65875649	colonel thorndykes secret   by g a henty     publishers introduction   colonel thorndykes secret is a story so far out of the ordinary that it will not be inappropriate to speak a few words regarding the tale and its unusually successful author mr george alfred henty  the plot of the story hinges upon the possession of a valuable bracelet of diamonds stolen from a hindoo idol by a british soldier in india this bracelet falls into the possession of colonel thorndyke who shortly afterward is sent home to england because of his wounds the secret concerning the bracelet is told to the colonels brother a country squire and the treasure is left to younger members of the thorndyke family  as is well known today the theft of anything from a hindoo temple is considered an extraordinary crime in india and when this occurs it becomes a religious duty for one or more persons to hunt down the thief and bring back the property taken from the heathen god  the members of the thorndyke family soon learn that they are being watched but this is at a time when highwaymen are numerous in this part of england and they cannot determine whether the work is that of the knights of the roads or that of the lascars after the famous bracelet a mysterious death follows and the younger members of the family are almost stunned not knowing what will happen next they would give the bracelet up but do not know where it is hidden the secret having been in the sole possession of the member now dead in this quandary the young hero of the tale rises to the occasion and determines to join the london police force and become a detective with the hope of ultimately clearing up the mystery thrilling adventures of a most unusual kind follow and at last something of the mystery is explained the bracelet and other jewelry are unearthed and it is decided to take the bracelet to amsterdam and offer it to the diamond cutters at that place but the carrying of the bracelet is both difficult and dangerous how the mission is brought to a conclusion and what part the lascars played in the final adventure will be found in the pages that follow  it can truthfully be said that mr henty is easily the most popular of all english story tellers his books for boys enjoying a circulation of from a hundred and fifty thousand to two hundred and fifty thousand per year his tales are all clean and although some are full of exciting situations and thrilling to the last degree they are of a high moral tone while the english employed is of the best  the present story is of peculiar value as giving a good insight into country and town life in england over a hundred years ago when railways and telegraph lines were unknown and when the knights of the road were apt to hold up any stagecoach that happened to come along it also gives a truthful picture of the dark and underhanded work accomplished at times by those of east indian blood especially when on what they consider a religious mission     chapter i   squire thorndyke of the manor house of crawley was on the 1st of september 1782 walking up and down the little terrace in front of the quaint old house in an unusually disturbed mood he was a man of forty three or four stoutly and strongly built and inclined to be portly save the loss of his wife four years before there had been but little to ruffle the easy tenor of his life a younger son he had at his mothers death when he was three and twenty come in for the small estate at crawley which had been her jointure  for ten years he had led a life resembling that of most of his neighbors he had hunted and shot been a regular attendant at any main of cocks that was fought within fifteen miles of crawley had occasionally been up to london for a week or two to see the gay doings there of an evening he had generally gone down to the inn where he talked over with two or three of his own condition and a few of the better class of farmers the news of the day the war with the french the troubles in scotland the alarming march of the young pretender and his defeat at cullodenwith no very keen interest in the result for the southern gentry and yeomen unlike those in the north had no strong leanings either way they had a dull dislike for hanoverian george but no great love for the exiled stuarts whose patron the king of france was an enemy of england  more often however their thoughts turned upon local topicsthe holding up of the coach of sir james harris or squire hamilton by highwaymen the affray between the french smugglers and the revenue men near selsea bill or shoreham the delinquencies of the poaching gangs the heaviness of the taxes and the price of corn  at the age of thirtythree squire thorndyke married the daughter of a neighboring landowner a son was born and three years later mrs thorndyke died since then the squire had led a more retired life he still went down to smoke his pipe at the inn parlor but he gave up his visits to town and cock fights and even bull baiting were no longer attractions to him he was known as a good landlord to the three or four farmers who held land under him was respected and liked in the village where he was always ready to assist in cases of real distress was of an easygoing disposition and on good terms with all his neighbors  but today he was unusually disturbed in his mind a messenger had ridden up two hours before with a letter from london it was as follows  my dear brother john  you will be surprised indeed at this letter from me who doubtless you suppose to be fighting in india i have done with fighting and am nearly done with life i was shot in the battle of buxar eighteen months ago for a time the surgeons thought that it was going to be fatal then i rallied and for some months it seemed that in spite of the ball that they were never able to find i was going to get over it and should be fit for service again then i got worse first it was a cough then the blood used to come up and they said that the only chance for me was to come home i did not believe it would be of any use but i thought that i would rather die at home than in india so home i came and have now been a week in london  i thought at first of going down to my place at reigate and having you and your boy there with me but as i have certainly not many weeks perhaps not many days to live i thought i would come down to you so the day after you receive this letter i shall be with you i shall not bring my little girl down i have left her in good hands and i shall only bring with me my hindoo servant he will give you no troublea mat to sleep on and a little rice to eat will satisfy his wants and he will take the trouble of me a good deal off your hands he was a sepoy in my regiment and has always evinced the greatest devotion for me more than once in battle he has saved my life and has for the last three years been my servant and has nursed me since i have been ill as tenderly as a woman could have done as i shall have time to tell you everything when i arrive i will say no more now  the news had much affected john thorndyke his brother george was five years his senior and had gone out as a cadet in the companys service when john was but thirteen and this was his first home coming had it not been for a portrait that had been taken of him in his uniform just before he sailed john would have had but little remembrance of him in that he was represented as a thin spare youth with an expression of quiet determination in his face from his father john had of course heard much about him  nothing would satisfy him but to go out to india john there was of course no occasion for it as he would have this place after mea fine estate and a good position what could he want more but he was a curious fellow once he formed an opinion there was no persuading him to change it he was always getting ideas such as no one else would think of he did not care for anything that other people cared for never hunted nor shot he used to puzzle me altogether with his ways and pon my word i was not sorry when he said he would go to india for there was no saying how he might have turned out if he had stopped here he never could do anything like anybody else nothing that he could have done would have surprised me  if he had told me that he intended to be a play actor or a jockey or a private or a book writer i should not have been surprised upon my word it was rather a relief to me when he said i have made up my mind to go into the east india service father i suppose you can get me a cadetship at least that was an honorable profession and i knew anyhow that when he once said i have made up my mind father no arguments would move him and that if i did not get him a cadetship he was perfectly capable of running away going up to london and enlisting in one of their white regiments  john thorndykes own remembrances were that his brother had always been good natured to him that he had often told him long stories about indian adventures and that a short time before he went away having heard that he had been unmercifully beaten by the schoolmaster at reigate for some trifling fault he had gone down to the town and had so battered the man that the school had to be closed for a fortnight they had always kept up a correspondence when he received the news of his fathers death george had written to him begging him to go down to reigate and to manage the estate for him  of course he said you will draw its income as long as you are there i maynt be back for another twenty years one gets rich out here fast what with plunder and presents and one thing and another and it is no use to have money accumulating at home so just live on the place as if it were your own until i come home to turn you out  john had declined the offer  i am very well where i am he wrote and the care of the estate would be a horrible worry to me besides i have just married and if i ever have any children they would be brought up beyond their station i have done what i can for you i have seen the family lawyers who have engaged a man who has been steward to sir john hieover and looked after the estate during his sons minority but the young blade on coming of age set to work to make ducks and drakes of the property and newman could not bear to see the estate going to the jews so as luck would have it he resigned a month ago and has been appointed steward at reigate of course if you dont like the arrangement you must write and say so it will be a year before i get your answer and he has only been engaged for certain for that time it must lie with you as to permanent arrangement  so newman had taken charge of the reigate estate and had continued to manage it ever since although george had written home in great displeasure at his offer being refused  inside the manor the bustle of preparations was going on the spare room which had not been used for many years was being turned out and a great fire lighted to air it john thorndyke had sent a letter by the returning messenger to a friend in town begging him to go at once to leadenhall street and send down a supply of indian condiments for his brothers use and had then betaken himself to the garden to think the matter over the next day a post chaise arrived bringing the invalid and his colored servant whose complexion and indian garb struck the maids with an awe not unmingled with alarm john thorndyke could hardly believe that the bent and emaciated figure was that of his brother but he remembered the voice when the latter said holding out his hand to him  well brother john here i am what is left of me gracious man who would have thought that you were going to grow up such a fine tall fellow you are more fitted to be a soldier than i am no dont try to help me out ramoo will do thathe is accustomed to my ways and i would as soon trust myself to a rogue elephant as to you  i am sorry to see you looking so bad brother george  what must be must i have had my fling and after thirty years of marching and fighting i have no right to grumble if i am laid upon my back at last  leaning on ramoos arm colonel thorndyke made his way into the house and when the hindoo had arranged the cushions of the sofa took his place there in a half reclining position  i am not always as bad as this john he said the jolting of your confounded roads has been too much for me if i were the king i would hang every fellow who had anything to do with themcontractors boards of county magistrates and the whole lot if i had known what it was going to be like i would have hired a sedan chair and had myself carried down that is what i have been doing in london but i would rather have had an indian palkee that one could have lain down comfortably in  what shall i get you first george i have got some lemons  i want something better than lemons john have you any burgundy handy  yes plenty  if you give a bottle to ramoo he will know how much water i want  here the servants entered with a tray with a chicken and a dish of kidneys  i sent up yesterday for some of the indian things that you are accustomed to george but they have not come down yet  i brought a store down with me this will do capitally for the present ramoo will do the cooking for me in future he need not go into the kitchen to scare the maids i could see they looked at him as if he had been his infernal majesty as he came in he can do it anywhere all he wants is an iron pot with some holes in it and some charcoal he can squat out there on the veranda or if it is bad weather any shed will do for him  well it is nice to be home again john he went on after he had eaten a few mouthfuls of chicken and drunk a tumbler of burgundy and water i am glad to be back now i am here though i dare say i should not have come home for another ten years if it had not been for this rascally bullet where is your boy  he is away at school  well i think i will go up to bed at once if you dont mind john i shall be fitter to talk in the morning  the next day indeed colonel thorndyke was materially better his voice was stronger and more cheery and when he came down after breakfast he took his seat in an easy chair instead of on the sofa  now brother he said we will have a cozy chat there are several things i want done but the chief of these is that when i am gone you should go down to reigate as i wanted you to do ten years ago i want you to seem to be its master as well as be its master until millicent comes of age if not longer her name is millicent conyers thorndyke i wish her to be called millicent conyers and to appear as your ward and not as your niece and heiress of the property if there is one thing in the world i have a greater horror of than another it is of a girl being married for her money i dont suppose that anyone knows that i have a daughterat any rate none beyond a few indian chums she was sent home with an ayah under the charge of the widow of a comrade of mine i had been away for months and only went back to calcutta in time to see her mother die so that is all right  i could not do such a thing as that george i should be living under false colors it is not that i mind so much leaving here and looking after the childs interest at reigate but i could not possibly take possession of the place as its owner when i should not be so besides there are other objections mark would grow up supposing himself to be the heir  mark will be all right i have since i have been in london signed a will leaving the rest of my fortune between them i had it drawn up by our fathers solicitors relying upon your consent to do what i asked you i have explained the matter to them and given them the assignment or whatever they call it of the reigate estate to you until my daughter comes of age appointing them her guardians should you die before that thus you will be placed in a proper position and should it be known by any means that the child is my daughter that deed will still be a proof that you are carrying out my wishes and are absolute master of the estate until she comes of age  i must think it all over george it is a singular proposal and i own i would rather things went on in their regular course  yes yes i understand that john but you see i have altogether set my mind on this matter i want to know that my girl is not going to be married for her money and at any rate that deed makes you master of the reigate estates for the next thirteen years so the only thing that i really want of you is to let the girl be called your ward instead of your niece and that she and everyone else shall be in ignorance that she is an heiress so far from doing the girl a wrong you will be doing her a benefit and as i have explained the whole matter to our lawyers no one can possibly think that the thing has been done from any motive whatever except that of affording me satisfaction  i will think the matter over john repeated of course brother it has been in your mind for some time but it comes altogether fresh to me and i must look at it in every light for myself i have no wish at all to become master of our fathers estate i have been going in one groove for the last twenty years and dont care about changing it you wished me to do so ten years ago and i declined then and the ten years have not made me more desirous of change than i was before  all right think it over please send ramoo in to me i have tired myself in talking  john thorndyke smoked many churchwarden pipes in the little arbor in his garden that day in the afternoon his brother was so weak and tired that the subject of the conversation was not reverted to at eight oclock the colonel went off to bed the next morning after breakfast he was brighter again  well john what has come of your thinking he asked  i dont like it george  you maynt like it john but you will do it i am not going to have my girl run after by ruined spendthrifts who want her money to repair their fortunes and i tell you frankly if you refuse i shall go up to town tomorrow and i shall make a new will leaving all my property to your son subject to a life annuity of 200 pounds a year to the child and ordering that in the event of his dying before he comes of age or of refusing to accept the provisions of the will or handing any of the property or money over to my daughter the whole estate money jewels and all shall go to the london hospitals subject as before to the annuity  dont be an ass brother john do you think that i dont know what i am doing i have seen enough of the evils of marrying for money out in india every ship that comes out brings so many girls sent out to some relation to be put on the marriage market and marrying men old enough to be pretty nearly their grandfathers with the natural consequence that there is the devil to pay before they have been married a year or two come you know you will do it why not give in at once and have done with it it is not a bad thing for you it will be a good thing for your boy it will save my girl from fortune hunters and enable me to die quietly and comfortably  all right george i will do it mind i dont do it willingly but i do it for your sake  that is right colonel thorndyke said holding out his thin bronzed hand to his brother that is off my mind now there is only one other thingthose confounded jewels but i wont talk about them now  it was not indeed till three or four days later that the colonel again spoke to his brother on any than ordinary matters he had indeed been very weak and ailing after breakfast when as usual he was a little stronger and brighter than later in the day he said to his brother suddenly  i suppose there are no hiding places in this room  hiding places what do you mean george  places where a fellow could hide up and hear what we are talking about  no i dont think so the squire replied looking round vaguely such an idea never occurred to me why do you ask  because john if there is such a thing as a hiding place someone will be sure to be hiding there where does that door lead to  it doesnt lead anywhere it used to lead into the next room but it was closed up before my time and turned into a cupboard and this door is permanently closed  do you mind stepping round into the next room and seeing if anyone is in the cupboard  thinking that his brother was a little light headed john thorndyke went into the next room and returned saying gravely that no one was there  will you look behind the curtains john and under this sofa and everywhere else where even a cat could be hidden that seems all right the colonel went on as his brother continued the search you know there is a saying that walls have ears and i am not sure that it is not so i have been haunted with the feeling that everything i did was watched and that everything i said was listened to for years and i can tell you it is a devilishly unpleasant thought draw your chair quite close to me it is about my jewels john i always had a fancy for jewelsnot to wear them but to own them in my time i have had good opportunities in that way both in the madras presidency and in the carnatic in the first place i have never cared for taking presents in money but i have never refused jewels and what with rajahs and nabobs and ministers that one had helped or done a good turn to somehow a good deal came to me that way  then i always made a point of carrying money with me and after a defeat of the enemy or a successful siege there was always lots of loot and the soldiers were glad enough to sell anything in the way of jewels for a tithe of their value in gold i should say if i put the value of the jewels at 50000 pounds i am not much wide of the mark that is all right there is no bother about them the trouble came from a diamond bracelet that i got from a soldier we were in camp near tanjore i was officer of the day i had made my rounds and was coming back to my quarters when i saw a soldier coming out of a tent thirty or forty yards away it was a moonlight night and the tent was one belonging to a white madras regiment suddenly i saw another figure that had been lying down outside the tent rise i saw the flash of the moonlight on steel then there was a blow and the soldier fell i drew my sword and rushed forward  the nativefor i could see that it was a nativewas bending over the man he had stabbed his back was towards me and on the sandy soil he did not hear my footsteps until i was close to him then he sprang up with a cry of fury and leaped on me like a tiger i was so taken by surprise that before i could use my sword the fellow had given me a nasty stab on the shoulder but before he could strike again i had run him through by this time several other men ran out of the tent uttering exclamations of rage at seeing their fallen comrade  what is it sir they asked me  this scoundrel here has stabbed your comrade i said he did not see me coming and i ran up just as he was i think rifling him for booty he came at me like a wild cat and has given me a nasty stab however i have put an end to his game is your comrade dead  no sir he is breathing still but i fancy there is little chance for him  you had better carry him to the hospital tent at once i will send a surgeon there  i called the regimental surgeon up and went with him to the hospital tent telling him what had happened he shook his head after examining the mans wound which was fairly between the shoulders  he may live a few hours but there is no chance of his getting better  now i said you may as well have a look at my wound for the villain stabbed me too  you have had a pretty narrow escape of it he said as he examined it if he had struck an inch or two nearer the shoulder the knife would have gone right into you but you see i expect he was springing as he struck and the blow fell nearly perpendicularly and it glanced down over your ribs and made a gash six inches long there is no danger i will bandage it now and tomorrow morning i will sew the edges together and make a proper job of it  in the morning one of the hospital attendants came to me and said the soldier who had been wounded wanted to speak to me the doctor said he would not live long i went across to him he was on a bed some little distance from any of the others for it was the healthy season and there were only three or four others in the tent  i hear major thorndyke he said in a low voice that you killed that fellow who gave me this wound and that you yourself were stabbed  mine is not a serious business my man i said i wish you had got off as easily  i have been expecting it sir he said and how i came to be fool enough to go outside the tent by myself i cannot think i was uneasy and could not sleep i felt hot and feverish and came out for a breath of fresh air i will tell you what caused it sir about two years ago a cousin of mine in one of the kings regiments who was dying they said of fever but i know the doctors thought he had been poisoned said to me here are some things that will make your fortune if ever you get to england but i tell you beforehand they are dangerous things to keep about you i fancy that they have something to do with my being like this now a year ago i went with some others into one of their great temples on a feast day well the god had got on all his trinkets and among them was a bracelet with the biggest diamonds i ever saw i did not think so much of it at the time but i kept on thinking of them afterwards and it happened that some months after our visit we took the place by storm i made straight for the temple and i got the jewels it dont matter how i got themi got them well since that i have never had any peace pretty near every night one or other of our tents was turned topsy turvy all the kits turned out and even the ground dug up with knives you know how silently indian thieves can work however nothing was ever stolen and as for the diamonds at the end of every days march i always went out as soon as it was quite dark and buried the bracelet between the tent pegs it did not take a minute to do when we moved of course i took it up again at last i gave that up for however early i turned out in the morning there was sure to be a native about i took then to dropping it down the barrel of my gun that way i beat them still i have always somehow felt myself watched and my tent has been disturbed a great deal oftener than any of the others i have had half a mind to throw the things away many a time but i could not bring myself to do it  well sir i have carried the bracelet ever since i have done as he did and always had it in my musket barrelwhen we had fighting to do i would drop it out into my hand and slip it into my ammunition pouch but i know that i have always been followed just as bill was i suppose they found out that i went to see him before he died anyhow my tent has been rummaged again and again i have no doubt that fellow whom you killed last night had been watching me all the time and thought that i had come out to hide the things however there they are sir one of my mates brought my musket here a quarter of an hour ago and emptied the barrel out for me now sir you did your best to save my life last night and you killed that fellow who did for me and you pretty nearly got killed yourself i have got no one else i could give the things to and if i were to give them to one of my mates in the regiment they would probably cost him his life as they have cost me mine but you will know what to do with the things they are worth a lot of money if you can get them home mind sir you have got to be careful i have heard tales of how those priests will follow up a temple jewel that has been lost for years and never give it up until they get it back again  i ought to give it up i said  you dont know where it came from sir he replied i was one of a party of convalescents who were sent up just before that fight and my own regiment was not there it might have been here and it might have been in the carnatic bill never told me and i have no more idea than a babe unborn  the gems were certainly magnificent and though i knew well enough that these untiring brahmins would not be long in guessing that the things had come into my possession i took the bracelet i thought anyhow that i might have a few hours start the fellow i had killed might of course have one or two others with him but i had to risk that i got leave an hour later and went down to madras and got them put into a place of safety that i was watched all the time i was in india afterwards i have no doubt but no attempts were made to assassinate me they would have known that i went straight away but whether i had buried them somewhere on the road or had given them to someones care at madras they could not know and there was therefore nothing for them to do but to wait till i made a move  i have no doubt whatever that they came over in the same ship with me two or three times during the week i was in london i saw colored men in the street outside the hotel once it was a lascar seaman another time a dark looking sailor in european clothes he might pass for a spaniard several times as i was going about in a sedan chair i looked out suddenly and each time there was a dark face somewhere in the street behind i had a letter this morning from the lawyer and he mentioned that two days ago his offices had been broken into and every strong box and drawer forced open but that curiously enough they could not find that anything had been stolen though in the cashiers box there were 30 pounds in gold of course it was my friends i have no doubt that one or two of them have followed me down here and for anything i know they may be lurking somewhere in your garden at the present momentthat is if they are not standing beside us in this room  john thorndyke looked round with an uncomfortable feeling  how do you mean george  i mean some of those indian fellows can do all sorts of wonderful conjuring tricks i have seen them go up into the air on a rope and never come down again and for aught i know they may be able to render themselves invisible seriously i think that it is likely as not  well and where are the things to be found now george  that i wont tell you john before i go i will whisper it in your ear and give you the means of finding them but not till then no i will write it down on a piece of paper and slip it into your hand as soon as you get out of the room you glance at it and then put the piece of paper into your mouth chew it up and swallow it i tell you i dare not even whisper it but whatever you do take no steps in the matter until your son comes of age  there can surely be no danger in another twelve years george they will have given up the search long before that   not they the colonel said emphatically if they die others will take their places it is a sacred business with them my advice to you is either sell them directly you get them into your hands or go straight to amsterdam and sell them there to one of the diamond cutters who will turn them out so that they will be altered beyond all recognition dont sell more than two stones at most to any one man then they will never come out as a bracelet again and the hunt will be over   i would almost rather leave them alone altogether george  well they are worth 50000 pounds if they are worth a penny and a great deal more i should say but you cannot leave them alone without leaving everything alone for all my gems are with them and 52000 pounds in gold of course if you like you can when you get the box pick those diamonds out and chuck them away but if you do you must do it openly so that anyone watching you may see you do it otherwise the search will go on  two days later as ramoo was helping the colonel to the sofa the latter was seized with a violent fit of coughing then a rush of blood poured from his lips his brother and ramoo laid him on the sofa almost insensible  run and get some water ramoo john thorndyke said  as ramoo left the room the colonel feebly placed his snuffbox in his brothers hand with a significant glance then he made several desperate efforts to speak and tried to struggle up into a sitting position another gush of blood poured from him and as it ceased he fell back dead  john thorndyke was bitterly grieved at the death of his brother and it was not until he went up to his room that night that he thought of the snuffbox that he had dropped into his pocket as his brother handed it to him he had no doubt that it contained the instructions as to the treasure it was of indian manufacture he emptied the snuff from it but it contained nothing else he was convinced that the secret must be hidden there and after in vain endeavoring to find a spring he took a poker and hammered it and as it bent a spring gave way and showed a very shallow false bottom  in this was a thin gold coin evidently of considerable antiquity and a small piece of paper on which was written the word masulipatam john thorndyke looked at it in bewilderment that it was connected with the secret he felt certain but alone it was absolutely useless doubtless his brother had intended to give him the key of the riddle when he had so desperately striven to speak after in vain thinking the matter over he said  well thank goodness there is nothing to be done about the matter for another thirteen or fourteen years it is of no use worrying about it now he went to an old fashioned cabinet and placed the coin and piece of paper in a very cunningly devised secret drawer the next morning he went out into the garden and dropped the battered snuffbox into the well and then dismissed the subject from his mind     chapter ii   standing some two miles out of reigate is the village of crowswood a quiet place and fairly well to do thanks in no small degree to squire thorndyke who owned the whole of the parish and by whom and his tenants the greater portion of the village were employed greatly had the closing of the manor house after the death of old squire thorndyke been felt there were no more jellies soups and other comforts to be looked for in time of sickness no abatement of rent when the breadwinner was sick or disabled no check to the drunkards whom the knowledge that they would be turned out of their cottage at a weeks notice kept in some sort of order when therefore after ten years of absence of all government john thorndyke after the death of his brother the colonel came down and took possession he found the place sadly changed from what it had been when he had left it twenty years before his first act was to dismiss newman who completely unchecked had he found been sadly mismanaging affairs it was not long however before his hand made itself felt two out of the three public houses were shut up in six months a score of their habitual frequenters had weeks before been turned out of their houses an order had been issued that unless a cottage was kept in good order and the garden bright and blooming with flowers in the summer a fresh tenant would be found for it every child must be sent to the village school the squire was ready to do what there was to be done in the way of thatching and whitewashing repairing palings and painting doors and windows but as he told the people the village had to be kept clean and decent and anyone who would not conform to the rules was at liberty to leave without a days notice  many of the villagers grumbled under their breath but public opinion was on the whole favorable there was someone to look after them now someone who would see that the greater portion of the wages was not spent at the alehouse who would take an interest in the people and would lend a helping hand in bad times there was a feeling of regret that the squire was a widower but the post of visitor and almoner was well supplied by the lady who acted as companion and governess to the squires little ward and regulated the affairs of his household  john thorndyke had never had much occasion for the display of energy before but he had an abundance of it although hitherto latent he had come into this business against his will but he took it up with a determination to do well in it the income was legally his until his niece came of age but he was determined he would take nothing out of the estate beyond the necessary expenses of the position and that all surplus should be expended in improving it in every way possible so that he could hand it over to her in the most perfect condition therefore when he came into possession he made a close inspection of the farms with their houses barns and other tenements where he saw that the men were doing their best that the hedges and fields were in good order he did everything that was necessary without a word but where there were slovenly farming and signs of neglect and carelessness he spoke out his mind sharply  this has all got to be amended he said what must be done i will do but unless i see things well kept up the fences in good order the hedges cut the cattle in good condition and everything going on as it ought to be out you go next christmas the estate at present is a disgrace to the county but it shall not be so any longer if i can help it i shall do my share and anyone who is not prepared to do the same had better look out for another holding at once  no one rejoiced more at the coming home of the squire than mr bastow the rector he had had a pleasant time of it during the life of the old squire he was always a welcome guest at the house mr thorndyke had been ever ready to put his hand into his pocket for any repairs needed for the church and bore on his shoulders almost the entire expense of the village school in the latter respect there had been no falling off he having given explicit instructions to his solicitors to pay his usual annual subscriptions to the school until his sons return from india but with the death of the squire the rector had gradually lost all authority in the village  for a time force of habit had had its effect but as this wore out and the people recognized that he had no real authority things went from bad to worse drunken men would shout jeeringly as they passed the rectory on their way home from the alehouse women no longer feared reproof for the untidiness of their houses and children the school was half emptied and the church almost wholly so  for seven or eight years mr bastow had a hard time of it it was then both with pleasure as an old friend and with renewed hopefulness for the village that he visited john thorndyke on his return the change in the state of affairs was almost instantaneous as soon as it became known that the rector was backed heart and soul by the squires authority and that a complaint from him was followed the next day by a notice to quit at the end of a week his own authority was established as firmly as it had been in the old squires time and in a couple of years crowswood became quite a model village every garden blossomed with flowers roses and eglantine clustered over the cottages neatness and order prevailed everywhere  the children were tidily dressed and respectful in manner the women bright and cheerful and the solitary alehouse remaining had but few customers and those few were never allowed to transgress the bounds of moderation the squire had a talk with the landlord a fortnight after his arrival  i am not going to turn you out peters he said i hear that you make some efforts to keep your house decently the other two i shall send packing directly their terms are up whether you remain permanently must depend upon yourself i will do up your house for you and build a bar parlor alongside where quiet men can sit and smoke their pipes and talk and take their beer in comfort and have liberty to enjoy themselves as long as their enjoyment does not cause annoyance to other people or keep their wives and children in rags i will do anything for you if i find the place well conducted but i warn you that i will have no drunkenness a man who to my knowledge gets drunk twice will not get drunk a third time in this parish and if you let men get drunk here it is your fault as much as theirs now we understand each other  things once placed on a satisfactory footing the squire had but little more trouble and it soon came to be understood that he was not to be trifled with and that crowswood was no longer a place for the idle or shiftless two or three of the farmers left at the termination of their year but better men took their places and john thorndyke having settled matters to his satisfaction now began to attend more to other affairs he had been when he first came back welcomed with great heartiness by all the gentry of the neighborhood his father had been a popular man and young thorndyke had been regarded as a pleasant young fellow and would in any case have been welcomed if only because crowswood had become a nuisance to the whole district it was indeed a sort of rendezvous for poachers and bad characters it was more than suspected that gangs of thieves and burglars made it their headquarters and that even highwaymen found it a convenient and quiet resort  thus then the transformation effected within a few months of mr thorndykes return caused general and lively satisfaction and a year later he was put on the commission of the peace and became one of the most regular attendants at the bench of magistrates reluctantly as he had taken up his present position he found it as time went on a pleasant one he had not been conscious before that time hung somewhat heavily on his hands but here he had duties to perform and ample employment his nature was naturally somewhat a masterful one and both as a magistrate and a landlord he had scope and power of action occasionally he went up to london always driving his gig with a pair of fast trotting horses and was known to the frequenters of the coffee houses chiefly patronized by country gentlemen altogether john thorndyke became quite a notable person in the district and men were inclined to congratulate themselves upon the fact that he and not the indian officer his brother had come into the estate  the idea of an old indian officer in those days was that he was almost of necessity an invalid and an irritable one with a liver hopelessly deranged a yellow complexion and a hatred of the english climate the fact that instead of leaving the army and coming home at his fathers death george thorndyke had chosen to remain abroad and leave the estate to the management of agents had specially prejudiced him in the eyes of the people of that part and had heightened the warmth with which they had received his brother john thorndyke had upon the occasion of his first visit to the family solicitors spoken his mind with much freedom as to the manner in which newman had been allowed a free hand  another ten years he said and there would not have been a cottage habitable on the estate nor a farm worth cultivating he did absolutely nothing beyond collecting the rents he let the whole place go to rack and ruin the first day i arrived i sent him out of the house with a talking to that he wont forget as long as he lives  we never heard any complaints about him mr thorndyke except that i think we did once hear from the rector of the place that his conduct was not satisfactory i remember that we wrote to him about it and he said that the rector was a malignant fellow on bad terms with all his parishioners  if i had the scoundrel here john thorndyke said with indignation i would let him have a taste of the lash of my dog whip you should not have taken the fellows word you should have sent down someone to find out the true state of things why the place has been an eyesore to the whole neighborhood the resort of poaching thieving rascals by gad if my brother george had gone down there i dont know what would have happened it will cost a couple of years rent to get things put straight  when the squire was at home there was scarce an evening when the rector did not come up to smoke a pipe and take his glass of old jamaica or hollands with him  look here bastow the latter said some three years after his return what are you going to do with that boy of yours i hear bad reports of him from everyone he gets into broils at the alehouse and i hear that he consorts with a bad lot of fellows down at reigate one of my tenantsi wont mention namescomplained to me that he had persecuted his daughter with his attentions they say he was recognized among that poaching gang that had an affray with sir james hartrops keepers the thing is becoming a gross scandal  i dont know what to do about him squire the boy has always been a trouble to me you see before you came home he got into bad hands in the village here of course they have all gone but several of them only moved as far as reigate and he kept up their acquaintance i thrashed him again and again but he has got beyond that now you see he is nearly eighteen and openly scoffs at my authority upon my word i dont know what to do in the matter  he is growing up a thorough young ruffian the squire said indignantly and one of these mornings i expect to see him brought up before us charged with some serious offense we had to fine him last week for being drunk and making a disturbance down at reigate why do you let him have money you may have no authority over him but at least you should refuse to open your purse to him dont you see that this sort of thing is not only a disgrace to him but very prejudicial to the village what authority can you have for speaking against vice and drunkenness when your son is constantly intoxicated  i see that squirenone better and i have thought of resigning my cure  stuff and nonsense parson if the young fellow persists in his present course he must leave the village that is clear enough but that is no reason why you should the question is what is to be done with him the best thing he could do would be to enlist he might be of some service to his country in india or the american colonies but so far as i can see he is only qualifying himself for a jail here  i have told him as much squire mr bastow said in a depressed voice and he has simply laughed in my face and said that he was very comfortable where he was and had no idea whatever of moving  what time does he go out in the morning john thorndyke asked abruptly  he never gets up till twelve oclock and has his breakfast when i take my dinner  well i will come in tomorrow morning and have a talk with him myself  the next day the squire rode up to the door of the rectory soon after one oclock mr bastow had just finished his meal his son a young fellow of between seventeen and eighteen was lolling in an easy chair  i have come in principally to speak to you young sir john thorndyke said quietly i have been asking your father what you intend to do with yourself he says he does not know  the young fellow looked up with an air of insolent effrontery  i dont know that it is any business of yours mr thorndyke what i do with myself  oh yes it is the squire replied this village and the people in it are mine you are disturbing the village with your blackguard conduct you are annoying some of the girls on the estate and altogether you are making yourself a nuisance i stopped at the alehouse as i came here and have ordered the landlord to draw no more liquor for you and unless you amend your conduct and that quickly i will have you out of the village altogether  i fancy mr thorndyke that even as a justice of the peace you have not the power to dictate to my father who shall be the occupant of this house  what you say is perfectly true but as you make your fathers life a burden to him and he is desirous of your absence i can and will order the village constable to remove you from his house by force if necessary  the young fellow cast an evil glance at his father he has not been complaining has he he said with a sneer  he has not sir john thorndyke said indignantly it is i who have been complaining to him and he admits that you are altogether beyond his authority i have pointed out to him that he is in no way obliged to support you at your age in idleness and dissipation and that it were best for him and all concerned that he should close his doors to you i dont want to have to send the son of my old friend to prison but i can see well enough that that is what it will come to if you dont give up your evil courses i should think you know by this time that i am a man of my word i have taken some pains to purge this village of all bad characters and i do not intend to have an exception made of the son of the clergyman who in his family as well as in his own person is bound to set an example  well mr thorndyke i utterly decline to obey your orders or to be guided by your advice  very well sir the magistrate said sternly mr bastow do i understand that you desire that your son shall no longer remain an inmate of your house  i do the clergyman said firmly and if he does so i have no other course before me but to resign my living my position here has become absolutely unbearable  very well sir then you will please lock your doors tonight and if he attempts to enter i as a magistrate should know how to deal with him now young sir you understand your position you may not take my advice nevertheless i shall give it you the best thing you can do is to take your place for town on the outside of the coach that comes through reigate this afternoon and tomorrow morning proceed either to the recruiting officer for his majestys service or to that for the east india companys you have health and strength you will get rid at once of your bad associates and will start afresh in a life in which you may redeem your past and be useful to your king and country  young bastow smiled  thanks he said sarcastically i have my own plans and shall follow them  i would think mr bastow the squire said quietly it would just be as well for you to come home with me i dont think that the leave taking is likely to be an affectionate one  the rector rose at once  i will come with you squire i may tell you now what i have not told you before that my son has more than once raised his hand against me and that i do not care to be left alone with him  i judged him capable even of that mr bastow  goodby arthur his father said my heart is ready to break that it has come to this but for both our sakes it is better so goodby my son and may heaven lead you to better ways if ever you come to me and say father i have turned over a new leaf and heartily repent the trouble i have caused you you will receive a hearty welcome from me and no words of reproach for the past  the young man paid no attention to the offered hand but laughed scornfully  you have not got rid of me yet he said as for you squire thorndyke i shall not forget your meddlesome interference and some day maybe you will be sorry for it  i think not john thorndyke said gravely i am doing my duty to the village and still more i am doing my duty to an old friend and i am not likely ever to feel any regret that i have so acted now parson lets be off  after leaving the house with the clergyman the squire stopped at the house of knapp the village constable and said a few words to him then leading his horse walked home with mr bastow  dont be cast down old friend he said it is a terrible trial to you but it is one sharp wrench and then it will be over anything is better than what you must have been suffering for some time  i quite feel that squire my life has indeed been intolerable of late i had a painful time before but always looked forward with hope to your brother coming home since you returned and matters in the parish have been put straight this trouble has come in to take the place of the other and i have felt that i would rather resign and beg for charity than see my son going from bad to worse a scandal to the parish and a hindrance to all good work  it is a bad business bastow and it seems to me that two or three years in prison would be the best thing for him as he will not take up the only trade open to him at any rate it would separate him from his evil associates and give you peace while he is behind the bars where does he get his money  that i know not squire he takes some from meit used to be done secretly now it is done with threats and as i told you with violencebut that would not account for his always having money he must get it somewhere else for when i have paid my bills as i always do the hour that i receive money there is but little over for him to take he is often away all night sometimes for two or three days together and i dare not think what he does with himself but certainly he gets money somehow and i am afraid that i cannot hope it is honestly obtained  i do not well see how it can be the squire agreed  if i had before known as much as you tell me now i would have taken some steps to have him watched and to nip the matter before it went too far do you think that he will take your notice and come no more to the house  mr bastow shook his head  i fear that the only effect will be to make him worse even when he was quite a small boy punishment only had that effect with him he will come back tonight probably half drunk and certainly furious at my having ventured to lay the case before you  you must lock the doors and bar the windows  i did that when he first took to being out at night but he always managed to get in somehow  well it must be all put a stop to bastow and i will come back with you this evening and if this young rascal breaks into the house i will have him down at reigate tomorrow on the charge of house breaking or at any rate i will threaten to do so if he does not give a promise that he will in future keep away from you altogether  i shall be glad at any rate if you will come down squire for to say the truth i feel uneasy as to the steps he may take in his fury at our conversation just now  john thorndyke took down from a wall a heavy hunting whip as he went out with the parson at nine oclock he had in vain endeavored to cheer his old friend as they sat over their steaming glasses of jamaica the parson had never been a strong man he was of a kindly disposition and an unwearied worker when there was an opportunity for work but he had always shrunk from unpleasantness and was ready to yield rather than bring about trouble he had for a long time suffered in silence and had not the squire himself approached the subject of his sons delinquencies he would have never opened his mouth about it now however that he had done so and the squire had taken the matter in hand and had laid down what was to be done though he trembled at the prospect he did not even think of opposing his plan and indeed could think of no alternative for it  i have told john knapp to be here the squire said as they reached the house it is just as well that he should be present if your son comes back again he is a quiet trustworthy fellow and will keep his mouth shut if i tell him  mr bastow made no reply it was terrible to him that there should be another witness to his sons conduct but he saw that the squire was right an old woman opened the door  are all the shutters closed and barred john thorndyke asked her  yes sir i always sees to that as soon as it gets dark  very well you can go to bed now elisa her master said is john knapp here  yes he came an hour ago and is sitting in the kitchen  i will call him in myself when i want to speak to him  as soon as the old servant had gone upstairs the squire went into the kitchen mr bastow having gone to the cellar to fetch up a bottle of old brandy that was part of a two dozen case given to him by the old squire fifteen years before  do you go round the house john and see that everything is properly fastened up i see that you have got a jug of beer there you had better get a couple of hours sleep on that settle i shall keep watch till i am sleepy and then i will call you let me know if you find any of the doors or windows unbarred  five minutes later the constable knocked at the door of the parlor the door opening into the stable yard was unbarred squire  i thought it likely that it would be so knapp you have made it fast now i suppose that is right now lie down and get an hour or two of sleep it is scarce likely that he will be back until late  that was the old woman of course he went on to his companion when the door closed behind the constable i thought it likely enough that he might tell her to leave a way for him to come in you told me that she had been with you a good many years i dare say she has left that door unbarred for him many a time i should advise you to get a man to sleep in the house regularly there are plenty of fellows who will be glad to do it for a shilling or two a week and i do not think that it is safe for you to be here alone  an hour later he said to the rector now bastow you had best go to bed i have taken the matter into my own hands and will carry it through however i wont have him taken away without your being present and will call you when we want you of course if he will give a solemn promise not to molest you and even if he wont enlist to leave this part of the country altogether i shall let him off  there is one thing mr thorndyke that i have not told you the rector said hesitatingly sometimes when he comes home late he brings someone with him i have heard voices downstairs i have never seen who it wasfor what could i have done if i went downbut i have heard horses brought round to the stable yard and heard them ride away  it is just as well you told me the squire said dryly if you had told me this evening at the house i would have dropped a brace of pistols into my pocket however this hunting crop is a good weapon but i dont suppose they will show fight even if anyone is with him besides knapp has a stout oaken cudgel with himi noticed it standing against his chair as i went inand as he is a strong active fellow and we shall have the advantage of a surprise i fancy we should be a match even for three or four of them  at one oclock the squire roused john knapp it is one oclock john now take off your boots i dont want him to know that there is anyone in the house till we get hold of him i am going to lie down on the sofa in the parlor the moment you hear footsteps you come and wake me  the clock in the kitchen had just struck two when the constable shook john thorndyke there are two horses just coming into the yard  all right i opened a window in the room looking down into the yard before i lay down i will go up and see what they are going to do if they try to break in anywhere down here do you come at once quietly up to me  the squire had taken off his boots before he lay down and holding his heavy hunting crop in his hand he went quietly upstairs as he went to the window he heard arthur bastow say angrily  confound the old woman she has locked the door she has never played me that trick before there is a ladder in the stable and i will get in at that window up there and open it for you or you may as well come up that way too and then you can stow the things away in my room at once and have done with it  the squire went hastily down  come upstairs knapp he whispered to the constable there are three of them and i fancy the two mounted men are highwaymen let them all get in keeping yourself well back from the window the moon is round on the other side of the house but it will be light enough for us to see them as they get in i will take the last fellow and i will warrant that he will give no trouble then i will fall upon the second and do you spring on young bastow the two highwaymen are sure to have pistols and he may have some also give him a clip with that cudgel of yours first then spring on him and hold his arms tightly by his side if i call you give him a back heel and throw him smartly and then come to my aid i dont think i shall want it but it is as well to prepare for everything  they went upstairs and took their places one on each side of the window standing three or four feet back just as they took up their positions the top of the stable ladder appeared above the sill of the window half a minute later young bastows head appeared and he threw up the sash still higher and stepped into the room then he turned and helped two men in one after the other  follow me he said then you wont tumble over the furniture  as they turned the heavy handle of johns thorndykes whip fell with tremendous force on the head of the last man  what the devil is that the other exclaimed snatching out a pistol and turning round as the falling body struck him but he got no further again the heavy whip descended this time on his right arm it dropped useless by his side and the pistol fell from his hand then john thorndyke fell upon him and bore him to the ground snatched the other pistol from his belt and held it to his head  now my man he said quietly if you dont surrender i will blow out your brains  i surrender the man moaned i believe that you have broken my arm curse you whoever you are  the struggle between john knapp and young bastow was soon over the young fellow was lithe and sinewy but he was no match for the constable who indeed had almost overpowered him before he was aware what had happened  has he got pistols knapp the squire asked  yes sir a brace of them i have got them both safely in my pocket there he went on as a sharp click was heard i have got the darbys on him now shall i help you sir  you had better run downstairs first and light a couple of candles at the kitchen fire you will find a pair standing on the parlor table dont be long about it the first fellow i hit was stunned and he may come round any moment  i will make sure of him before i go squire i have got another pair of darbys in my pocket  as soon as he had fastened these upon the wrists of the insensible man he ran downstairs and in a minute returned with the candles  i am glad that you are back the squire said i was afraid that young rascal would try to escape  i took good care of that squire you see i put one of his arms round the bedpost before i slipped the darbys on and he cannot get away unless he takes the whole bed with him and as i dont think he would get it out either by the window or the door he is as safe here as he would be in newgate what is the next thing to do squire  you had better tie this fellows legs i will leave you a candle here and you can keep guard over them while i go and wake mr bastow  the rector needed no waking he was walking up and down his room in great distress he had not undressed but had thrown himself upon his bed  what has happened thorndyke he asked as the squire entered i heard two heavy falls and i felt that something terrible had taken place  well it has been a serious mattervery serious that unfortunate son of yours is not hurt but i dont know but that the best thing that could have happened would have been for him to have got a bullet through his head he brought home with him two men who are i have little doubt highwaymen anyhow they each had a brace of pistols in their belt and from what he said i think they have been stopping a coach at any rate they have something with them that they were going to hide here and i fancy it is not the first time that it has been done i dont expect your son had anything to do with the robbery though he was carrying a brace of pistols too however we have got them all three  now you see bastow this takes the affair altogether out of our hands i had hoped that when we caught your son in the act of breaking into your house after you had ordered him from it we should be able to frighten him into enlisting or at any rate into promising to disturb you no more for even if we had taken him before the bench nothing could have been done to him for under such circumstances his reentering the house could not be looked upon as an act of burglary as it is the affair is altogether changed even if i wished to do so as a magistrate i could not release those two highwaymen they must appear as prisoners in court i shall hear down in the town tomorrow morning what coach has been stopped and i have no doubt that they have on them the proceeds of the robbery your son was consorting with and aiding them and acting as a receiver of stolen goods and as you have heard horses here before it is probable that when his room is thoroughly searched we shall come upon a number of articles of the same sort i am sorry that i ever meddled in the matter but it is too late for that now you had better come downstairs with me and we will take a turn in the garden and try to see what had best be done     chapter iii   john thorndyke opened the shutters of the parlor window and stepped out into the garden alone for the rector was too unnerved and shattered to go out with him but threw himself on the sofa completely prostrated half an hour later the squire reentered the room the morning was just beginning to break mr bastow raised his head and looked sadly at him  i can see no way out of it old friend were it not that he is in charge of the constable i should have said that your only course was to aid your son to escape but knapp is a shrewd fellow as well as an honest one you cannot possibly get your son away without his assistance for he is handcuffed to the bed and knapp in so serious a matter as this would not i am sure lend himself to an escape i have no doubt that with my influence with the other magistrates and indeed on the circumstances of the case they will commit him on a minor charge only as the passengers of the coach will i hope give evidence that it was stopped by mounted men alone i think therefore that he would only be charged with consorting with and aiding the highwaymen after the event and of aiding them to conceal stolen goodsthat is if any are found in his room  that much stolen property has been hidden there there is little reason to doubt but it may have been removed shortly afterwards it was of course very convenient for them to have some place where they could take things at once and then ride on quietly to london the next day for if arrested nothing would be found upon them and it would be impossible to connect them with the robbery later on they might come back again and get them from him of course if nothing is found in his room we get rid of the charge of receiving altogether and there would be nothing but harboring aiding and abettinga much less serious business look here old friend i will strain a point i will go out into the garden again and walk about for an hour and while i am out if you should take advantage of my absence to creep up to your sons room and to search it thoroughly examining every board of the floor to see if it is loose and should you find anything concealed to take it and hide it of course i cannot help it the things if there are any might secretly be packed up by you in a box and sent up to bow street with a line inside saying that they are proceeds of robbery and that you hope the owners will be traced and their property restored to them not of course in your own hand and without a signature there might be some little trouble in managing it but it could no doubt be done  john thorndyke went out into the garden without another word the hour was nearly up when mr bastow came out he looked ten years older than he had done on the previous day he wrung his friends hand  thank god i have been up there he said i do not think they will find anything  say nothing about it bastow i dont want to know whether you found anything now i am going to fetch two or three of the men from the village to get them to aid the constable in keeping guard and another to go up to the house at once and order a groom to saddle one of my horses and bring it here  as it was now past five oclock and the squire found most of the men getting up he sent one off to the house with the message and returned with two others to the rectory he told them briefly that two highwaymen had been arrested during the night and that as young mr bastow was in their company at the time it had been necessary as a matter of form to arrest him also he went upstairs with them  i have brought up two men to sit with you knapp until the reigate constables come up you can take those handcuffs off mr bastow but see that he does not leave the room and do you yourself sit in a chair against the door and place one of these men at the window how about others  the man you hit first squire did not move until a quarter of an hour ago he has been muttering to himself since but i dont think he is sensible the other one has been quiet enough but there is no doubt that his arm is broken  i am going to ride down to reigate at once and will bring back a surgeon with me  you will repent this nights business thorndyke arthur bastow said threateningly  i fancy that you will repent it more than i shall bastow it is likely that you will have plenty of time to do so  it was not long before the groom with the horse arrived john thorndyke rode at a gallop down to reigate and first called on the head constable  dawney he said as the man came down partially dressed at his summons has anything taken place during the night  yes squire the up coach was stopped a mile before it got here and the passengers robbed it was due here at one and did not come in till half an hour later of course i was sent for the guard was shot there were two of the fellows he let fly with his blunderbuss but he does not seem to have hit either of them and one rode up and shot him dead then they robbed all the passengers they got six gold watches some rings and adding up the amounts taken from all the passengers about a hundred and fifty pounds in money  well i fancy i have got your two highwaymen safe dawney  you have sir the constable said in astonishment  yes i happened to be at the rectory mr bastow had had a quarrel with his son and had forbidden him the house  the constable shook his head i am afraid he is a very bad one that young chap  i am afraid he is dawney however his father was afraid that he might come in during the night and make a scene so i said i would stop with him and i took our village constable with me at two oclock this morning the young fellow came with two mounted men who i have no doubt were highwaymen we had locked up down below bastow took a ladder and the three got in at a bedroom window on the first floor knapp and i were waiting for them there and taking them by surprise succeeded in capturing them before the highwaymen could use their pistols the constable and two men are looking after them but as one has not got over a knock i gave him on the head and the other has a broken arm there is little fear of their making their escape you had better go up with two of your men and take a light cart with you with some straw in the bottom and bring them all down here i will ride round myself to mr chetwynde sir charles harris and mr merchison and we will sit at twelve oclock you can send round a constable with the usual letters to the others but those three will be quite enough for the preliminary examination  well squire that is good news indeed we have had the coach held up so often within five miles of this place during the past three months that we have been getting quite a bad name and to think that young bastow was in it i have heard some queer stories about him and fancied before long i should have to put my hand upon his shoulder but i didnt expect this  there is not a shadow of proof that he had anything to do with the robbery dawney but he will have difficulty in proving that he did not afterwards abet them it is serious enough as it is and i am terribly grieved for his fathers sake  yes sir i have always heard him spoken of as a kind gentleman and one who took a lot of trouble whenever anyone was sick well sir i will be off in twenty minutes i will run round at once and send dr hewett up to the rectory and a man shall start on horseback at seven oclock with the summons to the other magistrates  john thorndyke rode round to his three fellow magistrates who living nearest to the town were most regular in their attendance at the meetings they all listened in surprise to his narrative and expressed great pleasure at hearing that the men who had been such a pest to the neighborhood and had caused them all personally a great deal of trouble had been captured all had heard tales too to arthur bastows disadvantage and expressed great commiseration for his father they agreed to meet at the court half an hour before business began to talk the matter over together  it is out of the question that we can release him on bail the gentleman who was chairman of the bench said quite so john thorndyke agreed in the first place the matter is too serious and in the next he certainly would not be able to find bail and lastly for his fathers sake it is unadvisable that he should be let out at the same time it appears to me that there is a broad distinction between his case and the others i fear that there can be no question that he had prior acquaintance with these men and that he was cognizant of the whole business something i heard him say and which to my regret i shall have to repeat in court almost proves that he was so still let us hope none of the stolen property will be found upon him whether they had intended to pass it over to his care or not is immaterial if they had not done so i doubt whether he could be charged with receiving stolen goods and we might make the charge simply one of aiding these two criminals and of being so far an accessory after the crime  if we could soften it down still further i should for his fathers sake be glad but as far as he himself is concerned i would do nothing to lighten his punishment he is about as bad a specimen of human nature as i ever came across his father is in bodily fear of him i saw the young fellow yesterday and urged him to enlist in order to break himself loose from the bad companionship he had fallen into his reply was insolent and defiant in the highest degree and it was then that in his fathers name i forbade him the house and as his father was present he confirmed what i said and told him that he would not have anything more to do with him this affair may do him good and save his neck from a noose a few years at the hulks or a passage to botany bay will do him no harm and at any rate his father will have rest and peace which he never would have if he remained here  a somewhat similar conversation took place at each house john thorndyke breakfasted at sir charles harris the last of the three upon whom he called and then mounting rode back to reigate  we have found the plunder on them the head constable said coming out of the lockup as he drew rein before it and fortunately for young bastow nothing was found upon him  how are the two men  the fellow you hit first is conscious now sir but very weak the doctor says that if he hadnt had a thick hat on your blow would have killed him to a certainty the other mans arm is set and bandaged and he is all right otherwise we shall be able to have them both in court at twelve oclock  the squire rode up to his house he was met at the door by his son in a state of great excitement  is it all true father the news has come from the village that you have killed two men and that they and arthur bastow have all been taken away in a cart guarded by constables  as usual mark rumor has exaggerated matters there are no dead men one certainly got a crack on the head that rendered him insensible for some time and anothers arm is broken  and are they highwaymen father they say that two horses were fastened behind the cart  that is what we are going to try mark until their guilt is proved no one knows whether they are highwaymen or not  and why is arthur bastow taken father  simply because he was in company with the others now you need not ask any more questions but if you like to get your pony saddled and ride down with me to reigate at eleven oclock i will get you into the courthouse and then you will hear all about it  at greater length the squire went into the matter with mrs cunningham his lady housekeeper and his wards governess  it is a bad business mr thorndyke she said and must be terrible for poor mr bastow  yes it is a bad business altogether except that it will rid him of this young rascal if i were in his place i should be ready to suffer a good deal to obtain such a riddance  i suppose that you wont sit upon the bench today  no at least i shall take no part in the deliberations i shall of course give evidence the affair is not likely to last very long my story will take the longest to tell knapps will be confirmatory of mine and the reigate constable will depose to finding the watches rings and money upon them then of course the case will be adjourned for the attendance of the coachman and some of the passengers i dont suppose they will be able to swear to their identity for no doubt they were masked but that is immaterial the discovery of the stolen property upon them will be sufficient to hang them no doubt we shall have some bow streets runners down from town tomorrow or next day and they will most likely be able to say who the fellows are  will mr bastow have to give evidence against his son  not before us i think but i imagine he will have to appear at the trial  it will be terrible for him  yes terrible i sincerely hope that they will not summon him but i am afraid that there is very little doubt about it they are sure to want to know about his sons general conduct though possibly the testimony on that point of the constable at reigate will be sufficient my own hope is that he will get a long sentence at any rate one long enough to insure his not coming back during his fathers lifetime if you had seen his manner when we were talking to him yesterday you would believe that he is capable of anything i have had a good many bad characters before me during the year and a half that i have sat upon the bench but i am bound to say that i never saw one who was to my eyes so thoroughly evil as this young fellow i dont think he added with a smile that i should feel quite comfortable myself if he were acquitted it will be a long time before i shall forget the expression of his face when he said to me this morning you will repent this nights work thorndyke  you dont mean that you think he would do you any harm mr thorndyke  well i should not care to meet him in a lonely place if he was armed and i was not but you need not be nervous mrs cunningham there is not the smallest chance of his being out for years and by that time his blood will have had time to cool down and he will have learnt at any rate that crimes cannot be committed in this country with impunity  it is all very shocking the lady said what will poor mr bastow do i should think that he would not like to remain as clergyman here where everyone knows about it  that must be for him to decide the squire said but if he wishes to resign i certainly shall not press him to continue to hold the living he is a very old friend of mine my father presented the living to him when i was nine or ten years old and i may say i saw him daily up to the time when i went down into sussex if he resigns i should urge him to take up his residence here and to act as marks tutor and he might also relieve you of some of millicents lessons you have plenty to do in looking after the management of things in general however that is for the future  at eleven oclock the squire drove down to reigate taking mark with him as it would save all trouble about putting up the horse and pony on arriving he handed mark over to the head constable and asked him to pass him into a seat in the courthouse before the public were let in  reigate was in a state of unusual excitement that the coach should have been stopped and robbed was too common an event to excite much interest but that two highwaymen should have been captured and as was rumored a young gentleman brought in on a charge of being in connection with them caused a thrill of excitement quite a small crowd was assembled before the courthouse and the name of squire thorndyke passed from mouth to mouth  there is some talk of his being mixed up with it in some way or other one said i saw him myself ride in here about half past five and i wondered he was about so early some do say as he caught the two highwaymen single handed but that dont stand to reason besides what could he have been doing out at such an hour as that he is a good landlord and they say that crowswood has been quite a different place since he came to be master he is a tight hand as a magistrate and cleared out half the village the first two or three months he was there but he spent a mint of money on the place and the people there say that they could not have a better master ah here is squire chetwynd he was sure to be here there is sir charles gig turning the corner i expect most of them will be on the bench they dont get such a case as this every day  it may be there will be nothing for us to hear when the court opens another said i hear both the fellows have been shot or knocked about so bad that they cannot be brought up of course the court cannot sit if they aint before it  that is not so master jones i spoke to one of the constables half an hour agohe lives next door to meand he said that they would be well enough to appear neither of them have been shot though they have been hurt pretty bad  all this added to the desire of those around to get into the court and there was quite a rush when the doors were opened two minutes before twelve and it was at once crammed the constable having some difficulty in getting the doors shut and in persuading those who could not get in that there was not standing room for another person there was a buzz of talk in court until the door opened and six magistrates came in it was observed that john thorndyke did not seat himself with the others but moved his chair a little apart from them thus confirming the report that he was in some way connected with the matter and did not intend to take any part in the decision then another door opened and the three prisoners were brought in the two first were pale and evidently weak one had his head wrapped in bandages the other had the right sleeve of his coat cut off and his arm bandaged and supported by a sling both made a resolute effort to preserve a careless demeanor the third who was some years younger than the others looked round with a smile on his lips bowed to the magistrates with an air of insolent bravado when he was placed in the dock and then leaned easily in the corner as if indifferent to the whole business a chair was placed between his comrades for the use of the man whose head was bandaged many among those present knew arthur bastow by sight and his name passed from mouth to mouth but the usher called loudly for silence and then the magistrates clerk rose  william smith and john brownat least these are the names givenare charged with stopping the south coast coach last night killing the guard and robbing the passengers and arthur bastow is charged with aiding and abetting the other two prisoners and with guilty knowledge of their crime  it was noticed by those who could see the prisoners faces that in spite of bastows air of indifference there was an expression of anxiety on his face as the charge was read and he undoubtedly felt relief as that against himself was mentioned the first witness was john knapp and the constable stepped into the witness box  what do you know of this business knapp the chairman asked just tell it your own way  i am constable of crowswood your honor and yesterday squire thorndyke said to me  no you must not tell it like that knapp you must not repeat what another person said to you you can say that from information received you did so and so  yes your honor from information received i went to the rev mr bastows house at a quarter to nine last night at nine oclock squire thorndyke and the parson came in together they sent the servant up to bed and then the squire sent me round to examine the fastenings of the doors i found that one back door had been left unfastened and locked and bolted it the squire told me to lie down until one oclock and he would watch and mr bastow went up to bed  do you know of your own knowledge why these precautions were taken  only from what i was told your honor at one oclock the squire woke me and he lay down in the parlor telling me to call him if i heard any movement outside about two oclock i heard two horses come into the parsons yard i called squire thorndyke who went upstairs to an open window presently someone came and tried the back door i heard voices outside but could not hear what was said the squire came down and called me upstairs i went up and took my place at one side of the window and the squire took his on the other i had this cudgel in my hand and the squire his riding whip a ladder was put up against the window and then someone came up lifted the sash up high and got in there was light enough for me to see it was young mr bastow then the two other prisoners came up when the third had got into the room mr bastow said follow me and then you wont tumble over the furniture  how was it that they did not see you and mr thorndyke the chairman asked  we were standing well back your honor the moon was on the other side of the house there was light enough for us to see them as they got in at the window but where we were standing it was quite dark especially to chaps who had just come in from the moonlight as they moved the squire hit the last of them a clout on the head with his hunting crop and down he went as if shot the man next to him turned but i did not see what took place for as the squire had ordered me i made a rush at mr bastow and got my arms round him pretty tight so as to prevent him using his pistols if he had any he struggled hard but without saying a word till i got my heel behind his and threw him on his back i came down on the top of him then i got the pistols out of his belt and threw them on the bed slipped the handcuffs onto one wrist lifted him up a bit and then shoved him up against the bedpost and got the handcuff onto his other wrist so that he could not shift away having the post in between his arms  then i went to see if the squire wanted any help but he didnt i first handcuffed the man whose head he had broken and tied the legs of the other and then kept guard over them till morning when the constables came up from town we searched the prisoners and on two of them found the watches money and rings we found nothing on mr bastow i went with the head constable to mr bastows room and searched it thoroughly but found nothing whatever there  the evidence created a great sensation in court john thorndyke had first intended to ask knapp not to make any mention of the fact that arthur bastow was carrying pistols unless the question was directly put to him but the more he had thought over the matter the more convinced was he that the heavier the sentence the better it would be for the rector and when he had heard from the latter that there was nothing left in his sons room that could be brought against him and that he could not be charged with the capital crime of being a receiver he thought it best to let matters take their course  the head constable was the next witness he deposed to the finding of the articles produced upon the two elder prisoners and the unsuccessful search of the younger prisoners room  you did not search the house further the chairman inquired  no sir i wanted to get the prisoners down here as fast as i could seeing that two of them were seriously hurt  the chairman nodded  you will of course make a careful search of the whole house constable  yes sir i left one of my men up there with instructions to allow no one to go upstairs until i returned  quite right  john thorndyke was the next witness and his evidence cleared up what had hitherto been a mystery to the general body of the public as to how he and the constable happened to be in the house on watch when the highwaymen arrived the most important part of his evidence was the repetition of the words young bastow had used as he mounted the ladder as they showed that it was arranged between the prisoners that the stolen goods should be hidden in the house the squire was only asked one or two questions  i suppose mr thorndyke that you had no idea whatever that the younger prisoner would be accompanied by anyone else when he returned home  not the slightest the squire replied i was there simply to prevent this unfortunate lad from entering the house when perhaps he might have used violence towards his father my intention was to seize him if he did so and to give him the choice of enlisting as i had urged him to do or of being brought before this bench for breaking into his fathers house i felt that anything was better than his continuing in the evil courses on which he seemed bent  thank you mr thorndyke i must compliment you in the name of my brother magistrates and i may say of the public for the manner in which you at considerable risk to yourself have effected the capture of the two elder prisoners  after consulting with the others the head constable was recalled  do you know anything about the character of the youngest prisoner  yes sir we have had our eye upon him for some time he was brought before your honors a week ago charged with being drunk and disorderly in this town and was fined 5 pounds he is constantly drinking with some of the worst characters in the place and is strongly suspected of having been concerned in the fray between the poachers and sir charles harris gamekeepers two of the latter said that they recognized him amongst the poachers but as they both declined to swear to him we did not arrest him  john knapp was then recalled and testified to bastows drinking habits and that the landlord of the alehouse at crowswood had been ordered by the squire not to draw any liquor for him in future on pain of having the renewal of his license refused  have you any more witnesses to call the chairman asked the head constable  not at present your honor we have sent up to town and on the next occasion the coachman will be called to testify to the shooting of the guard and we hope to have some of the passengers there to identify the articles stolen from them  it will be necessary that the rev mr bastow should be here he need not be called to give evidence unless we think it to be of importance but he had better be in attendance the prisoners are remanded until this day week  an hour later the three prisoners handcuffed were driven under an escort of three armed constables to croydon jail when again brought up in court the passengers on the coach identified the articles taken from them the coachman gave evidence of the stopping of the coach and of the shooting of the guard the head constable testified that he had searched the rectory from top to bottom and found nothing whatever of a suspicious nature none of the passengers were able to testify to the two elder prisoners as the men who had robbed them as these had been masked but the height and dress corresponded to those of the prisoners and the two bow street runners then came forward and gave evidence that the two elder prisoners were well known to them they had long been suspected of being highwaymen and had several times been arrested when riding towards london on occasions when a coach had been stopped the night before but no stolen goods had ever been found upon them and in no case had the passengers been able to swear to their identity one was known among his associates as galloping bill the other as the downy one at the conclusion of the evidence the three prisoners were formally committed for trial the magistrates having retired in consultation for some time upon the question of whether the charge of receiving stolen goods ought to be made against arthur bastow  i think gentlemen the chairman said after a good deal had been urged on both sides of the question in this case we can afford to take a merciful view in the first place no stolen goods were discovered upon him or in the house there is strong presumptive evidence of his intention but intention is not a crime and even were the evidence stronger than it is i should be inclined to take a merciful view there can be no doubt that the young fellow is thoroughly bad and the bravado he has exhibited throughout the hearing is at once unbecoming and disgraceful but we must remember that he is not yet eighteen and that in the second place he is the son of a much respected clergyman who is our neighbor the matter is serious enough for him as it stands and he is certain to have a very heavy sentence  mr thorndyke who takes no part in our deliberations is most anxious that the prisoners father should be spared the agony of his son being placed on trial on a capital charge though i do not think that there would be the smallest chance of his being executed for the judges would be certain to take his youth into consideration had there been prima facie evidence of concealment we must have done our duty and sent him to trial on that charge but as there is no such evidence i think that it will be in all respects better to send him on a charge on which the evidence is as clear as noonday moreover i think that mr thorndykes wishes should have some weight with us seeing that it is entirely due to him that the important capture of these highwaymen who have long been a scourge to this neighborhood has been effected  mr bastow had not been called as a witness john thorndyke had brought him down to reigate in a closed carriage and he had waited in the justices room while the examination went on but the magistrates agreed that the evidence given was amply sufficient for them to commit upon without given him the pain of appearing john thorndyke had taken him to another room while the magistrates were consulting together and when he heard the result drove him back again  i have fully made up my mind to resign my living thorndyke i could not stand up and preach to the villagers of their duties when i myself have failed so signally in training my own son nor visit their houses and presume to lecture them on their shortcomings when my son is a convicted criminal  i quite see that old friend the squire said and i had no doubt but that you would decide on this course i will try not to persuade you to change your decision for i feel that your power of usefulness is at an end as far as the village is concerned may i ask what you propose to do i can hardly suppose that your savings have been large  two years ago i had some hundreds laid by but they have dwindled away to nothing you can understand how for a time it was given freely then reluctantly then i declared i would give no more but he took it all the samehe knew well enough that i could never prosecute him for forgery  as bad as that eh thorndyke said sternly well we wont talk further of him now what i propose is that you should take up your abode at the hall i am not satisfied with the school where mark has been for the last two years and i have been hesitating whether to get a private tutor for him or to send him to one of the public schools i know that that would be best but i could not bring myself to do so i have some troubles of my own that but two or three people know of and now that everything is going on smoothly on the estate and in the village i often feel dull and the boys companionship does me much good and as he knows many lads of his own age in the neighborhood now i think that he would do just as well at home  he will be taking to shooting and hunting before long and if he is to have a tutor there is no one i should like to have better than yourself you know all the people and we could talk comfortably together of an evening when the house is quiet altogether it will be an excellent arrangement for me you would have your own room and if i have company you need not join us unless you like the house would not seem like itself without you for you have been associated with it as long as i can remember as to your going out into the world at the age of sixty it would be little short of madness thereyou need not give me an answer now he went on seeing that the rector was too broken down to speak but i am sure that when you think it over you will come to the same conclusion as i do that it will be the best plan possible for us both     chapter iv   the trial of the two highwaymen and arthur bastow came off in due course the evidence given was similar to that offered at reigate the only addition being that mr bastow was himself put into the box the counsel for the prosecution said i am sorry to have to call you mr bastow we all feel most deeply for you and i will ask you only two or three questions was your son frequently out at night  he was  did you often hear him return  yes i seldom went to sleep until he came back  had you any reason to suppose that others returned with him  i never saw any others  but you might have heard them without seeing them please tell us if you ever heard voices  yes i have heard mens voices the clergyman said reluctantly in a low voice  one more question and i have done have you on some occasions heard the sound of horses hoofs in your yard at about the time that your son came in  mr bastow said in a low voice i have  had you any suspicion whatever of the character of your sons visitors  none whatever i supposed that those with him were companions with whom he had been spending the evening  mr bastow had to be assisted from the witness box so overcome was he with the ordeal he had not glanced at his son while giving his evidence the latter and his two fellow prisoners maintained throughout the trial their expression of indifference the two highwaymen nodded to acquaintances they saw in the body of the court smiled at various points in the evidence and so conducted themselves that there were murmured exclamations of approval of their gameness on the part of the lower class of the public the jury without a moments hesitation found them all guilty of the offenses with which they were charged bastow was first sentenced  young man the judge said young as you are there can be no doubt whatever in the minds of anyone who has heard the evidence that you have been an associate with these men who have been found guilty of highway robbery accompanied by murder i consider that a merciful view was taken of your case by the magistrates who committed you for trial for the evidence of your heartbroken father on whose gray hairs your conduct has brought trouble and disgrace leaves no doubt that you have for some time been in league with highwaymen although not actually participating in their crime the words overheard by mr thorndyke show that you were prepared to hide their booty for them and it is well for you that you were captured before this was done and that no proceeds of other robberies were found in the house the evidence of the bow street officers show that it had for some time been suspected that these men had an accomplice somewhere in the neighborhood of reigate for although arrested several times under circumstances forming a strong assumption of their guilt nothing was ever found upon them there can now be little doubt who their accomplice was had you been an older man i should have sentenced you to transportation for life but in consideration of your youth i shall take the milder course of sentencing you to fifteen years transportation  the capital sentence was then passed in much fewer words upon the two highwaymen as they were leaving the dock bastow turned and in a clear voice said to john thorndyke who had been accommodated with a seat in the well of the court  i have to thank you thorndyke for this i will pay off my debt some day you make take your oath  a sad case mr thorndykea sad case the judge who had greatly complimented the squire on his conduct said to him as he was disrobing afterwards i dont know that in all my experience i ever saw such a hardened young villain with highwaymen it is a point of honor to assume a gayety of demeanor on such occasions but to see a boy of eighteen never before convicted exhibiting such coolness and effrontery is quite beyond my experience i suppose his record is altogether bad  altogether the squire said his father has during the last two years been quite broken by it he owned to me that he was in bodily fear of the lad who had on several occasions assaulted him had robbed him of his savings by means of forgery and was so hopelessly bad that he himself thought with me that the only possible hope for him was to get him to enlist i myself recommended the east india companys service thinking that he would have less opportunity for crime out there and that there would be a strong chance that either fever or a bullet would carry him off for i own that i have not the slightest hope of reformation in such a character  i would have given him transportation for life if i had known all this the judge said however it is not likely that he will ever come back againvery few of them do the hulks are not the most healthy places in the world and they have a pretty rough way with men who give them trouble as this young fellow is likely to do  mr bastow as soon as he had given his evidence had taken a hackney coach to the inn where he and the squire had put up on their arrival in town the evening before and here on his return john thorndyke found him he was lying on his bed in a state of prostration  cheer up bastow he said putting his hand upon the rectors shoulder the sentence is fifteen years which was the very amount i hoped that he would get the more one sees of him the more hopeless it is to expect that any change will ever take place in him and it is infinitely better that he should be across the sea where his conduct when his term is over can affect no one the disgrace such as it is to his friends is no greater in a long term than in a short one had he got off with four or five years imprisonment he would have been a perpetual trouble and a source of uneasiness not to say alarm and even had he left you alone we should always have been in a state of dread as to his next offense better that he should be out in the colonies than be hung at tyburn  how did he take the sentence  with the same bravado he had shown all through and as he went out of the dock addressed a threat to me that under the circumstances i can very well afford to despise now if you will take my advice you will drink a couple of glasses of good port and then go to bed i will see to your being awakened at seven oclock which will give us time to breakfast comfortably and to make a start at nine  i would rather not have the wine the rector said feebly  yes but you must take what is good for you i have ordered up a bottle of the landlords best and must insist upon your drinking a couple of glasses with me i want it almost as much as you do for the atmosphere of that court was enough to poison a dog i have got the taste of it in my mouth still  with much reluctance the rector accompanied him to the private sitting room that the squire had engaged he sat down almost mechanically in an easy chair the squire poured out the wine and handed him a glass mr bastow at first put it to his lips without glancing at it but he was a connoisseur in wine and the bouquet of the port appealing to his latent senses he took a sip and then another appreciatingly  the landlord said it was first rate and he is not far wrong john thorndyke remarked as he set down his own glass  yes it is a fine vintage and in perfect condition mr bastow agreed i have drunk nothing better for years though you have some fine bins  i would take a biscuit if i were you before i took another glass the squire said helping himself from a plate on the table you have had nothing to eat today and you want something badly i have a dish of kidneys coming up in half an hour they cook them well here  the rector ate a biscuit mechanically sipped another glass of wine and was even able to eat a kidney when they were brought up although september was not yet out the squire had a fire lighted in the room and after the meal was over and two steaming tumblers of punch were placed upon the table he took a long pipe from the mantel filled and lighted it then filled another and handed it to the rector at the same time holding out a light to him  life has its consolations he said you have had a lot of troubles one way and another bastow but we may hope that they are all over now and that life will go more smoothly and easily with you we had better leave the past alone for the present i call this snug a good fire a clean pipe a comfortable chair and a steaming bowl at ones elbow  the rector smiled faintly  it seems unnatural he began  not at all not at all the squire broke in you have had a tremendous load on your mind and now it is lifted off the thundercloud has burst and though damage has been done one is thankful that it is no worse now i can talk to you of a matter that has been on my mind for the last three weeks what steps do you think that i ought to take to find a successor for you it is most important to have a man who will be a real help in the parish as you have been would pull with one comfortably and be a pleasant associate i dont want too young a fellow and i dont want too old a one i have no more idea how to set about it than a child of course i could ask the bishop to appoint but i dont know that he would appoint at all the sort of man i want the living is only worth 200 pounds a year and the houseno very great catch but there is many a man that would be glad to have it  i have been thinking it over too thorndyke when i could bring my mind to consider anything but my own affairs how would greg do he has been taking duty for me since i could not do it myself i know that he is a hard working fellow and he has a wife and a couple of children his curacy is only 70 pounds a year and it would be a perfect godsend for he has no interest in the church and he might be years without preferment  i should think he would do very well bastow yes he reads well which i own i care for that a good deal more than for the preaching not that i have anything to say against that he gives sound and practical sermons and they have the advantage of being short which is a great thing in the first place it is good in itself and in the second specially important in a village congregation where you know very well every woman present is fidgeting to get home to see that the pot is not boiling over and the meat in the oven is not burnt yes i will go down tomorrow afternoon and ask him if he would like the living you were talking of selling the furniture how much do you suppose it is worth  i dont suppose it will fetch above seventy or eighty pounds it is solid and good but as i have had it in use nearly forty years it would not go for much  well let us say a hundred pounds the squire said i will give you a check for it i dare say greg will find it difficult to furnish and he might have to borrow the money and the debt would be a millstone round his neck perhaps for years so i will hand it over with the rectory to him  so they talked for an hour or two on village matters and the squire was well pleased when his old friend went up to bed that he had succeeded in diverting his thoughts for a time from the painful subject that had engrossed them for weeks  you have slept well he said when they met at breakfast i can see by your face  yes i have not slept so soundly for months i went to sleep as soon as my head touched the pillow and did not awake until the chambermaid knocked at the door  that second glass of punch did it bastow it is a fine morning we shall have a brisk drive back i am very glad that i changed my mind and brought the gig instead of the close carriage  in the afternoon the squire drove into reigate he found the curate at home and astonished and delighted him by asking him if he would like the living of crowswood it came altogether as a surprise to him for the rectors intentions to resign had not been made public and it was supposed in the village that he was only staying at the squires until this sad affair should be over greg was a man of seven or eight and twenty had graduated with distinction at cambridge but having no influence had no prospects of promotion and the offer almost bewildered him  i should be grateful indeed mr thorndyke he said it would be a boon to us will you excuse me for a moment  and opening a door he called for his wife who was trying to keep the two children quiet there having retired with them hastily when mr thorndyke was announced  what do you think emma her husband said excitedly as she came into the room mr thorndyke has been good enough to offer me the living of crowswood  then he recovered himself i beg your pardon sir for my unmannerliness in not first introducing my wife to you  it was natural that you should think of telling her the news first of all the squire said courteously madam i am your obedient servant and i hope that soon we shall get to know each other well i consider it of great importance that the squire of a parish and the rector should work well together and see a great deal of each other i dont know whether you are aware mr greg that the living is worth 200 pounds a year besides which there is a paddock of about ten acres which is sufficient for the keep of a horse and cow the rectory is a comfortable one and i have arranged with mr bastow that he shall leave his furniture for the benefit of his successor it will include linen so that you will be put to no expense whatever in moving in i have known these first expenses to seriously cripple the usefulness of a clergyman when appointed to a living  that is good of you indeed mr thorndyke the curate said we have been living in these lodgings since we first came here and it will indeed make matters easy to have the question of furniture so kindly settled for us  will your rector be able to release you shortly  i have no doubt that he will do that at once his son has just left oxford and taken deacons orders and the rector told me the other day that he should be glad if i would look out for another curacy as he wanted to have his son here with him he spoke very kindly and said that he should make no change until i could hear of a place to suit me his son has been assisting him for the last month since i took the services at crowswood and i am sure he would release me at once  then i should be glad if you will move up as soon as possible to the rectory i know nothing about the necessary forms but i suppose that mr bastow will send in his resignation to the bishop and i shall write and tell him that i have appointed you and you can continue to officiate as you have done lately until you can be formally inducted as the rector perhaps you would not mind going round to your rector at once and telling him of the offer you have had i have one or two matters to do in the town and will call again in three quarters of an hour i shall be glad to tell mr bastow that you will come into residence at once  on returning at the appointed time he found that the curate had returned  mr pilkington was very kind and evidently very pleased he congratulated me most warmly and i can come up at once we dont know how to thank you enough mr thorndyke  i dont want any thanks i can assure you mr greg tomorrow i will send a couple of women in from the village to get the place in order and no doubt mr bastow will want to take away a few things he is going to remain with me as tutor to my son i am sure you and i will get on very well together and i only hope that your sermons will be no longer when you are rector than they have been while you have been assisting us long sermons may do for a town congregation but in my opinion they are a very serious mistake in the case of a village one by the way i think it would be as well for you to get a servant here and that before you go up mr bastows servant was an old woman and in a case like this i always think it is better not to take ones predecessors servant she generally resents any change and is always quoting how her last master had things i mention this before you go because she is sure to ask to stay on and it is much easier to say that you are bringing a servant with you than to have to tell her she is too old or too fat dont you think so mrs greg  yes i think it will be much better mr thorndyke even if i cannot hear of one likely to suit us permanently i will take someone as a stop gap one can easily change afterwards  the old woman will do very well the squire said she has two married daughters in the village and with a shilling or two from the parish she will manage comfortably at any rate we shall look after her and i have no doubt mr bastow will make her an allowance  never were a pair more delighted than parson greg and his wife when two days later they took possession of their new home half a dozen women had been at work the day before and everything was in perfect order to mrs gregs relief she found that the old servant had already gone the squire having himself informed her that mrs greg would bring her own maid with her mr bastow said that he would allow her half a crown a week as long as she lived and the squire added as much more and as the woman had saved a good deal during her twenty years service with the rector she was perfectly satisfied  it is a good thing that she should be content the squire said to mr bastow she has a lot of connections in the village and if she had gone away with a sense of grievance she might have created a good deal of ill feeling against your successor and i am very anxious that he should begin well i like the young fellow and i like his wife  we are fortunate indeed ernest mrs greg said the following morning as with the children two and three years old they went out into the garden where the trees were laden with apples pears and plums what a change from our little rooms in reigate i should think that anyone ought to be happy indeed here  they ought to be emma but you see mr bastow had trouble enough and it should be a lesson to us dear to look very closely after the boys now they are young and see that they dont make bad acquaintances  from what we hear of the village there is little fear of that the mischief must have begun before mr thorndyke came down when by all accounts things had altogether gone to the bad here and of course young bastow must have had an exceptionally evil disposition ernest  yes no doubt but his father could not have looked after him properly i believe from what i hear that bastow was so dispirited at his powerlessness to put a stop to the state of things here that except to perform service he seldom left the house and the boy no doubt grew up altogether wild you know that i was in court on the second day of the examination and the young fellows insolence and bearing astonished and shocked me happily we have the squire here now to back us up the village has been completely cleared of all bad characters and is by all accounts quite a model place and we must do our best to keep it so  the news of the change at the rectory naturally occasioned a great deal of talk at first there was a general feeling of regret that mr bastow had gone and yet it was felt that he could not have been expected to stay the months experience that they had had of the new parson had cleared the way for him he and his wife soon made themselves familiar with the villagers and being bright young people speedily made themselves liked the squire and mrs cunningham called the first afternoon after their arrival  you must always send up if anything is wanted mr greg whenever there is any illness in the village we always keep a stock of soups and jellies and mrs cunningham is almoner in general is there anything that we can do for you if so let me know without hesitation  indeed there is nothing mr thorndyke it is marvelous to us coming in here and finding everything that we can possibly want  you will want a boy for your garden and you cannot do better than take young bill summers he was with me for a bit last year when the boy i have now was laid up with mumps or something of that sort and he was very favorably reported on as being handy in the garden able to milk a cow and so on by the way mrs greg i have taken the liberty of sending down a cow in milk i expect she is in your meadow now i have seven or eight of them and if you will send her back when her milk fails i will send down another  you are too kind altogether mr thorndyke mrs greg exclaimed  not at all i want to see things comfortable here and you will find it difficult to get on without a cow i keep two or three for the special use of the village i make them pay for it halfpenny a pint it is better to do that than to give it it is invaluable for the children and i dont think in all england you see rosier and healthier youngsters than those in our schools you will sometimes find milk useful for puddings and that sort of thing for the sick and they will appreciate it all the more than if they had to look solely to us for their supply  how is mr bastow sir  he is better than could be expected he himself proposed this morning that my boy mark should begin his studies at once and indeed now that the worst is over and he has got rid of the load of care on his shoulders i hope that we shall have him bright and cheerful again before long  such was indeed the case for some little time mr bastow avoided the village but john thorndyke got him to go down with him to call upon mr greg and afterwards to walk through it with him at first he went timidly and shrinkingly but the kindly greetings of the women he met and the children stopping to pull a forelock or bob a courtesy as of old gradually cheered him up and he soon got accustomed to the change and would of an afternoon go down to the village and chat with the women after he had ascertained that his successor had no objection whatever and was indeed pleased that he still took an interest in his former parishioners mark was at first disappointed at the arrangement for he had looked forward to going to a public school his father however had no great trouble in reconciling him to it  of course mark he said there are advantages in a public school i was never at one myself but i believe that though the discipline is pretty strict there is a great deal of fun and sport and you may make desirable acquaintances upon the other hand there are drawbacks in the first place the majority of the boys are sons of richer men than i am i dont know that that would matter much but it would give you expensive habits and perhaps make you fonder of london life than i should care about in the next place you see you would be at school when the shooting begins and you are looking forward to carrying a gun next year the same with hunting you know i promised that this year you should go to the meets on your pony and see as much of them as you can and of course when you were at school you would only be able to indulge in these matters during your holidays and if a hard frost set in as is the case three times out of four just as you came home you would be out of it altogether  i must say i should like you to have a real love of field sports and to be a good shot and a good rider a man however wide his acres may be is thought but little of in the country if he is not a good sportsman and moreover there is nothing better for developing health and muscles than riding and tramping over the fields with a gun on your shoulder and lastly you must not forget mark that one of my objects in making this arrangement is to keep mr bastow with us i am sure that unless he thought that he was making himself useful he would not be content to remain here and at his age you know it would be hard for him to obtain clerical employment  all right father i see that the present plan is the best and that i should have but little sport if i went away to school besides i like mr bastow very much and i am quite sure that i shant get so many whackings from him as i used to do from old holbrook  i fancy not mark his father said with a smile i am not against wholesome discipline but i think it can be carried too far at any rate i hope you will be just as obedient to mr bastow as if he always had a cane on the table beside him  mark therefore went to work in a cheerful spirit and soon found that he made more progress in a week under mr bastows gentle tuition than he had done in a month under the vigorous discipline of his former master mr and mrs greg dined regularly at the squires once a week  have you had that indian servant of yours long mr thorndyke mrs greg asked one day he is a strange looking creature of course in the daytime when one sees him about in ordinary clothes one does not notice him so much but of an evening in that eastern costume of his he looks very strange  he was the servant of the colonel my brother the squire replied he brought him over from india with him the man had been some years in his service and was very attached to him and had saved his life more than once he told me on one occasion he caught a cobra by the neck as it was about to strike my brothers hand as he sat at table he carried it out into the compound as george called it but which means he told me garden and there let it escape another time he caught a thug which means a sort of robber who kills his victims by strangling before robbing them they are a sort of sect who regard strangling as a religious action greatly favored by the bloodthirsty goddess they worship he was in the act of fastening the twisted handkerchief used for the purpose round my brothers neck when ramoo cut him down the closest shave though was when george coming down the country was pounced upon by a tiger and carried off ramoo seized a couple of muskets from the men and rushed into the jungle after him and coming up with the brute killed him at the first shot george escaped with a broken arm and his back laid open by a scratch of the tigers claws as it first seized him  so at georges death i took ramoo on and have found him a most useful fellow of course i was some little time before i became accustomed to his noiseless way of going about and it used to make me jump when i happened to look round and saw him standing quietly behind me when i thought i was quite alone however as soon as i became accustomed to him i got over all that and now i would not lose him for anything he seems to know instinctively what i want he is excellent as a waiter and valet i should feel almost lost without him now and the clumping about of an english man servant would annoy me as much as his noiseless way of going about did at first he has come to speak english very fairly of course my brother always talked to him in his own tongue still he had picked up enough english for me to get on with now he speaks it quite fluently when i have nothing whatever for him to do he devotes himself to my little ward she is very fond of him and it is quite pretty to see them together in the garden altogether i would not part with him for anything  for some years life passed uneventfully at crowswood it was seldom indeed that the squires authority was needed to set matters right in the village the substitution of good farmers for shiftless ones in some of the farms and the better cultivation generally had given more employment and as john thorndyke preferred keeping two or three cottages shut up rather than have them occupied by men for whom no work could be found it was rare indeed that there were any complaints of scarcity of work except indeed on the part of the rector who declared that what with the healthiness of the village and the absence of want his occupation save for the sunday duty was a sinecure mr bastow was more happy and much brighter than he had been for many years the occupation of teaching suited him and he was able to make the work pleasant to his pupil as well as to himself indeed it occupied but a small portion of the day the amount of learning considered necessary at the time not being extensive a knowledge of greek was thought quite superfluous for a country gentleman science was in its infancy mathematics a subject only to be taken up by those who wanted to obtain a college fellowship latin however was considered an essential and a knack of apt quotation from the latin poets an accomplishment that every man who was a member of society or aspired to enter parliament was expected to possess thus mark thorndykes lessons lasted but two or three hours a day and the school term was a movable period according to the season of the year and the engagements of the squire and mark in winter the evening was the time so that the boy shot with his father or rode to the hounds or as he got older joined in shooting parties at the houses of neighbors  in summer the work was done in the morning but was not unfrequently broken mark went off at a very early hour to drive perhaps some twenty miles with his great chum dick chetwynd for a long days fishing or to see a main of cocks fought or a fight between the champions of two neighboring villages or perhaps some more important battle  when millicent conyers was ten years old she came regularly into the study sitting curled up in a deep chair getting up her lessons while mark did his and then changing seats with him while he learned his horace or ovid by heart at this time she looked up greatly to him and was his companion whenever he would allow her to be fetched and carried for him and stood almost on a level with his dogs in his estimation five years later when mark was eighteen these relations changed somewhat he now liked to have her with him not only when about the house and garden but when he took short rides she cantered along on her pony by his side she was a bright faced girl full of life and fun and rejoicing in a far greater amount of freedom than most girls of her age and time  it is really time that she should learn to comport herself more staidly instead of running about like a wild thing mrs cunningham said one day as she and the squire stood after breakfast looking out of the open window at mark and millicent  time enough my dear lady time enough let her enjoy life while she can i am not in favor of making a young kitten behave like an old tabby every creature in nature is joyful and frolicsome while it is young she is as tall and as straight as any of her friends of the same age and looks more healthy she will tame down in time and i dare say walk and look as prim and demure as they do i was watching them the other day when there was a party of them up here and i thought the difference was all to her advantage she looked a natural healthy girl they looked like a set of overdressed dolls afraid to move or to talk loud or to stretch their mouths when they smile very ladylike and nice no doubt but you will see millicent will throw them into the shade when she is once past the tomboy age leave her alone mrs cunningham a girl is not like a fruit tree that wants pruning and training from its first year it will be quite time to get her into shape when she has done growing  john thorndyke had occasionally made inquiries of mr bastow as to the whereabouts of his son at the time the sentence was passed transportation to the american colonies was being discontinued and until other arrangements could be made hulks were established as places of confinement and punishment but a few months later arthur bastow was one of the first batch of convicts sent out to the penal settlement formed on the east coast of australia this was intended to be fixed at botany bay but it having been found that this bay was open and unsheltered it was established at sydney although for many years the settlement retained in england the name of the original site as the condition of the prisoners kept in the hulks was deplorable the squire had through the influence of sir charles harris obtained the inclusion of bastows name among the first batch of those who were to sail for australia mr bastow obtained permission to see his son before sailing but returned home much depressed for he had been assailed with such revolting and blasphemous language by him that he had been forced to retire in horror at the end of a few minutes  we have done well in getting him sent off the squire said when he heard the result of the interview in the first place the demoralizing effect of these hulks is quite evident and it may be hoped that in a new country where there can be no occasion for the convicts to be pent up together things may be better for although escapes from the hulks are not frequent they occasionally take place and had he gained his liberty we should have had an anxious time of it until he was rearrested whereas out there there is nowhere to go to no possibility of committing a crime it is not there as it was in the american colony settlements may grow up in time but at present there are no white men whatever settled in the district and the natives are they say hostile and were a convict to escape he would almost certainly be killed and possibly eaten no doubt by the time your son has served his sentence colonies will be established out there and he may then be disposed to settle there either on a piece of land of which he could no doubt take up or in the service of one of the colonists     chapter v   the scene in the convict yard at sydney five years after its foundation as a penal settlement was not a pleasant one to the lover of humanity warders armed to the teeth were arranging gangs that were to go out to labor on the roads many of the convicts had leg irons but so fastened as to be but slight hindrance to their working powers but the majority were unironed these were the better behaved convicts not that this would be judged from their faces for the brutalizing nature of the system and the close association of criminals had placed its mark on all and it would have been difficult for the most discriminating to have made any choice between the most hardened criminals and those who had been sent out for what would now be considered comparatively trivial offenses the voyage on board ship had done much to efface distinctions the convict life had done more and the chief difference between the chained and unchained prisoners was that the latter were men of more timid disposition than many of their companions and therefore less disposed to give trouble that would entail heavy punishment but it was only the comparatively well conducted men who were placed upon road work the rest were retained for work inside the jail or were caged in solitary confinement each morning a number varying from half a dozen to a dozen were fastened up and flogged in some cases with merciless severity but it was seldom that a cry was uttered by these the most brutal ruffians of the convict herd this spectacle was just over it was conducted in public for the edification of the rest but judging from the low laughs and brutal jests uttered below the breath it signally failed in producing the desired impression two of those who had suffered the severest punishment were now putting on their coarse woolen garments over their bloodstained shoulders both were comparatively young men  i shall not stand this much longer one muttered i will brain a warder and get hung for it one can but die once while one can get flogged once a week  so would i the other said bitterly but i have some scores to settle in england and i am not going to put my head in a noose until i have wiped them out the sooner we make arrangements to get back there the better  yes we have talked of this before the other said and i quite agreed with you that if we all had the pluck of men we ought to be able to overpower the warders in spite of their firearms of course some of us would get killed but no one would mind that if there was but the remotest chance of getting away the question is what we should do with ourselves when we were once outside the prison of course i know that there are two or three hundred settlers but there would not be much to be got out of them and life among those black fellows even if they were civil to us which i dont suppose they would be would not be worth having  we might not have to stay there long ships with stores or settlers arrive occasionally and if a lot of us got away we might seize one by force turn pirates for a bit and when we are tired of that sail to some south american port sell our capture and make our way home to england if we were not strong enough to take her we could hide up on board her we should be sure to find some fellow who for a pound or two would be willing to help us the thing can be done if we make up our minds to do it and i for one have made up my mind to try i havent chalked out a plan yet but i am convinced that it is to be done  i am with you whatever it is the other said and i think there are twenty or thirty we could rely on i dont say there are more than that because there are a lot of white livered cusses among them who would inform against us at once so as to get their own freedom as a reward for doing so well we will both think it over mate and the sooner the better  the two men who were thus talking together were both by birth above the common herd of convicts and had gained a considerable ascendency over the others because of their reckless indifference to punishment and their defiance of authority few of the men knew each others real names by the officials they were simply known by numbers while among themselves each had a slang name generally gained on board ship  separation there had of course been impossible and when fastened down below each had told his story with such embellishments as he chose to give it and being but little interfered with by their guards save to insure the impossibility of a mutiny there had been fights of a desperate kind four or five dead bodies had been found and thrown overboard but as none would testify as to who had been the assailants none were punished for it and so the strongest and most desperate had enforced their authority over the others as wild beasts might do and by the time they had reached their destination all were steeped much deeper in wickedness and brutalism than when they set sail  the two men who were speaking together had speedily become chums and though much younger than the majority of the prisoners had by their recklessness and ferocity established an ascendency among the others this ascendency had been maintained after their arrival by their constant acts of insubordination and by their apparent indifference to the punishment awarded them at night the convicts were lodged in wooden buildings where so long as they were not riotous they were allowed to talk and converse freely as indeed was the case when their work for the day was done  as to any attempt at escape the authorities had but small anxiety for until the arrival of the first settlers three years after that of the convicts there was nowhere a fugitive could go to no food to be obtained no shelter save among the blacks who were always ready for a reward of tobacco and spirits to hand them over at once to the authorities the case had but slightly changed since the settlement began to grow it was true that by stealing sheep or driving off a few head of cattle a fugitive might maintain himself for a time but even if not shot down by the settlers or patrols he would be sure before long to be brought in by the blacks  the experiment had already been tried of farming our better conducted convicts to the settlers and indeed it was the prospect of obtaining such cheap labor that had been the main inducement to many of the colonists to establish themselves so far from home instead of going to america as a whole the system worked satisfactorily the men were as much prisoners as were the inmates of the jail for they knew well enough that were they to leave the farmers and take to the bush they would remain free but a short time being either killed or handed over by the blacks and in the latter case they would be severely punished and set to prison work in irons with labor very much more severe than that they were called upon to do on the farms  some little time after the conversation between the two convicts the prison authorities were congratulating themselves upon the fact that a distinct change had taken or was taking place in the demeanor of many of the men who had hitherto been the most troublesome and they put it down to the unusually severe floggings that had been inflicted on the two most refractory prisoners in the establishment when in the prison yard or at work they were more silent than before and did their tasks doggedly and sullenly there was no open defiance to the authorities and above all a marked cessation of drunkenness from the spirits smuggled into the place  only the two originators were aware of the extent of the plot for they had agreed that only by keeping every man in ignorance as to who had joined it could they hope to escape treachery in the first place they had taken into their confidence a dozen men on whom they could absolutely rely beyond this they had approached the others singly beginning by hinting that there was a plot for escape and that a good many were concerned and telling them that these had bound themselves together by a solemn oath to kill any traitor even if hanged for it  no one is to know who is in it and who is not the leaders said to each recruit every new man will be closely watched by the rest and if he has any communication privately with a warder or any other official he will be found strangled the next morning no one will know who did it even if he succeeded in eluding the vigilance of his comrades at the time it would soon be known for if indulgence of any kind was shown towards one man or he was relieved from his ordinary work or even freed altogether and suddenly he would be a dead man in twentyfour hours for we have friends outside among the ticket of leave men who have bound themselves to kill at once any man set free  to the question what do you intend to do when we get off the answer was we shall go straight to the bush so as to avoid a fight with the soldiers in the first place then we shall join that night and drive off all the cattle and sheep from the settlements take possession of every firearm found in the houses then move off a couple of hundred miles or so into the bush and establish a settlement of our own  of course we shall take horses and clothes and any spirits and food we may find if the soldiers pursue us we will fight them but as there are only three or four companies of them and we shall be eight hundred strong we shall very soon show them that they had better leave us alone  oh yes no doubt they will send more soldiers out from england but it will be over a year before they can get here and we propose after we have done with the fellows here to break up into parties of twenty and thirty dividing the sheep and cattle among us and each party going where it will the place is of tremendous size as big as a dozen englands they say and each party will fix a place it fancies where there is good water and a river with fish and so on and we may live all our lives comfortably with just enough work to raise potatoes and corn and to watch our stock increasing anyhow we might calculate on having some years of peace and freedom and even if in the end they searched us all out which would be very unlikely they could but bring us back hang a few and set the rest to work again but we think that they would most likely leave us alone altogether quite satisfied with having got rid of us  those who liked it could no doubt take wives among the blacks the convict women who are out on service with the settlers would you may be sure join us at once and an enterprising chap who preferred a white woman to a black could always make his way down here and persuade one to go off with him to his farm that is the general plan if many get tired of the life they have only to come down to sydney hide up near the place on some dark night and go down to the port seize a ship and make off in her compelling the officers and sailors to take them and land them at any port they fancy either in chili peru or mexico or if they like sail west and make for rio or buenos ayres or one of the west indian islands as to when it is going to be done or how it is going to be done no one will be told till it is ready to be carried out we have not settled that ourselves and thus one who was fool enough to risk certain death could tell the governor no more than that there was a plot on hand and that the man who had sworn him in was concerned in it  so one by one every man in the prison was sworn by a terrible oath to secrecy to watch his companions and to report anything that looked suspicious many joined willingly the prospect of relief even should it only be temporary being too fascinating to be resisted some joined against their will fearing that a refusal to do so would be punished by death and the fact that two or three men were found strangled in bed had a very great effect in inducing others to join in the plot  these deaths caused some uneasiness to the authorities their utmost endeavors failed to discover who were the perpetrators of these murders and even when everyone in the same hut was flogged to obtain information not one opened his lips  one night the word was passed round that the time had come one only in each hut was familiar with the details and he gave instructions to each man individually as to what he was to do the date had been determined by the fact that the time which they had been sentenced to wear irons had terminated the day before and their unusually subdued and quiet demeanor having carried them through the interval without as usual fresh punishments being awarded them before the termination of the former one  in the morning the whole of the convicts were drawn up to witness the flogging of the inmates of one of the huts where a man had been found strangled the morning before the first prisoner was taken to the triangle stripped to the waist and tied up there was a dead silence in the ranks of the convicts but as the first blow fell upon his shoulders there was a loud yell and simultaneously the whole ranks broke up and a number of men sprang upon each of the warders wrested their muskets from them and threw them to the ground then there was a rush towards the governor and officers who were assembled in front of the stone house that faced the open end of the square firing their pistols these at once took refuge in the house three or four falling under the scattered fire that was opened as soon as the muskets of the warders fell into the hands of the convicts  directly the doors were closed the officers appeared at the windows and opened a rifle fire upon the convicts as did the guards near the gate as comparatively few of the convicts had muskets they began to waver at once but headed by the two ringleaders the armed party rushed at the guard shot them down and threw open the gate  then an unexpected thing occurred the soldiers from the barracks happened to be marching down to do target practice on the shore and were passing the convict prison when the firing broke out they were at once halted and ordered to load and as the convicts with exultant shouts poured through the gate they saw a long line of soldiers with leveled muskets facing them  at them one of the leaders shouted it is too late to draw back now we have got to break through them  many of the convicts ran back into the yard but those armed with muskets the more desperate of the party followed their leaders a moment later a heavy volley rang out and numbers of the convicts fell their two leaders however and some twenty of their followers keeping in a close body rushed at the line of soldiers with clubbed muskets and with the suddenness and fury of the rush burst their way through the line and then scattering fled across the country pursued by a dropping fire of musketry  the officers in command seeing that but a fraction had escaped ordered one company to pursue and marched the rest into the prison yard it was already deserted the convicts had scattered to their huts those who had arms throwing them away dotted here and there over the square were the bodies of eight or ten convicts and as many warders whose skulls had been smashed in by their infuriated assailants as soon as they had obtained possession of their muskets close to the gate lay the six soldiers who had furnished the guard these were all dead or mortally wounded  the governor and the officials issued from the house as soon as the soldiers entered the yard the first step to do was to turn all the convicts out of the huts and to iron them no resistance was attempted the sight of the soldiers completely cowing the mutineers when the bodies of the convicts that had fallen were counted and the roll of the prisoners called over it was found that eighteen were missing and of these six were during the course of the next hour or two brought in by the soldiers who had gone in pursuit of them the rest had escaped  the convicts were all questioned separately and the tales they told agreed so closely that the governor could not doubt that they were speaking the truth all had been sworn in by one of two men and knew nothing whatever of what was intended to be done that day until after they were locked up on the evening previous each of those in the huts had received his instructions the night before from the one man  there were eighteen huts each containing fifteen convicts of the men who had given instructions six had fallen outside the gate together with sixteen others five had been overtaken and brought in altogether twelve were still at large among these were the two leaders the next day six of the prisoners were tried and executed the rest were punished only by a reduction in their rations sentence of death was at the same time passed upon the twelve still at large so as to save the trouble of a succession of trials as they were caught and brought in  the two leaders had kept together after they had broken through the line of soldiers  things have gone off well one said as they ran through those soldiers nearly spoilt it all  yes that was unlucky the other agreed but so far as we are concerned which is all we care about i think things have turned out for the best  nothing more was said until they had far outstripped their pursuers hampered as these were by their uniforms and belts  you mean that it is not such a bad thing that they have not all got away  yes that is what i mean it is all very well to tell them about driving off the sheep and cattle and horses and going to start a colony on our own account but the soldiers would have been up to us before we had gone a days journey most of the fellows would have bolted directly they saw them as it is i fancy only about a dozen have got away perhaps not as many as that and they are all men that one can rely upon one can feed a dozen without difficultya sheep a day would do itand by giving a turn to each of the settlers the animals wont be missed besides we shall want money if we are ever to get out of this cursed country it would not be difficult to get enough for you and me but when it comes to a large number the sack of the whole settlement would not go very far  my own idea is that we had best join the others tonight kill a few sheep and go two or three days march into the bush until the heat of the pursuit is over we are all armed the blacks would not venture to attack us and the soldiers would not be likely to pursue us very far in a week or so when we can assume that matters have cooled down a bit we can come down again we know all the shepherds and even if they were not disposed to help us they would not dare to betray us or report a sheep or two being missing of course we shall have to be very careful to shift our quarters frequently those black trackers are sure to be sent out pretty often  as long as we are hanging about the settlements there wont be much fear of our being bothered by the blacks of course we shall have to decide later on whether it will be best for us to try and seize a ship all of us acting together or for us to get quietly on board one and keep under hatches until she is well away that is the plan i fancy most  so do i in the first place the chances are that in the next two or three months at least half the fellows will be picked up to begin with several of them are sure to get hold of liquor and make attacks upon the settlers in which case some of them anyhow are sure to get killed in the next place most of them were brought up as thieves in the slums of london and will have no more idea of roughing it in a country like this than of behaving themselves if they were transported to a london drawing room therefore i am pretty sure that at the end of three months we shall not be able to reckon on half of them well six men are not enough to capture a ship or if they do capture it to keep the crew under one must sleep sometimes and with only three or four men on deck we could not hope to keep a whole ships crew at bay  then there is another reason you and i when we have got a decent rig out could pass anywhere without exciting observation while if we had half a dozen of the others whatever their good qualities they would be noticed at once by their villainous faces and if questions were to be asked we should be likely to find ourselves in limbo again in a very short time so i am all for working on our own account even if the whole of the others were ready to back us but of course we must keep on good terms with them all and breathe no word that we think that each man had better shift for himself some of those fellows if they thought we had any idea of leaving them would go straight into sydney and denounce us although they would know that they themselves would be likely to swing at the same time  as none of the convicts were acquainted with the bush they had been obliged to select as their rendezvous a hut two miles out of the town where the convict gangs that worked on the road were in the habit of leaving their tools on the way there the two men killed a couple of sheep from a flock whose position they had noticed before it became dark these they skinned cut off the heads and left them behind carrying the sheep on their shoulders to the meeting  is that you captain wild a voice said as they approached  yes gentleman dick is with me  that is a good job we had begun to think that the soldiers had caught you  they would not have caught us alive you may take your oath how many are there of us here  ten of us captain i think that that is all there are  that is enough for our purpose has anyone got anything to eat  there was a deep growl in the negative  well we have brought a couple of sheep with us and as we have carried them something like a mile you had better handle them by turns we will strike off into the bush and put another three or four miles between us and the jail and then light a fire and have a meal  two of the men came forward and took the sheep then they turned off from the road and taking their direction from a star followed it for an hour  i think we have got far enough now the man called captain wild said you had better cut down the bushes and we will make a fire  but how are we to light it one of them exclaimed in a tone of consternation i dont suppose we have got flint and steel or tinder box among us  oh we can manage that the captain said get a heap of dried leaves here first then some wood and we will soon have a blaze  his orders were obeyed some of the men had carried off the warders swords as well as their muskets and now used them for chopping wood as soon as a small pile of dried leaves was gathered the captain broke a cartridge and sprinkled half its contents among them and then dropped the remainder into his musket he flashed this off among the leaves and a bright flame at once shot up and in five minutes a fire was burning  one of the sheep was soon cut up the meat hacked in slices from the bones a ramrod was thrust through the pieces and supported by four sticks was laid across the fire three other similarly laden spits were soon placed beside it and in a short time the meat was ready for eating until a hearty meal had been made there was but little talking  that is first rate one of the men said as he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand now one only wants a pipe and bacca and a glass of grog to feel comfortable  well captain are you satisfied with the days work  it would have been a grand day had it not been for the soldiers passing just at the time as it is gentleman dick and i have been agreeing that as far as we are all concerned it has not turned out so badly there would have been a lot of difficulty in finding food if we had all got away and some of those mealy mouthed fellows would have been sure to go back and peach on us at the first opportunity a dozen is better than a hundred for the sort of life we are likely to lead for some time we are strong enough to beat off any attack from the black fellows and also to break into any of these settlers houses  we can when we have a mind to take a stray sheep now and then or even a bullock would scarcely be missed especially if our pals in the settlement will lend us a helping hand which you may be sure they will do in fact they would know better than to refuse then a large party could be traced by those black trackers at a run while a small one would not especially if as we certainly will do we break up into twos and threes for a time first of all though we must go well into the bush at daybreak tomorrow morning we will drive off twenty sheep and go right away a hundred miles and wait there till matters have settled down they will never take the troops out that distance after us then we can come back again and hang about the settlement and take what we want the wild blacks dont come near there and we shall be safer in pairs than we should be if we kept together and of course we could meet once a week or so to talk over our plans we must borrow some whisky flour tea tobacco and a few other items from the settlers but we had better do without them for this trip i dont want to turn the settlers against us for they have all got horses and might combine with the troops to give chase so it would be best to leave them alone at any rate till we get back again another reason for treating them gently is that even if they did not join the troops they might get into a funk and drive their sheep and horses down into sydney and then we should mighty soon get short of food it will be quite time enough to draw upon them heavily when we make up our minds to get hold of a ship and sail away money would be of no use to us here but we shall want it when we get to a port wherever that port may be  that sounds right enough captain one of the convicts said and just at present nothing would suit me better than to get so far away from this place that i can lay on my back and take it easy for a spell  there was a general chorus of assent and there being neither tobacco nor spirits the party very soon stretched themselves off to sleep round the fire  in the morning they were up before daylight and half an hour later arrived at one of the farms farthest from sydney here they found a flock of a hundred sheep the shepherd came to the door of his hut on hearing a noise  you had best lie down and go to sleep for the next hour the leader of the convicts said sharply we dont want to do an old pal any harm and when you wake up in the morning and find the flock some twenty short of course you wont have any idea what has come of them  the man nodded and went back into the hut and shut the door and the convicts started for the interior driving twenty sheep before them  during the first days journey they went fast keeping the sheep at a trot before them and continuing their journey through the heat of the day  i tell you what captain one of the men said when they halted at sunset if we dont get to a water hole we shall have to give up this idea of going and camping in the bush my mouth has been like an oven all day and it is no use getting away from jail to die of thirst out here  there had been similar remarks during the day and the two leaders agreed together that it would be madness to push further and that whatever the risk they would have to return to the settlements unless they could strike water as they were sitting moodily round the fire they were startled by a dozen natives coming forward into the circle of light these held out their hands to say that their intentions were peaceful  dont touch your muskets captain wild exclaimed sharply as some of the men were on the point of jumping to their feet the men are friendly and we may be able to get them to guide us to water  the natives as they came up grinned and rubbed their stomachs to show that they were hungry  i understand the captain said you want a sheep we want water and he held up his hand to his mouth and lifted his elbow as if in the act of drinking  in two or three minutes the natives understood what he wanted and beckoned to the men to follow the tired sheep were got onto their legs again and half a mile away the party arrived at a pool in what in wet weather was the bed of a river a sheep was at once handed over to the natives and when the men had satisfied their thirst another sheep was killed for their own use  after a great deal of trouble the natives were made to understand that the white men wanted one of their party to go with them as a guide and to take them always to water holes and a boy of fifteen was handed over to them in exchange for two more sheep and at daybreak the next morning they started again for the interior feeling much exhilarated by the piece of luck that had befallen them they traveled for four days more and then considering that the soldiers had ceased their pursuit long ago they encamped for ten days enjoying to the utmost their recovered freedom and their immunity from work of any kind then they returned to the neighborhood of the settlements and broke up as their leader proposed into pairs  they had been there but a short time before the depredations committed roused the settlers to band themselves together every horse that could be spared was lent to the military who formed a mounted patrol of forty men while parties of infantry guided by native trackers were constantly on the scent for the convicts  this is just what i expected captain wild said to his lieutenant it was the choice of two evils and i am not sure that the plan we chose was not the worst we might have been quite sure that these fellows would not be able even for a time to give up their old ways if they had confined themselves as we have done to taking a sheep when they wanted it and behaving civilly when they went to one of the houses and begged for a few pounds of flour or tea the settlers would have made no great complaint of us they know what a hard time we have had and you can see that some of the women were really sorry for us and gave us more than we actually asked for but it has not been so with the others they had been breaking into houses stealing every thing they could lay their hands upon and in three or four cases shooting down men on the slightest provocation  the money and watches were no good to them but the brutes could not help stealing them so here we are and the settlement is like a swarm of angry bees and this plan of handing over most of their horses to the military will end in all of us being hunted down if we stay here two were shot yesterday and in another week we shall all either be killed or caught there is nothing for it but to clear out i am against violence not on principle but because in this case it sets peoples backs up but it cannot be helped now we must get a couple of horses to ride and a spare one to carry our swag we must have half a sack of flour and a sheepit is no use taking more than one because the meat wont keepand a good stock of tea and sugar we must get a good supply of powder if we can some bullets and shot we shall have to get our meat by shooting  there is no time to be lost and tonight we had better go to that settlers place nearest the town he has got two of the best horses out hereat least so redgrave that shepherd i was talking to today told meand a well filled store of provisions if he will let us have them without rumpus all well and good if not it will be the worse for him my idea is that we should ride two or three hundred miles along the coast until we get to a river follow it up till we find a tidy place for a camp and stop there for three or four months then come back again and keep ourselves quiet until we find out that a ship is going to sail then we will do a night among the farmhouses and clean them out of their watches and money manage to get on board and hide till we are well out to sea we must get a fresh fit out before we go on board these clothes are neither handsome nor becoming we must put on our best manners and tell them that we are men who have served our full time and want to get back and that we were obliged to hide because we had not enough to pay our full passage money but that we have enough to pay the cost of our grub and are ready to pull at a rope and make ourselves useful in any way if we are lucky we ought to get enough before we start to buy horses and set ourselves up well in business at home  i think that is a very good plan the other agreed and i am quite sure the sooner we make ourselves scarce here the better     chapter vi   while arranging for young bastow being sent out with the first batch of convicts john thorndyke had been introduced to several of the officials of the department and called upon them at intervals to obtain news of the penal colony three years after its establishment a crown colony had been opened for settlement in its vicinity as the climate was said to be very fine and the country fertile and land could be taken up without payment the number who went out was considerable there being the additional attraction that convicts of good character would be allotted to settlers as servants and farm hands  six years after arthur bastow sailed the squire learned that there had been a revolt among the convicts several had been killed and the mutiny suppressed but about a dozen had succeeded in getting away these had committed several robberies and some murders among the settlers and a military force and a party of warders from the prison were scouring the country for them  of course mr thorndyke the official said the governor in his report does not gives us the names of any of those concerned in the matter he simply says that although the mutiny was general it was wholly the work of a small number of the worse class of prisoners by worse class he means the most troublesome and refractory out there the prisoners are not classified according to their original crimes a poacher who has killed a game keeper or a smuggler who has killed a revenue officer may in other respects be a quiet and well conducted man while men sentenced for comparatively minor offenses may give an immense deal of trouble i will however get a letter written to the governor asking him if arthur bastow was among those who took part in the revolt and if so what has become of him  it was more than a year before the reply came and then the governor reported that arthur bastow who was believed to have been the leading spirit of the mutiny was among those who had escaped and had not yet been recaptured it was generally believed that he had been killed by the blacks but of this there was no actual proof  mr bastow was much disturbed when he heard the news suppose he comes back here mr thorndyke  i wont suppose anything of the sort the squire replied i dont say that it would be altogether impossible because now that vessels go from time to time to sydney he might of course be able to hide up in one of them and not come on deck until she was well on her way when in all probability he would be allowed to work his passage and might be put ashore without any information being given to the authorities i have no doubt that among the sailors there would be a good deal of sympathy felt for the convicts no doubt they have a hard time of it and we know that the gangs working on the roads are always ironed still this is very unlikely and the chances are all in favor of his being in hiding in the bush  the shepherds and other hands on the farms are chiefly convicts and would probably give him aid if he required it and there would be no difficulty in getting a sheep now and then for as all reports say one of the chief troubles out there are the wild dogs or dingoes as they are called any loss in that way would readily be put down to them as to money he would have no occasion for it if he wanted it he would get it by robbing the settlers he would know that if he came back here he would run the risk of being seized at once on landing or of being speedily hunted down as an escaped convict i dont think that there is the slightest occasion for us to trouble ourselves about him  but though the squire spoke so confidently he felt by no means sure that arthur bastow would not turn up again for his reckless audacity had made a great impression upon him the proceeds of the robberies in the colony in which he had no doubt played a part would have furnished him with money with which he could bribe a sailor to hide him away and if necessary pay his passage money to england when discovered on board and perhaps maintain him when he got home until he could replenish his purse by some unlawful means lastly the squire argued that the fellows vindictive nature and longing for revenge would act as an incentive to bring him back to london he talked the matter over with mark who was now a powerful young fellow of twenty who of course remembered the incidents attending bastows capture and trial  i cannot help fancying that the fellow will come back mark  well if he does father we must make it our business to lay him by the heels again you managed it last time and if he should turn up you may be sure i will help you to do it again  yes but we may not hear of his having returned until he strikes a blow at any rate see that your pistols are loaded and close at hand at night  they always are father there is no saying when a house like this standing alone and containing a good deal of plate and valuables may be broken into  well you might as well carry them always when you go out after dark i shall speak to knapp and request him to let me know if he hears of a suspicious looking characterany stranger in factbeing noticed in or about the village and i shall have a talk with simeox the head constable at reigate and ask him to do the same he is not the same man who was head at the time bastow was up before us but he was in the force then and as one of the constables who came up to take the prisoners down to reigate he will have all the facts in his mind he is a sharp fellow and though bastow has no doubt changed a good deal since then he would hardly fail to recognize him if his eye fell upon him of course we may be alarming ourselves unnecessarily but there are several reasons why i should object strongly to be shot just at the present time  or at any other time i should say father the young man said with a laugh  i shall know him squire safe enough the head constable replied when john thorndyke went down to see him on the following day but i should think that if he does come back to england he will hardly be fool enough to come down here he was pretty well known in town before that affair and everyone who was in the courthouse would be sure to have his face strongly impressed upon their minds you may forget a man you have seen casually but you dont forget one you have watched closely when he is in the dock with two others charged with murder five out of my six men were constables at that time and would know him again the minute they saw him but anyhow i will tell them to keep a sharp lookout in the tramps quarters and especially over the two or three men still here that bastow used to consort with i should say that reigate is the last place in the world where he would show his face  i hope so the squire said he has caused trouble enough down here as it is his father is getting an old man now and is by no means strong and fresh troubles of that kind would undoubtedly kill him  a month later the reigate coach was stopped when a short distance out of the town by two highwaymen and a considerable prize obtained by the robbers soon afterwards came news of private carriages being stopped on various commons in the south of london and of several burglaries taking place among the houses round clapham wandsworth and putney such events were by no means uncommon but following each other in such quick succession they created a strong feeling of alarm among the inhabitants of the neighborhood john thorndyke going up to town shortly afterwards went to the headquarters of the bow street runners and had a talk with their chief in reference especially to the stoppage of the reigate coach mr chetwynd had lately died and john thorndyke had been unanimously elected by his fellow magistrates as chairman of the bench  no mr thorndyke we have no clew whatever our men have been keeping the sharpest watch over the fellows suspected of having a hand in such matters but they all seem keeping pretty quiet at present and none of them seem to be particularly flush with money it is the same with these burglaries in the south of london we are at our wits end about them we are flooded with letters of complaint from residents but though the patrols on the common have been doubled and every effort made we are as far off as ever as far as the burglaries are concerned we have every reason to think that they are the work of two or three new hands the jobs are not neatly done and certainly not with tools usually used by burglars they seem to rely upon daring rather than skill anyhow we dont know where to look for them and are altogether at sea  of course it is as annoying to us as it is to anyone else more so because the justices of the peace are sending complaints to the home secretary and he in turn drops on us and wants to know what we are doing i have a sort of fancy myself the fellows who are stopping the coaches are the same as those concerned in the burglaries i could not give you my reasons for saying so except that on no occasion has a coach been stopped and a house broken into on the same night i fancy that at present we shant hear much more of them they have created such alarm that the coaches carry with them two men armed with blunderbusses in addition to the guards and i should fancy that every householder sleeps with pistols within reach and has got arms for his servants at many of the large houses i know a watchman has been engaged to sit in the hall all night to ring the alarm bell and wake the inmates directly he hears any suspicious sounds perhaps the fellows may be quiet for a time for they must during the last month have got a wonderful amount of spoil maybe they will go westthe bath road is always a favorite one with these fellowsmaybe they will work the northern side of the town i hope we shall lay hands upon them one day but so far i may say frankly we have not the slightest clew  but they must put their horses up somewhere  yes but unfortunately there are so many small wayside inns that it is next to impossible to trace them a number of these fellows are in alliance with the highwaymen some of them too have small farms in addition to their public house businesses and the horses may be snugly put up there while we are searching the inn stables in vain again there are rogues even among the farmers themselves little men perhaps who do not farm more than thirty or forty acres either working them themselves or by the aid of a hired man who lives perhaps at a village a mile away to a man of this kind the offer of a couple of guineas a week to keep two horses in an empty cowshed and to ask no questions is a heavy temptation  we have got two clever fellows going about the country inquiring at all the villages whether two mounted men have lately been heard going through there late at night or early in the morning so as to narrow down the area to be searched but nothing has come of it although i am pretty sure that they must have three or four places they use in various directions my men have picked up stories of horsemen being heard occasionally but they come from various directions and nowhere have they been noticed with any regularity besides there are other knights of the road about so we are no nearer than we were on that line of inquiry  a month later john thorndyke had occasion to go up again to town this time mark accompanied him both carried pistols as did the groom sitting behind them the squire himself was but a poor shot but mark had practiced a great deal  tis a good thing to be able to shoot straight mark his father had said to him three years before i abhor dueling but there is so much of it at present that any gentlemen might find himself in a position when he must either go out or submit to be considered a coward then too the roads are infested by highwaymen for that reason alone it would be well that a man should be able to shoot straight you should also practice sometimes at night setting up some object at a distance so that you can just make out its outline and taking a dozen shots at it i know it is very difficult when you cannot see your own pistol but you can soon learn to trust to your arm to come up to the right height and in the right direction of course you must wait until morning to find out where your bullet has gone  two days after they had reached town the squire received a letter from mrs cunningham  dear mr thorndyke  knapp has been up this morning to tell me that a stranger dismounted yesterday at the alehouse and while his horse was being fed he asked a few questions among others he wished to be told if you were at home saying that he had known you some fifteen years ago when you lived near hastings and should like to have a talk with you again in fact he had turned off from the main road for the purpose he seemed disappointed when he heard that you had gone up to town and hearing that you might not be back for three or four days said he should be coming back through reigate in a week or ten days and he dared say he should be able to find time to call again knapp did not hear about it until this morning he asked the landlord about the man and the landlord said he was about thirty dark and sparely built he did not notice his horse particularly seeing that it was such as a small squire or farmer might ride he carried a brace of pistols in his holsters the landlord was not prepossessed with his appearance and it was that that made him speak to knapp about him i have told the men to unfasten the dogs every night and i have asked knapp to send up two trustworthy men to keep watch  it may mean something and it may not the squire said as he handed the letter to mark it is a suspicious looking circumstance if the fellow had been honest he would surely have said something about himself there is no doubt these housebreakers generally find out what chance there is of resistance and hearing that we were both away may have decided on making an attempt i have pretty well finished our business and ordered nearly all the provisions that mrs cunningham requires but i have to call at my lawyers and that is generally a longish business it is half past two oclock now if we start from here at five we shall be down soon after eight which will be quite soon enough we shall have a couple of hours drive in the dark but that wont matter we have got the lamps  i am quite ready to start father i am engaged to sup with reginald ascot but i will go over this afternoon and make my excuses  at five oclock they started you have got your pistols in order mark the squire asked as they drove over london bridge  i have them handy father one in each pocket  james are your pistols charged  yes sir  at six oclock it was beginning to get dusk and they stopped while the groom got down and lit the lamps then they resumed their journey they were within five miles of reigate when suddenly two horsemen rode out from a side road with a shout of stand and deliver  the squire lashed the horses and a moment later a pistol was fired and the ball went through his hat by the light of the lamps mark saw the other man raise his hand and leveling his pistol fired on the instant then as there was no reply to his shot he discharged the second barrel at the first who had fired and who had at once drawn another pistol the two reports rang out almost at the same moment but marks was a little the first there was a sharp exclamation of pain from the highwayman who wrenched round his horse and galloped down the lane from which he had issued the groom sending two bullets after him  where is the other man mark exclaimed as his father reined in the horses  somewhere on the ground there mark i saw him fall from his saddle as we passed him  is it any use pursuing the other father i am pretty sure i hit him  i am quite sure you did but it is no good our following the side roads are so cut up by ruts that we should break a spring before we had gone a hundred yards no we will stop and look at this fellow who is unhorsed mark  the groom got down and taking one of the carriage lamps proceeded to a spot where the highwaymans horse was standing the man was already dead the bullet having hit him a few inches above the heart  he is dead father  i think you had better lift him up on the foot board behind james can ride his horse we will hand the body over to the constable at reigate he may know who he is or find something upon him that may afford a clew that will lead to the capture of his companion  no i dont know him squire the constable said as they stopped before his house and told him what had happened however he certainly is dead and i will get one of the men to help me carry him into the shed behind the courthouse so you say that you think that the other is wounded  i am pretty sure he is i heard him give an exclamation as my son fired  that is good shooting mr mark the constable said if every passenger could use his arms as you do there would soon be an end to stopping coaches i will see what he has got about him and will come up and let you know squire the first thing in the morning  i will send knapp down john thorndyke said as they drove homewards i am rather curious to know if this fellow is the same mrs cunningham wrote about i will tell him to take peters along with him  i hardly see that there can be any connection between the two highwaymen dont go in for house breaking i think they consider that to be a lower branch of the profession  generally they do no doubt mark but you know i told you that the chief at bow street said that he had a suspicion that the highway robbers and the house breakers who have been creating so much alarm are the same men  it is curious that they should have happened to light on us father if they were intending to break into our house  john thorndyke made no reply and in a few minutes drove up to the house their return a couple of days before they were expected caused great satisfaction to mrs cunningham and millicent the former however had wisely kept from the girl the matter on which she had written to the squire and the suspicion she had herself entertained  it is very dull without you both millicent said i was telling mrs cunningham that i thought it would be a good thing when you got back for us two to take a run up to town for a week just to let you see how dull the place is when two of us are away you are looking quite serious uncle is anything the matter  happily nothing is the matter with us dear but we have had an adventure and not a very pleasant one  what was it the girl asked  if you examine my hat closely millicent it will tell you  the girl took up the hat from a chair on which he had put it and brought it to the light there are two holes in it she said oh guardy have you been shot at  it looks like it dear two gentlemen highwaymenat least that is what i believe they call themselvesasked us pressingly to stop and as we would not comply with their request one fired at me and as you see it was an uncommonly good shot the other was about to fire when marks pistol put a stop to him and his second barrel stopped the fellow who had fired first he was hit for we heard him give an exclamation of pain but before any more shooting could be done he turned and rode off down a narrow lane where we could not follow  and what became of the first millicent asked with open eyes  he was dead before we could get down to examine him he will not disturb the kings peace again it happened about four miles from home so we brought him in and gave him and his horse into the charge of the constable at reigate  and you have really killed a man millicent said looking up with an awestruck expression to mark  well as the man would have killed us if i hadnt i cannot say millicent that his death weighs in any way heavily on my mind if he were as good a shot as the other my fathers life would not have been worth much for as we were driving fast he was not above half as far away as the other had been when he fired just the same i suppose as it would be in a battle a man is going to shoot you and you shoot him first and i dont suppose it ever troubles you afterwards  of course i dont mean that i blame you mark but it does seem shocking  i dont suppose you would think that millicent if a burglar who had taken one shot at you and was about to finish you with another was cut short in the operation by a shot from my pistol i believe that your relief and thankfulness would be so great that the idea that it was a shocking thing for me to do would not as much as enter your head  i wish you had shot the other man as well as the one you did mark the squire said as he walked with his son down to reigate to attend the inquest the next morning on the man he had brought in mark looked at his father in surprise  there is no doubt i hit him father he said but i should not think that he will be likely to trouble us again  i wish i felt quite sure of that do you know that i have a strong suspicion that it was arthur bastow  mark had of course heard of bastows escape but had attached no great importance to it the crime had taken place nearly eight years before and although greatly impressed at the time by the ill doings of the man the idea that he would ever return and endeavor to avenge himself on his father for the part he had taken had not occurred to him beyond mentioning his escape the squire had never talked to him on the subject  it was he who bade us stand and deliver and the moment he spoke the voice seemed familiar to me and thinking it over i have an impression that it was his i may be mistaken for i have had him in my mind ever since i heard that he had escaped and may therefore have connected the voice with him erroneously and yet i cannot but think that i was right you see there are two or three suspicious circumstances in the first place there was this man down here making inquiries knapp went down early this morning with the innkeeper and told me before breakfast that peters at once recognized the fellow you shot as the man who had made the inquiries now the natural result of making inquiries would have been that the two men would the next evening have broken into the house thinking that during our absence they would meet with no resistance instead of doing this they waylaid us on the road which looks as if it was me they intended to attack and not the house  but how could they have known that it was us father it is certainly singular that one of the two men should have been the fellow who was up at the inn but it may be only a matter of coincidence  i dont know mark i dont say that singular coincidences dont occur but i have not much faith in them still if they were journeying down to attack the house last night they would hardly have stopped travelers by the way when there was a rich booty awaiting them as they evidently believed there was or that man would not have come down specially to make inquiries my own impression is that when they heard that we should return in two or three days one of them watched us in london and as soon as they learned that we were to start for home at five oclock they came down here to stop us they would hardly have done that merely to get our watches and what money we had in our pockets  no i should think not father but they might be friends of men who have got into trouble at reigate and as you are chairman of the bench may have had a special grudge against you for their conviction  that is of course possible and i hope that it is so  but even if arthur bastow had escaped father why should he come back to england where he would know that he might be arrested again instead of staying quietly out in australia  there are two reasons in the first place the life out there would not be a quiet one there would be nothing for him but to attack and rob the settlers and this as they are sure to be armed is a pretty dangerous business then there are perils from the blacks and lastly such a life would be absolutely devoid of comfort and be that of a hunted dog living always in the bush scarcely venturing to sleep lest he should be pounced upon either by the armed constables of the colony or by the blacks it is not as if the country were extensively populated there are not a very large number of settlers there yet and therefore very small scope for robbers these people would keep very little money with them and the amount of plunder to be got would be small indeed therefore i take it that the main object of any escaped convict would be to get away from the place  that is one of the reasons why the fellow might come back to england in spite of the risks the other is that i believe him to be so diabolically vindictive that he would run almost any peril in order to obtain revenge upon me or his father twice he has threatened me the first time when we captured him the second time as he left the court after he had received his sentence i am not a coward so far as i know mark but i am as certain as i stand here that he meant what he said and that during these years of imprisonment and toil out there he has been cherishing the thought of coming home some day and getting even with me you see he is said to have been the leader of this convict revolt there is no doubting his daring and to my mind the attack upon us last night when they knew that they could have managed a successful robbery here points to the fact that it was the result of personal animosity and strengthens my belief that it was arthur bastow who called upon us to stand and deliver  it is a very unpleasant idea father  very unpleasant and it seems to me that we should at any rate spare no pains in hunting the man you wounded down  i will undertake that if you like i have nothing particular to do and it would be an excitement you have a lot to keep you here  i dont fancy that you will find it an excitement mark for of course the detectives will do the hunting but i should certainly be glad if you would take a letter for me to the head of the detective department and tell him what i think and my reasons for thinking so and say that i offer a reward of a hundred pounds for the capture of the man who tried to stop us and who was we are certain wounded by you unless he has some marvelously out of the way hiding place it ought not to be difficult a wounded man could scarcely lie hidden in the slums of london without it being known to a good many people to some of whom a reward of the sum of a hundred pounds would be an irresistible temptation  by this time they had reached reigate the inquest did not last many minutes and the jury without hesitation returned a verdict of justifiable homicide     chapter vii   the next morning mark went up to london  of course mr thorndyke the chief at bow street said your fathers suspicions as to the mans identity may or may not be justified that however makes no difference to us here is a highwayman who has been wounded and would certainly be a valuable capture i will set my men to work at once if he is in london they will get news of him before many days my men in any case would do their duty but your fathers offer will certainly stimulate their energy where are you stopping  at the bull in holborn  very well i will be sure to let you know as soon as we get any clew to the mans identity  mark remained in london a week and at the end of that time he received a note from bow street saying that the superintendent wished to see him  i am sorry that i have no news for you mr thorndyke the officer said when he called upon him every place where such a man would be likely to be in hiding has been searched and no clew whatever has been obtained we shall now circulate notices of the reward throughout the country if the man was at all severely hit we may assume that he must be somewhere in the neighborhood of london whereas if the wound was a slight one he might be able to go a long distance and may be now in york for aught we know however now that the search in london has terminated i can really see no use in your staying here any longer we will let you know directly we have any news  three months later john thorndyke received a letter from the detective office asking him to call the next time he came up to town as although no news had been obtained that would lead to the mans immediate arrest news had at any rate been obtained showing that he was alive it happened that mark was intending to go up on the following day and his father asked him to call for him at bow street  well mr thorndyke we have heard about your man and that after we had quite abandoned the search i had come to the conclusion that the wound you gave him had been a fatal one and that he had been quietly buried by some of the people with whom he was connected the discovery was as half these discoveries generally are the result of accident last week a gentleman entered the bank and asked for change in gold for a fifty pound note the cashier looking at the number found that it was one of those that had been stolen from a passenger by one of the south coaches several months ago the gentleman was at once taken into a private office and questioned as to how he had obtained the note the account that he gave was that he was a surgeon in practice at southampton a gentleman had arrived there on a date which we found to be the day after that on which you were stopped he was well dressed and had the air of a gentleman he had come down by coach and was evidently very ill he told the surgeon that he had been engaged in a duel that the pistols had been discharged simultaneously and that he had killed his man but had himself been severely wounded he said that the person whom he had killed had influential connections and that it would be necessary for him to remain in seclusion for a time and he asked him to take charge of his case as he had ample means of paying him handsomely the surgeon examined the wound and found it to be indeed a serious one and as he thought probably fatal however having no doubt as to the truth of the story he had taken the gentleman in and he remained under his charge until a week before he came up to town  for the first month he had been dangerously ill but he completely recovered the surgeon had no reason whatever for doubting his patient being a gentleman he was fashionably dressed and had evidently changed his clothes after the duel as there were no bloodstains upon them he was however glad when he left as his conversation did not please him from its cynical tone the bank sent to us directly the man presented the note which he stated had been given to him in part payment for his medical services and the board and lodging of the patient the total amount had been 75 pounds and the balance was paid in gold as he was able to give several good references and was identified by three gentlemen he was of course released i have no doubt whatever that the fellow he attended was your man the surgeon said whoever he was he must have been a man of iron resolution to have made such a journey in the state he was  no doubt he must have ridden straight to the place he used as his headquarters where he had his wound roughly bandaged changed his clothes and had ridden in the morning to some point that the coach passed on its way to southampton of course we obtained a minute description from the surgeon of the mans appearance we found that the people at the coach office had no remembrance of there being anyone answering to that description among the persons who traveled by the coach but of course that would not go for much for over three months have elapsed  when the coachman who had driven the down coach that day came up to town we saw him and he remembered perfectly that on or about that day he had picked up a passenger at kingstona gentleman who was in very weak health there were only three inside passengers besides himself and he had to be assisted into the coach the way bill on being turned up showed that an inside passenger had been taken up at kingston i have already sent down men to make inquiries at every village in the district between reigate and kingston and i trust that we shall lay hands on him especially now we have got an accurate description of him while before we were working in the dark in that respect  what is the description sir my father is much interested on that point for as i believe i told you he has a strong suspicion that the fellow is the man who was transported more than eight years ago to australia and who made his escape from the prison there  yes i know at first it appeared to me very improbable but i am bound to say the description tallies very closely with that given of him the surgeon took him to be nearly thirty but after what he has gone through he may well look three or four years older than he is he had light hair rather small gray eyes and a face that would have been good looking had it not been for its supercilious and sneering expression  i can remember him mark said and that answers very closely to him i should say that it is certainly bastow and my father made no mistake when he asserted that he recognized his voice  the officer added a note to the description in his register strongly suspected of being arthur bastow transported for connivance with highwaymen was leader of a mutiny in convict jail of sydney two years and a half ago made his escape  there is no doubt he went on that he is a desperate character no doubt he is the man who has been concerned in most of these robberies in the southern suburbs we must get hold of him if we can and once we do so there will be an end of his travels for the mutiny in prison and escape is a hanging business putting aside the affairs since he got back well sir i hope he will give you and your father no more trouble  i am sure i hope so mark said i suppose that the fellow who was shot was one of the men who escaped with him from the convict prison  that is likely enough two would get home as easily as one and the fact that they were both strangers here would account for the difficulty our men have had in their search for him you see we have had nothing whatever to go on you must not be too sanguine about our catching the man in a short time he is evidently a clever fellow and i think it likely that once he got back he lost no time in getting away from this part of the country and we are more likely to find him in the west or north than we are of laying hands on him here we will send descriptions all over the country and as soon as i hear of a series of crimes anywhere i will send off two of my best men to help the local constables  on his return home mark told his father what he had done  i thought that i could not have been mistaken mark we have got that rascal on our hands again i hope now that they have got a description of him to go by they will not be long before they catch him but the way he escaped after being badly wounded shows that he is full of resources and he may give them some trouble yet if i am not mistaken at any rate i will have a talk with the reigate constable and tell him that there is very little doubt that the man who attacked us was arthur bastow who has as we have heard escaped from botany bay and that he had best tell his men to keep a sharp lookout for him for that owing to his animosity against us for his former capture and conviction it is likely enough that sooner or later he will be in this neighborhood again after his determined attempt at my life when pretending to rob us i shall certainly not feel comfortable until i know that he is under lock and key  i wish guardy you would give up this magistrates business millicent said at dinner i am sure that it is worrying you and i cant see why you should go on with it  it does not worry me as a rule millicent indeed i like the duty besides every landowner of standing ought to take his share in public work there are only two of the magistrates younger than i am and whatever you may think of me i feel myself capable of doing what work there is to do when mark gets a few years older i shall resign and let him take my place on the bench i own though that i should be glad if these highway robberies could be suppressed poaching and the ordinary offenses of drunkenness and assaults are disposed of without any trouble but this stopping of the coaches accompanied occasionally by the shooting of the coachman or guard gives a great deal of trouble and the worst of it is that we are practically powerless to put such crimes down nothing short of patrolling the roads in parties of three or four between sunset and sunrise would put a stop to them and the funds at our disposal would not support such an expenditure  it is a pity that you cannot get up a corps like the yeomanry and call it the mounted constabulary said mark there are at least a dozen fellows i know who would like myself be glad to join it and i dare say we could get a score of young farmers or farmers sons  it is not a bad idea mark and i dare say that for a time the duty would be zealously performed but before very long you would tire of it a few wet nights or winters cold and you would cease to see the fun of it especially as you may be sure that the news that the roads are well patrolled would soon come to the ears of these scoundrels and they would cease to work in the district  perhaps you are right sir but i think that a few of us would stick to it  perhaps so mark but i should be sorry to wager that the work would be thoroughly done the first county or hunt ball or even dinner party more than half of them would be away i dont say that you personally might not for some considerable time persist in patrolling the roads for you have a sort of personal interest in the matter but i would wager that before two months have passed you would find you were the only one who attended at the rendezvous regularly  a fortnight later the party were seated round the fire in the dusk mr bastow was sitting next to the squire and was in unusually good spirits he had heard no word of what the squire had discovered nor dreamed that his son was again in england still less that he was suspected of being one of the men who had endeavored to stop the squire and his son on their drive from london suddenly there was the crack of a pistol outside and a ball passed between him and the squire without a word mark thorndyke rushed to the door seized a pistol from his riding coat and snatching up a heavy whip dashed out into the garden  he was just in time to see a figure running at full speed and he set off in pursuit good runner as he was he gained but slightly at first but after a time he drew nearer to the fugitive the latter was but some sixty yards away when he leaped a hedge into a narrow lane mark followed without hesitation but as he leaped into the road he heard a jeering laugh and the sharp sound of a horses hoofs and knew that the man he was pursuing had gained his horse and made off disgusted at his failure he went slowly back to the house the shutters had been put up  i have lost him father he ran well to begin with but i was gaining fast on him when he leaped into a narrow lane where he had left his horse and rode off before i could get up to him i need hardly say that there was no use attempting to follow on foot he missed you all did he not  yes mark it is not so easy to take an accurate aim when it is nearly dark the bullet passed between myself and mr bastow and has buried itself in the mantelpiece  something ought to be done guardy millicent conyers said indignantly it is shameful that people cannot sit in their own room without the risk of being shot at what can it mean surely no one can have any enmity against you  i hope not my dear john thorndyke said lightly some of the fellows we have sentenced may think that we were rather hard on them but i do not think that any of them would feel it sufficiently to attempt to murder one besides mark says that the fellow had a horse waiting for him and none of our poachers would be likely to be the owner of a horse it may be that the highwayman mark shot at and wounded has come down to give us a fright it is no use worrying about it now in future we will have the shutters closed at sunset it is hardly likely that the thing will be attempted again and marks chase must have shown the fellow that the game is hardly worth the risk  he might have shot you mark you had no right to risk your life in that sort of way the girl said to him later as they were seated together in front of the fire while the squire was reading the gazette at the table mrs cunningham was working and mr bastow who had been greatly shaken by the event had retired to bed  do you think that he really meant to kill your father  i should imagine he did a man would hardly run the risk of being hung merely for the pleasure of shooting i would give a good deal if i had caught him or better still if i had shot him said mark however i will make it my business to hunt the fellow down after this evenings affair we shall never feel comfortable until he is caught i have no doubt that he is the fellow we have been hunting for the last four months the people at bow street seem no good whatever i will try if i cannot succeed better  dont do anything rash mark said millicent in a low voice you have no right to put yourself in danger  but our lives are in danger now millicentin much greater danger than mine would be when looking out for him but there seems no guarding against attacks like this i mean to hunt him down if it takes me a year i have nothing special to do and cannot employ my time more usefully  when the ladies went up to bed the squire said  come into the library mark and we will smoke a pipe and have a talk over this business he touched the bell have you got a good fire in the library ramoo  yes sahib very good  then take a bottle of number one bin of port thereand a couple of glasses  when they were quietly seated glasses filled and the long pipes alight the squire said i want to have a serious talk with you mark what i am going to say will surprise you a good deal i had not intended to tell you for another four yearsthat is to say not until millicent came of agebut after that affair tonight i feel that my life is so uncertain that i ought not to delay letting you know the truth i suppose you agree with me that it was bastow who shot at me this evening  i have not the least doubt about that father  i will not say that he shot at me the squire said for he may have shot at his father the villain is quite capable of that it was his father who brought me upon him and though i effected his capture eight years ago i dont suppose he cares which of us he killed however the point is not what he aimed at but whether it was he and that i take there is no doubt about he missed me this time but his next shot may be more successful at any rate i think that it is high time that i told you the story  and beginning with the arrival of colonel thorndyke at his place he repeated the conversation that he had had with him several times in the early portion of his narrative he was interrupted by exclamations of surprise from his son  then millicent is really my uncles heiress exclaimed mark when he heard the request the colonel had made of the squire  that is so mark she does not know it herself and it was my brothers urgent wish that she should not know it until she came of age or until she married i fought against it to the utmost but it was his dying prayer and i could not refuse it my solicitor knows the facts of the matter and so does mrs cunningham who brought millicent over from india when she was only about a year old i may say that i especially urged that it would not be fair to you to be brought up to consider yourself to be heir to the property but he said  putting aside the estate i have a considerable fortune in the first place there are the accumulations of rent from the reigate place i have never touched them and they have been going on for twelve years in the next place the shaking of the pagoda tree has gone on merrily and we all made a comfortable pile then i always made a point of carrying about with me two or three hundred pounds and after the sacking of some of the palaces i could pick up jewels and things from the troops for a trifle being able to pay money down even without the rents here i have some 50000 pounds in money i should think the jewels would be worth at least as much more irrespective of a diamond bracelet which is i fancy worth more than the rest put together it was stolen from the arm of some idol he then explained how he got it and the manner in which he had placed it and the rest of his wealth in a secure position  things stolen from a god are frightfully dangerous he said for the brahmins or priests connected with the temples have been known to follow them up for years and in nine cases out of ten they get possession of them again murder in such a case is meritorious and i would not have them in the house here were they ten times the value they are i know that my clothes my drawers and everything belonging to me have been gone through at night a score of times nothing has been stolen but being a methodical man i could generally see some displacement in the things that told me they had been disturbed they gave it up for a time but i havent a shadow of a doubt that they have been watching me ever since and they may be watching me now for anything i know now half of that fortune i have left by my will to your son half to the girl i will tell you where the things are the last thing before i die  now mind you must be careful when you get them when i am dead you are almost certain to be watched you dont know what these fellows are the things must remain where they are until your boy comes of age dont let him keep those diamonds an hour in his possession let him pass them away privately to some man in whom he has implicit confidence for him to take them to a jewelers let him double and turn and disguise himself so as to throw everyone that may be spying on him off his track if you can manage it the best way would be to carry them over to amsterdam and sell them there  i confess it seemed absurd but it is a matter about which he would know a great deal more than i do and he was convinced that not only was he watched but that he owed his life simply to the fact that the fellows did not know where the diamonds were hidden and that by killing him they would have lost every chance of regaining them  so convinced was he of all this that he would not tell me where he had stowed them away he seemed to think that the very walls would hear us and that these fellows might be hidden under the sofa in a cupboard or up the chimney for aught i know he told me that he would tell me the secret before he died but death came so suddenly that he never had an opportunity of doing so he made a tremendous effort in his last moment but failed and i shall never forget the anguish his face expressed when he found himself powerless to speak however he pressed his snuffbox into my hand with such a significant look that being certain it contained some clew to the mystery and being unable to find a hidden spring or a receptacle i broke it open that night  it contained a false bottom and here are what i found in it i stowed them away in a secret drawer in that old cabinet that stands by my bedside it is in the bottom pigeonhole on the right hand side i bought the cabinet at a sale and found the spring of the secret drawer quite accidentally i shall put the things back tonight and you will know where to look for them you press against the bottom and up against the top simultaneously and the back then falls forward the opening behind is very shallow and will hold but two or three letters but however it sufficed for this and he handed mark the coin and slip of paper  but what are these father  these are the clews by which we are to obtain the treasure  as mark examined them carefully the squire stood up with his back to the fire and looking round walked to the door and said i thought there was a draught somewhere either ramoo did not shut the door when he went out or it has come open again it has done that once or twice before when i go into town tomorrow i will tell tucker to send a man up to take the lock off well what do you make out of that  i can make out nothing mark replied no doubt the coin is something to be given to whoever is in charge of the treasure and masulipatam may be the place where it is hidden  yes or it may be a password it reminds one of the forty thieves business you go and knock at the door of a cave a figure armed to the teeth presents itself you whisper in his ear masulipatam he replies madras or calcutta or something of that sort you take out the coin and show it to him he takes out from some hidden repository a similar one compares the two and then leads you to an inner cave piled up with jewels  mark laughed  well it is no laughing matter mark the squire went on seriously the little comedy may not be played just as i have sketched it but i expect that it is something of the kind that coin has to be shown and the word masulipatam spoken to the guardian whoever he may be of your uncles treasure but who that guardian may be or how he is to be found is a mystery i myself have never tried to solve it there was nothing whatever to go upon the things may be in england or it may be anywhere in india to me it looked an absolutely hopeless business to set about i did not see how even a first step was to be taken and as i had this estate and you and millicent to look after and was no longer a young man i put the matter aside altogether you are young you have plenty of energy and you have your life before you and it is a matter of the greatest interest to you  possiblyvery improbably mind still possiblywhen millicent comes of age and learns who she is mrs cunningham may be able to help you i have no idea whether it is so i have never spoken to her about this treasure of georges but it is just possible that while he was in town before he came down to me he may have given her some instructions concerning it of course he intended to give me full particulars but he could hardly have avoided seeing that in the event of my death perhaps suddenly before the time came for seeking the treasure the secret would be lost altogether whether he has told her or his lawyer or not i cannot say but i have all along clung to the hope that he took some such natural precaution unless that treasure is discovered the only thing that will come to you is the half of the accumulated rents of this estate during the ten years between my fathers death and georges these rents were paid to our solicitors and by them invested  the rentals amount to about 2500 pounds a year and of course there is interest to be added so that i suppose there is now some 25000 pounds for i had out 2000 pounds when i came here to set matters straight i had a great fight with the lawyers over it but as i pointed out they had failed altogether to see that the agent did his duty and that at least a couple of hundred a year ought to be expended in necessary repairs i had a right to at least that sum to carry out the work that ought to be done from year to year in addition to that sum i laid out about 1000 pounds a year for the first three years i was here so that practically 5000 pounds was expended in rebuilding the village and doing repairs on the homesteads that however is not the point now altogether then there is some 25000 pounds to be divided between you and millicent when she becomes mistress of this property  according to the terms of my brothers will i am still to remain here until she marries when she does so i shall of course go back to my own little place the income of that has been accumulating while i have been here my only expenses having been for clothes i have taken nothing out of this estate since i came here and each year have paid to the solicitors all balances remaining after discharging the household expenses these balances averaging 700 or 800 pounds a year of course the income was absolutely left to me during the time i remained ostensible owner but i had no wish to make money out of a trust that i assumed greatly against my will that money is millicents of course the house had to be kept up in proper style whether i were here or not had she at once come into possession there must have been horses and carriages and so on i dont say that i have not had all the expenses of our living saved that i had no objection to but i was determined at least not to take a penny put of the estate beyond those expenses you see mark you will have your 12500 pounds anyhow as soon as millicent comes of agenot a bad little sumso that even if you never hear anything more of this mysterious treasure you will not be penniless or in anyway dependent upon me at my death of course you will come into the sussex place with what savings there may be  i am sure i have no reason to grumble father mark said heartily of course it came upon me at first as a surprise that millicent was the heiress here and it flashed through my mind for the moment that the best thing would be to take a commission in the army or to follow my uncles example and get a cadetship in the companys service i have no doubt that i should have enjoyed life either way quite as much or possibly more than if i had gone on a good many years as heir to these estates and afterwards as squire of course now i shall make it my business to see if it is possible to obtain some sort of clew to this treasure and then follow it up but the first thing to which i shall give my mind will be to hunt down bastow we shall never feel safe here as long as that fellow is alive and that will be the first thing i shall devote myself to after that i shall see about the treasure  as to that mark i cannot impress upon you too strongly what your uncle said it may of course be a pure delusion on his part but if he is right and some of these hindoo fellows are still on the watch to obtain that bracelet you must use extraordinary precautions when you get it into your hands he advised me to take it across to amsterdam and either get the stones recut or to sell them separately to different diamond merchants there he said that my life would not be worth an hours purchase as long as the stones were in my hands  that rather looks father as if the things were somewhere in england had they been in india you would have had them some months in your hands before you could get them to amsterdam  i did not think of that before mark and it is possible that you are right but i dont know he might have thought that it would be impossible for me to dispose of them at madras or calcutta and may have assumed that i should at once deposit them in a bank to be forwarded with other treasure to england or that i should get them packed away in the treasure safe in the ship i came back by and that i should not really have them on my person till i landed in england or until i took them from the bank still i see that your supposition is the most likely and that they may all this time have been lying somewhere in london until i should present myself with a gold coin and the word masulipatam  suddenly mark sprang to his feet and pulled back the curtains across a window threw it up and leaped into the garden and there stood listening for two or three minutes with his pistol cocked in his hand he stepped for a moment into the room again  you had better put that light out father or we may have another shot  did you hear anything mark  i thought i did father i may have been mistaken but i certainly thought i heard a noise and when i pulled the curtains aside the window was not shut by three or four inches i will have a look through the shrubbery that fellow may have come back again pull the curtains to after me  i will go with you mark  i would rather you didnt father it would only make me nervous i shant go into the shrubbery and give them a chance of getting first shot i shall hide up somewhere and listen it is a still night and if there is anyone moving i am pretty sure to hear him  the squire turned down the lamp drew the curtains and seated himself by the fire it was three quarters of an hour before mark returned he shut the window and fastened it carefully  i fancy you must have been mistaken mark  i suppose that shot through the window has made me nervous i certainly did fancy i heard a noise there it may have been a dead bough snapping or something of that sort and of course the window being partly open even though only three or four inches any little noise would come in more plainly than it otherwise would do however everything has been perfectly quiet since i went out and it is hardly likely indeed that the fellow would have returned so soon after the hot chase i gave him  it is very stupidthe window being left open the squire said i shall question martha about it in the morning it was her duty to see that it was shut and fastened before drawing the curtains just at present one can scarcely be too careful i dont mean to deny that whether there was a window open or not a burglar who wanted to get into the house could do so still there is no use in making their work more easy for them i know as a rule we are careless about such things there has not been a burglary in this part for years and until lately the front door has never been locked at night and anyone could have walked in who wanted to of course the servants dont know that there is any reason for being more careful at present than usual  i was thinking the other day of having shutters put to all these downstair rooms some of them have got them and some have not still even with shutters burglars can always get in if they want to do so they have only to cut round the lock of a door or to make a hole in a panel to give them room to put an arm through and draw back a bolt and the thing is done i know that all the silver is locked up every night in the safe for ramoo sees to that and i have never known him neglect anything under his charge well mark i dont know that it is any use sitting up longer we have plenty of time to talk the matter over it is four years yet before millicent comes of age though of course there is nothing to prevent your setting out in quest of the treasure as soon as you like still there is no hurry about it  none whatever father but i dont mean to lose a day before i try to get on the track of that villain bastow     chapter viii   mark was some hours before he went to sleep the news that he had heard that evening was strange and startling full of health and strength the fact that he was not as he had always supposed the heir to the estate troubled him not at all the fact that in four years he would come in for some twelve thousand pounds was sufficient to prevent his feeling any uneasiness as to his future and indeed in some respects it was not an unpleasant idea that instead of being tied down to the estate he should be able to wander at will visit foreign countries and make his own life  in one respect he was sorry his father had in the last year hinted more than once that it would be a very nice arrangement if he were to make up a match with his ward he had laughed and said that there would be plenty of time for that yet but the idea had been an agreeable one he was very fond of millicentfond perhaps in a cousinly way at present but at any rate he liked her far better than any of the sisters of his friends of course she was only seventeen yet and there was plenty of time to think of marriage in another three years still the thought occurred to him several times that she was budding out into a young woman and every month added to her attractions it was but the day before he had said to himself that there was no reason to wait as long as three years especially as his father seemed anxious and would evidently be glad were the match to take place now of course he said to himself that was at an end he had never given her any reason to suppose that he cared for her and now that she was the heiress and he comparatively poor she would naturally think that it was for the estate and not for herself that she was wooed then there was the question of this curiously lost treasure with the mysterious clew that led to nothing how on earth was he to set about the quest he puzzled for a long time over this till at last he fell asleep he was roused by ramoo entering the room  what is it ramoo  me not know sahib massa thorndykes door shut me no able to make him hear  that is curious ramoo mark said jumping hastily out of bed i will be with you in a minute  he slipped on his trousers coat and slippers and then accompanied ramoo to his fathers door he knocked again and again and each time more loudly his face growing paler as he did so then he threw himself against the door but it was solid and heavy  fetch me an ax ramoo he said there is something wrong here  ramoo returned in a short time with two men servants and with the ax in his hands mark took it and with a few mighty blows split the woodwork and then hurling himself against the door it yielded as he entered the room a cry broke from his lips within a pace or two of the bed the squire lay on the ground on his face and a deep stain on the carpet at once showed that his death had been a violent one mark knelt by his side now and touched him the body was stiff and cold the squire must have been dead for some hours  murdered he said in a low voice my father has been murdered  he remained in horror struck silence for a minute or two then he slowly rose to his feet  let us lay him on the bed he said and with the assistance of the three men he lifted and laid him there  he has been stabbed he murmured pointing to a small cut in the middle of the deep stain just over the heart  ramoo after helping to lift the squire onto the bed had slid down to the floor and crouched there sobbing convulsively the two servants stood helpless and aghast mark looked round the room the window was open he walked to it a garden ladder stood outside showing how the assassin had obtained entrance mark stood rigid and silent his hands tightly clenched his breath coming slowly and heavily at last he roused himself  leave things just as they are he said to the men in a tone of unnatural calmness and fasten the door up again and turn a table or something of that sort against it on the outside so that no one can come in john do you tell one of the grooms to saddle a horse and ride down into the town let him tell the head constable to come up at once and also dr holloway then he is to go on to sir charles harris tell him what has happened and beg him to ride over at once  come ramoo he said in a softer voice you can do no good here poor fellow and the room must be closed it is a heavy loss to you too  the hindoo rose slowly the tears streaming down his face  he was a good master he said and i loved him just as i loved the colonel sahib ramoo would have given his life for him  with his hand upon ramoos shoulder mark left the room he passed a group of women huddled together with blanched faces at a short distance down the passage the news that the squires door could not be opened and the sounds made by its being broken in having called them together mark could not speak he silently shook his head and passed on as he reached his room he heard shrieks and cries behind him as the men informed them of what had taken place on reaching his door the one opposite opened and mrs cunningham in a dressing gown came out  what is the matter mark and what are these cries about  a dreadful thing has happened mrs cunningham my father has been murdered in the night please tell millicent  then he closed the door behind him threw himself on his bed and burst into a passion of tears the squire had been a good father to him and had made him his friend and companiona treatment rare indeed at a time when few sons would think of sitting down in their fathers presence until told to do so since he had left school eight years before they had been very much together for the last two or three years mark had been a good deal out but in this his father had encouraged him  i like to see you make your own friends mark and go your own way he used to say it is as bad for a lad to be tied to his fathers coattail as at his mothers apron string get fresh ideas and form your own opinions it will do for you what a public school would have done make you self reliant and independent  still of course a great portion of his time had been with his father and they often would ride round the estate together and talk to the tenants or walk in the gardens and forcing houses generally mark would be driven by his father to the meet if it took place within reasonable distance his horse being sent on beforehand by a groom while of an evening they would sit in the library smoke their long pipes and talk over politics or the american and french wars  all this was over there was but one thing now that he could do for his father and that was to revenge his death and at the thought he rose from his bed impatiently and paced up and down the room he must wait for a week wait till the funeral was over and then he would be on bastows track if all other plans failed he would spend his time in coaches until at last the villain should try to stop one but there must be other ways could he find no other he would apply for employment as a bow street runner serve for a year to find out their methods and acquaint himself with the places where criminals were harbored it would be the one object of his life until he succeeded in laying his hand on bastows shoulder he would not shoot him if he could help it he should prefer to see him in the dock to hear the sentence passed on him and to see it carried out as to the treasure it was not worth a thought till his first duty was discharged  presently a servant brought him a cup of tea he drank it mechanically and then proceeded to dress himself sir charles harris would be here soon and the others indeed he had scarcely finished when he was told that the doctor from reigate had just arrived and that the constable had come up half an hour before he at once went down to the library into which the doctor had been shown  you have heard what has happened he said as he shook hands silently i expect sir charles harris here in half an hour i suppose you will not go up till then  no i think it will be best that no one should go in until he comes i have been speaking to simeox he was going in but i told him i thought it was better to wait i may as well take the opportunity of going upstairs to see mr bastow i hear that he fainted when he heard the news and that he is completely prostrate  two such shocks might well prove fatal to him mark said he has been weak and ailing for some time  two shocks the doctor repeated interrogatively  ah i forgot you had not heard about the affair yesterday evening a man fired at us through the window when we were sitting round the fire before the candles were lit the ball passed between my fathers head and mr bastows both had a narrow escape the bullet is imbedded in the mantelpiece i will have it cut out it may be a useful item of evidence some day  but what could have been the mans motive your father was universally popular  except with ill doers mark said i ran out and chased the fellow for half a mile and should have caught him if he had not had a horse waiting for him in a lane and he got off by the skin of his teeth i hope that next time i meet him he will not be so lucky mr bastow was very much shaken and went to bed soon afterwards i am not surprised that this second shock should be too much for him will you go up and see him i will speak to simeox  the constable was out in the garden  this is a terrible business mr thorndyke i suppose after what you told me you have your suspicions  they are not suspicions at allthey are certainties did you hear that he tried to shoot my father yesterday evening  no sir i have heard nothing about it  mark repeated the story of the attempt and pursuit  could you swear to him mr thorndyke  no there was not much light left besides as i have not seen him for the last eight years i should certainly not be able to recognize him unless i had time to have a good look at him had it only been last nights affair it might have been anyone but the shooting through the window was not the act of a thief but of an assassin who could only have been influenced by private enmity i quite see that at present i have no legal evidence against bastow i am not even in a position to prove that he is in the country for it cannot be said that my fathers belief that he recognized the voice of the man who said stand and deliver is proof i doubt if anyone could swear that when he only heard three words he was absolutely sure that it was the voice of a man he had not seen for some years however fortunately that will make no difference the man is as i told you wanted for his heading the mutiny in the convict prison at sydney which will be quite sufficient to hang him without this business but i own that i should prefer that he were hung for my fathers murder if we could secure sufficient evidence moreover there is the attack upon us three or four months ago and with the evidence of the surgeon who attended him as to his wound that would be enough to hang him but we have first got to catch him and that i mean to make my business however long the search may take me  was anything taken last night sir  i dont know i did not look we shall see to that when we go upstairs we may as well go indoors now sir charles may be here in a few minutes and i want to hear dr holloways report as to mr bastow  he does not suspect i hope sir  no thank god my father never mentioned to him anything he heard about his son or his suspicions therefore he has no reason to believe that the fellow is not still in the convict prison at sydney we shall keep it from him now whatever happens but it would for his sake be best that this shock should prove too much for him he has had a very hard time of it altogether  he is terribly prostrate the doctor reported when mark joined him i dont think that he will get over it he is scarcely conscious now you see he is an old man and has no reserve of strength to fall back upon your father has been such a good friend to him that it is not surprising the news should have been too much for him i examined him at the squires request some months ago as to his hearts action which was so weak that i told the squire then that he might go off at any time and i rather wonder that he recovered even temporarily from the shock  in a few minutes sir charles harris drove up  this is terrible news my dear mark he said as he leaped from his gig and wrung marks handterrible i dont know when i have had such a shock he was a noble fellow in all respects a warm friend an excellent magistrate a kind landlord good all round i can scarcely believe it yet a burglar of course i suppose he entered the house for the purpose of robbery when your father awoke and jumped out of bed there was a tussle and the scoundrel killed him at least that is what i gather from the story that the groom told me  that is near it sir charles but i firmly believe that robbery was not the object but murder for murder was attempted yesterday evening and he informed the magistrate of the shot fired through the window  bless me you dont say so the magistrate exclaimed that alters the case altogether and certainly would seem to make the act one of premeditated murder and yet surely the squire could not have had an enemy some of the men whom we have sentenced may have felt a grudge against him but surely not sufficient to lead them to a crime like this  i will talk of it with you afterwards sir charles i have the very strongest suspicions although no absolute proofs now will you first come upstairs doctor holloway is here and simeox but no one has entered the room since i left it i thought it better that it should be left undisturbed until you came  quite so we will go up at once  an examination of the room showed nothing whatever that would afford the slightest clew the squires watch was still in the watch pocket at the head of the bed his purse was on a small table beside him apparently nothing had been touched in the room  if robbery was the object sir charles said gravely it has evidently not been carried out and it is probable that mr thorndyke was partly woke by the opening of the window and that he was not thoroughly aroused until the man was close to his bed then he leapt out and seized him probably the stab was as dr holloway assures us instantly fatal and he may have fallen so heavily that the man fearing that the house would be alarmed at the sound at once fled without even waiting to snatch up the purse the whole thing is so clear that it is scarcely necessary to ask any further questions of course there must be an inquest tomorrow i should like when i go down to ask the gardener where he left the ladder yesterday have you examined the ground for footmarks  yes sir charles but you see it was a pretty hard frost last night and i cannot find any marks at all the ground must have been like iron about the time when the ladder was placed there  the gardener on being called in said that the ladder was always hung up outside the shed at the back of the house there was a chain round it and he had found that morning that one of the links had been filed through  the squire was most particular about its being locked as mr mark knows so that it could not be used by any ill disposed chaps who might come along at night the key of the padlock was always hung on a nail round the other side of the shed the squire knew of it and so did mr mark and me so that while it was out of the way of the eyes of a thief any of us could run and get it and undo the padlock in a minute in case of fire or anything of that sort i have not used the ladder maybe for a fortnight but i know that it was hanging in its place yesterday afternoon  i expect the fellow was prowling about here for some time mark said i was chatting with my father in the library when i thought i heard a noise and i threw open the window which had by some carelessness been left a little open and went out and listened for nearly an hour but i could hear nothing and put it down to the fact that i was nervous owing to what had happened early in the evening and that the noise was simply fancy or that the frost had caused a dry branch of one of the shrubs to crack  how was it you did not notice the window was open as you went in  the curtains were drawn sir i glanced at that when i went into the room with my father after being shot at once from outside it was possible that we might be again though i own that i did not for a moment think that the fellow would return after the hot chase that i gave him i suppose after i went in he looked about and found the ladder it is likely enough that he would have had a file with him in case he had any bars to cut through to get into the house but to my mind it is more likely that he knew where to find the ladder without any looking for it it has hung there as long as i can remember  yes sir the gardener said i have worked for the squire ever since he came here and the ladder was bought a week or two after he took me on and the squire settled where it should be hung so that it might be handy either in case of fire or if wanted for a painting job this aint the first ladder we got a new one four years ago  it is singular that the man should have known which was the window of your fathers room  very singular mark said  shortly after the doctor left and mark had a long talk with the magistrate in the library and told him his reasons for suspecting that the murderer was arthur bastow  it certainly looks like it the magistrate said thoughtfully after he had heard marks story though of course it is only a case of strong suspicion and not of legal proof your fathers recognition of the voice could have scarcely been accepted as final when he heard but three words still the whole thing hangs together the fellow was i should say capable of anything i dont know that i ever had a prisoner before me whose demeanor was so offensive and insolent and if it can be proved that bastow is in england i should certainly accept your view of the case he would probably have known both where the ladder was to be found and which was the window of your fathers bedroom  i should certainly think that he would know it sir the bedroom was the same that my grandfather used to sleep in and probably during the years before we came here young bastow would have often been over the house the first year or two after we came he was often up here with his father but i know that my father took such an objection to him his manner and language were so offensive that he would not have me boy as i wasi was only about eleven when he came hereassociate with him in the smallest degree but during those two years he may very well have noticed where the ladder was  do you intend to say anything about all this tomorrow at the inquest mark  i dont think i shall do so mark said moodily i am certain of it myself but i dont think any man would convict him without stronger evidence than i could give however that business in australia will be sufficient to hang him  i think you are right mark of course if you do light upon any evidence we can bring this matter up in another court if not there will be no occasion for you to appear in it at all but leave it altogether for the authorities to prove the sydney case against him it will only be necessary for the constables who got up the other case against him to prove his sentence and for the reports of the governor of the jail to be read there will be no getting over that and he will be hung as a matter of course it will be a terrible thing for his unhappy father  i do not think that he is likely to come to know it sir the shock of the affair yesterday and that of this morning have completely prostrated him and dr holloway who was up with him before you arrived thinks that there is very little chance of his recovery  when the magistrate had left mark sent a request to mrs cunningham that she would come down for a few minutes she joined him in the drawing room  thank you for coming down he said quietly i wanted to ask how you were and how millicent is  she is terribly upset you see the squire was the only father she had ever known and had he been really so he could not have been kinder it is a grievous loss to me also after ten years of happiness here but i have had but little time to think of my own loss yet i have been too occupied in soothing the poor girl how are you feeling yourself mark  i dont understand myself he said i dont think that anyone could have loved his father better than i have done but since i broke down when i first went to my room i seem to have no inclination to give way to sorrow i feel frozen up my voice does not sound to me as if it were my own i am able to discuss matters as calmly as if i were speaking of a stranger the one thing that i feel passionately anxious about is to set out on the track of the assassin  there is nothing unusual in your state of feeling mark such a thing as this is like a wound in battle the shock is so great that for a time it numbs all pain i have heard my husband say that a soldier who has had his arm carried off by a cannon ball will fall from the shock and when he recovers consciousness will be ignorant where he has been hit it is so with you probably the sense of pain and loss will increase every day as you take it in more and more as for what you say about the murderer it will undoubtedly be a good thing for you to have something to employ your thoughts and engage all your faculties as soon as this is all over is there anything that i can do  no thank you the inquest will be held tomorrow i have sent down to chatterton to come up this afternoon to make the necessary preparations for the funeral let me see today is wednesday is it not i seem to have lost all account of the time  yes wednesday  then i suppose the funeral will be on monday or tuesday if there is any message that you want sent down to the town one of the grooms will carry it whenever you wish  thank you tis not worth sending particularly any time will do but i shall want to send a note to mrs wilson presently asking her to come up the first thing tomorrow morning  he can take it whenever you like mrs cunningham i have nothing to send down for as far as i know i suppose you have heard that the doctor thinks very badly of mr bastow  yes ramoo is sitting with him now  then i think if you will write your note at once mrs cunningham i will send one down to dr holloway asking him to send an experienced nurse he said he should call again this afternoon but the sooner a nurse comes the better  that afternoon mark wrote a letter to the family solicitors telling them of what had taken place and stating that the funeral would be on the following tuesday and asking them to send down a clerk with his fathers will or if one of the partners could manage to come down he should greatly prefer it in view of the explanations that would be necessary he had already sent off a letter to the head of the detective department asking him to send down one of his best men as soon as possible then he went out into the garden and walked backwards and forwards for about two hours and then returned to what he thought would be a solitary meal mrs cunningham however came down she had thoughtfully had the large dining table pushed on one side and a small one placed near the fire  i thought it would be more comfortable she said as there are only our two selves just to sit here  he thanked her with a look it was a nice little dinner and mark to his surprise ate it with an appetite except the cup of tea that he had taken in the morning and a glass of wine at midday he had touched nothing mrs cunningham was a woman of great tact and by making him talk of the steps that he intended to take to hunt down the assassin kept him from thinking  thank you very much mrs cunningham he said when the dinner was over i feel very much better  i have brought down my work she said and will sit here while you drink your wine and smoke a pipe millicent has gone to bed completely worn out and it will be pleasanter for us both to sit here than to be alone  mark gladly agreed to the proposal she turned the conversation now to india and talked of her life there  i was not out there very long she said i was engaged to my husband when he first went out and six years afterwards joined him there and we were married your uncle who was a major of his regiment gave me away my husband got his company six months afterwards and was killed three years later my pension as his widow was not a large one and when your uncle offered me the charge of his daughter i was very glad to accept it he gave some idea of his plans for her i thought they were very foolish but when i saw that his mind was thoroughly made up i did not attempt to dissuade him he said that when he came home to england and he had no idea when that would be he should have me here as head of his establishment and it would be given out that the child was his ward i hoped that he would alter his mind later on but as you know he never did  well of course she will have to be told now mark said  do you think so it seems to me that it were better that she would go as she is at any rate until she is twentyone  that would be quite impossible mark said decidedly how could i assume the position of master here and even if i could it would be a strange thing indeed for me to be here with a girl the age of my cousin even with you as chaperon you must see yourself that it would be quite impossible  but how could she live here by herself  i dont think she could live here by herself mark said especially after what has happened of course it has all got to be talked over but my idea is that the place had better be shut up and that you should take in your own name a house in london i suppose she will want masters for the harp and so on for a time at any rate that would be the best plan unless you would prefer some other place to london we have done our best to carry out my uncles wishes but circumstances have been too strong for us and it cannot be kept up any longer but there is no reason if you and she prefer it why she should not be known until you return here by her present name of course the affair will create a great deal of talk down here but in london no one will know that millicent is an heiress though it is hardly likely that you will make many acquaintances for a time  have you known it long mark i thought that you were kept in ignorance of it  i only heard it yesterday evening mrs cunningham after that shot through the window my father thought i ought to know all about it for the attempt might be repeated more successfully he told me all about her and about the treasure  what treasure mrs cunningham said i dont know what you mean  he then told her of the story his uncle had related and how he had been prevented from giving full instructions for its discovery the only clew being a gold coin and the word masulipatam and that this treasure had been left equally divided between him and millicent by his will  he told me that he should provide for you mrs cunningham remarked when i said that it would be unfair that you should be brought up believing yourself the heir i never heard any more about it but i am glad that it is so  i fancy the chance of its coming to either of us is very small mark said a coin and a word are not much to go upon i have not the most remote idea what they mean and whether the treasure is in england or in india heaven only knows  possibly when he made the will he may have told the solicitors where it was and instructed them to keep it secret until the time that millicent came into possession of the estate  it is just possible he did so mrs cunningham but the efforts he made to speak at the last moment would almost seem to show that he had not told them for if he had the matter would have been of no vital importance one way or the other will millicent be well enough to come down in the morning  i hope so  i hope so too but at any rate keep her up in her room till the afternoon the inquest will be at eleven oclock and it is better that she should not come down until everyone has gone away     chapter ix   directly after breakfast was over the next morning the rector came in  i would not come in yesterday mark he said i knew that you would be best alone and indeed i was myself so terribly upset by the news that i did not feel equal to it i need not say how deeply i and my wife sympathize with you never did a kinder heart beat than your fathers never have i seen people so universally grieved as they are in the village i doubt whether a man went to work yesterday and as for the women had it been a father they had lost they could not be more affected  yes he will be greatly missed mark said unsteadily and between ourselvesbut this must go no furtheri have a suspicion amounting almost to a certainty that the hand that dealt this blow is the same that caused the vacancy that brought you here  do you mean arthur bastow mr greg said in amazement why i thought that he was transported for fifteen years  then mark told the rector the inner history of the past six months and of the report they had had from the officer at bow street of the personal appearance of the wounded man  other things are in favor of it he went on my fathers watch and purse were untouched and a stranger on a dark night would be hardly likely to have discovered the ladder or to have had a file in his pocket with which to cut through a link though this might have been part of the apparatus of any burglar then again an ordinary man would hardly have known which was my fathers bedroom except indeed that he saw the light there after those in the ladies rooms were extinguished but at any rate he could not have told which was my fathers and which was mine but all this is as i said mr greg quite between ourselves i had a long talk yesterday with sir charles harris and as he said there is no legal proof whatever strong as the suspicion is so i am going to say nothing on the subject at the inquest the scoundrels poor father is dying happily in ignorance of all this dr holloway was up with him all night and told me this morning before he drove off that it is very unlikely that he will get through the day  it is all very terrible mark but i cannot deny that everything points to the man surely no one else could have cut short so useful a life for certainly no ordinary degree of hatred would drive a man however brutal his nature to commit such a crime and to run the risk of hanging for it let us take a brisk walk in the garden for an hourthat will be the best thing for you i will stop with you until the inquest is over and then you had better come over and have lunch with us  thank you i cannot do so mark said though i should like to in the first place millicent will come downstairs this afternoon and i should like to be in to meet her had it not been for that i might have come as i can walk across the fields to the rectory without passing through the village there is another reason i sent up yesterday by the coach a letter to be delivered at once by hand and i expect a detective down here by one oclock i dont know that he will do any good but at the same time it will give me something to do and at present there is nothing i dread so much as sitting alone fortunately yesterday evening millicent went to bed at five oclock and mrs cunningham sat with me all the evening and her talk did me a great deal of good  the inquest occupied a very short time the only point on which many questions were asked being as to the firing through the window mark stated that it was already so dark that although he was within fifty yards of the man when he mounted and rode off he could not give any very distinct description of his figure it struck him as being that of a man of medium height  you have made out that the bullet was intended for pour father  i cannot say that sir it went between his head and that of mr bastow but it might have been meant for either  was your father impressed with the idea that it was an attempt to murder him  he naturally thought so mr bastow can assuredly have no enemies while my father as a magistrate may have made some he certainly thought it was an attempt to murder him and was so impressed by the fact that when we went to the library later on he went into certain family matters with me that he had never communicated before and which had it not been for this he would not have entered into for some years to come  he had his opinion then as to who was his assailant  he had sir but as it was but an opinion although there were several facts that seemed to justify the conviction there was no proof whatever and therefore i do not think myself justified in saying what that opinion was  do you entertain the same opinion yourself  i do mark said emphatically but until i can obtain some evidence in support of what is really but a matter of opinion and because were i to give the name it would lessen my chance of obtaining such evidence i decline to mention the name  you have no doubt that the author of the second attempt is the same as that of the first  personally i have no doubt whatever it stands to reason that it is barely possible that two men could have unknown to each other made up their minds to murder my father on the same evening  the constables evidence added nothing to that given by mark he had been down to the lane where the man pursued had mounted the reins of the horse had apparently been thrown over a gatepost and he thought it had been standing there for some little time for there were marks where it had scraped the ground repeatedly he had followed the marks of its hoofs for some distance it had gone at a gallop for about half a mile and then the pace had slackened into a trot it continued until the lane fell into the main road but beyond this he had been unable to distinguish it from the marks of the traffic in general  you found no footprints whatever near the foot of the ladder or anywhere else round the house  none whatever sir  there were no signs of any other window or door save that of mr thorndykes room being attempted  none at all sir  there was but a short consultation between the jurors who at once returned a verdict of willful murder by some person or persons unknown  dr holloway had after giving evidence returned at once to mr bastows room the only point of importance in his evidence was the statement that the wound must have been fatal at once the heart itself having been penetrated it had been inflicted by a dagger or a narrow bladed knife  do you mean that it was an unusually small dagger dr holloway  i should say it was a very fine dagger not the sort of weapon that you would expect to find a highwayman carry if he carried one at all but rather a weapon of spanish or italian manufacture  not the sort of wound that a rapier would make  yes the wound itself might have been very well made by a light rapier but there was a slight bruise on the flesh on each side of the wound such a mark as might be made by the handle or guard of a dagger and sufficiently plain to leave no doubt in my mind that it was so made  had the wound a downward course or was it a straight thrust  a straight thrust the doctor replied my idea is that the two men were grappling together and that as mr thorndyke was a very powerful man his assailant who probably was approaching the bed with the dagger in his hand plunged it into him had he struck at him i should certainly have expected the course of the wound to be downward as i fancy a man very seldom thrusts straight with a dagger as he would do with a rapier  when the inquest was over mark going out into the hall found the doctor waiting there for him  mr bastow breathed his last some ten minutes ago i saw when i went up to him just before i gave my evidence that it was likely that he would die before i returned to the room  i am very sorry mark said although i expected nothing else from what you told me he was a very kind hearted man no one could have had a kinder or more patient tutor than he was to me while my father regarded him as a very dear and valued friend i am expecting the undertaker here in a few minutes and they can both be buried at the same time  it was late in the afternoon before millicent came down with mrs cunningham the news of mr bastows death had set her tears flowing afresh she had been very fond of him and that he and the squire should have been taken at once seemed almost beyond belief she had however nerved herself to some degree of composure before she went down to meet mark but although she returned the pressure of his hand she was unable for some time to speak mrs cunningham thought it best to speak first on the minor grief  so mr bastow has gone mark  yes dr holloway thought very badly of him yesterday and said that he had but very faint hope of his rallying i cannot help thinking that it was best so of course he was not a very old man but he has for some years been a very feeble one and now that millicent and i have both given up our studies with him i think that he would have felt that his work was done and would have gone downhill very fast  i think so too mrs cunningham agreed i am sure that even had the squires death come quietly in the course of nature it would have been a terrible blow to him he was fond of you and millicent but his affection for your father was a passion his face always lit up when he spoke to him i used to think sometimes that it was like an old dog with his master it was quite touching to see them together i think mark with you that it is best that it should be as it is  gradually the conversation turned to other matters millicent was however unable to take any part in it and half an hour later she held out her hand silently to mark and left the room hurriedly the next day she was better and was able to walk for a time with mark in the garden and talk more calmly about their mutual loss for to her no less than to mark the squire had been a father  tis strange to think that you are the squire now mark she said as they sat together in the dining room on the evening before the funeral  you will think it stranger still millicent he said when i tell you that i am not the squire and never shall be  she looked up in his face with wonder  what do you mean mark  well dear you will know tomorrow as mr prendergast one of the family solicitors is coming down but i think it is as well to tell you beforehand it has been a curious position all along i never knew it myself till my father told me when we went into the library after the shot was fired the news did not affect me one way or the other although it surprised me a great deal like yourself i have always supposed that you were my fathers ward the daughter of an old comrade of his brothers well it is a curious story millicent but there is no occasion for you to look frightened the fact is you are my uncles daughter and my cousin  oh that is not very dreadful she exclaimed in a tone of relief  not dreadful at all mark said but you see it involves the fact that you are mistress of this estate and not i  millicent stood up suddenly with a little cry no no mark it cannot be it would be dreadful and i wont have it nothing could make me have it what to take the estate away from you when you have all along supposed it to be yours how could i  but you see it never has been mine my dear father might have lived another fiveandtwenty years and god knows i have never looked forward to succeeding him sit down and let me tell you the story it was not my fathers fault that he reigned here so long as master it was the result of a whim of your fathers and although my father fought against it he could not resist the dying prayer of my uncle  he then related the whole circumstances under which the girl had been brought up as millicent conyers instead of millicent conyers thorndyke and how the estate had been left by colonel thorndykes will to his brother until such time as millicent should come of age or marry and how he had ordered that when that event took place the rest of his property in money and jewels was to be divided equally between mark and herself  it must not be mark she said firmly you must take the estate and we can divide the rest between us what is the rest  to begin with mark said cheerfully there are 25000 pounds the accumulations of the rents of the estate after the death of my grandfather up to the time when the colonel returned from india and there are besides a few thousands though i dont exactly know how many that my father paid over to the solicitors as the surplus of the rents of the estates after paying all expenses of keeping up this house he very properly considered that although he had accepted the situation at your fathers earnest wish he ought not to make money by doing so if we put it down at 30000 pounds altogether you see there is 15000 pounds for each of us a very nice sum for a young man to start life with especially as i shall have my fathers estate near hastings which brings in 500 pounds a year and as the rents of this have been accumulating for the last ten years my share will be raised from 15000 pounds to 20000 pounds besides this there is the main bulk of the colonels fortune made in india that seems to be worth about 100000 pounds but i must own that the chance of getting it seems very small  how is that mark  mark told her the whole story  i mean to make it my business to follow the matter up he said i think that the chance of ever finding it is very small still it will give me an object to begin life with  oh i hope that you will never find it she exclaimed from what you say it will be a terrible danger if you do get it  mark smiled  i hardly think so millicent i cannot believe that people would be following up this thing for over fifteen years for it was many years before the colonel came home that he got possession of these diamonds even hindoos would i think have got sick of such a hopeless affair long before this but as they may ever since your fathers death have been watching us although it hardly seems possible i shall follow out the colonels instructions and get rid of those particular diamonds at once i shall only keep them about me long enough to take them to amsterdam and sell them there the colonel said they were the finest diamonds that he ever saw and that he really had no idea of what they were worth however that is for the future  mrs cunningham has known this all along mark  not about the money affairs but of course she knew that you were my cousin she brought you from india you see and has known all along that the colonel was your father she knows it and the family solicitors know it but i believe no one else except perhaps ramoo i am not sure whether he was in uncles service when you were sent over in mrs cunninghams charge he may know it or he may not but certainly no one else does except as i say the solicitors and myself possibly some other of the colonels old comrades knew that there was a child born but if they were in england and happened to hear that my father had succeeded to the estate they would of course suppose that the child had died  then millicent said in a tone of relief there can be no reason why anyone else should know anything about it i will see mr prendergast when he comes down tomorrow and beg him to say nothing about it 15000 pounds is quite enough for any girl and besides you say that my fathers greatest wish was that i was not to be married for money and after all the pains that have been taken his wish will not be carried out if i am to be made owner of the estate  you wont be able to persuade mr prendergast to do that mark said smiling it is his duty simply to carry out the provisions of your fathers will and to place you in possession of the estate and if he would keep silence which he certainly wont you dont suppose that i would  then i shall hate you mark  i dont think you will millicent and i would rather that you did that than that you should despise me at the present moment you may think that this estate would be only a burden to you but some day when you marry you might see the matter in a different light  the girl looked at him reproachfully  i should never think so she burst out what would you have me do live here in this great house with only mrs cunningham while you are going about the world seeking for this treasure never  no i dont think that it would be nice for you to do that millicent mark said mrs cunningham and i have been talking it over we thought that the best plan would be for her to take a house in london and go there with you you would have the advantages of good masters  then you were saying only a short time since that you would like to learn the harp and take lessons in painting there would be time enough to think about what you would do with respect to this house afterward  it is all horrible millicent said bursting into tears and i shall always feel that i have robbed you  but i dont feel so in the least mark urged i was not in the smallest degree put out when my father told me about it i have always had a fancy for wandering about the world as my uncle did and doing something to distinguish myself instead of settling down for life to be a country magistrate and a squire of course it came as a surprise but i can assure you that it was not an altogether unpleasant one what can a man want more than a nice little estate of 500 pounds a year and 20000 pounds in money  it is all very well to say that but as you said to me just now you may see it in a different light some day  then she sat thinking for some time at any rate she went on at last i dont see why anyone should know about it now if the house is to be shut up and you are going away why need anyone know anything about it my fathers wish was that i should not have people making love to me just because i was an heiress after all that has been done it would be wicked to go against his wishes i suppose the interest of this 15000 pounds would be enough for mrs cunningham and i to live comfortably on in london  yes mark said it will at 5 per cent bring in 750 pounds a year  then i shall remain millicent conyers to the world there is nothing to prevent that is there she said almost defiantly  no he replied thoughtfully the rents of this estate might accumulate i suppose the solicitors would see after that and as i shall be away it will of course make no difference to me were i to stay in the neighborhood i could not consent to live as my father did in a false position but even then i might give out that the property had only been left to my father during his lifetime and that it had now gone elsewhere without saying whom it had gone to however as i shall be away there will be no occasion even for that when the will is read there will be no one present but ourselves and i dont see why its contents should not be kept a secret for a time at any rate we can ask mr prendergasts opinion upon that subject  at this moment mrs cunningham coming into the room millicent ran to her and threw her arms round her neck  he has made me most miserable she said i thought i could not have been more miserable than i was before he told me all about it  i knew that he was going to do so and i was quite sure that you would not be pleased at the news i have all along thought that it was a mistake on the part of your father but as it was his decision and not mine i only had to carry out his wishes  it is cruel millicent sobbed i dont mean it is cruel of my father of course he could not have known and he thought he was doing the best thing for my happiness but it has all turned out wrong  for the present you may think so dear but you must remember that up to the present time it has turned out well i know that your uncle did not like it at first but i think that he passed ten happy years here it gave him a great power for doing good and he worthily availed himself of it we have all spent a happy time he was universally liked and respected i think all of us have benefited by it it would not have been half as pleasant if it had been known that you my child were the real owner of the estate and he was acting merely as your guardian let us hope that everything will turn out as well in future colonel thorndyke told me that he had left a considerable sum in addition to the estates and that this was to be divided between you and mark so you see your cousin will not go out into the world a beggar  it is most of it lost millicent said with an hysterical laugh it is all hidden away and no one can find it everything has gone wrong together  well i think dear that you had better go up to bed i will go with you at the present time this of course has come upon you as an additional shock i would gladly have shielded you from it for a time if i could have done so but you must have learned it tomorrow and i quite agree with mark that is was better that he should tell you this evening i sent down to the town today to the doctors and asked him to send me up a soothing draught thinking that you might be upset by the news i hope by the morning you will be able to look at matters more calmly  some time later mrs cunningham came down again  she has cried herself to sleep she said she is much grieved about this money being lost  it is annoying still i cannot help thinking that the colonel must have taken some such precaution to prevent the treasure from being lost  one would certainly think so mrs cunningham agreed the colonel seemed to me a methodical man i know that he had the reputation of being one of the most particular men in the service as to all petty details his instructions to me before i left him were all very minute and he gave me a sealed packet which he told me contained instructions and a copy of the register of his marriage and of millicents birth and he said that in case of his death i was to take it to your father he said that there was a letter inclosed in it to him and also a copy of his will the letter was directed to your father and not to me i handed it over to him when he asked me to come here he told me afterwards that the letter contained the request that his brother lived to make personally to himthat the child should be brought up as his ward and that he had handed the certificates to a lawyer who had however received copies of them from the colonel himself before he went down to see your father so as he took these precautions to insure his wishes being carried out in the event of his sudden death i should think that he must have done something of the sort with regard to this treasure  i should think that extremely likely mrs cunningham i certainly had not thought of that before and i hope that for millicents sake and my own it may turn out to be so i can get on extremely well without it but at the same time i dont pretend that 50000 pounds are to be despised  the next morning mr prendergast who had arrived at reigate late the evening before and had put up at an inn came up to the house an hour before the time named for the funeral he learned from mark that he had already acquainted millicent with her change of circumstances a few minutes after he arrived a servant told him that miss conyers would be glad if he would see her alone for a few minutes in the drawing room mark had already prepared him for her request  mark has told you that he told me about this hateful thing last night i suppose mr prendergast  he has the old lawyer said kindly and he tells me also that you are not at all pleased at the news  pleased i should think not mr prendergast she said indignantly i am not going to rob my cousin of what he has always been taught to think as his inheritance it is abominable i call it and most unnatural  but my dear young lady it is yours and not his i do not wish to discuss whether the arrangement was altogether a wise one but i think that so far it has turned out well for all parties your estate has profited greatly by the management of your uncle the tenants and all connected with it have benefited greatly he himself has had active employment afforded him of which he was fond your cousin has i believe enjoyed the advantages of the position and has become acquainted with the best people in this part of the country and will now obtain the benefit of something like 15000 poundsa comfortable little sum especially as he inherits i believe his fathers property in sussex you yourself will have obtained what i cannot but consider the advantage of having been brought up without knowing that you were an heiress and therefore without being spoiled which is in my opinion the case with many young ladies in such a condition therefore i cannot but think that if unwise in its conception the matter has so far worked out well i am bound to say that mr mark thorndyke has been speaking to me very handsomely on the subject and that he appears in no way disappointed at finding that you are the heiress of the estate and is really concerned only at your unwillingness to accept the situation  i wanted to know mr prendergast she said but in a tone that showed she was convinced by his manner that her request would be refused if you could arrange so that things would not be disturbed and he should come into possession as his fathers heir in the natural way  but you see he is not his fathers heir miss thorndyke his father only had the use as we call it of the property until you came of age or marriage it was not necessary for it to come to you on your coming of age but only as your father explained to me in the event of your marriage that is to say it was not to become public that you were entitled to the estate until your marriage if you married before you were twentyone the property was then to come to you if you did not your were to be informed of the circumstances or not as mr thorndyke might decide was best but you were not to come into the property until you married your cousin was also to be informed when you came to the age of twentyone and as at that time he was to take his half share of the remainder of the property he would then be able to arrange his life as he liked if your uncle died as unfortunately he has done before you reached the age of twentyone you would then be placed in your proper position but your father desired us to say to you that it was his wish that if it could be arranged your having succeeded to the ownership should not be publicly known until you divulged it to your husband after marriage the other portions of the will must be carried out this being only a request you are at liberty to follow it or not as you may choose  certainly i should choose the girl said after all this trouble to prevent my being run after as an heiress it would be wicked to upset it all and to fly in the face of his wishes by setting up as mistress of this estate still you understand mr prendergast that i dont mean to take it  the lawyer smiled indulgently there is one way in which it might be managed he said perhaps you can guess what it is  a flush of color rose over the girls face dont say it i beg of you mr prendergast mrs cunningham hinted at it this morning and i told her that my own wish entirely agreed with that of my father and that i was determined not to be married for money and i am quite sure that mark would be as unwilling as i am that the estate should change hands in that way no mr prendergast you must find some other way of doing it than that surely an estate cannot be forced upon anyone who is determined not to take it  well we must think it over mr prendergast said quietly and now i think that it is time for me to join the others     chapter x   the funeral of squire thorndyke and mr bastow was over and all agreed they had never seen a more affecting spectacle than that at the churchyard when the two coffins were brought in the distance was short and the tenants had requested leave to carry the squires bier while that of mr bastow was borne by the villagers who had known and loved him behind followed all the magistrates and a great number of the gentry for miles round the churchyard was crowded by every man woman and child in the village and the women as well as many of the men wept unrestrainedly as the coffins passed by besides these a large number of people from reigate and the surrounding villages were present attracted rather by the crime that had caused the death than by the loss of the squire himself the church was crowded and it was with difficulty that mr greg read the service the squire was laid by the side of his father mr bastow in the spot where many of his predecessors had slept before him  mark had been greatly affected not only by his own loss but by the sight of the general grief among those for whom the squire had done so much even mr prendergast who had taken part in many such functions over departed clients was much moved by the scene  i have been at many funerals he said to mark as they walked back to the hall but i never have been at one that so affected me no monument ever raised sir did such credit to him who was laid beneath it as the tears of those simple villagers  mark did not reply his heart was altogether too full to speak as they entered the house he said the ladies will have their lunch upstairs mr prendergast we may as well have ours at once and then you can call them down if there is any business to be done  that will not take long the lawyer said i have brought down the wills of both your uncle the colonel and your father and i think that it would be as well for me to read them both that of your father is a very short and simple document extending indeed only over a few lines your uncles is longer and more complicated but as you are well aware of the gist of it it will take us but a short time to get through it  mark took his meal in a perfunctory manner for himself he would have eaten nothing but he made an effort to do so in order to keep his guest company when it was over he said  we may as well go into the library at once and i will send up for the ladies it is as well to lose no time for i know that you want to catch the afternoon coach up to town  mrs cunningham and millicent joined them in a minute or two the girl looking very pale in her deep mourning  i am about mr prendergast said quietly to read the wills of colonel thorndyke and mr john thorndyke and i will ask you if there is any phrase that you do not understand to stop me and i will explain to you its purport  the three persons present were acquainted with the main provisions of the colonels will it began by stating that being determined that his daughter millicent conyers thorndyke should not be married for her money he hereby bequeathed to his brother john thorndyke his estate in the parish of crowswood to be held by him until his daughter millicent came to the age of twentyone or was married if that marriage did not take place until she was over the age of twentyone so long was it to continue in john thorndykes possession save and except that she was on attaining the age of twentyone to receive from it an income of 250 pounds a year for her private use and disposal  to jane cunningham the widow of the late captain charles cunningham of the 10th madras native infantry should she remain with my daughter until the marriage of the latter i bequeath an annuity of 150 pounds per annum chargeable on the estate and to commence at my daughters marriage all my other property in moneys investments jewels and chattels of all sorts is to be divided in equal portions between my daughter millicent conyers thorndyke and my nephew mark thorndyke should however my daughter die before marriage i bequeath the said estate in the parish of crowswood to my brother john thorndyke for his life and after him to his son mark and to the latter the whole of my other property of all kinds this to take effect on the death of my daughter should my brother predecease the marriage or coming of age of my daughter she is at once to come into possession of the said estate of crowswood in which case my nephew mark and mr james prendergast of the firm of hopwood  prendergast my solicitors are to act as her trustees and mrs jane cunningham and the said james prendergast as her guardians  all this was of course expressed in the usual legal language but the purport was clear to those previously acquainted with its bearing the only item that was new to them being the legacy to mrs cunningham john thorndykes testament was a short one he left all his property to his son mark with the exception of a hundred pounds to his niece to buy a mourning ring or brooch or other ornament in memory of him and fifty pounds to mrs cunningham for a similar purpose as a token of his great esteem for her character and 200 pounds to ramoo for his faithful services to his brother and himself when the lawyer had folded up the wills millicent said  on my part i have to say that i absolutely renounce the legacy of the estate in favor of my cousin mark who has always believed that it would be his  and i as absolutely refuse to accept the sacrifice mark said  my dear young lady mr prendergast said quietly at present at any rate you have no power whatever to take any action in the matter you are in the eye of the law an infant and until you come of age you have no power to execute any legal document whatever therefore you must perforce remain mistress of the estate until you attain the age of twentyone many things may happen before that time for example you might marry and in that case your husband would have a voice in the matter you might die in which case mr mark thorndyke would without any effort on your part come into possession of the estate but at any rate until you reach the age of twentyone your trustees will collect the rents of the estate on your behalf and will hold the monies in trust for you making of course such payments for your support and maintenance as are fit and proper for your condition  the tears came into millicents eyes as she resumed the seat from which she had risen and she did not utter another word until mr prendergast rose to leave  i shall doubtless learn your wishes as to the future miss thorndyke from your cousin he said i hope that you will not cherish any malice against me and that when you think it over you will come to the conclusion that second thoughts are sometimes the wisest and also that you should have some consideration for your fathers wishes in a matter of this kind he worked hard and risked his life to build up the fortune that he has left he evidently thought greatly of your welfare and was above all things anxious to insure your happiness i am sure that on thinking it over you will see that you should not thwart his wishes  my dear boy he said to mark as they stood on the doorstep waiting for the carriage to come round the best plan by far in this business would be for the interests of your cousin and yourself to be identical she is a very charming young lady a little headstrong in this matter perhaps but i do not think that that is altogether unnatural  that might have come about if it had not been for the property mr prendergast mark said but it cannot be now if she and i had been engaged before all this happened the case would have been different but you see yourself that now my lips are sealed for it would seem as if i had not cared for her until she turned out to be an heiress  you are a silly young couple the lawyer said i can only hope that as you grow older you will grow wiser well you had better come up and have a talk with me about the assets your uncle mentions in his will  then you dont know anything about them sir  nothing at all except as to the accumulations in his absence he mentioned vaguely that he was a wealthy man i thought that as a matter of course he had told his brother all about it  it is a curious business sir and i doubt if there will ever be anything besides the accumulations you speak of  bless me you dont say so well well i always thought that it was the most foolish business that i ever heard of however you shall tell me all about it when you come up i shall miss my coach unless i start  so saying he shook marks hand took his place in the gig and was driven away millicent did not come downstairs again that day  she is thoroughly upset mrs cunningham said and it would be best to let her have her own way for a time i think the sooner i can get her away from here the better the house is full of sad memories and i myself feel shaken and in need of a change  i can quite understand her feeling and yours mrs cunningham i do hope you will be able to disabuse her mind of the idea that i have any shadow of feeling of regret that she instead of i has the estate and please try to work upon her on the ground of her fathers wishes i could see that her face changed when mr prendergast put the matter in that light which i do not think had occurred to her before i am thinking of going up to town in a couple of days i was thinking of doing so tomorrow but a day or so will make no difference i propose that you both go with me and that i then help you look for a house even if you dont get one at once a week in london will be a change and you can then if you like go somewhere for a time of course bath would be too gay at present but you might go to tunbridge wells or if she would like a seaside place as she has never been near the sea since she was a baby that would be the greatest change for her you might go down for a month or two to dover or hastings there is no occasion for you to settle down in london for a time there is weymouth too if you would like it better i believe that that is a cheerful place without being too fashionable  i think that will be an excellent plan mrs cunningham said  if you like i will drive you up to town and the luggage can go by the carrier it is more pleasant than being shut up in a coach  much more cheerful of course  you will of course leave many of your things here and the packing them up will give her something to do and prevent her from brooding  i think that is an excellent idea mark  late in the afternoon ramoo came in in his usual silent manner the man had said but little during the past few days but it was evident that he was grieving deeply and he looked years older than he had done before that fatal night  of course ramoo you will stay with me for the present i hardly know what i shall be doing for a time but i am sure that until i settle down miss conyers will be very glad to have you with her  no sahib ramoo will return home to india ramoo is getting old he was thirty when he entered the service of the colonel sahib he is fifty now he will go home to end his days he has saved enough to live in comfort and with what the lawyer sahib told him your father has left him he will be a rich man among his own people  but you will find things changed ramoo since you left while here you know we all regard you as a friend rather than as a servant  you are all very kind and good sahib ramoo knows that he will meet no friends like those he has here but he longs for the bright sun and blue sky of india and though it will well nigh break his heart to leave the young missie and you he feels that he must go  all right ramoo we shall all be very sorry to lose you but i understand your longing to go home and i know that you always feel our cold winters very trying therefore i will not oppose your wishes i shall be going up to town in two or three days and will arrange to pay your legacy at once and will inquire what vessels are sailing  millicent was unfeignedly sorry when she heard of ramoos determination she was very fond of him for when as a child she first arrived at crowswood he had been her companion whenever the squire did not require his services and would accompany her about the garden and grounds listening to her prattle carrying her on his shoulder and obeying her behests no doubt he knew that she was the daughter of his former master and had to a certain extent transferred his allegiance from the sahib whose life he had several times saved to his little daughter still she agreed with mark that it was perhaps best that he should go she and mrs cunningham would find but little occasion for his services when established in london and his swarthy complexion and semieastern costume would attract attention and perhaps trouble when he went abroadthe population being less accustomed to orientals then than at presentbut still less would they know what to do with him were they for a time to wander about mark said at once that so long as he himself was engaged in the task that he had set himself he could not take ramoo with him and as for his staying alone in the house when it was only in charge of a caretaker it was not to be thought of  although not inclined at the present time to agree with mark in anything millicent could not but acknowledge that it were best that ramoo should not be urged further to reconsider his determination and she also fell in with his proposal that they should go up to london for a week and then go down to weymouth for a time after which they would be guided by circumstances accordingly two days later mark drove millicent and mrs cunningham up to london a groom accompanied them on marks favorite horse this was to be left in town for his use and the groom was to drive the carriage back again comfortable rooms were obtained in a quiet inn for the ladies while mark put up at the bull saying that he would come every day to take them out  why did not mark stay here mrs cunningham millicent asked pettishly  i suppose he thought it better that he should not do so and i own that i think he was right  when we were as we supposed no relation to each other millicent said we could be like brother and sister now that we find that we are cousins we are going to be stiff and ceremonious  not necessarily because you are cousins millicent before you were his fathers ward and under his fathers care now you are a young lady on your own account you must see that the position is changed greatly and that what was quite right and proper before would not be at all right and proper now  millicent shrugged her shoulders  oh if mark wishes to be distant and stiff he can certainly do so if he likes it it makes no matter to me  that is not at all fair millicent and very unlike yourself had not mark suggested his going to another inn i should have suggested it myself  oh yes no doubt it is better millicent said carelessly he has several friends in town and of course we cannot expect him to be devoting himself to us  mrs cunningham raised her eyebrows slightly but made no answer millicent was seldom wayward but at present things had gone very hardly with her and her friend felt that it would be better to leave her entirely to herself until her humor changed in the morning when mark came round millicent announced that she felt tired with the drive of the previous day and would prefer staying indoors mark looked a little surprised more at the tone than at the substance of the words for the manner in which she spoke showed that the excuse she had given was not her only reason for not going out  of course i shall stay at home too mrs cunningham said quietly as he glanced toward her inquiringly millicent is unnerved and shaken and perhaps it is just as well for her to have a days complete rest  very well mrs cunningham then i will as i cannot be of any use to you set about my own business for the day i have already been round to the lawyers and have got a check for ramoos legacy he will be up this afternoon and i will go round to leadenhall street and find out what ships are sailing and when they start i will come in this evening for a chat  millicent sat without speaking for some minutes after he had left the room mrs cunningham whose hands were always busy took some work out of a bag and set to work at it industriously presently the girl said  what business is this that mark is going to occupy himself in  i do not know much about it she replied but from a few words which he let drop i believe that he intends to devote himself to discovering and hunting down your uncles murderer  the listless expression faded out at once of millicents face  but surely mrs cunningham that will be very dangerous work  no doubt it will be dangerous work but i dont think that that is likely to hinder mark the man whoever he may be is of course a desperate character and not likely to be captured without making a fierce struggle for it  then he ought to put the matter in the hands of the proper authorities millicent said decidedly of course such men are dangerous very likely this man may have accomplices and it is not against one only that mark will have to fight he has no right to risk his life in so desperate an adventure  mrs cunningham smiled quietly over her work the squire had often confided to her how glad he would be if these two should some day come together in that case the disclosure after marriage of the real facts of the case would cause no disturbance or difficulty the estate would be theirs and it would not matter which had brought it into the partnership she had thoroughly agreed with him but so far nothing had occurred to give any ground for the belief that their hopes would be fulfilled  till within the last year millicent had been little more than a child she had looked up to mark as she might have done to a big brother as something most admirable as one whose dictum was law during the last year there had been some slight change but more perhaps on marks part than on hers he had consulted her wishes more had asked instead of ordered and had begun to treat her as if conscious that she was fast growing up into womanhood  millicent herself scarcely seemed to have noticed this change she was little more inclined to assert herself than before but was ready to accompany him whenever he wished her to do so or to see him go away without complaint when it so pleased him but the last week had made a rapid change in their position millicent had sprung almost at a bound into a young woman she had come to think and resolve for herself she was becoming wayward and fanciful she no longer deferred to marks opinion but held her own and was capable of being vexed at his decisions at any rate her relations with mark had changed rapidly and mrs cunningham considered this little outburst of pettishness to be a good omen for her hopes and very much better than if they had continued on their old footing of affectionate cousins  mark went back again to the lawyers and had a long talk with mr prendergast over the lost treasure the old lawyer scoffed at the idea that there could be any danger associated with the bracelet  men in india i suppose get fanciful he said and imbibe some of the native superstitions the soldier who got them from the man who stole them was stabbed he might have been stabbed for a thousand reasons but he had the bracelet on his mind he was forever hiding it and digging it up and fancying that someone was on his track and he put down the attack as being made by someone connected with it his manner impressed your uncle he concealed the diamonds or sent them off somewhere instantly he never had any further trouble about them but like many men who have a craze fancied that he was being perpetually watched and followed the unfortunate result of all this is that these jewels and the money that he accumulated during his service in india seem to be lost a more stupid affair i never heard of  now as to the clew any reasonable man would have given full instructions as to how the treasure was to be found or if he did not do that would at least instead of carrying about an absurd coin and a scrap of paper with a name upon it have written his instructions and put them in that ridiculous hiding place or more wisely still would have instructed his solicitor fully on the subject the amount of trouble given by men otherwise perfectly sane by cranks and fancies is astonishing here is something like 100000 pounds lost owing to a superstitious whim as to your chance of finding the treasure i regard it as small indeed the things are hidden in india in some old tomb or other rubbishing place your uncle may have committed them to the charge of a native he may have sent them to a banker at one of the great towns he may have shipped them to england he may have sent them to the north pole for anything i know how can one begin to search the universe  i thought sir that perhaps he might have sent them to some london bank or agent with instructions to hold them until claimed by him and that perhaps an inquiry among such houses would lead to the discovery that they hold certain property forwarded by him  well there is some sense in that suggestion prendergast grumbled and i suppose the first thing to be done will be to carry that out if you wish we will do it for you they would be more likely to give the information if they possess it to a well known firm of solicitors like ourselves than to any private individual besides if you were to go yourself they would in each case want you to be identified before they would answer any question whereas i should write a note to them in the firms name with our compliments saying that we should be glad to know if the late colonel thorndyke of whose will we are the executors had any account at their firm or has deposited any property in their hands there are not above five or six banks doing business with india and as many agents in a large way of business and if he did such a foolish thing he would be certain to do it with some houses of good standingif indeed anything can be taken as certain in the case of a gentleman with such extraordinary fancies and plans as his  thank you mr prendergast mark said with a slight smile at the lawyers irritability that will be clearing the ground to a certain extent if that does not succeed i think i shall go to india myself and shall there make similar inquiries at all the principal establishments at calcutta and madras should i fail there it seems to me that the only remaining plan will be to find out from the military authorities the place where my uncles regiment was encamped on the daywe have the date on which the jewels were given to himand to institute a minute search of all the old ruins within such a distance as he might have reached within a days ride  but you have no certainty that it was a ruin he might have dug a hole under his tent and have buried the things there he might have taken a shovel and buried them in a clump of bushes a quarter of a mile away the thing is more and more ridiculous the more you look at it  i see it is very difficult sir but one might narrow it down somewhat if one discovered the spot probably there are still native officers in the regiment who were there at the time if so they might possibly know who was my uncles servant at the time the man may be a pensioner and in that case i might discover his address through the military authorities and i could find out from him whether my uncle often rode out at night what were his habits and possibly where the tent stood and so on  well mr prendergast said if you like to undertake a wild goose chase of this sort it is your business and not mine but i consider the idea is the most utopian that i ever heard of as to where the tent stood is it likely that a man would remember to within a hundred yards where a tent stood fourteen years ago why you might dig up acres and acres of ground and not be sure then that you had hit upon the right place  there is one other circumstance mr prendergast mark said quietly that has to be taken into consideration and which renders it improbable that these diamonds were hidden anywhere by my uncle himself at that time he certainly spoke of the whole of this treasure collectively it is morally certain that he would not carry all these jewels that he had been collecting about with him and certainly not his treasure in money he must therefore have sent these diamonds to the person whoever he may be who had the keeping of his other jewels and of his money this certainly points to a bank  there is a sensible conjecture yes there is something in that he certainly could not have carried about him 50000 pounds in gold and as much in jewelry it would have been the act of a madman and colonel thorndyke although eccentric and cranky was not mad but on the other hand he may have carried about a bankers passbook or what is equivalent to it for the amount that had been deposited with a native banker or agent together with a receipt for the box containing the jewels and this he might have hidden with the diamonds  i dont think that he would have done that there could have been no object for his putting the power of demanding his money and valuables out of his possession  well well the lawyer said testily it is of no use arguing now what he might or might not have done a man who would have taken the trouble that he did to prevent his daughter knowing that she was an heiress and fancied that he was followed about by black fellows might do anything reasonable or unreasonable under the sun at any rate mr thorndyke i will carry out your instructions as to inquiries in london and will duly inform you of the result beyond that i must really decline to give any advice or opinion upon the matter which is altogether beyond me  on leaving the lawyers mark went to bow street and related to the chief the circumstances attending his fathers murder  i have heard them from the man i sent down at your request mr thorndyke and taking the attempt early in the evening and the subsequent murder there can be no doubt that the affair was one of revenge and not of robbery had the second attempt stood alone robbery might have been the object the mere fact that nothing was stolen in no way alters the case men are often seized with a certain panic after committing a murder and fly at once without attempting to carry out their original purpose your father no doubt fell heavily and the man might well have feared that the fall would be heard but the previous attempt precludes the supposition that robbery was at the bottom of it it points to a case of revenge and certainly goes a very long way to support the theory that we talked over when i last saw you that the highwayman who endeavored to stop you on the road whom you wounded and who afterwards went down to southampton was the escaped convict bastow since that time i have had a man making inquiries along the roads between reigate and kingston but altogether without success i should be glad to follow up any other line that you might suggest and that might offer any reasonable possibility of success but i must own that at present we are entirely off the scent  i am thinking of devoting myself entirely to the quest i have no occupation at present i have an income amply sufficient for my wants and for all expenses that i may incur and i intend to devote if necessary some years of my life to hunting this man down as your men have searched without success in the country i think for the present my best plan will be to devote myself to learning something of the ways and haunts of the criminal classes of london and it is with that object that i have come to you now i should like for some time at any rate to enter the detective force as an enrolled member i should of course require no pay but should be prepared to obey all orders and to do any work required as any other member of the corps would do i am strong active and have i hope a fair share of intelligence i should not mind risking my life in carrying out any duty that you might assign to me i presume that i need not always be on duty and could when not required employ my time as i liked and keep up my acquaintances in town should it be otherwise however i am perfectly ready to submit myself in all respects to your rule i have a first rate horse and should be available for country duty wherever you might think fit to send me i should not desire any distinction to be made between me and the paid officers  your proposal is an altogether novel one mr thorndyke but it is worthy of consideration i have no doubt that you would make a very useful officer the work is certainly interesting though not without serious hazards however i will think the matter over and if you will call in tomorrow you shall have my answer we are always glad to have a new hand in the force for the faces of our men are so well known among the criminal class that they are liable to be detected even under the cleverest disguises there is work too upon which it is absolutely necessary that a gentleman should be employed and in the event of your joining us i should wish you to keep the matter strictly from all your acquaintances and it would certainly be advantageous that you should when disengaged continue to mix with your friends and to mingle in society of all kinds as freely as possible there is crime among the upper classes as well as among the lower though of a different type and as mr thorndyke of crowswood you would have far better opportunities of investigating some of these cases than any of my men would have you would not object to take up such cases  not at all sir that is if it could be arranged that i should not do the actual work of making an arrest or have to appear in court as a witness  that could be managed the chief said when you have got to a certain point the matter of the final arrest could always be handed over to someone else but as a rule we keep our officers in the background as much as possible because at every trial the court is half full of men of the criminal class and the faces of our men would soon be known to every one of them well if you will call about ten oclock tomorrow you shall have my answer but i should advise you to think the matter well over before you see me again the responsibilities as well as the dangers are great and indeed in some of the work you would literally have to carry your life in your hand and i can assure you that the task you would undertake is by no means a light one     chapter xi   mark called that evening as he had promised upon mrs cunningham  i hope that you feel all the better for your days rest millicent he said  the girl looked quickly at him to see if there was any sarcasm in the question but it was evident that the inquiry was made in earnest  yes i feel better now she said i have dozed a good deal today i did not feel up to anything mrs cunninghams work has progressed wonderfully i should say that she has done more today than she ordinarily finds time to do in a week what have you been doing with yourself  i have been having a long talk with mr prendergast about the lost treasure  and of course he said that you would never find it mark  well yes he distinctly expressed that opinion  and afterwards  afterwards i went to bow street and had a long talk also with the chief officer there  i dont like the idea of your searching for this man mark in the first place i dont see why you should hope to succeed when the men whose business it is to do such work have failed in the next place i think that you may get into serious danger  that i must risk millicent i have already proved a better shot than he is and i am quite ready to take my chance if i can but come upon him that is the difficult part of the matter i know that i shall need patience but i have plenty of time before me and have great hopes that i shall run him to earth at last  but you would not know him if you saw him  i think i should mark said quietly at least if he is the man that i suspect  then you do suspect someone mrs cunningham said laying down her work  yes i know of no reason why you should not know it now i suspectindeed i feel morally certainthat the man who murdered my father was arthur bastow  an exclamation of surprise broke from both his hearers and they listened with horror while he detailed the various grounds that he had for his suspicions they were silent for some time after he had brought his narrative to a conclusion then mrs cunningham said  what a merciful release for mr bastow that he should have died before this terrible thing came out for after what you have told us i can hardly doubt that you are right and that it is this wicked man who is guilty  yes it was indeed providential mark said though i think that feeble as he has been for some months it might have been kept from him still a word from a chance visitor who did not associate bastow the murderer with our dear old friend might have enlightened him and the blow would have been a terrible one indeed it is true that as it was he died from the shock but he did not know the hand that struck the blow  now that you have told me this millicent said i cannot blame you mark for determining to hunt the man down it seems even worse than it did before it is awful to think that anyone could cherish revenge like that now tell me how you are going to set about it  i have promised the chief officer that i will tell absolutely no one he said i have a plan and i believe that in time it must be successful i know well enough that i could tell you both of it without any fear of its going further but he asked me to promise and i did so without reservation moreover i think that for some reasons it is as well that even you should not know it as it is you are aware that i am going to try and that is all if i were to tell you how you might be picturing all sorts of imaginary dangers and worrying yourself over it so i think that it will be much the best that you should remain in ignorance at any rate for a time i can say this that i shall for the present remain principally in london and i think that i am more likely to come upon a clew here than elsewhere  millicent pouted but mrs cunningham said i think perhaps that you are right mark and it is better that we should know nothing about it we shall know that you are looking for a clew but of course no danger can arise until you obtain it and attempt to arrest him i feel sure that you will do nothing rash especially as if any harm befell you he might escape unpunished and therefore that when the time comes to seize him you will obtain such help as may be necessary and will if possible arrest him at a moment when resistance is impossible  thank you mrs cunningham i shall certainly spare no efforts in taking him that way and would far rather he met his fate on a gibbet than by a bullet from my pistol  i agree with you mark millicent said even hanging is too good for such a wicked man when are you going to set about it  i hope to be able to begin tomorrow he said i am impatient to be at work even though i know perfectly well that it may be months before i can get on his track i hope to get a good deal of information as to the habits of men of his kind from the bow street runners and i have an appointment tomorrow morning to see their chief who will give me every assistance in his power  then you will not be able to take us out millicent said  i trust to do so later on but i cannot say how long i shall be engaged however i hope to get away so as to go out with you after lunch and may possibly be able to postpone my getting regularly to work until after you have gone so as to be able to devote myself to your service  but what sort of work i cannot make out how you are going to begin  i can tell you this much that to begin with i shall go in company with a constable to various places where such a man is likely to be found it will take some time to acquaint myself with all these localities the next step will be to find out if possible if anyone at all answering to his description is in the habit of coming there occasionally and whom he visits another thing will be to find out the places where receivers of stolen goods do their business and to watch those with whom highwaymen are suspected of having dealings all this you see will entail a lot of work and require a very large amount of patience of course if nothing whatever comes of such inquiries i shall have to try quiet places in the suburbs you must remember that this fellow during his time as a convict must have had opportunities of getting a vast amount of information likely to be useful to him such as the addresses of men holding positions of apparent respectability and yet in alliance with thieves you may be sure that when he returned he took every imaginable pains to obtain a safe place of concealment before he began his work my own opinion is that i am more likely to find him living quietly in a suburban cottage than in a london slum  millicent was now thoroughly interested in the search it seems a great business mark but going into it as thoroughly as you are doing i feel sure that you will succeed i only wish that i could help you but i could not do that could i she asked wistfully  he saw that she was in earnest and suppressed all semblance of a smile  i am afraid dear that you would be a much greater source of embarrassment than of assistance to me he said gravely this is essentially not a womans work i believe that women are sometimes employed in the detection of what we may call domestic crimes but this is a different matter altogether  i suppose so she sighed but it will be very hard to be taking our ease down at weymouth while we know that you are day after day wearing yourself out in tramping about making inquiries  it will be no more fatiguing than tramping through the stubble round crowswood after partridges which i should probably be doing now if i were down there by the way before you go we shall have to talk over the question of shutting up the house we had too much to think of to go into that before we came away and i suppose i shall have to run down and arrange it all if you have quite made up your mind that you dont mean to return for a year or two  decidedly our present idea is to have a few weeks at weymouth and then when we feel braced up to come back here and look for a house where are you likely to be mark mrs cunningham asked  i shall consult with dick chetwynd he knows the town thoroughly and is more up here than he is down in the country he will recommend me to some lodging in a street that without being the height of fashion is at least passable i have not the least wish to become a regular man about town but i should like to go into good society one cannot be at work incessantly  the next morning the chief of the detective department told mark that he had decided to accept his offer  as you will receive no pay he said i shall regard you as a sort of volunteer for the first two or three months you will spend your time in going about with one or other of my men on his work they will be able to put you up to disguises when you have once learned to know all the thieves quarters and the most notorious receivers of stolen goods you will be able to go about your work on your own account all that i require is that you shall report yourself here twice a day should i have on hand any business for which you may appear to me particularly well suited i shall request you to at once undertake it and from time to time when there is a good deal of business on hand i may get you to aid one of my men who may require an assistant in the job on which he is engaged  i am sure i am very much obliged to you sir mark said and will i can assure you do my best in every way to assist your men in any business in which they may be engaged  when will you begin  it is saturday today sir i think i will postpone setting to until monday week my cousin and the lady in whose charge she is came up with me on thursday and will be leaving town the end of next week and i should wish to escort them about while here i will come on monday morning ready for work how had i better be dressed  i should say as a countryman a convenient character for you to begin with will be that of a man who having got into a poaching fray and hurt a gamekeeper has made for london as the best hiding place you are quite uncertain about your future movements but you are thinking of enlisting  very well sir i will get the constable at reigate who knows me well to send me a suit i might find it difficult to get all the things i want here  accordingly for the next week mark devoted himself to the ladies millicent in her interest in the work that he was about to undertake had now quite got over her fit of ill temper and the old cordial relations were renewed on the friday he saw them into the weymouth coach then sauntered off to his friend chetwynds lodgings  ramoo had already sailed on his arrival in town he had said that he should if possible arrange to go out as a steward  many men of my color who have come over here with their masters go back in that way he said in answer to marks remonstrances it is much more comfortable that way than as a passenger if you go third class rough fellows laugh and mock if you go second class men look as much as to say what is that colored fellow doing here this is no place for him much better go as steward not very hard work very comfortable plenty to eat no one laugh or make fun  well perhaps it would be best when one comes to think of it ramoo but i would gladly pay your passage in any class you like  ramoo go his own way sahib he said no pay passage money me go to docks where boats are sailing go on board and see head steward head steward glad enough to take good servant who is willing to work his way out and ask for no wages head steward draw wages for him and put wages in his own pocket he very well satisfied  on wednesday he came and told mark that he had arranged to sail in the nabob and was to go on board early the next morning he seemed a great deal affected and mark and millicent were equally sorry to part with the faithful fellow  well old man dick chetwynd said when mark entered the room where he was still at breakfast i was beginning to wonder whether you had gone to reigate why when i saw you last friday you told me that you would look me up in a day or two  i have been busy showing london to mrs cunningham and miss conyers he repliedfor millicent had insisted on keeping her former name at any rate for the presentand mark was somewhat glad that there had been no necessity for entering into any explanations it was agreed that when he went down to discharge some of the servants and called upon his friends he should say nothing of the change in his position but should assign as a motive that he intended to travel about for a long time and that he felt he could not settle down in the lonely house at any rate for two or three years and therefore intended to diminish the establishment  you will have some breakfast mark  no thank you i breakfasted two hours ago  then you still keep to your intention to stay in london for a while  yes i dont feel that i could bear the house alone mark replied you see mrs cunningham and my uncles ward could not very well remain in a bachelors home and naturally after what has happened they would not like to do so even if they could they have gone down to weymouth for a few weeks for a complete change and mrs cunningham talks of taking a house in town for a time i am going to look for lodgings and i want your advice as to the quarter likely to suit me  why not take up your abode here for a time there is a vacant room and i should be very glad to have you with me  thank you very much dick but i should prefer being alone you will have friends dropping in to see you and at present i should be poor company it will be some little time before i shall feel equal to society  of course mark i always speak first and think afterwards as you know pretty well by this time well what sort of lodgings do you want  i want them to be in a good but not in a thoroughly fashionable street in time no doubt i shall like a little society and shall get you to introduce me to some of the quieter of your friends and so gradually feel my way  i will do all that sort of thing for you mark as you know i am not one of those who see much fun in gambling or drinking though one must play a little to be in the fashion still i never go heavily into it i risk a few guineas and then leave it my own inclinations lie rather towards sport and in this i can indulge without being out of the fashion all the tip top people now patronize the ring and i do so in my small way too i am on good terms with all the principal prize fighters and put on the gloves with one or other of them pretty nearly every day i have taken courses of lessons regularly from four or five of them and i can tell you that i can hold my own with most of the corinthians it is a grand sport and i dont know how i should get on without it after the hard exercise i was accustomed to down in the country it keeps ones muscles in splendid order and i can tell you that if one happens to get into a fight in the streets it is no light thing to be able to polish off an antagonist in a round or two without getting a mark on your face that would keep you a prisoner in your room for a week or more  yes i should like very much to take lessons too dick it is one of the things that i have always wished to do i suppose one can do it of an evening or any time you like  yes any hour suits those fellows you ought to get either a heavy middleweight or a light heavyweight you will be a heavyweight yourself by the time you have filled out let me think what is your heightsix feet one if i remember rightly  yes that is about it  well with your shoulders and long reach and activity you ought to be something out of the way if you take pains mark you see i am barely five feet ten and am something like two stone lighter than you are i suppose you are not much under twelve stone and a half  that is just about my weight i weighed at the millers only a fortnight ago  good i will make some inquiries and see who would be the best man to take you in hand to begin with and now about lodgings well i should say essex street or any of those streets running down from the strand would suit you the rooms in essex street are bigger than those in buckingham street and you will find anything between the two in some of the others i may as well saunter round there with you of course money is no object to you  no mark agreed but i dont want big rooms i think a small one when you are sitting by yourself is more cozy and comfortable  finally two rooms were taken in villiers street they were of moderate size and handsomely furnished the last tenant had fitted them out for himself but had lived to enjoy them only three months having at the end of that time been killed in a duel over a quarrel at cards  well i think you are in luck mark you might look through a good many streets before you would find rooms so fashionably furnished as these i see he went in for driving that is evident from these engravings on the walls  they are common gaudy looking things mark said and quite out of character with the furniture  not at all as times go mark it is quite the thing for a man to have prints showing his tastes riding or driving shooting or coaching or the ring if you dont like them you can take them down or what will be better take them out of their frames and put some of the champions past and present up there instead  i will see about it mark said with a laugh i may turn out a complete failure  there is no fear of that mark and as the ring is all the fashion now i can assure you it would be considered in good taste though i own that in point of art most of these things leave a good deal to be desired now that that important thing is settled suppose you come and lunch with me in covent garden i dont belong to a club yet though i have got my name down at a couple of them but as far as i can see they are slow sort of places unless you know a lot of people the coffee houses are much more amusing you see people of all sorts therefellows like myself who have no clubs to go to country gentlemen up for a week a few writers who by the way are not the best customers of these places men whom nobody knows and men whom everybody knows of course the best time to see them is of an evening  yes i have generally been in of an evening when i have been up in towns dick and i have always been amused however i am quite ready to lunch there now for i breakfasted early  i have to make some calls this afternoon mark at seven this evening i will look in at your lodgings and you shall go along with me to inglestons in st giles it is one of the headquarters of the fancy and jack needham who taught me is safe to be there and he will tell me who he thinks is best for you to begin with  accordingly after taking luncheon they separated and mark went to his inn  inglestons was at that time regarded as the headquarters of the fancy at the back of the house was a large room with benches rising behind each other to accommodate the spectators here on the evenings when it was known that leading men would put on the gloves peers of the realm would sit side by side with sporting butchers and men of fashion back their opinion on a coming prize fight with expugilists and publicans a number of men were assembled in the bar among these was jack needham  good evening mr chetwynd the man said as they came up to him its going to be a good night tring and bob pratt are going to have a round or two together and gibbons will put on the gloves with anyone who likes to take him on  this gentleman is mr thorndyke a squire jack whose place is near mine at reigate he has come up to town for a few months and wants to learn how to use his mauleys i told him that you would advise him as to who would be the best man for him to go to  i can tell you better when i have seen him strip sir there is no one in the big room at present it wont be open for half an hour ingleston keeps it shut as long as he can so as to give everyone a fair chance of a good place if the gentleman will come in there with me i will have a look at him  mark expressed his willingness to be looked at and the man having gone and got the key of the room from ingleston went in with them and locked the door behind  now sir if you will strip to the waist i shall be better able to say who you should have as your teacher than i can now  mark stripped and the man walked round and round him examining him critically  hes a big un he said to dick when he had completed his examination he has got plenty of muscle and frame and ought to be a tremendous hitter he is about the figure of gibbons and if he goes in for it really ought to make well nigh as good a man if not quite i dont think bill would care about taking him up till he knows a bit about it i tell you what sir you will be too big altogether for me by the time you get to be quick on your legs and to use your strength but if you like i will take you on for a month or sosay two months by that time i think you will be good enough to go to gibbons i will just call him in if you dont mind he came in just before you  in a couple of minutes he came in with a man of similar height and somewhat similar figure to mark  this is gibbons sir exchampion and like enough he might be champion now if he chose as fine a boxer as ever stripped but he is ring maker now to the p c and it suits him better to do that and to teach than to have a chance of getting a battle once a year or so  have you a great many pupils gibbons  the man shook his head  i am too big sir gentlemen like to learn from someone about their own weight or perhaps a bit lighter and there are not many of them who would care to stand up against a man who has been champion and so i have plenty of time on my hands i am a hard hitter too even with the gloves that is one reason why jack had best take you on until you get a little handy with your fists i do more in the dog fancier line than i do with boxing but there is nothing i like better than getting the gloves on with an amateur who is likely to be a credit to me that is my card sir you will find me in pretty nearly any time of the day and i have got a place behind the house where i do teaching when i get a chance it is handy in one way because you can drop in and take a lesson any time you like  that would suit me exceedingly well mark said and when i have had a couple of months with needham i will come to you  mark now put on his clothes again and they went out together and reentered a few minutes later when the door was open the benches were soon crowded mark had been to several prize fights with dick chetwynd had often boxed with him and other lads and had had lessons from an exprize fighter at reigate and was therefore able to appreciate the science shown by the various men who confronted each other the event of the evening was the contest between tring and bob pratt both were very powerful men who were about to go into strict training for matches that had been made for them against two west countrymen who were thought very highly of by their friends and who were regarded as possible candidates for the championship  bob pratt was a stone heavier than his opponent but far less active and owed his position more to his ability to take punishment and to hard hitting powers than to his science in the two rounds that were fought tring had the advantage but the general opinion was that in the long run the other would wear him down both fought with good temper and were warmly applauded as they shook hands at the finish  i think i should back tring in a fight mark said as the meeting broke up but it is difficult to say for he is in better condition than the other and it may be that when both are thoroughly fit the heavy man might show more improvement than he would do  the hat was passed round at the conclusion every man dropped in his guinea some more it being understood that the collection was divided between the two men to pay the expenses of their training     chapter xii   the next morning mark commenced work in earnest and for two months visited all the worst slums of london in company with one of the bow street men both were generally in disguise but marks companion sometimes went openly to some of the houses inhabited by men well known as criminals on such occasions mark remained within call ready to go in if assistance should be required but there was small fear of this the men who were visited were all personally known to the officer and generally greeted him with you aint wanting me are you  not at all what i am wanting is a little information for which i shall be quite willing to pay the first man who enables us to lay hands on the gentleman i want to find then he would describe bastows appearance  he has taken to the road i fancy and has given us a good deal of trouble if it is the man i think it is he has been away from london for some years and came back eight or ten months ago  the reply was always to the same effect  i dont know of such a man and never heard of him for my part i would not split on a pal not for anything but i should not mind earning five guineas to put you on a cove who is not one of us besides it aint only the money you know you might do me a good turn some day  quite so well i can tell you it is a good deal more than five guineas that would be earned if you could put me in the way of laying my hand on his shoulder i dont think that he is living in town i expect he is in some quiet neighborhood still if he is on the road he must have a horse somewhere you might ask among the stables and find out whether anyone keeps a horse there who is in the habit of going out in the afternoon and not coming back until the next day you have plenty of time upon your hands and it would pay you well if you could bring me the information i want  the officer said to mark at the end of two months these knights of the road dont often mix themselves up with the london housebreakers the most likely men to be able to tell you about the doings of such a fellow would be receivers of stolen goods but it would be dangerous to question any of themthey would be sure to put him on his guard i will give you a list of some of them and i should say that your best way would be to watch their places of an evening from the time it gets dark till ten or eleven of course it is just a chance you may watch one place for a month and he may happen to go there the very day you have gone off to watch another crib still there is just the chance and i dont see that there is one any other way  during this time mark had been taking a lesson every evening with needham and had surprised his teacher with the rapidity of his progress he had said the very evening before when mark had countered him with a blow that knocked him for two or three minutes senseless  we have had enough of this governor you have got beyond me altogether and i dont want another blow like that you had better take on gibbons now you are too big altogether for me and yet you dont fight like a heavyweight for you are as quick on your pins as i am  well pleased at having the day to himself and of having got clear of his work in the thieves rookeries mark went the next morning to gibbons shop his entry was hailed by a chorus of barking from dogs of all sorts and sizes from the bulldog down to the ratting terrier  glad to see you mr thorndyke gibbons said when he had silenced the barking i saw jack last week and he told me that he should hand you over to me pretty soon for that you were getting beyond him altogether and he thought that if you stuck to it you would give me all my work to do in another six months  i finished with him last night gibbons and i shall be ready to come for a lesson to you every morning somewhere about this hour i have brought my bag with my togs  all right sir i am ready at once the place is clear now behind i have just been making it tidy for we had a little ratting last night one of my dogs against sir james collettes fifty rats each my dog beat him by three quarters of a minute  you will never see me here at one of those businesses i have no objection to stand up to a man my own size and give and take until we have had enough but to see rats slaughtered when they have not a chance of making a fight of it is altogether out of my line  well sir i do not care about it myself there are lots who do like it and are ready to wager their money on it and as it helps to sell my dogs besides what i can win out of the eventit was a wager of twenty guineas last nightit aint for me to set myself up against it  calling a boy to look after the shop gibbons went away into a wooden building in the back yard it was about twentyfive feet square and there were holes in the floor for the stakes when a regular ring was made the floor was strewn with clean sawdust a number of boxing gloves hung by the wall  there is the dressing room gibbons said pointing to a door at the other end when both were ready he looked mark over your muscles have thickened out a good bit sir since i saw you strip before another four years if you keep on at it you will be as big a man as i am i am about eight years too old and you are four years too young you will improve every day and i shant now sir let us see what you can do jack tells me that you are wonderfully quick on your feet there is the advantage you have of me i am as strong as ever i was i think but i find that i cannot get about as i used to  he stood somewhat carelessly at first but as they sparred for an opening he became more careful and presently hit out sharply mark leaped back and then springing forward struck out with his left gibbons only just stopped it and then countered but mark was out of reach again  that is good enough gibbons said i can see jack has taught you pretty nearly all there is to know we will just take those hits again you were right to get away from the first but the second time you should have guarded with your left and hit at my chin with your right that jumping back game is first rate for avoiding punishment but you have got to come in again to hit you took me by surprise that time and nearly got home but you would not do it twice and so the lesson went on for three quarters of an hour  that will do for today sir i am getting blown if you are not well i can tell you i have never had a more promising pupil and i have brought forward two or three of the best men in the ring no wonder that jack cannot do much with you give me six months every day and you should have a turn occasionally with other men and i would back you for a hundred pounds against any man now in the ring  three or four days later mark received a message that the chief wanted to speak with him that afternoon and he accordingly went down  ive got a job for you mr thorndyke it is just the sort of thing that will suit you there is a house in buckingham street that we have had our eye on for some time it is a gambling house but with that we have nothing to do unless complaints are made but we have had several complaints of late it is a well got up place and there are a good many men of title frequent it but men of title are not always more honest than other people anyhow there are some rooks there and several young fellows of means have been pigeoned and ruined they are mighty particular who they let in and there would be very little chance of getting my regular men in there now you are a stranger in london but you have friends here and no doubt you could get introduced we want to know if the play is fair if it isnt we would break the place up altogether we know enough to do it now but none of the poor beggars who have been ruined will come forward and indeed havent any idea i think that they have lost their money in anything but a run of bad luck  one young fellow blew his brains out last week and his father came here with a list of what are called debts of honor which he found in his room there they are and the names of the men they are owed to of course some of them have been fairly won but i have a strong suspicion that those i have marked with a cross have not been for instance there is sir james flash a fellow who was turned out of whites two years ago for sharp practice with cards there is john emerson he is a man of good family but all his friends have given him up long ago and he has been living by his wits for the last five years the others marked are all of the same sort now what i want you to do is to become a frequenter of the place of course you will have to play a little and as you are a stranger i expect that they will let you win for a bit but if not the old gentleman has placed 200 pounds in my hands for the expenses  i could play with my own money mark said rather warmly  you forget mr thorndyke the chief said firmly that at the present moment you are a member of my force and that you go to this place in that capacity and not as squire of crowswood therefore you must if you please do as i instruct you the gentleman will be ready to pay that sum as you see the amounts entered here total up to nearly 10000 pounds he said that it will ruin him to pay that sum but that he must do so rather than his son should be branded as a defaulter i have advised him to write to all these people saying that it will take him some time to raise the money but that he will see that nobody shall be a loser by his sons debts i have told him in the meantime that i will endeavor to get proof that the play was not fair and in that case he would of course refuse to pay any of the claims on that ground and you may be sure that if unfair play was proved none of those concerned would dare to press their claims  then my function would be simply to watch  yes to watch and to bring me word of anything you may observe you see without making a public scandal if it could be found that a man was discovered cheating and the way in which he was doing it one would be able to put so strong a pressure on him that not only might he be forced to abstain from going to any club but would be frightened into giving up any ious he might hold  i shall be glad to do the best i can sir but frankly i know next to nothing of cards and should have but little chance of detecting anything that might be going on when it must be done so cleverly that experienced gamblers watching a man closely fail to see anything wrong  i quite understand that but one of my men has made a study of the various methods employed by gamblers to cheat and although it would take you years to learn how to do it yourself a few hours instruction from him would at least put you up to some of their methods and enable you to know where to look for cheating the man is now waiting in the next room and if you will take two or three hours daily with him say for a week you ought to be able to detect the doings of these fellows when to others everything seems right and above board you may have no inclination for cards but knowledge of that sort is useful to anyone in society here or anywhere else and may enable him either to save his own pocket or to do a service to a friend  mark was greatly interested in the tricks the man showed him at first it seemed to him almost magical after he himself had shuffled the cards and cut them the dealer invariably turned up a king even admitting he might have various places of concealment pockets in the lining of the sleeve in the inside of the coat and in various other parts of the dress in which cards could be concealed and drawn out by silken threads it did not seem possible that this could be done with such quickness as to be unobserved it was only when his teacher showed him at first in the slowest manner and then gradually increasing his speed that he perceived that what seemed impossible was easy enough when the necessary practice and skill had been attained the man was indeed an adept at a great variety of tricks by which the unsuspecting could be taken in  i ought to know he said i was for three years in a gambling house in paris where every other man was a sharper i have been in places of the same sort in belgium holland germany and italy at first i was only a boy waiter and as until evening there was nothing doing at these places men would sometimes amuse themselves by teaching me tricks easy ones to begin with and when they saw i was sharp and quick handed they went on after a time i began to work as a confederate and at last on my own account but i got disgusted with it at last a young fellow shot himself at the table of the gambling house at rome and at another place i was nearly killed by a man who had lost heavilydo you see it has left a broad scar right across my foreheadso i gave it up  i was in the french police for a time and used to watch some of the lower hells i was nearly killed there once or twice and at last i came back here my french chief gave me a letter to the chief and i was taken on at once for talking as i do half a dozen languages and being acquainted with most of the swell mobsmen of paris i was just the man who happened to be wanted here at the time since i came over i have done a good deal in the way of breaking up hells where sailors and others are plundered but you see i cannot be used for the higher class of work my nose has been broken and i have half a dozen scars on my face i hate the sight of cards now i have seen so much of the ruin they do and have i am sorry to say taken a hand so often in doing it that save showing someone who would use the knowledge in the right way how the tricks are done nothing would persuade me to touch them again however as a protection the knowledge is as useful as it is dangerous when used the other way it would take you ten years to learn to do these tricks yourself so well as to defy detection but in a very short time by learning where to keep your eyes you would get to detect almost any of them  you see there are three methods of cheating the first by hidden cards the second by marked cards the third simply by sleight of hand this being generally used in connection with marked cards these tricks require great skill and extreme delicacy of touch for the marks which are generally at the edge of the cards are so slight as to be altogether imperceptible save to a trained hand there are also marks on the back of the cards these are done in the printing and are so slight that unless attention were attracted to them no one would dream of their existence  in the course of a weeks practice mark learned where to look for cheating he could not indeed follow the fingers of his instructor for even when he knew what was going to be done the movements were so rapid that his eye could not follow them and in nine cases out of ten he was unable to say whether the coup had been accomplished or not but he could see that there was a slight movement of the fingers that could only mean that something was being done  it would be a good thing he said one day if every young fellow before going out into the world were to have a course of such instruction as you are giving me he would learn at least the absolute folly of sitting down to play cards with strangers he would see that he could be robbed in fifty different ways and would be at the absolute mercy of any sharper i never had any inclination for gambling but if i had been inclined that way you would have cured me of the passion for life  the weeks instruction was lengthened to a fortnight and at the end of that time mark went to dick chetwynd  do you know dick he said a gambling place in buckingham street  i know that there is a hell there mark but i have never been in it why do you ask  i have rather a fancy to go there he replied i hear that although a good many men of fashion haunt the place the crowd is rather a mixed one  it has a bad name mark i have heard some queer reports about it  yes so have i i should think that it is a very likely place for a man like bastow to go to if he has any liking for play of course he would get up as a gentleman at any rate i have been making what inquiries i can in some of the thieves quarters and have come to the conclusion that he is not likely to have taken up his abode there and i dont think i can do better than make a round of some of these doubtful houses i should like to begin with this and then work downwards  well i dare say i could manage it mark i know half a dozen men who play there they say there is more fun and excitement to be got than at whites or crockfords or any of those places some men of course play high but a good many who go there only risk a few guineas some go because it is the proper thing at present for a man about town either to play or to bet on horses or cock fights or to patronize the ring and after all it is easier to stroll for an hour or two of an evening into comfortable rooms where you meet a lively set and there is champagne always going than it is to attend races or prize fights  very few days passed that mark did not go in for half an hours chat with his friend and two days after this conversation dick said  by the way mark i have arranged for us to go to that hell tonight young boldero who is a member of my club told me some time ago that he played there sometimes i met him yesterday evening and said that i had a fancy to go and have a look at it and that a friend of mine from the country also wanted to go he said at once that he would take us there  i should advise you not to play much chetwynd he said sometimes they play uncommonly high and there are some fellows who have wonderful luck of course on ordinary occasions when the play is low you could stake a few guineas there as well as elsewhere but when really high play is on we small fish always stand out all i can say is that i have never seen anything that savors of foul play in the smallest degree but you understand how it is if one man happens to have a big run of luck there are always fellows who go about hinting that there is something wrong in it however it is a jolly place to drop into and of course there is no occasion to play always and if one loses one is likely to win on the next race or on the next fight  accordingly that evening mark met boldero whom he had once or twice before seen in dicks company and the three went together to the house in buckingham street boldero nodded to the doorkeeper as he went in and they then proceeded upstairs and entered a handsome room with comfortable sofas and chairs on which a dozen men were seated for the most part smoking several champagne bottles stood on the tables and all who liked helped themselves boldero was known to several of those present while two or three were also known to dick boldero introduced them both to his friends one of these was the hon john emerson a man of some five and thirty with a languid air and a slight drawl  glad to make your acquaintance sir he said to mark have you been long in town  two or three months only mark replied  is this your first visit here  yes this is my first visit to any place of the sort but i thought that i should like to go the rounds before i went home again  quite so going to punt a few guineas i suppose  yes i suppose that is the right thing to do  well everyone who comes is expected to do a little that way there is no occasion to play high  oh i should not like to do that mark said innocently indeed i know very little about cards  oh that is quite immaterial so long as you only play games of chance in fact you dont want to know anything about them you see others staking their money some on one side of the table and some on the other you place your money whichever side you like and take your chance there is no skill in it some people play on what they call a system but there is nothing in it you have just as much chance if you put your money down blindfolded if luck is with you you win if luck is against you you lose  after chatting for a few minutes mark went with his two companions upstairs the room they now entered was furnished as a drawing room except that in the middle was a table round which some fifteen people were seated while as many more looked on round the room were several small tables on which were packs of cards these were for those who preferred to play piquet or ecarte two or three couples being so engaged mark knew enough of cards to know that hazard was being played at the large table there was an inner room and mark strolled across and looked in it was at present untenanted it contained a center table capable of holding four and two or three small ones with two chairs set in readiness to each  that is where the heavy play goes on boldero said none of your four or five guineas wagers there fifties and hundreds are nearer the mark and i have seen a thousand wagered many a time it is exciting work even looking on i can tell you what it must be for the players i cannot say but i should think it must be frightful  mark took up his stand at the hazard table and after looking on for some little time began to play beginning with guineas he gradually as luck favored him played five guineas and after half an hours play won fifty then luck turned and in a few minutes he had lost all he won  you ought to have stopped mark dick said reproachfully as he stepped back from his place which was at once filled by one who had been standing behind him  the play in the inner room had now begun and mark went in and joined those who were looking on in half an hour one of the players had had enough and a young man said to emerson who was standing on the other side of the table  now mr emerson will you give me my revenge  i would really rather not mr cotter the luck has been so one sided lately that i would rather leave it alone  but it may turn tonight the other said at any rate i will try it if you have no objection  there was a certain eagerness in the young mans voice that caused mark to watch him closely he was a good looking young fellow but his face was not a strong one and although he evidently tried to assume an appearance of indifference as he sat down there was a nervous movement of his fingers mark took his place behind him as play began the game was ecarte and for a time emerson lost  i think the luck has changed mr cotter but as we generally raise the stakes after playing for a bit i am ready to do so shall we make it fifty pounds again  with pleasure the young man said  he won the next two games then for some time they won alternately  shall we say a hundred again he said  as you like emerson replied we dont seem to get much forwarder either way at present  a considerable number of lookers on had now gathered round so far mark although watching the fingers of the opposite player intently had seen no sign whatever of unfair play he now redoubled his attention cotter won the first game his adversary the three next mark noticed now that after looking at his hand emerson looked abstractedly as if meditating before taking the next step there was no expression in his face but mark fancied that his eyes rested for a moment on the man standing next to himself he looked at his watch and then as if finding the hour later than he had expected moved away from his place and presently joined dick who was standing with boldero on the other side of the table  who is that man playing with emerson he asked in a whisper  he is the son of cotter the head of cotters bank in lombard street  as the men were standing two or three deep round the table mark could not see the table itself but this mattered little for his attention was entirely directed towards the man standing behind cotters chair he saw that after glancing down at the young mans hand he looked across as if seeing what emerson was going to do sometimes his eyes dropped for an instant at other times there was no such movement and after noticing this four or five times and noticing the course emerson took he had no doubt whatever in his own mind that the movement of the mans eyes was an intimation to emerson of the nature of cotters hand the young man had lost four games in succession he had grown very pale but showed no other signs of agitation presently he said  you have your usual luck again i will only play one more game tonight but we may as well make it worth playing shall we say five hundred  at your service emerson replied  this time the face of the man standing behind cotters chair was immovable and mark placing himself behind a short man and straining his head forward saw that cotter scored four the next time there was still no sign emerson showed a king and scored it and then won every trick and the game  that makes nine hundred pounds the young man said quietly writing an iou for that amount and handing it to emerson there was a general movement of the spectators and two fresh players took the seats vacated by the late antagonists  who was the man standing behind cotters chair mark asked boldero  that is sir james flash he is just going to play you see it is sure to be another hot game and an interesting one  well i think i will go mark said the heat of the room has given me a bit of a headache i will see you tomorrow dick  good night old man chetwynd said and shaking hands with boldero mark went downstairs immediately after cotter the latter went into the room below drank off a tumbler of champagne and then went down took his hat and went out mark followed him for a short distance and joined him as soon as he got up into the strand  mr cotter he said i have not the pleasure of knowing you personally and i must introduce myself my name is mark thorndyke and i am the owner of an estate close to reigate would you mind my exchanging a few words with you  cotter looked up and was about to give a flat refusal but the expression of marks face was so friendly and pleasant that he changed his mind and said in a hard voice  i really do not know what you can have to say to me mr thorndyke but of course i can hardly refuse to hear you  they walked across the road and turned up a quiet street  for certain reasons it is not necessary for me to explain mark said i went to that place for the first time tonight and i watched the play between you and mr emerson  it does not matter sir i lost and i am not going there again  i hope on the contrary that you will go there again mr cotter if i mistake not from what i heard you have lost considerable sums to that man  i imagine sir that that is no business of a stranger  in no way personally mark replied not heeding the angry ring in the voice but as an honest man it does concern me i am absolutely convinced sir that that money has not been won from you fairly  the young man gave a start  impossible he said shortly mr emerson is a man of good family and a gentleman  he is a man of good family i admit but certainly not a gentleman his antecedents are notorious  i have never heard a word against him he is intimate with sir james flash and other gentlemen of position  i am not surprised that you have not heard of it it was probably to the interest of several persons that you should not do so nor do i suppose that you are aware that sir james flash was himself expelled from whites for cheating at cards  impossible mr cotter replied  i can assure you of the fact mark said quietly probably you have among your acquaintances some members of whites i am sure if you ask them they will confirm the fact now sir i can assure you that i have no interest in this matter save to prevent a gentleman from being ruined by blacklegs may i ask how much you owe to mr emerson and sir james flash  the young man hesitated i believe you sir he said at last they hold my ious for 29000 pounds i need hardly say it is absolute ruin my intention is to make a clean breast to my father about it tomorrow morning my father will give me the money in the first place because he loves me and would save my name from disgrace and in the second because were i posted as a defaulter it would strike a severe blow at the credit of the bank so he will give me the money but he will bid me leave his house forever that will matter little for i shall pay the money and tomorrow night i shall blow out my brains  well sir if you will follow my advice you will neither pay the money nor blow out your brains i saw enough tonight to feel absolutely certain that you have been cheated sir james flash stood behind you and was i am sure signaling your hand to emerson i believe that emerson played fair otherwise until the last game but i am convinced that he then cheated you had good hands but he had better and although i did not see him cheatfor i was on the other side of the tablei am convinced that he did so now sir i advise you to go in as usual tomorrow evening and to play raising your stakes as you did tonight when the times comes i will expose him should i not be able to detect him we must try another night i am so much convinced that this is the case and that i shall succeed that whether you play one night or three i will guarantee that you shall be no loser but will on the honor of a gentleman place in your hands the amount of your losses so that you will not have to ask your father for a check larger than you would do if you confessed to him tomorrow morning i only ask in return that you on your part will give me your word of honor that you will never touch a card again after you rise from the table  i cannot accept so generous an offer from a stranger cotter said in a low tone  i do not think that it is generous mark replied quietly because i am perfectly convinced that i shall not have to pay at all have you any other ious out  i have given them for about 5000 pounds but that is not in addition to the 29000 pounds emerson told me that as he knew that i should have difficulty in paying them at the present moment he had taken them up and held them with his own  will you give me the names of the persons to whom you gave them in the first place  certainly and he mentioned three names all of which stood with a black cross against them on marks list  thank you then you will go tomorrow night again  yes and i swear to you that i will never touch a card afterwards  i dont think that you need fear mark said i have not been long in london but i happen to have been shown a good many of the tricks that these blacklegs play on greenhorns which will account for my having noticed what has never been observed by the honest portion of the men who frequent the place now i will say good night sir i shall be behind your chair or his tomorrow night  i dont know what to say cotter said hesitatingly  there is no occasion to say anything it is the duty of every honest man to interfere if he sees another honest man being robbed and that is my sole object in this matter good night and turning round he walked rapidly away     chapter xiii   the next morning before going round to gibbons mark saw his chief and told him of what had taken place on the previous evening  i certainly did not think that you would succeed so soon you believe that you will be able fairly to expose these fellows  i have no doubt whatever that i shall be able to expose one of them and i have equally no doubt that if the others are arrested either false cards or pockets for cards will be found upon them what do you wish me to do sir i can of course expose any fellow i catch at it but can do nothing about the others  i must have more than one captured the chief said at even the most irreproachable club there may be one blackleg but if it is clear that this place is the haunt of blacklegs we can break it there are half a dozen acts that apply there is the 11th act of henry viii statute 33 cap 9 which prohibits the keeping of any common house for dice cards or any unlawful game that has never been repealed except that gaming houses were licensed in 1620 what is more to the point is that five acts of george ii the 9th 12th 13th 18th and 30th impose penalties upon the keepers of public houses for permitting gambling and lay heavy penalties upon hazard roulette and other gambling games on the keepers of gambling houses and those who play there having received complaints of several young men being rooked in the place we can if we prove that some of its frequenters are blacklegs shut the place up altogether we should do it quietly and without fuss if possible but if we shut it up several others of the same sort will be certain to close their doors but mind there will probably be a desperate row and you had better take pistols with you i will have four men close at hand from ten oclock till the time the place closes and if they hear a scrimmage or you fire a pistol out of the window they will rush in and seize all engaged in the row and march them to the lock up of course you will have to be included  mark then went to chetwynd  well what did you think of it last night  well i own that it went against my grain to see that young fellow being victimized by a sharper  my dear mark you must not use such language as that i fancy from what i have heard that the honorable john is not altogether an estimable character but to call him a sharper is going too far altogether  i dont think that it is for from what i saw last night i am pretty well convinced that he did not play fair i mean to go again tonight  but why on earth should you mix yourself up in such an affair mark it is no business of yours you are not an habitue of the place above all it is extremely unlikely that you are right there were some shady people there no doubt but there were also a good many gentlemen present and as you know nothing of cards as far as i know it is the most unlikely thing in the world that you should find out that emerson cheated when no one else noticed it  it is my business it is the duty of every honest man to see that a poor lad like that should not be eaten up by a shark like emerson i dont care if there is a shindy over it i shall not interfere unless i can prove that the man is cheating in which case no man of honor would go out with him i shall be glad if you and boldero would go with me again this evening i am not known there and you are to a good many men and boldero to many more i only want that if i get into a row you should testify to the fact that i am a gentleman and ordinarily sane if there is a row you will have an opportunity of seeing how much i have benefited by my lessons  yes i heard you were making tremendous progress jack needham told me a month ago that you had knocked him out of time and i went into gibbons yesterday morning with a man who wanted to buy a dog and he told me that he considered that it was a great misfortune that you were an amateur for that you only required another six months practice and he would then be ready to back you for a hundred pounds against any man in the ring but about this affair mark are you really in earnest  i am dick thoroughly in earnest so would you be if you had spoken to cotter last night as i did i tell you that if i had not given him a little hope that the thing might come out right he would have blown out his brains today  well mark if you have set your mind on it of course i will stick to you though i have some doubts whether cotter has any brains to speak of to blow out else he would not be mad enough to back himself against emerson and other men whom boldero tells me he has been playing with  he has made an ass of himself no doubt dick but i fancy a good many fellows do that at one time or other of their lives though not i grant always in the same way  well i will go mark i need not ask boldero for he told me that he should look in again at ten oclock this evening for he thought that another nights play would probably bring cotter to the end of his tether  accordingly a little before ten they walked into the gambling house together  now dick i want you as soon as you sit down to take your place in the front line within a yard or two of emerson i dont want you to be just behind him but a short distance away and i want you to keep your eye upon sir james flash who if i am not mistaken will take up the same position that he did last night near enough to cotter to see his hand you will remark i have no doubt as i did last night that whenever cotter has a bad hand flash will either close his eyes or put his hand up to his mouth and stroke his mustache or make some sign of that sort when cotter has a good hand he will stand perfectly still or look about the room at any rate he will make no signthat of course is a guide to emerson whether to propose or to refuse to allow cotter to do so i need not point out to you what a tremendous advantage the knowledge whether an opponents hand is good or not gives him of course while watching an hours play i can only know that flash was making signs and that when he did so cotters hand was a bad one it is possible that the manner in which the sign was made either by closing his eye or twisting his mustache or so on may have been an intimation as to the suit in which cotter was strongest or weakest  by jove this is a serious thing mark  it is a serious thing i dont want you to get into a row with the fellow i should like you to give me a nod when you have satisfied yourself that i was not mistaken i will take upon myself to denounce the fellow and to say what i noticed yesterday and you can back me up by saying that you saw the same thing i have no doubt that i shall be able to convince every decent man there that my charge is well founded i am going to watch emerson with the help he gets from flash he wont risk anything by cheating until it comes to a big stake like the last game yesterday in which case if cotters hand happens to be a strong one he is likely to do so and i fancy if he does i shall be able to catch him at it you had better keep boldero near you you can whisper to him what you are watching flash for and get him to do so too as if i catch emerson cheating there is likely to be a row he can lend a hand if necessary and at any rate his joining in with you will suffice to show his friends that the thing is genuine  all right mark i am interested in the matter now and am ready for anything  soon after ten cotter and emerson again sat down and as usual a lot of spectators gathered round the table the game resembled the one on the previous evening mark placed himself by the side of cotter a stranger stood immediately behind his chair another member of the club was on the other side and sir james flash stood partly behind him so that although somewhat in the background he could obtain a view between their heads of cotters cards mark saw to his satisfaction that dick and boldero had secured the exact position that he wished them to take for the first few games the play was even and dick began to think that mark had been mistaken for flash appeared to take little interest in the game and made no sign how emerson should proceed  as soon as the stake rose to a hundred again he distinctly saw flash close his eyes and play with his mustache he called bolderos attention to the fact and found the latter who had also been watching had noticed it by the time a few games had been played he verified marks assertion that these signs were signals that cotters hand was a bad one and in each case emerson played without giving his opponent the opportunity of discarding and taking in fresh cards he and dick nodded quietly to mark who had satisfied himself that so far emerson had not cheated in any other way as on the previous evening cotter after losing five or six hundred pounds proposed a final game of five hundred mark bent down his head so that the intentness of his gaze should not be noticed but from under his eyebrows he watched emersons every movement suddenly he placed a foot on the edge of the chair of the man sitting in front of him and with a sudden spring leaped upon the table seized emersons hand and held it up to the full length of his arm  gentlemen he shouted this fellow is cheating there is a card in his hand which he has just brought from under the table  in a moment there was a dead silence of surprise then mark forced the hand open and took emersons card which he held up  there you see gentleman it is a king  then a babel of sounds arose a dozen hands were laid upon emerson who was pulled back from his chair and thrown down on a sofa while hands were run over his coat waistcoat and breeches  here they are a man shouted and held a dozen cards over his head  the place of concealment had been cleverly chosen the breeches apparently buttoned closely at the knee but in reality they were loose enough to enable a finger and thumb to be passed between them and the stocking and in the lining of the breeches was a pocket in which the cards had been placed being held there by two pieces of whalebone that closed the pocket the searchers among whom were dick and boldero did not have it all their own way four or five men rushed upon them and endeavored to pull them off emerson the din of voices was prodigious but mark still standing on the table stilled it for a moment by shouting  the scoundrel has an accomplice who this evening and yesterday has been signaling the strength of the cards in mr cotters hands  who is he was shouted over the room  it is sir james flash mark said i denounce him as a cheat and a sharper  as pale as death flash rushed to the table  i dont know who you are sir he said in a tone of concentrated rage but you are a liar and you shall answer for this in the morning  i will answer to any gentleman that calls me to account mark said in a ringing voice but i dont meet a man who has been expelled from whites for cheating and who i have no doubt is well stocked with cards at the present moment in readiness for the victim that he is next going to meet after the plucking of mr cotter has been done now gentlemen search him and see if i am wrong if i am i will apologize for that part of my accusation  flash drew a pistol from his pocket but in an instant his arm was seized by those standing round him and it exploded harmlessly among those who seized flash was the man who had played with him the previous evening in spite of his struggles and curses and the efforts of his friends to rescue him he too was thrown down and eight court cards were found concealed in his sleeve the uproar while this was going on had been tremendous but it was suddenly stilled as four men in dark clothes entered the room each held in his hand the well known symbol of his office the little ebony staff surmounted by a silver crown  i arrest all present in the name of the king one said for breaking the laws against gambling and for brawling and the use of firearms now gentlemen resistance is useless i must request that you each give me your card and your word of honor that you will appear at bow street tomorrow morning  what is all this about sir he asked mark who was still standing on the table  two fellows here have been caught cheating  what is your name and address sir  my name is mark thorndyke and i am a landed gentleman at reigate my friends mr chetwynd and mr boldero will bear this out  who are the two men the constable asked  the two fellows with torn clothes mark said they are mr emerson and sir james flash  you are certain of the charge that you are making  quite certain the cards have been found hidden upon them  yes yes a score of voices shouted they have been caught in the act of cheating  take those two men into custody the constable said to two of his companions  who fired that pistol he went on  a number of voices shouted  sir james flash he attempted to murder mr thorndyke  the constable nodded to the man who had laid his hands on sir james flash and in a moment a pair of handcuffs closed on his wrists  you shall repent this flash exclaimed furiously  calm yourself sir james the constable said calmly we know our duty and do it whether a man is a peer or a peasant you are accused of card sharping and an attempted murder  what is your address in town mr thorndyke he asked  18 villiers street  is there any charge against anyone else here a good many of you seem to have your clothes torn and disarranged  some fellows attempted to rescue emerson and flash while we were searching them for what reason we can all pretty well imagine  i shall require the names in the morning of your assailants the constable said it looks very much as if they were confederates of the two prisoners now gentlemen you can all leave this house is closed and will not be opened again until this affair is thoroughly investigated  in five minutes the house was deserted  how can i thank you mr thorndyke cotter who was one of those who had seized flashs arm diverted his aim and searched him said when they got outside the house you have saved my life it did not seem possible to me that you could succeed in showing that i was being cheated and i had firmly resolved that instead of allowing you to suffer loss i would tomorrow morning make a clean breast of the whole affair to my father as i had intended to have done this morning  if i might advise you mr cotter i should say carry out your intention as far as making a clean breast of it is concerned happily you are free from debt as those ious are worthless for they were obtained from you by cheating therefore you have no demand to make upon his purse the police will i have no doubt endeavor to keep this thing quiet but your name may come out and it would be far better that your father should hear this story from you than elsewhere and your assurance that you will never touch a card again and the heavy lesson that you have had will doubtless induce him to look at the matter leniently it will no doubt be a painful story to tell but it will be far better told by you  i will do it sir as you say the lesson has been a heavy one and henceforth my father shall have no reason to complain of me may i call and see you tomorrow evening  certainly i shall be at home from seven to eight after which hour i have an engagement good night  cotter walked on and mark fell back and joined dick and boldero who had fallen behind when they saw him speaking to cotter  well mark i congratulate you dick chetwynd said you did it wonderfully though how on earth you knew that fellow had a card in his hand is more than i can guess  i felt sure he was going to cheat mark said quietly i saw that cotters hand was a very strong one and knew that emerson would be aware that it was so because he would receive no signal from flash therefore this was the time if any that he would cheat he had been playing with both hands upon the table i saw him withdraw one there was a little pause and then it came up again and i had not a doubt in the world that there was a card in it and that it had been hidden somewhere in his breeches which is one of the best places of concealment for his hand being under the table while getting at the card no one present who was not behind the scenes as i was could detect him doing it  the wonder to me is boldero said that while there were a number of men looking on closely for emerson has long been suspected of not playing fair you just fresh from the country if i may say so should have spotted him  that is easily explained mark said not wishing to fall a victim i have of late been put up to a great many of these sharpers tricks by a man who at one time had been in the trade himself  that was a capital idea mark dick said i wish you would introduce me to him  i wont do that dick but i shall be very glad to teach you all i know myself about it but i fancy that after this you will be in no great hurry to enter a gambling hell again  that is so mark i have never had any great inclination for play but after this you may be quite sure that i will light shy of cards altogether still i shall be glad if you will put me up to some of these tricks for i may be able to some day save a victim of card sharpers as you have done this evening  the next morning when those who had been present at the scene of the previous evening arrived at the office of the detectives in bow street they were shown into some private rooms and asked to wait cotter mark and his two friends first had an interview with the chief  you will understand the latter said that this is an altogether informal affair i propose you first tell me your story as briefly as possible  this was done  now mr cotter i take it that you do not wish to prosecute  certainly not i would in fact give anything rather than appear in it  you have said that in addition to the ious that you have given to the two men caught cheating they hold others to the amount of some five or six thousand pounds given by you to three other frequenters of the club in fact these papers have been found in emersons pocketbook he told you i believe that he had taken them up so that you should not be inconvenienced by them i understand then that you will be quite content if you get these ious back again those given to emerson and flash are of course worthless after what has happened they could not be presented but probably you might have trouble about the others for though i have no doubt that the whole of the men were in league together we have no means of absolutely proving it  i shall be more than content sir i have no wish to prosecute  we are glad the chief said to be able to close a dangerous place and as the exposure will put a stop to the career of these two men and no doubt alarm a good many others we dont care about taking the matter into court such gross scandals as this are best kept quiet when there is no object in ventilating them therefore gentlemen as mr cotter is willing to do so we shall let the matter drop i shall be obliged if you will step into the next room however until i have seen these three men  when they had left the three were brought in  you have been concerned sirs the chief said sternly in winning large sums of money from the hon william denton from mr james carew from mr william hobson and others in all of these cases the two men caught cheating last night were also concerned you all hold notes of hand of mr hobson i shall advise that gentlemans father to refuse to pay those notes and promise him that if any further request for payment is made i will furnish him with such particulars for publication as will more than justify him in the eyes of the world in refusing to honor them you as well as mr emerson and sir james flash have won large sums from mr cotter and the fact that the ious he gave you were found on mr emerson points very strongly to their being in confederacy with you in the matter at any rate they point so strongly that whether a jury would convict or not on the evidence that we shall be able to lay before them there can be no question whatever as to what the opinion of men of honor will be these ious are in our hands mr cotter does not desire to pursue the case he will however refuse absolutely to pay those ious and in doing so he will have the approval of all honorable men that being so the ious are absolutely useless to you and if you will agree to my tearing them up now he has most kindly consented to let the matter drop in your cases  the three men who had all turned very white when he was speaking now protested angrily against imputations being made on their honor  well sirs the officer said in that case the matter can of course go on you know best what the feeling will be as to these ious they will form an important item of evidence against you you will see as the matter stands either you gave them to emerson to collect for you without any money passing between youa very strange procedure which you will find it difficult to explainor else he gave you the coin for them and you passed them over to him and have therefore parted with all claim on mr cotter on your own account of course i impound them with the other ious as proof of a conspiracy between you now sirs am i to tear them up or not  the three men looked at each other and then one of them said  we protest altogether against the assertion sir but at the same time as there can be little doubt that emerson and sir james flash have played unfairly and we do not wish any association of our names with theirs we are perfectly willing that the ious which under the circumstances we should never have dreamt of presenting should be destroyed  i think that you have chosen wisely the chief said dryly it is a pity that you did not do so at first these are the ious he gave to one or other of you perhaps it would be pleasanter for you to destroy them yourselves  the three men took the papers with their names on them and tore them up  thank you he went on sarcastically that will place you in a better position you will be able to tell your friends that you felt so indignant at the manner in which mr cotter had been swindled by emerson and flash that you at once destroyed his ious for the sums that you had won of him but gentlemenhe spoke sternly nowremember that we have a long list against you and that the next victim or let us say his father might be more disposed to push matters to their full length than is mr cotter remember also that we keep ourselves acquainted with what is going on and that should trouble arise we shall produce all the complaints that have been made against you and shall also mention your connection with this affair in which as i understand you all did your best to prevent those two fellows from being searched  without saying another word the three men went out of the room too crestfallen to make even an attempt at keeping up their air of indignation the others were then called in  i am sorry gentlemen he said that you have had the trouble of coming here for the gentleman swindled has declined to prosecute the swindlers and you will understand that he is somewhat anxious that his name should not appear in the matter fortunately as instead of paying in cash he gave ious for his losses he will not be a loser to any large amount by these transactions i may say that the proprietor of the hell has been there this morning and to avoid trouble he has consented to close his place for good i have only to remark that i should advise you gentlemen in future only to indulge in gambling in places where you may be fairly assured of the character of the men you play with i think in conclusion that you may all feel grateful to mr cotter for refusing to prosecute it has saved you from having to appear in court as witnesses in so utterly disreputable an affair  there was a general murmur of assent and in a minute or two the room was clear flash and emerson were then brought in with a constable on each side of them  mr cotter has i regret to say declined to prosecute and mr thorndyke has done the same with regard to sir james flashs use of his pistol you have therefore escaped the punishment due to swindlers at cards it is the less matter as you are not likely to have an opportunity of making fresh victims for the story will be known by this afternoon in every club in london these ious will be of no use to youthey are not worth the paper on which they are written however i shall take it upon myself to hand them back to mr cotter to prevent the possibility of their getting into other hands and giving him trouble  you can unlock those handcuffs constable these men are at liberty to go and if they will take my advice they will lose no time in crossing the water and establishing themselves somewhere where their talents are likely to be better appreciated than they are here they can go one of you can call a hackney coach for them if they wish it they will scarcely care to walk with their garments in their present condition  then the chief went into the next room  there is an end of that affair mr cotter here are the ious you gave to those two swindlers those you gave to the other three men who were no doubt their confederates have been torn up by them in my presence they declare that after seeing how shamefully you had been victimized they had not the slightest idea of ever presenting them  i am sure that i am extremely grateful to you cotter said i know that i have behaved like a madman and that i dont deserve to have got off as i have done it will be a lesson to me for life i can assure you  on leaving dick chetwynd walked for some distance with markas far as gibbons place in st giles  there is one thing which i cannot understand he said and that is how it was that the constables happened to be so close at hand just at the time they were wanted  well you see dick my relations with bow street are just at present of a somewhat close nature for they are aiding me in the search that i told you that i was making for my fathers murderer the consequence was that i had only to mention to the chief that i fancied i had detected cheating at that place and that there was a likelihood of a row there last night and he at once said he would send four men to come in if they heard a rumpus and he was indeed rather glad of an opportunity for breaking up the place concerning which he had had several complaints of young men being plucked to the last feather well it was lucky they came i dont say that it would have made any difference because i think our side was a great deal stronger than they were still it would have led to a nasty row and perhaps to half a dozen duels afterwards well i will say goodby now i am very glad that the affair has been dropped it would not have mattered so much to me as i am single and my own master but there were a good many men there who would have been ready to have paid up handsomely rather than that their names should appear in connection with a row at a gambling house  at seven oclock in the evening philip cotter called at marks lodgings accompanied by his father who as he came in with him advanced at once to mark and shook him warmly by the hand  my son has told me everything mr thorndyke he said and i cannot thank you sufficiently for the noble part you took in rescuing him from the terrible effects of his folly i have been down here twice this afternoon for i felt that i could not rest until i had shaken you by the hand it is not the question of money so much though that would have been a serious loss to me but it is the saving of my sons life and the saving of the honor of our name  i am glad indeed to have been of service mr cotter and i trust that you have consented to forgive the folly that he has committed and which i feel sure will never be repeated  yes it was a heavy blow to me mr thorndyke when philip told me but as he has sworn most solemnly never to touch a card again and as i feel sure that the lesson cannot but be a useful one to him all his life i have agreed to say no more about it and let the matter drop altogether he has been fortunate to have escaped so easily he has told me of the noble offer you made to pay his losses if you should not be able to prove that he was being cheated  i was not committing myself heavily mark said with a smile i had seen enough to be absolutely certain and was sure that i should be able to bring it home to them  but it was at a considerable risk to yourself mr thorndyke as it was you had a narrow escape of being shot  not a very narrow escape mark replied with so many men standing round him and their attention called to him it was certain that he would be seized before he could take aim at me i had pistols in my pocket and was prepared to fire in an instant but i saw at once that there was no occasion for that  but i cannot imagine how you should have detected the cheating the banker said you are younger than my son and he said that you told him that you had only recently come up to london it is astonishing that while experienced players should never have noticed that anything was wrong you should have discovered it  the explanation is simple mr cotter i have no inclination for play myself but i happened a short time since to fall in with a man who was well acquainted with all the various methods of card sharping i thought that a knowledge of that might some day be useful and i got him to put me up to a number of the tricks of card sharpers both at home and abroad having these fresh in my mind and seeing that your son was playing with a man whose reputation i knew to be bad i naturally concentrated my attention upon him and was not long in discovering that he had a confederate standing behind your sons chair being a stranger in the place i could not denounce him but the next night i set two friends to watch that method of cheating while i kept my eyes fixed on emersons hands as i anticipated there was nothing suspicious about his movements so long as play was comparatively low for the advantage that he gained from his confederate enabled him to be sure of winning in the long run it was only in the last game which was a high one that as he knew that your son had a strong hand he was tempted to stock his hand with false cards and watching closely i had no difficulty in detecting his method  well sir you have at any rate laid us both under the deepest obligation is there any possible way in which we can show our gratitude  mark thought for a moment  in one way you might do me a favor mr cotter a ward of my fathers who will inherit some property when she comes of age is at present finishing her education in town and is living with a lady who has been her friend and companion since childhood i have a good many acquaintances but they are all bachelors and having been living down at my fathers place near reigate for so many years the ladles have no acquaintances in london they live at islington and their life is a very dull one i am anxious for several reasons that the young lady should have the advantage of going somewhat into society hitherto i have had no means of introducing her if it is not too much to ask mr cotter i should be extremely glad and obliged if mrs cotter would call on them and give them an introduction into society the lady with my fathers ward is the widow of a captain in the indian army and is in all ways a very charming person and has been at the head of my fathers establishment for the last twelve years  with the greatest pleasure in the world mr thorndyke i am only sorry that it is so slight a thing that you ask of me i have thought it but right to tell my wife what has passed and i had difficulty in persuading her not to come with me this evening to also express her gratitude to you she will be pleased indeed to call upon your friends at once and i am sure she will do so tomorrow i was going to ask you to dine with us and i hope that you will do so we shall have no one else and i hope that you will be able to arrange to meet your friends at our house a few days later  the next morning mark called on mrs cunningham  i think you will have a visitor today he said it has happened that i have been able to do a service to the son of mr cotter a wealthy banker i am going to dine there this evening he asked me about my friends in london and i mentioned that my only lady friends were you and millicent he asked a few questions as to where you were living and so on and said that his wife would have much pleasure in calling and introducing millicent into society as your life is very dull here and it is clearly very desirable that millicent should go into society i gladly accepted the offer and i believe that she will call today  that will be very nice indeed mark millicent is not complaining but she must have felt it very dull i have even felt it so myself after the cheerful society we had at home  i dont know that i shall like it millicent said doubtfully  oh yes you will millicent and besides it will be good for you it is not natural for a girl of your age to be here without friends and i shall be very glad to know that you are going to mix a little with other people  mrs cotter called that afternoon and three days later mark met mrs cunningham and millicent at a dinner party at the bankers and mrs cotter introduced them very warmly to several of her friends with the result that in a very short time they were frequently invited out while they became very intimate with the banker and his wife and often spent the day there     chapter xiv   some little time after this mark was intrusted by his chief with the work of discovering a man who had committed a very atrocious murder and was it was tolerably certain hiding in the slums of westminster it was the first business of the kind that had been confided to him and he was exceedingly anxious to carry it out successfully he dressed himself as a street hawker and took a small lodging in one of the lanes being away the greater portion of the day ostensibly on his business and of an evening dropped into some of the worst public houses in the neighborhood he was at first viewed with some suspicion but it was not long before he became popular he let it be understood that he had got into trouble down in the country and that he was quite ready to take part in any job that promised to be profitable but he principally owed his popularity to the fact that the bully of the locality picked a quarrel with him and to the astonishment of those present mark invited him to go outside  you had better make it up with him mate a man sitting by his side whispered he was in the prize ring at one time and thrashed big mike hartley at kennington he had to give it up owing to having fought a cross he would kill you in five minutes  i will chance that mark said quietly as he moved towards the door i dont think that he is stronger than i am and i can use my fists a bit too  by the time they had taken off their upper garments a crowd had assembled the news that a hawker was going to stand up against black jim circulated rapidly and caused intense excitement to the astonishment of the spectators the bully from the first had not a shadow of a chance and at the end of the third round was carried away senseless while the hawker had not received a scratch a few days later mark who on the strength of his prowess had had two or three hints that he could be put up to a good thing if he was inclined to join was going down to westminster when two men stopped and looked after him  i tell you emerson that is the fellow i could swear to him anywhere what he is got up like that for i cannot tell you but i should not be surprised if he is one of that bow street gang he called himself mark thorndyke and chetwynd said that he was a gentleman of property but that might have been part of the plant to catch us i have never been able to understand how a raw countryman could have caught you palming that card i believe that fellow is a bow street runner if so it is rum if we cannot manage to get even with him before we go it seemed to me that luck had deserted us altogether but this looks as if it was going to turn again lets go after him  keeping some fifty yards behind him they watched mark to his lodgings waited until he came out again and followed him to a public house  he is acting as a detective sure enough emerson said the question is what are we to do next  in half an hour mark came out again several people nodded to him as he passed them but they saw a big man who happened to be standing under a lamp turn his back suddenly as mark approached him and after he had passed stand scowling after him and muttering deep curses flash at once went up to him do you know who that fellow is my man the fellow turned savagely upon him  i dont know who he is but what is that to you  he is not a friend of ours flash said quietly quite the contrary we have known him when he was not got up like this and we are rather curious to know what he is doing here  do you mean that  i do i owe the fellow a grudge  so do i the man growled just step up this next turning there wont be anyone about there now then what do yer want to know  i want to know who he is  well he calls himself a hawker but my idea of him is he is one of the fancy perhaps a west countryman who is keeping dark here till he can get a match on i have been a prize fighter myself but he knocked me out in three rounds the other day  well the last time i saw him flash said he was dressed as a swell my idea of him is he is a bow street runner and he is got up like this to lay his hands on some of the fellows down here  you dont mean it the man said with a deep oath then i can tell you he has come to the wrong shop i have only got to whisper it about and his life would not be worth an hours purchase i had meant to stick a knife in him on the first opportunity but this will save me the trouble  well you can have your revenge and five guineas besides flash said but we must be there at the time i should like him to know that i was at the bottom of his being caught  they stood talking together for a few minutes and then separated flash and his companion going back to a quiet lodging they had taken until they could finish their arrangements for disposing of their furniture and belongings before going abroad while at the same time they finished plucking a country greenhorn they had met at a coffee house two days later wrapped up in great coats and with rough caps pulled down over their eyes they entered the thieves resort half an hour before marks usual time of getting there a larger number of men than usual were assembled and among them was black jim the men were all talking excitedly and were evidently furious at the news that the pugilist had just told them  those are the gents that have given me the office he said as flash and his companion entered they can tell yer he is one of that cursed bow street lot  that is right enough my men flash said he and four of his mates broke into a place where we were having a bit of play three weeks since marched us all away to bow street and shut the place up i dont know what he is down here for but you may be sure that its for no good to some of you we owe him a heavy one ourselves he came spying on us dressed up as a swell and spoilt our game and got the darbies put on us and we have sworn to get even with him  you will get even dont you fear one of the men growled and more than even strike me blind if you dont  look here lads flash said there is one thing i saydont use your knives on him remember he is a runner and no doubt his chief knows all that he is doing and no doubt ordered him to come here there will be a big search you may be sure when he dont turn up to make his report so dont lets have any bloodshed let the thing be done quietly  we can chuck his body into the river one said  yes but if it is picked up with half a dozen holes in it you may be sure that they will be down here and like enough every man who has used this place will be arrested you know that when there are twenty men in a job the chances are that one will slip his neck out of the halter by turning kings evidence  an angry growl went round the room  well you know well enough it is so it is always the case besides we ought to give him a little time to prepare himself my idea is that the best plan will be to bind and gag him first then we can hold a little court over him and let him know what is coming an hour later when the place gets a bit quiet we can carry him down to the riverit is not above fifty yards awaytie a heavy weight round his neck cut his cords the last thing and chuck him over if his body is found it will be thought it is that of some chap tired of life who took pains to drown himself pretty quickly and there wont be any fuss over him and there will be nothing to come upon any of you fellows for  there was a general murmur of assent several of those present had already committed themselves to some extent with the supposed hawker and were as eager as flash himself that he should be killed still all felt that it was as well that it should be managed with the least possible risk of discovery for while an ordinary man could be put out of the way without any trouble arising the fact that he was a bow street runner added enormously to the risk of the discovery of his fate  there was a little talk and then two of the men went out and brought back a couple of strong ropes a few minutes after their return mark thorndyke came in he paused as he entered the room in surprise at the silence that reigned for he was accustomed to be greeted with friendly exclamations however as he walked in the door closed and then suddenly with shouts of down with the spy the men sprang from their seats and made a sudden rush at him for a minute the struggle was tremendous man after man went down under marks blows others clung onto him from behind a rope was passed round his legs and pulled and he fell down with a crash bringing down five or six of his assailants a minute later he was gagged and bound  while the struggle was going on no one noticed that a lascars face was pressed against the window it disappeared as soon as mark fell and ten minutes later a dark faced sailor ran into gibbons it was a quiet evening at inglestons and gibbons after smoking a pipe with half a dozen of the pugilists had just returned  hallo he said as he opened the door what the deuce do you want  the man was for a moment too breathless to answer  you know mr thorndyke he said at last in very fair english  yes i know him well what of him  he has been attacked by a number of thieves in a public house near the river at westminster and he will be murdered unless you go with others to help him  what the deuce was he doing there gibbons muttered and then seizing his cap said to the lascar  come along with me it aint likely that we shall be in time but we will try anyhow  he ran to inglestons  come along ingleston he exclaimed and all of you you all know mr thorndyke this man says he has been attacked by a gang down at westminster and will be murdered i am afraid we shant be in time but it is worth trying  the prize fighters all leaped to their feet mark had sparred with several of them and being open handed and friendly was generally liked in a moment headed by ingleston and gibbons they started at the top of their speed and in less than a quarter of an hour were at bank side  that is the house the sailor said pointing to the public where a red blind had been lowered at the window and two men lounged outside the door to tell any chance customer that might come along he was not wanted there at present  inside a mock trial had been going on and mark had been sentenced to death as a spy not a voice being raised in his defense as soon as he had been lifted up and seated so that he could see the faces of those present he recognized the two gamblers and saw at once that his fate was sealed even had they not been there the chance of escape would have been small the fact that one of the detectives had been caught under circumstances when there was but slight chance of its ever being known how he came to his end was in itself sufficient to doom him several of the men present had taken him into their confidence and he had encouraged them to do so not that he wanted to entrap them or that he intended to do so but in order to obtain a clew through them as to the hiding place of the man he was in search of  the savage exultation on the faces of the two gamblers however was sufficient to extinguish any ray of hope he felt sure at once that they had been the authors of his seizure and that no thought of mercy would enter the minds of these two scoundrels whose plans he had frustrated whose position he had demolished and to whom he had caused the loss of a large sum of money neither flash nor emerson would have taken share in a crime known to so many had they not been on the point of leaving england their names were known to no one there and even should some of these afterwards peach they would at least be safe mark had been asked whether he could deny that he was a member of the detective force and had shaken his head even if he had told a lie which he would not do the lie would have been a useless one no one would have believed it for the two gamblers would have been witnesses that he was so  he had been placed in one corner of the room so that what light there was would not fall on his face and had anyone entered they would not have noticed that he was gagged one indeed had suggested that it would be better to lay him under one of the benches but black jim said with a brutal laugh  no no it is better that we should keep sight of him and if anyone asks a question of course we can say that the gentleman has the toothache  presently flash spoke to the ruffian in a low voice  yes i think you are right he replied look here he went on raising his voice there is no occasion to have such a lot in this business jake watson bill the tinker and me are quite enough to carry him to his bed i reckon the rest had better make themselves scarce when the times comes go home and keep their mouths shut i need not say that anyone who lets his tongue wag about it is likely to come to a worse end than this bloodhound we will have another glass of grog before you turn out the streets wont be quiet for another hour yet and there is another guinea of this worthy hawkers to be spent summers make another big bowl of punch dont put so much water in it as you did in the last  the landlord a notorious ruffian was just coming into the room with a huge bowl when there was the sound of a scuffle outside  you had better see what is up black jim said and two of the men nearest the door unbarred and opened it as they did so there was a rush and eight powerful men ran in knocking to the floor those who had opened the door the rest sprang to their feet gibbons looked round and as his eye fell upon mark who had the moment the men inside rose got into a standing position gibbons launched himself towards him striking four of the ruffians who endeavored to stop him to the ground with his crushing blows  this way he shouted to his friends ingleston and tring do you keep the door  the moment the six men had closed round mark one of them taking out his knife cut the cords removed the bandage from his mouth and extricated the gag the name of the two prize fighters had created something like a panic among the crowd which had increased when one of them shouted it is charley gibbons  flash and emerson sprang to their feet with the rest and the latter shouted go at them men there are only eight of them and we are twenty knife them or you will all hang for this job  the knowledge of their danger was evident to all the men and nerved by desperation they rushed at the prize fighters but the eight were now nine and each of them in a fray of this kind was equal to half a dozen ordinary men scarce a word was spoken but the sound of crushing blows and scuffling and an occasional oath made a confused din in the half lighted room mark burst his way through his assailants to the spot where flash and emerson were standing somewhat in the rear of the crowd for they had been sitting at the other end of the room flash had a pistol in his hand but the man who was standing in front of him was struck with such violence that he fell backwards knocking emerson to the ground and almost upsetting flash and before the latter could steady himself mark struck him with all his force under the chin a moment later the landlord blew out the two candies and in the darkness the ruffians made a dash for the door carried tring and ingleston off their feet and rushed out into the lane  if the man who blew those candles out dont light them again at once gibbons shouted i charley gibbons tell him that i will smash him and burn this place over his head he had best be quick about it  the landlord cowed with the threat soon returned with a candle from the kitchen and lit those that he had extinguished  well mr thorndyke we just arrived in time i fancy gibbons said  you have saved my life gibbonsyou and the others how you got to know that i was here i cannot imagine i would have been a dead man in another half hour if you had not arrived i thank you all from the bottom of my heart  that is all right sir gibbons said it is a pleasure to give such scoundrels as these a lesson is anyone hurt i fancy i have got a scratch or two  several of the men had been cut with knives but the blows had been given so hurriedly that no one was seriously injured twelve men lay on the ground  now sir what shall we do with these fellows  i should say we had better leave them alone gibbons i dont want any row over the affair it is the work of these two fellows here i think i pretty well settled one of them  gibbons stooped over flash  you have broken his jaw sir but he will come round in time i believe this other fellow is only shamming i dont see any of our handiwork upon his face the others have all got as much as they want i think and taking a candle he looked at their faces there is not one of them who will want to show up for a week or so he said and there are two or three who will carry the marks to their graves well sir if you dont want anything done to them the sooner we are off the better those fellows who got away may bring a lot of others down upon us as long as it is only fists we could march through westminster but as they would have knives it is just as well to get out of it before there is any trouble you are got up in a rum way mr thorndyke  yes i will tell you about it afterwards i agree with you that we had best be moving at once  but the men who had fled were too glad to have made their escape to think of anything but to make for their dens as quick as possible and the party passed through the lanes into the open space in front of parliament house without interruption  we will go up to your place ingleston and talk it over there mark said you can get those cuts bound up and i shall be very glad to get a drink that thing they shoved into my mouth hurt my tongue a good deal and i have not gone through a pleasant half hour i can tell you  he walked up past whitehall with gibbons and ingleston the others going in pairs so as not to attract attention as soon as they reached inglestons place the latter told the man in the bar to put the shutters up led the way into the bar parlor and mixed a large bowl of punch  now gibbons in the first place mark said after quenching his thirst how did you know of my being in danger  well sir a black sailor chap ran into my place suddenly and told me  do you mean a colored man gibbons  yes sir one of those lascar chaps you see about the docks i did not ask any questions but ran as hard as i could i had only left here five minutes before and knew that tring and some of the others would still be here they did not lose a moment and off we went the sailor chap he kept ahead i tried to come up to him two or three times to get to know something about it but he always seemed to quicken his pace when i was coming up and i soon got too blown to want to do much talking he led us to the door and after that i saw nothing more of him what became of him i dont know i expect he was better at running than he was at fighting  it is curious mark said thoughtfully he might have been in the place when i went in and slipped out while i was making a fight for it i have seen a lascar several times while i have been down there i dare say it was the same man though why he should take such trouble for the sake of a stranger i dont know there seems to be a good many of them about for now i think of it i have run against them several times wherever i have been in town  now sir what did they want to kill you for  well gibbons it happened in this way my father you know was murdered by a man who had a grudge against him and who is both a highwayman and a house breaker  they dont often go together ingleston said the highwaymen generally look down upon the burglars and keep themselves to themselves  i hew they do ingleston but this fellow has been a convict and is not particular what he turns his hand to the detectives have been after him for a long time but have failed and i determined to take the matter up myself and ever since i have been up here i have been hunting about in the worst quarters of the town the people of bow street have aided me in every way they could and i suppose some of these men have seen me go in or out of the place of course when i am going into these bad quarters i put on a disguise and manage to get in with some of these thieves and so to try to get news of him through them three weeks ago i decided to try westminster i was getting on uncommonly well there principally because i gave a tremendous thrashing to a fellow they call black jim he has been a prize fighter  i know him tring said it was the fellow that was kicked out for selling a fight he was not a bad man with his fists either but i expect you astonished him mr thorndyke  yes i knocked him out of time in three rounds well he has been a bully down there and everyone was very glad he was taken down after that i got to know several of the worst lot down there they fancied that i was one of themselves and several of them made proposals to me to join them and of course i encouraged the idea in hopes of coming upon the man that i was after then some fellow in the street recognized me i suppose and denounced me to the rest as being one of the runners i suppose he told them this evening before i went in  the place was a regular thieves den which of course was why i went there naturally they were furious especially those who had been proposing to me to join them anyhow they had evidently settled among themselves that i was to be put out of the way and directly i went in i was attacked i knocked down a few of them but they jumped on my back and one of them managed to get a rope round my legs and down i went with three or four of them and before i could get up again they had tied and gagged me then they held a sort of court man after man got up and said that i had been drawing them on to find out what they were up to and had agreed to join them of course with the intention of getting them caught in the act and two got up and said that they knew me as one of the runners they all agreed that i must be put out of the way  i suppose as the landlord did not want blood spilt in his house they did not knife me at once however they told me that they had decided that as soon as the coast was clear i should be carried down to the river and chucked in with an old anchor tied to my neck i had just a gleam of hope a short time before you came in for then it had been settled that it was just as well no more should be engaged in the affair than was necessary and that black jim with two others whom i had been talking to and the two men who had told them that i was a runner should manage it and the rest were to go off to their homes  i had been all the time trying to loosen my ropes and had got one of my hands nearly free and i thought that if they waited another half hour i might have got them both free and been able to make a bit of a fight of it though i had very little hope of getting my legs free  however i had my eye on the knife of the man who was sitting next to me and who was one of those who was to stay i thought that if i had my hands free i could snatch his knife settle him and then cut the ropes from my legs that done i could i think have managed black jim and the others as for the men who denounced me they were small men and i had no fear of them in a fight unless as i thought likely enough they might have pistols one of them is the fellow whose jaw i broke i hit him hard for he had a pistol in his hand  there is no doubt you hit him hard gibbons said dryly he looked a better sort than the rest  yes the fellow was a card sharper whom i once detected at cheating and so was the one who was lying next to him the man whom you said you thought was shamming  by this time the mens wounds were all bandaged up mark told them that he would be round there again in the morning and hoped that they would all be there  i shall go home at once and turn in he said straining at those cords has taken the skin off my wrists and i feel stiff all over it will be a day or two gibbons before i am able to put the gloves on again i wish i could find that lascar i owe him a heavy debt  as mark made his way home he thought a good deal about the colored sailor if the man had been in the den the ruffians would hardly have ventured to have attacked him in the presence of a stranger of course he might have been passing and have seen the fray through the window but in that case he would run to the nearest constable how could he know anything about his habits and why should he have gone to gibbons for assistance that and the fact that he had so often observed lascars in the places he had gone to certainly looked as if he had been watched and if so it could only be connected with those diamonds it was a curious thing altogether  the next morning he went early to bow street as soon as the chief came he related the events of the previous evening and told him that it was flash and emerson who had denounced him  i know the place the officer said it is one of the worst thieves dens in london however it is just as well you decided not to take any steps of course all the fellows would have sworn that they did not intend to do any harm but that flash had put them up to frightening you and i doubt whether any jury would have convicted as to the other men we know that they are all thieves and some of them worse but the mere fact that they proposed to you to join in their crimes wont do as no actual crime was committed however i shall have the gang closely watched and at any rate you had better leave westminster alone someone else must take up the work of looking for that man you were on the watch for anyhow you had best take a weeks rest there is no doubt you have had a very narrow escape it is strange about that lascar he might not have cared for going in to take part in the fray but you would have thought that he would have waited outside to get a reward for bringing those men to your rescue  as mark did not care to tell about the diamonds till the time came for getting them he made no reply beyond expressing an agreement with the chiefs surprise at the man not having remained to the end of the fray on leaving bow street he went up to inglestons the men who had rescued him the night before were gathered there and he presented each of them with a check for twentyfive guineas  i know very well he said that you had no thought of reward when you hurried down to save me but that is no reason why i should not show my gratitude to you for the service you have rendered me some of you might very well have been seriously hurt if not killed by their knives at any rate i insist upon you taking it money is always useful you know and it is not often so well earned as this  the men were greatly pleased and tring said  well sir if you get into another scrape you may be sure that you can count upon us  i shall try and not get into any more mark laughed this has been a good deal more serious than i had bargained for and i shall be very careful in the future     chapter xv   the burglary season seems to have recommenced in earnest marks chief said some nine months after he had been at work for a time there had been a lull as you know but i have had three reports this week and it strikes me that they are by the same hand as before of course i may be mistaken but they are done in a similar way the only difference being that there is ground for believing that only one man is engaged in them i fancy the fellow that you are after has either been away from london for some time or has been keeping very quiet at any rate we have every ground for believing that he keeps himself aloof from london thieves which is what i should expect from such a man if one has nerve enough to do it there is nothing like working singly when two or three men are engaged there is always the risk of one being caught and turning queens evidence or of there being a quarrel and of his peaching from revenge  if your man has been away from town he has certainly not been working any one district of course one gets the usual number of reports from different quarters but although burglaries are frequent enough there has been no complaint of a sudden increase of such crimes as there would have been judging from the numerous daring attempts here had bastow been concerned therefore i feel sure that he has been living quietly he would have his mates sharethat man you shot you knowof the plunder they made together he would know that after that affair at your place there would be a vigilant hunt for him and it is likely enough that he has retired altogether from business for a time  however men of that sort can never stand a quiet life long and are sure sooner or later to take to their trade again if only for the sake of its excitement now that the burglaries have begun again i shall be glad if you will devote yourself entirely to this business you have served a good apprenticeship and for our sake as well as yours i should be glad for you to have it in hand  i shall be very pleased to do so sir although we do not know where he is to be found i think i can say that it is not in the slums of london it seems to me that he may be quietly settled as an eminently respectable man almost under our noses he may show himself occasionally at fashionable resorts and may be a regular attendant at horse races  he would not run any appreciable risk in doing so for his face is quite unknown to anyone except the constables who were present at his trial and even these would scarcely be likely to recognize him for he was then but eighteen while he is now six or seven and twenty and no doubt the life he has led must have changed him greatly  i quite agree with you the chief said after the first hunt for him was over he might do almost anything without running much risk well i put the matter in your hands and leave it to you to work out in your own way you have given ample proof of your shrewdness and pluck and in this case especially i know that you will do everything that is possible of course you will be relieved of all other duties and if it takes you months before you can lay hands upon him we shall consider it time well spent if you succeed at last from time to time change your quarters but let me know your address so that should i learn anything that may be useful i can communicate with you at once you had better take another name than that by which you are known in the force i shall be glad if after thinking the matter over you will write me a few lines stating what you propose to do in the first place  mark went back to his lodgings and sat there for some time thinking matters over his first thought was to attend the races for a time but seeing the number of people there and his own ignorance of bastows appearance he abandoned the idea and determined to try a slower but more methodical plan after coming to that conclusion he put on his hat and made his way to mrs cunninghams  well mr constable millicent said saucily as he entered any fresh captures  no i think that i have for the present done with that sort of thing i have served my apprenticeship and am now setting up on my own account  how is that mark  there is reason to believe that bastow has begun his work again near london as i have told you it is absolutely certain that he is not hiding in any of the places frequented by criminals here and there is every reason for supposing that he has been leading a quiet life somewhere or that he has been away in the country as long as that was the case there was nothing to be done but now that he seems to have set to work again it is time for me to be on the move i have seen the chief this morning and he has released me from all other duty and given me carte blanche to work in my own way  then why dont you leave the force altogether mark you know that i have always thought it hateful that you should be working under orders like any other constable  of course women dont like to be under orders millicent but men are not so independent and are quite content to obey those who are well qualified to give orders i have had a very interesting time of it  very interesting she said scornfully you have nearly been killed or shot half a dozen times you have been obliged to wear all sorts of dirty clothes to sleep in places where one would not put a dog and generally to do all sorts of things altogether unbecoming in your position  my dear i have no particular position he laughed and then went on more seriously my one position at present is that of avenger of my fathers murder and nothing that can assist me in the task is unbecoming to me but as i said it has been interesting i may almost say fascinating work i used to be fond of hunting but i can tell you that it is infinitely more exciting to hunt a man than it is to hunt a fox you are your own hound you have to pick up the scent to follow it up however much the quarry may wind and double and when at last you lay your hand upon his shoulder and say in the kings name there is an infinitely keener pleasure than there is when the hounds run down the fox one sport is perhaps as dangerous as the other in the one case your horse may fail at a leap and you may break your neck in the other you may get a bullet in your head so in that respect there is not much to choose between man and fox hunting there is the advantage though that in the one you have to depend upon your horses strength and in the other on your own courage  i know that you are an enthusiast over it mark and i can fancy that if i were a big strong man as you are i might do the same but if you are going now to try by yourself why should you not leave the force altogether  because in the first place i shall get all the information they obtain and can send for any assistance that i may require in the next place by showing this little staff with its silver crown i show that i am a bow street runner and can obtain information at once from all sorts of people which i could not get without its aid  well i wont say anything more against it mark how are you going to begin  i mean to go the round of all the places near londonsay within ten miles i shall stay from a week to a fortnight in each take a quiet lodging give out that i am on the lookout for a small house with a garden and get to talk with people of all kinds  but i cannot see what you have to inquire for  i imagine that bastow will have taken just the sort of house that i am inquiring for and in the course of my questions i may hear of someone living in just that sort of waya retired life not making many friends going up to london sometimes and keeping perhaps a deaf old woman as a servant or perhaps a deaf old mansomeone you see who would not be likely to hear him if he came home in the middle of the night or in the early morning once i hear of such a man i should ascertain his age and whether generally he agreed in appearance with what bastow is likely to be by this time then get down one of the constables who was at the trial and take his opinion on the subject after which we should only have to watch the house at night and pounce upon him as he came back from one of his excursions that is the broad outline of my plan i cannot help thinking that in the long run i shall be able to trace him and of course it will make it all the easier if he takes to stopping coaches or committing murderous burglaries  then i suppose we are not going to see you often mark  well not so often as you have done millicent for some time at any rate i shall not be more than five or six miles away and i shall often ride into town for the evening and return late with some sort of hope that i may be stopped on the road again it would save me a world of trouble you see if he would come to me instead of my having to find him  which side of london are you going to try first  the south side certainly there are a score of places that would be convenient to himdulwich clapham tooting wimbledon stockwell the list is a long one i should say wimbledon was about the most distant and i should think that he would not go so far as that if he only acted as a highwayman he might be as far off as epsom but if he is really the man concerned in these burglaries he must be but a short distance away he would hardly risk having to ride very far with the chance of coming upon the patrols i think that i shall begin at peckham that is a central sort of position and from there i shall work gradually west before i do so perhaps i shall try lewisham he is likely in any case to be quite on the outskirts of any village he may have settled in in order that he may ride in and out at any hour without his coming and going being noticed  you certainly seem to have thought it over in all ways mark you almost infect me with your ardor and make me wish that i was a man and could help you  you are much nicer as you are millicent  the girl tossed her head in disdain at the compliment  it is all very well mark she went on ignoring his speech but it seems to me that in finding out things a woman would be able to do just as much as a man she can gossip with her neighbors and ask about everyone in a place quite as well if not better than a man  yes i dont doubt that mark laughed and if i want your aid i shall have no hesitation in asking for it until then i hope you will go on with your painting and harping steadily like a good little girl  i am nearly eighteen sir and i object to be called a good little girl  well if i were to say a good young woman you would not like it  no i dont think i should i dont know why but when anyone says a girl is a good young woman or a nice young woman there always seems something derogatory about it it is almost as bad as saying she is a very respectable young person which is odious  then you see he went on you are quite getting on in society since mr cotters introduction to mrs cunningham and his mothers subsequent call you have got to know a good many people and go about a good deal  yes it has been more lively of late she admitted at first it was certainly monstrously dull here and i began to think that we should have to change our plans and go down again to weymouth and settle there for a time now i am getting contented but i admit even at the risk of making you conceited that we shall certainly miss you very much as you have been very good considering how busy you have been to come in three or four evenings every week for a chat  there has been nothing very good about it millicent it has been very pleasant to me it is like a bit of old times again when i am here with you two and seem to leave all the excitement of ones work behind as i come in at the door  i wonder whether the old time will ever come back again mark she said sadly  it never can be quite the old time again but when you are back at the old place it may be very near it  she looked at him reproachfully  you think that i shall change my mind mark but at heart you know better the day i am one and twenty i hope to carry out my intentions  well as i have told you before millicent i cannot control your actions but i am at least master of my own you can give away crowswood to whom you like but at least you cannot compel me to take it make it over to one of the hospitals if you likethat is within your power but it is not in your power to force me into the mean action of enriching myself because you have romantic notions in your mind i should scorn myself were i capable of doing such an action i wonder you think so meanly of me as to suppose for a moment that i would do so  it is a great pity my father did not leave the property outright to your father then all this bother would have been avoided she said quietly i should still have had plenty to live upon without there being any fear of being loved merely for my money  it would have been the same thing if he had mark said stubbornly my father would not have taken it and i am sure that i should not have taken it after him you are his proper heiress i dont say if he had left a son and that son had been a second bastow that one would have hesitated for he would probably have gambled it away in a year the tenants might have been ruined and the village gone to the dogs every man has a right to disinherit an unworthy son but that is a very different thing from disinheriting a daughter simply from a whim well dont let us talk about it any more millicent it is the only thing that we dont agree about and therefore it is best left alone  the next day mark established himself at an inn in peckham and for six weeks made diligent inquiries but without success there were at least a dozen men who lived quietly and rode or drove to their business in town many of them were put aside as needing no investigation having been residents there for years some of the others he saw start or return but none of them corresponded in any way with the probable appearance of the man for whom he was in search during this time he heard of several private coaches being held up on the road between epsom and london and three burglaries took place at streatham  he then moved to stockwell before proceeding there he had his horse up again from crowswood and rode into stockwell from the west he was dressed now as a small country squire and had a valise strapped behind his saddle the inn there was a busy one  i want a room he said as he alighted i shall probably stay here a few days  presently he had a talk with the landlord  i am on the lookout he said for a little place near town i have come in for a small estate in the country but i have no taste for farming and want to be within easy reach of town and at the same time to have a place with a paddock where i can keep my horse and live quietly i dont much care whether it is here or anywhere else within a few miles of town and i intend to ride about and see if i can find a place that will suit me i do not want to be nearer the town than this for i have not money enough to go the pace still i should like to be near enough to ride or walk in whenever i have a fancy for it  i understand sir of course there are plenty of places round here at clapham and tooting and i may say streatham but most of them are a deal too large for a bachelor still i have no doubt you would find a place to suit you without much difficulty these sort of places are most in request by london tradesmen who have given up business and want to get a little way out of town and keep a gig i should say there must be a score of such people living round here i am often asked about such places but i dont know of one to let just at the present moment  still there ought to be for of late people have not cared so much to come out here there has been such a scare owing to highwaymen and burglars that men with wives and families dont fancy settling out of town though there aint much work about it for to every one house that is broken into there are thousands that are not and besides the houses that these fellows try are large places where there is plenty of silver plate and a few gold watches and perhaps some money to be had  mark soon made the acquaintance of the stablemen and a few pints of beer put them on good terms with him every day he took rides round the neighborhood going out early stabling his horse and after having a chat with the ostlers strolling round the place clapham ewell and streatham were also visited  i know of a place that would just suit you the ostler at the greyhound at streatham said to him on the occasion of his third visit there but it is let my old mother is the gentlemans housekeeper he took the place through me for he rode up just as you have done one afternoon nigh a year ago he was from town he was he told me that he had been going the pace too hard and had to pull in and wanted a little place where he could keep his horse and live quiet for a time i told him of a place that i thought would suit him just outside the town and he called in the next day and told me he had taken it now he said i want a woman as house keeper an old woman you know i cannot be bothered with a young one if you speak a civil word to a wench she soon fancies you are in love with her i want one who can cook a chop or a steak fry me a bit of bacon and boil an egg and keep the place tidy i intend to look after my horse myself  well sir i said there is my old mother she is a widow and it is as much as she can do to keep off the parish she is reckoned a tidy cook and a good cleaner and she could keep herself well enough if it wasnt that she is so hard of hearing that many people dont care to employ her  i dont care a rap about that he said i shall not need to talk to her except to tell her what i will have for dinner and if she is deaf she wont want to be away gossiping does she live near here  she lives in the town i said i can fetch her down in half an hour  that will do says he i am going to have lunch when i have done i will come out and speak with her  well sir he engaged her right off and he tipped me a guinea for finding the place for him and there he has been ever since it was a lucky job for mother for she says there never was a gentleman that gave less trouble he is a wonderful quiet man and in general stops at home all the day smoking and reading he has a boy comes in two or three times a week to work in the garden sometimes of an evening he rides up to town i expect he cannot keep away from the cards altogether  is he an elderly man mark asked  lor no sir under thirty i should say he is a free handed sort of chap and though he aint particular about his eating he likes a bottle of good wine the old woman says even if it is only with a chop he never rides past here and i happen to be outside without tossing me a shilling to drink his health  mark went into the house and ordered lunch it would not have done to have asked any more questions or to have shown any special interest in the matter but he felt so excited that he could not have avoided doing so had he waited longer with the ostler after he had finished his meal he strolled out again into the stable yard  well he said to the ostler cant you put me up to another good thing just as you told that gentleman you were speaking to me about  there are two or three places that i know of that might suit you sir there is a house on the hill i know that it has got a paddock but i dont know how big it is it is in general known as hawleysthat is the name of the last people who lived there anyone will tell you which is the house then there is another place you turn to the right the third turning on the hill it stands by itself two or three hundred yards down it has got a goodish bit of ground there is only one house beyond it that is the one where my mother lives that was an old farm once but this was built later i believe the ground belonged to the farm you will know it by a big tree in front of it it stands back forty feet or so from the road  where does the road lead to  well sir it aint much of a road beyond the next house it is only a lane but you can get through that way into the main road through tooting down into balham and on to wimbledon  i think i will go and have a look at both those places mark said  will you take your horse sir  no i suppose it is not much above half a mile  about that sir  then i will walk i shall not be likely to find anyone to hold my horse there  mark had no difficulty in finding the house it looked as if it had been untenanted for some time and in the window was a notice that for keys and information applications were to be made at a shop in the high street well pleased to find that there was no one in the house mark entered the gate and passed round into what at one time had been a kitchen garden behind it at the bottom of this was a field of three or four acres  the ground was separated by a hedge from that of the house beyond this was fully a hundred yards away a well bred horse was grazing in the field a man smoking a pipe was watching a boy doing gardening work behind the house mark remained for nearly an hour concealed behind the hedge in hopes that he would come nearer at the end of that time however he went into the house and after waiting another ten minutes mark also left resisting the temptation to walk along the road and take a closer look at it for he felt that such a step would be dangerous for should the man notice anyone looking at the place his suspicions might be aroused  it was evident that the lane was very little used in many cases the grass grew across it there were marks of horses feet but none of wheels and he concluded that when going up to town the man came that way and rode quietly through streatham for the hoof prints all pointed in that direction and that on his return at night he came up the lane from the other road  well master what do you think of the houses the ostler asked on his return to the inn  i have only been to the one in the lane that you spoke of for i want to get back to town i had a good look at it but it is rather a dreary looking place and evidently wants a lot of repairs before it can be made comfortable the next time that i am down i will look at the other  mounting his horse he rode at a rapid pace into london and dismounted at bow street  you have news i see mr thorndyke the chief said when he entered  i have sir i believe that i have marked the man down at any rate if it is not he it is a criminal of some sortof that i have no doubt  that is good news indeed the chief said now tell me all about it  mark repeated the story the ostler had told him and the result of his own observations  you see he said the man whether bastow or not has clearly taken the place for the purpose of concealment for he can approach it by the lane which is a very unfrequented one on his return from his expeditions he has taken on a deaf old woman who will not hear him ride in at night and will have no idea at what hours he comes home riding out through the main street in the afternoon he would excite no notice and the story to the ostler would very well account for his taking the house and for his habit of coming up here of an afternoon and returning late i thought it best to come back and tell you and i will adopt any plan that you suggest for his capture  you say that he has been there for nearly a year  about a year the ostler said  then one of my men at least must have been very careless not to have found him out long ago let me see and he took down a volume of reports streatham tomlinson has been here a fortnight making every inquiry no man of suspicious appearance or of unknown antecedents here  humph that is not the first time that tomlinson has failed altogether in his duty however that does not matter for the moment what is your own idea mr thorndyke  my idea is that a couple of good men should go down with me to streatham and that we should be always on the watch in high street until we see him ride past directly it is dark we will go to his house fasten the old woman up and search it thoroughly if we find stolen property so much the better but in any case we shall wait inside the house until he returns and as he comes in throw ourselves upon him before he has time to draw a pistol i should say it would be as well the men should go down in a trap there is an empty house next door and when we go to search the place we can leave the horse and trap inside the gate directly we have him secure we can fetch up the trap put him in and one of the men and myself can drive him back here leaving the other in charge of the house which can then be searched again next day  i think that will be a very good plan and will avoid all unnecessary fuss i will send malcolm and chester down with you tomorrow where will you meet them  i should say that they had better put up at the greyhound i dont suppose he will go out until six or seven oclock but they had better be there earlier one should station himself in the main street the other concealing himself somewhere beyond the fellows house for it is likely enough that sometimes he may take the other way i will go down to the greyhound at six and will wait there until one of them brings me news that he has left  i think you had better come in in the morning and give your instructions to the men there will be less fear of any mistake being made i should say you had better put your horse up and come here on foot one can never be too careful when one is dealing with so crafty a rogue as this he certainly does not work with an accomplice but for all that he may have two or three sharp boys in his pay and they may watch this place by turns and carry him news of any stir about the office  i will walk in mark replied it is no distance from stockwell  mark slept but little that night he had believed all along that he should be finally successful but the discovery had come so suddenly that it had taken him completely by surprise it might not be the man and he tried hard to persuade himself that the chances were against his being so so that he should not feel disappointed should it turn out that it was some other criminal for that the man was a criminal he had not a shadow of doubt  the next morning he was at the office early the chief arrived half an hour later and the two officers were at once called in  you will go with mr thorndyke the chief said and he will give you instructions the capture is a very important one and there must be no mistake made we believe the man to be bastow i think you were present at his trial chester he escaped from sydney convict prison some three years ago and is i believe the author of many of the highway robberies and burglaries that have puzzled us so of course you will take firearms but if he is alone you will certainly have no occasion to use them especially as you will take him completely by surprise you will order a gig from morden and leave here about three oclock i should say you had better get up as two countrymen who have been up to market however mr thorndyke will explain the whole matter to you fully  mark then went off with the two officers to a private room and went into the whole matter with them  i think chester he said that you had better watch in the high street because you know the man at least you have seen him and may recognize him again  i think i should know him however much he has changed i took particular notice of him at the trial and thought what a hardened looking young scamp he was it is very seldom i forget a face when once i have a thorough look at it and i dont think i am likely to forget his  malcolm i think you cannot do better than take your place in the garden of the house next to his it is a place that has stood empty for many months and there is no chance of anyone seeing you his paddock comes up to the garden and you can by placing yourself in the corner see him as he comes out into the lane as soon as you see that he has gone come back to the greyhound with the news i shall be there and you will pick up chester in the high street as you come along of course you wont pretend to know me but the mere fact of your coming back will be enough to tell me that he has gone as soon as it gets dark we will pay our reckoning and drive off in the gig leaving it in the drive in front of the house this side of his i shall have strolled off before and shall be waiting for you there if he does not come out by ten oclock we can give it up for tonight you had better say that you have changed your mind and will take beds at the greyhound and the next morning drive off in your gig and put up again at the inn at the other end of the town the white horse i will come over again at two oclock in the afternoon you will bring handcuffs and you had better also bring a stout rope to tie him with  when every detail had been arranged mark strolled to dick chetwynds lodgings  well mark what has become of you i have not seen you for the last two months and i hear that you have not been near inglestons crib since i saw you  no i have been away on business you know i told you that i was spending much of my time in endeavoring to hunt down my fathers murderer i can tell you now that i have been working all the time with the bow street people and i think i know every thieves slum in london as well as any constable in the town  you dont say so mark well i should not like such work as that the prize fighters are a pretty rough lot but to go to such dens as those is enough to make one shudder but that does not explain where you have been now  no well having persuaded myself at last that his headquarters were not in town i have been trying the villages round and i believe that i have laid my hands on him at last  you dont say so mark well i congratulate you heartily both on your having caught the fellow and for having got rid of such horrid work where is he have you got him lodged in jail  no we are going to capture him tonight or if not tonight tomorrow night two of the bow street officers are going down with me and we shall have him as he comes home from one of his expeditions either on the highway or as a house breaker if he does not go this evening we shall wait until tomorrow but at any rate the first time that he goes out we shall have him  i have got a special engagement for this evening mark or i would offer to go with you and lend you a hand if necessary  there is no occasion for that dick we shall take the fellow by surprise as he goes into his own house and have him handcuffed before he can draw a pistol then when we have got him fairly tied up we shall put him into a light cart that we shall have handy and bring him straight to bow street to tell you the truth i am so excited over the thought that i do not know how i should have got through the day if i had not come in to have a chat with you  i can quite understand that old fellow well the best thing we can do is to take a stroll out and look at the fashions it is early yet but just at present it is all the rage to turn out early it will do me good too for i was at inglestons last night and the smoke and row has given me a headache i shall really have to give up going there except when there is an important fight on it is too much to stand and the tobacco is so bad that i am obliged to keep a suit of clothes for the purpose let us be off at once     chapter xvi   at four oclock mark put up his horse at the greyhound and chatted for a quarter of an hour with the ostler who had been making inquiries and had heard of one or two other houses in the neighborhood which were untenanted mark then strolled up the town exchanging a passing glance with chester who in a velveteen coat low hat and gaiters was chatting with a wagoner going with a load of hay for the next mornings market in london he turned into an inn called for a pint of the best port and sat down in the parlor at a table close to the window so that he could see all who went up or down he entered into conversation with two or three people who came in and so passed the time till seven when he felt too restless to sit still longer and went out into the street  when he was halfway to the greyhound he heard the sound of a horses hoofs behind him and saw a quietly dressed man coming along at an easy trot had it not been that he recognized the horse he could not have felt sure that its rider was the man whose coming he had been waiting for there being nothing in his appearance that would excite the slightest suspicion that he was other than a gentleman of moderate means and quiet taste either returning from a ride or passing through on his way to town he had a well built and active figure carried himself with the ease of a thorough horseman and nodded to one or two persons of his acquaintance and checking his horse at the principal butchers ordered some meat to be sent in that evening  mark could trace no resemblance in the face to that of the young fellow he remembered it was a quiet and resolute one if this were bastow he had lost the sneering and insolent expression that was so strongly impressed on his memory it might be the man but if so he was greatly changed marks first impression was that it could not be bastow but when he thought over the years of toil and confinement in the convict prison the life he had led in the bush and the two years he had passed since he returned home he imagined that the insolence of youth might well have disappeared and been succeeded by the resolute daring and dogged determination that seemed to be impressed on this fellows face  mark paused fifty yards before he reached the inn in a few minutes he saw chester coming along there was no one else in sight  is it bastow he asked as the officer came up  its bastow sure enough sir but he is so changed that if i had not had him in my mind i should not have recognized him i calculate that a man who has gone through what he has would have lost the expression he had as a boy he must have learnt a lot in the convict prison and the fact that he headed the mutiny and escaped from the searchers and managed to get home showed that he must have become a resolute and desperate man all those burglaries and the way in which he has several times stopped coaches single handed show his nerve and coolness i had all that in my mind as he came along and his face was pretty much as i expected to see it he is a cool hand and i can understand how he has given us the slip so long there is none of the shifty look about his eyes that one generally sees in criminals no glancing from side to side he rode with the air of a man who had a right to be where he was and feared no one he will be an awkward customer to tackle if we do not take him by surprise  yes i agree with you there however he wont have much chance of using either his pistols or his strength here is malcolm coming so i will walk away for a few minutes and let you go in first you can tell the ostler now that you will have your horse put in at nine oclock i have been thinking by the way that we had better take the trap round behind the house instead of leaving it in the drive the man may come back this way and if so he might hear the horse stamp or make some movement and that would at once put him on his guard  as the officers entered the inn mark went into the yard and told the ostler that he had met some friends and should let his horse remain there for the night  it is possible that they may drive me into the town in the morning he said and i shall very likely send a man down for the horse  at a quarter to nine he went out again and walked to the house he had before visited in ten minutes he heard the sound of wheels threw open the gate and the men jumping down led the horse in  you may as well take him out of the trap he said we cannot very well get that round the house but there is no difficulty about taking the horse  the officers had brought a halter and a nosebag full of corn the horse was fastened to a tree with soft ground round it the nosebag put on and a horse cloth thrown over its back then mark and his two companions went out into the lane and in a couple of minutes entered the next gate treading lightly and going round to the back of the house  a light burned in the kitchen and an old woman could be seen knitting they lifted the latch and walked in dropping her knitting she rose with an exclamation of terror  mark advanced alone  do not be frightened he said we are not going to do you any harm he took out his little ebony staff we are constables he went on and have orders to search this house we must secure you but you will be released in the morning now which is your room  in spite of marks assurance the old woman was almost paralyzed with terror however the two constables assisted her up to her room and there secured her with a rope taking care that it was not so tightly bound as to hurt her then they placed a gag in her mouth and left her  now let us search his room in the first place mark said when they came downstairs again i hardly expect we shall find anything you may be sure that he will have taken great pains to hide away any booty that he may have here and that it will need daylight and a closer search than we can give the place now before we find anything  the search of the house was indeed fruitless they cut open the bed prized up every loose board in the bedroom and the parlor lifted the hearth stone tapped the walls and searched every drawer then taking a lantern went out into the stable the officers were both accustomed to look for hiding places and ran their hands along on the top of the walls examining the stone flooring and manger  that is a very large corn bin mark said as he looked round when they desisted from the search  you are right sir we will empty it  there were two or three empty sacks on the ground near it and they emptied the corn into these so that there should be no litter about chester gave an exclamation of disappointment as they reached the bottom mark put his hand on the bin and gave it a pull  it is just as i thought he said it is fastened down i saw an ax in the woodshed malcolm just fetch it here  while the man was away mark took the lantern and examined the bottom closely we shant want the ax he said as he pointed out to chester a piece of string that was apparently jammed in the form of a loop between the bottom and side just get in and clear those few handfuls of corn out i think you will see that it will pull up then  there was however no movement in the bottom when mark pulled at the loop  look closely round outside he said handing malcolm who had now returned the lantern i have no doubt that there is a catch somewhere  in a minute or two the constable found a small ring between two of the cobblestones close to the foot of the wall he pulled at it and as he did so mark felt the resistance to his pull cease suddenly and the bottom of the bin came up like a trapdoor  that is a clever hiding place he said if i had not happened to notice that the bin was fixed we might have had a long search before we found it here  below was a square hole the size of the bin a ladder led down into it mark with a lantern descended four or five sacks piled on each other lay at the bottom leaving just room enough for a man to stand beside them  the top one is silver by the feel he said not yet broken up these smaller sacks are solid i suppose it is silver that has been melted down this and he lifted a bag some eighteen inches deep opened it and looked in contains watches and jewels now i think we will leave things here for the present and put everything straight he may be back before long  mark ascended the bottom of the trap was shut down again the corn poured in and the bags thrown down on the spot from which they had been taken they returned to the house shut the door and extinguished the light  that has been a grand find he said even if this is not bastow it will be a valuable capture  that it will mr thorndyke i have no doubt that this fellow is the man we have been in search of for the last eighteen months that accounts for our difficulty in laying hold of him he has been too crafty to try to sell any of his plunder so that none of the fences have known anything about him no doubt he has taken sufficient cash to enable him to live here quietly he intended some time or other to melt down all the rest of the plate and to sell the silver which he could do easily enough as for the watches and jewels he could get rid of them abroad  no doubt that is what he intended mark agreed it is not often these fellows are as prudent as he has been if they were your work would be a good deal more difficult than it is  you are right sir i dont know that i ever heard of such a case before the fellow almost deserves to get away  that would be rewarding him too highly for his caution mark laughed he is a desperate villain and all the more dangerous for being a prudent one now i think one of us had better keep watch at the gate by turns we shall hear him coming in plenty of time to get back here and be in readiness for him we must each understand our part thoroughly i will stand facing the door it is possible that he may light that lantern we saw hanging in the stable but i dont think it likely he will do so he will take off the saddle and either take the horse in therethere is plenty of food in the mangeror else turn it out into the paddock as he comes in i will throw my arms round him and you will at once close in one on each side each catch an arm tightly handcuff him and take the pistols from his belt dont leave go of his arms until i have lit the candle he may have another pistol inside his coat and might draw it  it was now one oclock and half an hour later malcolm who was at the gate came in quietly and said he could hear a horse coming along the lane  which way malcolm  tooting way  that is all right i have been a little nervous lest if he came the other way our horse might make some slight noise and attract his attention that was our only weak point  they had already ascertained that the front door was locked and bolted and that he must therefore enter through the kitchen they heard the horse stop in front a moment later the gate was opened and through the window they could just make out the figure of a man leading a horse then the stable door opened and they heard a movement and knew that the horse was being unsaddled they heard it walk into the stable the door was shut behind it and a step approached the back door it was opened and a voice said with an oath the old fool has forgotten to leave a candle burning then he stepped into the kitchen  in an instant there was a sound of a violent struggle deep oaths and curses two sharp clicks then all was quiet except heavy breathing and the striking of flint on a tinderbox there was the blue glare of the sulphur match and a candle was lighted mark then turned to the man who was standing still grasped in the hands of his two captors  arthur bastow he said producing his staff i arrest you in the kings name as an escaped convict as a notorious highwayman and house breaker  as his name was spoken the man started then he said quietly  you have made a mistake this time my men my name is william johnson i am well known here and have been a quiet resident in this house for upwards of a year  a resident but not a quiet resident bastow i dont think we are mistaken but even if you can prove that you are not bastow but william johnson a man of means and family we have evidence enough upon the other charges we have been in search of you for a long time and have got you at last you dont remember me though it is but eighteen months since we met but i fancy that i then left a mark upon you that still remains on your shoulder i am mark thorndyke and you will understand now why i have hunted you down  the game is not finished yet the man said recklessly the hunting down will be the other way next time mark thorndyke  i dont think so now chester you may as well tie his feet together and then search him when that is done i will look after him while you fetch the trap round  in his pockets were found two gold watches fortyeight pounds in gold and a hundred pounds in bank notes  we shall hear where this comes from tomorrow malcolm said as he laid them on the table it will save us the trouble of getting evidence from australia  the prisoner was placed in a chair and then the two officers went out to fetch the trap round  so you have turned thief catcher have you he said in a sneering tone that recalled him to marks memory far more than his face had done and you carry a bow street staff about with you and pretend to belong to the force that is a punishable offense you know  yes it would be if i had no right to use it mark said quietly but it happens that i have a right having been for a year and a half in the force i joined it solely to hunt you down and now that i have done so my resignation will be sent in tomorrow  and how is the worthy squire  mark started to his feet and seized one of the pistols lying before him  you villain he exclaimed i wonder you dare mention his nameyou his murderer  it was but tit for tat the man said coolly he murdered me body and soul when he sent me to the hulks i told him i would be even with him i did not think i had hit him at the time for i thought that if i had you would have stopped with him and would not have chased me across the fields  you scoundrel mark said you know well enough that you came back stole into his room and stabbed him  bastow looked at him with a puzzled expression  i dont know what you are talking about he said i fired at him through the windowi dont mind saying so to you because there are no witnessesand saw him jump up but i fancied i had missed him i saw you bolt out of the room and thought it better to be off at once instead of taking another shot you gave me a hard chase it was lucky for you that you did not come up with me for if you had done so i should have shot you i owed you one for having killed as good a comrade as man ever had and for that bullet you put in my shoulder before if i had not been so out of breath that i could not feel sure of my aim i should have stopped for you but i rode straight to town  a likely story mark said shortly what you will pretend that there were two murderers hanging round the house that nighta likely tale indeed  i tell you that if your father was killed by a knife or dagger i had nothing to do with it the man said i am obliged to the man whoever he was i had intended to go down again to reigate to finish the job myself i should scarcely have missed a second time so it is for that you hunted me down well i dont blame you i never forgive an injury and i see your sentiments are mine whether i killed your father or not makes no difference he was killed that is the principal point if i was going to be put on my trial for that i could prove that at eight oclock i was in a coffee house in covent garden i purposely kicked up a row there and was turned out so that if i were charged with that shooting affair i could prove that i was in london that evening  i cant quite believe that mark said a fast horse would have brought you up to town in an hour and a half and another fast horse would have taken you back again as quickly so you might have been in london at eight and back again at crowswood by half past twelve or one even if you stopped a couple of hours at a coffee house however you wont be tried for that those things on the table and the contents of that corn bin are enough to hang you a dozen times  curse you have you found that out bastow exclaimed furiously  we have mark replied it would have been wiser if you had got rid of your things sooner it was a clever hiding place but it is always dangerous to keep such things by you bastow  the man said no more but sat quietly in his chair until they heard the vehicle stop outside the gate then the two constables came in and lifting bastow carried him out and placed him in the bottom of the cart  you can loose the old woman now malcolm mark said as he took his seat and gathered the reins in his hand by eleven oclock no doubt one of the others will be down with the gig again and you can empty out the contents of that hole and bring them up with you i dont think that it will be of any use searching further you might have a good look all round before you come away there may be some notes stowed away though it is likely enough that they have been sent away by post to some receiver abroad  for some time after starting they could hear the prisoner moving about uneasily in the straw  i suppose there is no fear of his slipping out of those handcuffs chester  not a bit they are full tight for him i expect that that is what is making him uncomfortable  presently the movement ceased  he is still enough now mr thorndyke i should not be at all surprised if he has dropped off to sleep he is hardened enough to sleep while the gibbet was waiting for him  it was four oclock in the morning when they drove up at bow street two constables on duty came out to the cart  we have got a prisoner inspector chester said he is the man we have been looking for so long i fancy we have got all the swag that has been stolen for the last eighteen monthsbags of jewels and watches and sacks of silver he is handcuffed and his legs are tied so we must carry him in  the officer fetched out a lantern the other constable helped him to let down the backboard of the cart  now bastow wake up chester said here we are  but there was no movement  he is mighty sound asleep the constable said  well haul him out and taking the man by the shoulders they pulled him out from the cart  there is something rum about him the constable said and as they lowered his feet to the pavement his head fell forward and he would have sunk down if they had not supported him  the inspector raised the lantern to his face  why the man is dead he said  dead chester repeated incredulously  aye that he is look here and he pointed to a slim steel handle some three inches long projecting over the region of the heart you must have searched him very carelessly chester well bring him in now  they carried him into the room where two candles were burning mark followed them the inspector pulled out the dagger it was but four inches long with a very thin blade the handle was little thicker than the blade itself mark took it and examined it  i have not a shadow of doubt that this is the dagger with which he murdered my father the wound was very narrow about this width and the doctor said that the weapon that had been used was certainly a foreign dagger  i dont think this is a foreign dagger the inspector said on examining it although it may be the one that was used as you say mr thorndyke it has evidently been made to carry about without being observed  he threw back the dead mans coat  ah here is where it was kept you see the lining has been sewn to the cloth so as to make a sheath down by the seam under the arm i expect that knowing what would happen if he were caught he had made up his mind to do it all along well i dont know that you are to be so much blamed chester for passing your hand over his clothes you might very well miss this which is no thicker than a piece of whalebone well well he has saved us a good deal of trouble you say you have got most of the booty he has collected  i dont know that we have got all of it sir but we have made a very big haul anyhow it was a cunningly contrived place there was a big corn bin in the stable and when we had emptied out the corn it seemed empty however mr thorndyke discovered that the bin was fixed then we found that the bottom was really a trap door and under it was a sort of well in which were sacks and bags one of the sacks was full of unbroken silver two others contained silver ingots things that he had melted down and there was a large bag full of watches and jewels in his pocket we found a hundred pounds in bank notes about fifty guineas and a couple of gold watches  that he must have got tonight from the portsmouth coach we heard half an hour ago that it had been stopped near kingston the coachman shot and the passengers robbed it will be good news to some of them that we have got hold of their valuables well mr thorndyke i have to congratulate you most heartily on the skill with which you have ferreted out a man who had baffled us for so long and had become a perfect terror to the south of london no doubt we shall be able to trace a great portion of the property in that sack the capture has been splendidly effected  you will understand mark said that i do not wish my name to appear in the matter at all i have as you know been actuated by private reasons only in my search and i see no occasion why my name should be mentioned the evidence of chester and malcolm will be ample from information received they went down to this place searched it in his absence discovered the stolen goods and captured them having handcuffed and bound him one drove him up to town the other remaining to guard the treasure on his way he got at this hidden dagger and stabbed himself my evidence would not strengthen the case at all  no i dont see that it will be necessary to call you mr thorndyke the discovery of this hidden booty and the proceeds of the coach robbery would be quite sufficient beyond the coroners inquest there will be no inquiry had it been otherwise it might probably have been necessary to call you at the trial however as it is it will save a lot of trouble now we shall only need to find the owners of these bank notes i will send off a cart for the things as early as i can get one and will send a couple of constables round to the houses where burglaries have been committed to request the owners to come over and see if they can identify any of their property and those who do so can attend the inquest tomorrow though i dont suppose they will be called the chief will be mightily pleased when he hears what has taken place for he has been sadly worried by these constant complaints and i fancy that the authorities have been rather down upon him on the subject the announcement that the career of this famous robber has been brought to an end will cause quite a sensation and people round the commons on the south side will sleep more quietly than they have done lately i expect that if he had not put an end to himself we should have had to send him across to newington today for of course it is a surrey business though we have had the luck to take him i suppose we shall not see much of you in the future mr thorndyke  no indeed mark said my business is done and i shall send in my resignation this morning i dont regret the time that i have spent over it i have learned a great deal and have seen a lot of the shady side of life and have picked up experience in a good many ways  mark after requesting the inspector to find a man to go over to streatham and bring back his horse and writing an order to the ostler to deliver it walked across to his lodgings upon the whole he was not sorry that bastow had taken the matter into his own hands he had certainly while engaged in the search looked forward to seeing him in the dock and witnessing his execution but he now felt that enough had been done for vengeance and that it was as well that the matter had ended as it had he was wearied out with the excitement of the last fortyeight hours it was one oclock when he awoke and after dressing and going into covent garden to lunch at one of the coffee houses he made his way up to islington  taking a days holiday millicent asked as he came in  well not exactly millicent i have left school altogether  left school mark do you mean that you have decided that it is of no use going on any longer  i have given it up because i have finished it arthur bastow was captured last night and committed suicide as he was being taken to the station  an exclamation of surprise broke from mrs cunningham and millicent  it seems horrid to be glad that anyone has taken his own life the latter said but i cannot help feeling so for as long as he lived i should never have considered that you were safe and besides i suppose there is no doubt that if he had not killed himself he would have been hung  there is not a shadow of doubt about that mark replied we found the proceeds of a vast number of robberies at his place and also in his pockets the money he had taken from the passengers of the portsmouth coach an hour before we captured him so that putting aside that australian business altogether his doom was sealed  now please tell us all about it mrs cunningham said but first let us congratulate you most warmly not only on the success of your search but that the work is at an end  yes i am glad it is over at first i was very much interested in fact i was intensely interested all along and should have been for however long it had continued but at the same time i could do nothing else and one does not want to spend ones whole life as a detective at last it came about almost by chance and the only thing i have to congratulate myself upon is that my idea of the sort of place he would have taken was exactly borne out by fact  and mark then gave them a full account of the manner in which the discovery had been made and the capture effected  you see millicent i followed your injunction and was very careful taking him by surprise as i did i might have managed it single handed but with the aid of two good men it made a certainty of it and the whole thing was comfortably arranged  i think you have done splendidly mark mrs cunningham said it was certainly wonderful that you should have found him doing exactly what you had guessed even down to the deaf servant well now that is done and over what do you think of doing next  i have hardly thought about that he replied but at any rate i shall take a few weeks holiday and i suppose after that i shall settle down to the search for my uncles treasure i am afraid that will be a much longer and a vastly more difficult business than this has been here there were all sorts of clews to work upon bastow ought to have been captured months ago but in this other affair so far there is next to nothing to follow up we dont even know whether the things are in india or in england i believe they will be found but that it will be by an accident besides i fancy that we shall hear about them when you come of age millicent there was to have been no change till that time and i cannot help thinking that uncle george must have made some provisions by which we should get to know about them in the event of his death without his having an opportunity of telling anyone where they are  he might have been killed in battle he might have been drowned on his way home he had thought the whole matter over so thoroughly i do think the possibilities of this could not have escaped him as i told you mr prendergast made inquiries of all the principal bankers and indian agents here and altogether without success after he had done that i got a list of all the leading firms in calcutta and madras and wrote to them and all the replies were in the negative it is true that does not prove anything absolutely eighteen years is a long time and the chances are that during those years almost every head of a firm would have retired and come home such a matter would only be likely to be known to the heads and if as we thought likely the box or chest was merely forwarded by a firm there to england the transaction would not have attracted any special attention if upon the other hand it remained out there it might have been put down in a cellar or store and have been lying there ever since altogether forgotten  i dont see myself why you should bother any more about it perhaps as you say it will turn up of itself when i come of age at any rate i should say it is certainly as well to wait till then and see if it does especially as you acknowledge that you have no clew whatever to work on it is only three more years for i am eighteen next week and it certainly seems to me that it will be very foolish to spend the next three years in searching about for a thing that may come to you without any searching at all  well i will think it over  you see you really dont want the money mark she went on  no i dont want it particularly millicent but when one knows that there is something like 50000 pounds waiting for one somewhere one would like to get it your father worked for twenty years of his life accumulating it for us and it seems to me a sort of sacred duty to see that his labor has not all been thrown away  millicent was silent  it is very tiresome she said presently of course my father intended as you say that his savings should come to us but i am sure he never meant that they should be a bother and a trouble to us  i dont see why they should ever be that millicent as it is we have both sufficient for anything any man or woman could reasonably want and neither of us need fret over it if the treasure is never found still he wished us to have it and it is properly ours and i dont want it to go to enrich someone who has not a shadow of a right to it  on the following morning mark went to attend the inquest on bastow he did not go into the court however but remained close at hand in the event of the coroner insisting upon his being called however the two men only spoke casually in their evidence of their comrade roberts who had been also engaged in the capture one of the jurymen suggested that he should also be called but the coroner said  i really cannot see any occasion for it we are here to consider how the deceased came by his death and i think it must be perfectly clear that he came by it by his own act you have heard how he was captured that the spoils of the coach that he had just rifled were found upon him and that the booty he had been acquiring from his deeds for months past also was seized therefore as the man was desperate and knew well enough that his life was forfeited there was ample motive for his putting an end to his wretched existence i really do not think gentlemen that it is worth while to waste your time and mine by going into further evidence  finally a verdict of felo de se was returned with a strong expression of the jurys admiration of the conduct of constables malcolm chester and roberts who had so cleverly effected the capture of the man who had so long set the law at defiance     chapter xvii   four days later mark on his return from dinner found philip cotter sitting in his room waiting for him they had met on the previous evening and cotter had expressed his intention of calling upon him the next day  i am here on a matter of business thorndyke the latter said as they shook hands  of business mark repeated  yes you might guess for a year and i dont suppose that you would hit it it is rather a curious thing nearly twenty years ago  i can guess it before you go any further mark exclaimed leaping up from the seat that he had just taken your people received a box from india  that is so mark although how you guessed it i dont know  we have been searching for it for years mark replied our lawyer prendergast wrote to you about that box at least he wrote to you asking if you had any property belonging to colonel thorndyke and your people wrote to say they hadnt  yes i remember i wrote to him myself of course that was before you did me that great service and i did not know your name and we had not the name on our books what is in the box  jewels worth something like fifty thousand pounds  by jove i congratulate you old fellow that is to say if you have the handling of it well this is what happened the box was sent to us by a firm in calcutta together with bills for 50000 pounds the instructions were that the money was to be invested in stock and that we were to manage it and to take 100 pounds a year for so doing the rest of the interest of the money was to be invested the box was a very massive one and was marked with the letters xyz it was very carefully sealed our instructions were that the owner of the box and the money might present himself at any time  and that the proof of his ownership was to be that he was to use the word masulipatam mark broke in and produce a gold coin that would probablythough of this i am not certaincorrespond with the seals  he got up and went to the cabinet which he had brought up with him from crowswood unlocked it and produced the piece of paper and the coin  yes that looks like the seal thorndyke at any rate it is the same sort of thing why on earth didnt you come with it before and take the things away  simply because i did not know where to go to my uncle was dying when he came home and told my father about the treasure but he died suddenly and my father did not know whether it was sent to england or committed to someones charge in india or buried there we did the only thing we could namely inquired at all the banks and agents here and at all the principal firms in madras and calcutta to ask if they had in their possession any property belonging to the late colonel thorndyke  you see we did not know cotter went on any more than adam to whom the box belonged fortunately the agent sent in his communication a sealed letter on the outside of which was written this is to remain unopened but if no one before that date presents himself with the token and password it is to be read on the 18th of august 1789 that was yesterday you know  yes that was my cousins eighteenth birthday we thought if my uncle had left the box in anyones charge he would probably have given him some such instructions for at that time there was hard fighting in india and he might have been killed any day and would therefore naturally have made some provisions for preventing the secret dying with him  we did not think of it until this morning early though we have been rather curious over it ourselves when we opened it inside was another letter addressed to be delivered to john thorndyke esquire at crawley near hastings or at crowswood reigate or in the event of his death to his executors  i am one of his executors mark said mr prendergast the lawyer is the other i think i had better go round to him tomorrow and open the letter there  oh i should think you might open it at once thorndyke it will probably only contain instructions and at any rate as you have the coin and the word you could come round tomorrow morning and get the chest out if you want it  i wont do that mark said the coffer contains gems worth over 50000 pounds and i would very much rather it remained in your keeping until i decide what to do with it how large is it  it is a square box about a foot each way and it is pretty heavy probably from the setting of the jewels well anyhow i am heartily glad thorndyke i know of course that you are well off still 100000 poundsfor the money has doubled itself since we had itto say nothing of the jewels is a nice plum to drop into anyones mouth  very nice indeed although only half of it comes to me under my uncles will to tell you the truth i am more glad that the mystery has been solved than at getting the money the affair was a great worry to my father and has been so to me i felt that i ought to search for the treasure and yet the probability of finding it seemed so small that i felt the thing was hopeless and that really the only chance was that my uncle would have taken just the course he did and have fixed some date when the treasure should be handed over if not asked for i rather fancied that it would not have been for another three years for that is when my cousin comes of age  what cousin do you mean philip cotter asked i did not know you had one  well that is at present a secret cotterone of the mysteries connected with my uncles will for myself i would tell it in the market place tomorrow but she wishes it to be preserved at present you shall certainly know as soon as anyone by the way i have not seen you at mrs cunninghams for the last week and you used to be a pretty regular visitor  no the young man said gloomily i dont mind telling you that miss conyers refused me a fortnight ago i never thought that i had much chance but i had just a shadow of hope and that is at an end now  perhaps in the future mark suggested for the sake of saying something  no i said as much as that to her and she replied that it would always be the same and i gathered from her manner although she did not exactly say so that there was someone else in the case and yet i have never met anyone often there  perhaps you are mistaken mark said  well whether or not there is clearly no hope for me i am very sorry but it is no use moping over it my father and mother like her so much and they are anxious for me to marry and settle down altogether it would have been just the thing i do not know whether she has any money and did not care for of course i shall have plenty i shall be a junior partner in another six months my father told me so the other day he said that at one time he was afraid that i should never come into the house for that it would not have been fair to the others to take such a reckless fellow in but that i seemed to have reformed so thoroughly since that affair that if i continued so for another six months they should have no hesitation in giving me a share  it was too late to go up to islington that evening in the morning mark went with the still unopened letter to the solicitors the old lawyer congratulated him most heartily when he told him of the discovery that he had made  i am glad indeed mark not so much for the sake of the money but because i was afraid that that confounded treasure was going to unsettle your life when a man once begins treasure hunting it becomes a sort of craze and he can no more give it up than an opium smoker can the use of the drug thank goodness that is over so the capital amount is doubled and you are accordingly worth 70000 pounds more than you were this time yesterdaya fine windfall now let us see what your uncle says  he broke the seal the letter was a short one and began  my dear john  if you have not before you receive this got my treasure you will get it on the 18th or 19th of august 1789 i have made a will which will give you full instructions what to do with it i may say though that i have left it between a little daughter who was born six months ago and your son mark my own intentions are to stop out here until i get the rank of general and i have taken the measures that i have done in case a bullet or a sharp attack of fever carries me off suddenly i hope that you will have carried out the provisions of my will and i hope also that i shall have come home and talked the whole matter over with you before i go under  your affectionate brother  a singular man mr prendergast said as he laid the letter down on the table beside him what trouble these crotchety people do give i suppose you have altogether put aside that folly of his about the jewels  well no i cant say that i have mr prendergast do you know that i have a fancyit may only be a fancy but if so i cannot shake it offthat i am watched by lascars there was one standing at the corner of the street as i came up this morning and again and again i have run across one it is not always the same man nor have i any absolute reasons for believing that they are watching me still somehow or other i do come across them more frequently than seems natural  pooh nonsense mark i should have thought that you were too sensible a fellow to have such ridiculous fancies in your head  of course i should never have thought of such a thing mr prendergast if it had not been for what my father told me that my uncle was desperately in earnest about it and had an intense conviction that someone watched his every movement  dont let us talk of such folly any longer the lawyer said irritably now that you have got the money the best thing you can do is to go at once and carry out what was the wish both of your father and your uncle and ask your cousin to marry you that will put an end to the whole business and i can tell you that i am positively convinced that the day she gets twentyone she will renounce the property and that if you refuse to take it she will pass it over to some hospital or other you cannot do better than prevent her from carrying out such an act of folly as that and the only way that i can see is by your marrying her i gathered from what you said when i gave you the same advice at reigate that you liked her and should have done it had it not been for her coming into the estate instead of you well you are now in a position to ask her to marry you without the possibility of its being supposed that you are a fortune hunter  i will think about it mr prendergast of course this money does make a considerable difference in my position however i shall do nothing until i have got the jewels off my hands  well a couple of days will manage that the lawyer said you have only got to take the box to a first class jeweler and get him to value the things and make you an offer for the whole of them  mark did not care to press the subject and on leaving went to cotters bank he was at once shown into his friends room and the latter took him to his father  it is curious mr thorndyke the latter said heartily that we should have been keeping your money all this time without having the slightest idea that it belonged to you we are ready at once to pay it over to your order for if you pronounce the word you know of and i find that the coin you have corresponds with the seal on the box the necessary proof will be given us that you have authority to take it away i have had the box brought up this morning so that we can compare the seal  the box was taken out of the strong safe and it was at once seen that the coin corresponded with the seals  i will leave it with you for the present mr cotter it contains a large amount of jewels and until i have decided what to do with them i would rather leave them it would be madness to have 50000 pounds worth of gems in a london lodging even for a single night as to the money that also had better remain as it is at present invested as i told your sonthat and the jewels are the joint property of myself and another i dare say that in a few days half of the money will be transferred to the name of the other legatee that can be easily done i shall get my lawyer mr prendergast to call upon you mr cotter i suppose it would be better that some legal proof that we are entitled to the money should be given  i shall be glad to see him and to take his instructions the banker said but in point of fact i regard the property as yours i have nothing to do with wills or other arrangements i simply received the box and the cash with an order that they should be delivered to whomsoever should come with the word masulipatam and a coin to match the seals that you have done and with subsequent dispositions i have no concern i shall be happy to keep this box for you as long as you should think proper and i have also written out an acknowledgement that i hold securities of the value at the closing prices yesterday of 103000 pounds 16 shillings and he handed the paper to mark  as the latter left the bank he looked up and down the street and muttered an angry exclamation as he caught sight of a rough looking fellow just turning a corner into a side street the glance was so momentary a one that he could not say whether the man was a colored seaman but he certainly thought that he was a lascar  i am going to have trouble about that bracelet he said to himself as he hailed a hackney coach and told him to drive to islington i am convinced that the colonel was right and that there are some men over in this country with the fixed purpose of seeing what is done with those jewels and obtaining them if possible how they could tell that they were deposited at cotters beats me altogether it may be indeed that they really knew nothing about it and have simply been watching me they can hardly have been watching me for the last nine months and yet curiously enough though i have never given the matter a thought since charley gibbons said that it was a dark colored man who brought the news that took them to my rescue and saved my life i have often run against lascars and if they have taken this trouble all along now that they have seen me come out of the bank i shall be watched night and day  it is a creepy sort of idea i should not be afraid of any number of them if they attacked me openly but there is no saying what they might do i wish ramoo had been here i would have consulted him about it but as i got a letter from him only last week saying that he had on the day of writing it arrived in calcutta it is of no use wishing that at any rate i cannot do better than stick to the plan that my uncle sketched out and take them across to amsterdam it would be very unfair to take them to any jeweler here he might have them in his possession for a week or ten days before he made me any definite offer for them and during that time i would not give a fig for his life if i distribute the stones at amsterdam they would hardly set about attacking twelve diamond merchants one after another well at any rate i must say nothing about the affair to millicent and mrs cunningham it was bad enough my running risks in the pursuit of bastow but this would be ten times worse and i know millicent would be for letting the things remain for good at the bankers but i have no idea of allowing myself to be frightened by two or three black scoundrels into throwing away 50000 pounds  mrs cunningham and millicent were sitting in their bonnets in the parlor  here you are at last sir the girl said another five minutes and we should have gone out you told us that you would come early and now it is twelve oclock and you are generally so punctual in your appointments what have you got to say for yourself  a good many things have happened since then millicent last night your friend mr cotter called upon me  why do you say my friend he was your friend and it was entirely through you that we knew him at all  well we will say our friend millicent and he made a communication to me that this morning i had to go to mr prendergast and make a communication to him  what do you mean by your communications millicent asked laughing you are quite mysterious mark  and then i had to go he went on without heeding her interruption to cotters bank where i saw both our friend and his father and there is the result of these communications and that interview and he threw the paper to her  what does it mean she asked in astonishment after glancing through it  it means dear that your father took exactly the precautions i thought he would take and after sending his money and jewels home he sent a sealed letter to the firm with whom he deposited them which happened to be cotters with instructions that should no one present himself with the word and coin by the 18th of august 1789that is to say on your eighteenth birthdaythe envelope should be opened it was so opened and it contained a letter that was to be sent to my father or in the case of his death before that date to his executors  how wonderful the girl said i had quite given up all idea of it but how is it that it came to be so much have they sold the jewels  no you see it is the compound interest going on for seventeen years and perhaps some rise in the value of the securities that has doubled the original sum invested as for the jewels i have left them at the bank i should not care about having 50000 pounds worth of such things in my rooms and i should not think that you would like to have them here either  certainly not mrs cunningham said emphatically you did quite right mark i dont think i could sleep even if you had half a dozen of your detective friends posted round the house  still i suppose we shall have a chance of seeing them millicent said  certainly i can make an appointment with philip cotter for you to see them at the bank or if i take them to a jeweler to value you could see them there but i should think that the bank would be the best i am sure that cotter would put his room at your disposal and of course if you would like to have some of them for yourself you could select any you liked but i expect that they wont look much in their present settings the indian jewelers have not the knack of setting off gems however there is no hurry about them one way or another the money i have told cotters father shall for the present remain as it is invested it is all in the funds cotter said for although the instructions were that it was to be put into good securities he did not feel justified under the peculiar circumstances in going outside government stock mr prendergast is quite of opinion that it would be better to make no change until you come of age i did not know whether you would wait till then for some purpose or other you might want to use some of it  millicent shrugged her shoulders  i think i would much rather have had just the money i had before mark all this will be a great nuisance i am sure i think there ought to be a law against women having more than 20000 pounds whether in money or in land  mark laughed  it would be a bad thing for spendthrift young noblemen millicent how are they to pay off their debts and mortgages if there were no heiresses ready to do so in exchange for a title  it would be a good thing for them i consider the girl said indignantly in the first place they would not impoverish themselves if they knew that there was no way of building up their fortune again and in the next place if they did ruin themselves they would have to either set to work to earn an honest living or blow out their brains if they have any to blow out i can assure you that i dont feel at all exultant at getting all this money and i think that my father was quite right in wishing that i should know nothing about it until i married but on the other hand i am heartily glad more glad than i can say mark that you have come into your share  i am glad for one reason millicent that is that this must put an end to the ridiculous idea you have of giving up crowswood your father has made me rich beyond anything i could possibly have expected from him i suddenly find myself a wealthy man and i can buy another estate for myself worth more than crowswood if inclined to settle down as a squire therefore your theory that i have been disappointed in not inheriting what i thought was my fathers estate falls to the ground altogether in no case would i ever have accepted your sacrifice if you had liked to hand it over to st bartholomews or guys hospital or to give it away to any other charity i would not have prevented you but i would never have accepted it for myself now thank goodness the question cannot arise for you must see that even looking at the matter from a purely business point of view i have benefited to an enormous and altogether unexpected extent by your fathers will and if any contest between us could arise it should be on the ground that he has acted unfairly to you by giving me so large a proportion of the money that in the course of nature you should have inherited it was not even as if he had known and liked me for i was but four years old at the time he wrote the letter saying that i was to share the money and jewels with you  you are very obstinate and very disagreeable mark she said with tears in her eyes  i think the obstinacy has been principally on your side millicent though certainly i should not think of saying that you have been disagreeable it has been an excess of kindheartedness on your part and you have resolutely closed your eyes to the fact that had i been willing to take advantage of your generosity i should have lacked the courage to do so for i should have been pointed at wherever i went as a mean fellow who took advantage of his little cousins romantic generosity pray dear let us say no more about it we are two rich young people we have both an estate yours i grant is the larger but if i choose i can increase mine until it is quite as large as crowswood we can be better friends than we have been for the last year because this point of dispute has always stood between us and made us uncomfortable now you will have to think over what you would like done and whether you wish any change made in your manner of living  did you tell mr cotter millicent laughed after a pause that i had a half share in the money  no that was a matter for you to decide not for me i told him that i was only a half shareholder but there was no necessity to say who it was who had the other half when i was talking to philip cotter the words my cousin slipped out but he did not associate it in any way with you it might have been the son of another brother or of a sister of my fathers  in that case then we will certainly make no change will we mrs cunningham  i think millicent that mr prendergast and mark will probably be of opinion that you ought now to be introduced regularly into society the fact that you are a rich heiress might as your father so much wished remain a secret but it is one thing having this blazoned about and quite another for you to be living quietly here where with the exception of mr cotter and a few other friends you have no society whatever certainly it was not the wish of your father that you should remain unmarried you are quite pretty and nice enough to be sought for yourself alone and i must say that i think now that you have finished with your various masters it would be well that you should go out a good deal more and that as a first step we should go down to bath this year instead of paying another visit to weymouth as we had arranged  i dont want any change at all mrs cunningham if i am to get married i shall be married if i am not i shall not fret about it  but for all that millicent mark said mrs cunningham is right we quite agree that there is no occasion whatever for you to go about labeled a good estate and over 70000 pounds in cash but i do think that it is right that you should go into society with the exception of philip cotter dick chetwynd and two or three other of my friends you really know very few people you have now gone out of mourning and i think that mrs cunninghams proposal that you should go down to bath is a very good one i shall not be sorry for a change myself for i have been engrossed in my work for a long time now i can go down a day or two before you and get you comfortable lodgings and will myself stay at a hotel although i have no intimate friends beyond those from reigate i know a large number of men of fashion from meeting them at the boxing schools and other places and could introduce you both and get you into society  i am altogether opposed to the idea millicent said decidedly you want to trot me out like a horse for sale  no millicent mark said calmly i only want you to have the same advantages that other girls have neither more nor less and for you to enjoy yourself as others do there is nothing undignified or objectionable about that especially as we are agreed that nothing shall be said about your fortune well we will think it over mr prendergast and i certainly do not wish to act as tyrants and there is no occasion to come to a decision in a hurry we have only discovered our good fortune today and can scarcely appreciate the difference that it will make to us we can think over what will be for the best at our leisure and see if we cannot hit upon some plan that will be agreeable to you  thank you mark she said gratefully i am afraid that you must think me very disagreeable and cross but though you as a man have not the same sort of feelings i can assure you that i feel all this money and so on to be a heavy burden and were it not for your sake i could wish heartily that this treasure had never been discovered at all  i can quite understand that he said quietly at the present moment even i do not see that it will be of much advantage to me but it may be that some day i shall see it in a different light it has come upon me almost as suddenly as it has upon you i thought that after i had finished with the bastow affair i should set to work to find out this treasure and that it would probably take me out to india occupy me there for some time and that afterwards i might travel through other places and be away from england three or four years now the matter is altogether altered and i shall be some time before i form any fresh plans in fact these must depend upon circumstances  mrs cunningham had left the room two or three minutes before thinking that mark might be able to talk her charge into a more reasonable state of mind were he alone with her and he added  of one circumstance in particular  she looked up inquiringly  well millicent it depends a great deal upon you i know you think that all that has happened during the past year has been a little hard upon you and i thoroughly agree with you you were fond of crowswood and were very happy there and the change to this somewhat dull house just at a time when you are of an age to enjoy pleasure has been a trial then too there has been this question of the estate upon your mind but you must remember it has been somewhat of a trial to me also i grant that i have had plenty of occupation which has been in every way beneficial to me and have not at all lamented leaving the country but in one respect it has been a trial i dont know whether it ever entered your mind before that sad time at home that i was getting to care for you in a very different way to that in which i had done before  my father i think observed it for he threw out a very plain hint once that he would very gladly see us coming together however i never spoke of it to you i was young and you were young it seemed to me that there was plenty of time and that moreover it would not be fair for me to speak to you until you had had the opportunity of going out and of seeing other men then came the evening before his death when my father told me how matters really stood and he again said that there was a way by which all trouble could be obviated but i saw that it was not so and that the hope i had entertained must be put aside i had never told you i loved you when i seemed to be the heir of the property and you only the daughter of an old comrade of his and i saw that were i to speak now when you were the heiress it could not but appear to you that it was the estate and not you that i wanted and i felt my lips were sealed forever mr prendergast said that day when he came down to the funeral and you told him that you would not take the property that it might be managed in another way and you said that you did not want to be married for your money so you see you saw it in exactly the same light as i did  my first thought this morning when mr cotter told me that the money had mounted up to over 100000 pounds was that it would unseal my lips you were still better off than i was but the difference was now immaterial i was a rich man and had not the smallest occasion to marry for money whether i married a girl without a penny or an heiress could make but little difference to me as i have certainly no ambition to become a great landowner i still think that it would have been more fair to you to give you the opportunity of seeing more of the society of the world before speaking to you but you see you are opposed to that and therefore it would be the same did i wait patiently another year which i dont think i should be able to do i love you millicent it is only during the past eighteen months when i have thought that i had lost you that i have known how much i love you and how much my happiness depends upon you i can truly say that were you penniless it would make no shadow of difference to me it is no longer a question of arranging matters comfortably it is a question of love the estate is nothing to me it never has been anything and it does not count at all in the scale i hope that you will put it altogether out of your mind in giving me an answer and that if you cannot say as truly and wholly as i do i love you that you will say as frankly as you have always spoken to me i love you very much as a cousin mark but not in that way  the girl had sat perfectly quiet while he was speaking  he was standing before her now and he took one of her hands  i love you dear i love you with all my heart do you love me  then she looked up and rose to her feet and placed both hands upon his shoulders  as you love me so i love you mark  after that conversation languished till mrs cunningham came into the room five minutes later  we have come to the conclusion mrs cunningham he said that there will be no necessity for the visit to bath millicent is otherwise provided for she has promised to be my wife  i am glad mark glad indeed and she took millicent in her arms and kissed her tenderly i have all along hoped for it but i began to be afraid that you were both such obstinate young people that it would never come about i know that your father wished it mark and he told me that his brother had said that it would be a good arrangement if some day you should come to like each other i have guessed for the last year and indeed before then that millicent would not say no if you ever asked her but this stupid estate seemed to stand in the way of late i have even come to hope that the obstinate girl would keep to her intention and that if as i knew would be the case you refused to take the estate she would give it away to some charity in that case there could be nothing to prevent your speaking and even then you would have been between you very fairly equipped with this worlds goods however the present is a far better solution and the discovery of the treasure has saved you from three years waiting before things were straightened out i feel as if i were her mother mark having had her in my charge since she was a baby and as she grew up it became my fondest hope to see you united some day and i think that i am almost as pleased that my hope has been fulfilled as you are yourselves     chapter xviii   after thinking over the best way in which to set about the work of carrying the diamonds to amsterdam mark decided upon asking the advice of his late chief the latter said as mark entered his room  i did not expect to see you here again mr thorndyke  well sir i have come to ask your advice about another matter altogether  what is it now  i have to convey a diamond bracelet of very great value across to amsterdam i have reasons to believe that there is a plot to seize it on the way and that the men engaged will hesitate at nothing to achieve their object under these circumstances i should be very much obliged if you will tell me what would be the best course to pursue i must say that the bracelet is with many other jewels in a strong teak box of about a foot square at present in the possession of our bankers they were brought from india by my uncle i imagine that the rest of the jewels are of comparatively little importance in the eyes of these men though doubtless they would take them also if they lay their hands on them the bracelet however is of special interest to them not so much for its intrinsic value as because it was stolen from one of their sacred idols  this was about twenty years ago but i have reason to believe that the search for it on the part of some hindoos connected with the temple has never ceased the soldier who took it was murdered his comrade into whose hands they next passed was also murdered they next came to my uncle who forwarded it at once to england his bungalows were searched again and again until probably the fellows came to the conclusion that he must have either buried it or sent it away nevertheless to the day of his death he was firmly convinced that he was closely followed and every movement watched he warned my father solemnly that he too would be watched but as far as we know it was not so at any rate we had no reason to suppose that the house was ever entered on the other hand i am convinced i have been watched more or less closely ever since i came up to town and as i came out from the bank yesterday i saw a mana colored fellow i believeon the watch  my uncle said that my life would not be worth an hours purchase so long as i had the bracelet in my possession and advised that it should be taken straight over to amsterdam broken up and the diamonds sold singly to the merchants there  it is a curious story mr thorndyke i own to ignorance of these indian thieves and their ways but it certainly seems extraordinary that so hopeless a quest should be kept up for so long a time you are sure that it is not fancy on your part that you have been watched i know you are not the sort of man to take fancies in your head but as you have had the matter so strongly impressed upon you you might naturally have been inclined to think this would be the case when it was not so  no i dont think there is any chance of my being mistaken it is only of late that i have thought about it but when i did so and thought over what had passed since i came to london i recalled the fact that i had very often come across foreign seamen sometimes they were lascars at others they might have been italian or spanish seamen and you see sir it was as i told you at the time some foreign sailor who came and informed gibbons that i had fallen into the hands of a gang of criminals and that i should certainly be killed if i was not rescued immediately gibbons at once got together half a dozen fighting men and as you know rescued me just in time it was extraordinary that the man never came forward to obtain any reward  that was a friendly act mr thorndyke  yes i have no reason to suppose that these men would be hostile to me personally i was not the thief i was simply the person who happened to be in possession or rather might come into possession of the bracelet from the close watch they had kept they were i imagine well aware that i had not got it but may have thought and doubtless did think that i had some clew to its hiding place and should sooner or later get it with my death the clew might be finally lost and my life was consequently of extreme importance to them and therefore they took steps to have me rescued and the fact that they learned this and knew how friendly i was with gibbons shows how close was the watch kept over me no doubt had gibbons refused to help them they would have come here at once  certainly after what you say it would seem that your conjecture is right and in this case if i were you i should take the bracelet out of the case and conceal it about me i would not fetch it myself from the bank  i dont think i should be much safer so mark said thoughtfully in the first place i must go to the bank to get them and i might be murdered merely on the supposition that i had brought the bracelet away in the next place even if i got to amsterdam safely and got rid of the bracelet and returned unnoticed by them a fresh danger would arise when i got the other gems into my possession for they could not be certain whether the diamonds were still among them or not  i should hardly think that would be the case if they watch you as strictly as you believe even if none of them accompanied you they would soon find out what diamond merchants you went to and the leader might call upon these men stating that he was commissioned to purchase some diamonds of exceptional value for an eastern prince in which case he would be sure to obtain sight of them  if i had your business to perform i would not go near the bank again but would send some friend i could trust to go and open the box and take out the bracelet and make it into a small parcel he should hand it to you privately as you are on your way to embark for amsterdam then i would take with me one or two of my men and say a couple of your prize fighters and with such a guard you ought to be fairly safe  i think that is a capital plan mark said and if i dont go to the bank there will be nothing to lead them to suppose that i have taken them out or that i am just going across to holland  mark then went straight to dick chetwynds lodgings  i want you to do me a service dick he said  with pleasure mark what sort of service is it if it is anything in my power you know that you can absolutely rely upon me you are not going to fight a duel are you and want a second  no quite another sort of business i will tell you shortly what it is i have to convey an extremely valuable diamond bracelet to amsterdam and i have reason to believe that there will be an attempt to murder me and to carry off the jewels before i can dispose of them it happened in this way and he then related the history of the diamonds the reason he was followed and the suggestions that the chief of the bow street detectives had given him  that is all right dick said when he concluded it is a rum business but certainly i will do what you ask me and what is more i will go over with you to amsterdam and see the thing through it is an interesting business if it is a queer one  you know philip cotter  of course mark why i have met him with you several times  i will give you a note to ask him to allow you to open the case and to take from it the bracelet i dont know whether it is a regular gold mounted bracelet or simply some diamonds that have been fastened together as a necklace however i suppose you are sure to recognize them they are altogether exceptional stones and will certainly be done up in a packet by themselves whatever the others may be say that you will call in and take them away some other time of which i will give him notice by letter i will write the note now and if you can spare time to go there today all the better for i shall be glad to get the business over then i will come again tomorrow morning and we will arrange the details of the plan i will look in the shipping list and see what vessels are sailing for amsterdam when we have fixed on one it will be best for you to take our passages under any names you like so that they are not our own the detectives will take their passages separately and so will gibbons and whoever else goes with us  i will go at once mark  dont go straight there dick if these fellows are dogging my footsteps everywhere and saw me coming here they might take it into their heads to follow you  oh they can never be doing all that sort of thing thats too much to believe however to please you i will go into my club for a quarter of an hour shall i come round to your rooms this evening or will you come here  i think i will put off our meeting altogether until tomorrow morning i have an engagement this evening that i cannot very well get out of  all right mark just as you please what time will you come round in the morning  about the time you have finished breakfast i will go now and have a look at the shipping list  they parted at the door and mark went to the coffee house where shipping matters were specially attended to and where master mariners might often be met conversing together or with ship owners or merchants on going through the list he found that the fast sailing brig essex of 204 tons and mounting eight guns would sail for amsterdam in three days time and would take in goods for that place and should sufficient freight be obtained for any other dutch port it was also announced that she had good accommodation for passengers information as to cargo could be obtained from her owners on tower hill or from the captain on board between the hours of ten and twelve then in small type it was stated that the essex was at present lying in the outside tier nearly opposite andersons wharf  mark made a note of all these particulars in his pocketbook and then went to inglestons public house  morning mr thorndyke the man said havent seen yer for the last month or so  no i have been out of town do you expect gibbons in here this morning  it is about his time sir when he has nothing in particular to see about like a turn with the mauleys this morning  not this morning ingleston i have got some engagements for the next day or two where i could not very well show myself with a black eye or a swelled nose you have given me a good many of both  well mr thorndyke when one stands up against a man who is as strong as ones self and a mighty quick and hard hitter you have got to hit sharp and quick too you know my opinion that there aint half a dozen men in the country could lick you if you had a proper training  i suppose you couldnt get away for a week or maybe two he said  lor bless you no sir who would there be to keep order here at night when i first came here i had not given up the ring and i fought once or twice afterwards but lor bless you i soon found that i had got either to give up the pub or the ring and as i was doing a tidy business here i thought it best to retire since then business has grown you see boxing is more fashionable than it used to be and there are very few nights when one dont have a dozen corinthians in heresometimes there are twice as manyeither to see some of the new hands put on the mauleys and judge for themselves how they are going to turn out or maybe to arrange for a bout between some novice they fancy and one of the west countrymen no sir i could not do it anyhow i should not like to be away even for one night though i know gibbons would look after things for me as for being away for a week i could not do it for any money no sir my fight with jackson last year was the last time i shall ever go into the ring i was a fool to go in for that but i got taunted into it i never thought that i should lick him though as you know sir i have licked a good many good men in my time but jackson is an out and out man and he has got a lot more science than i ever had my only chance was that i could knock him out of time or wear him down but he was too quick on his pins for me to do the former ah gibbons here is mr thorndyke he wants to see you you had best go into my room behind the bar  want to get hold of a fresh hand mr thorndyke gibbons asked when they had sat down by the fire  no gibbons it is another business altogether have you got anything particular to keep you in town for the next fortnight it may not be over a week but it may be over a fortnight  no sir the man said after taking three or four draws at his long pipe no sir they wont want the ropes and stakes for another three weeks so i am your man if you want me what is it for sir  well it is rather a curious affair gibbons i have to take a very valuable bracelet over to amsterdam to sell there and i have very strong reasons for believing that if some fellows get an inkling of it they will try to put me out of the way and get hold of the diamonds i want a couple of good men to go with me  well sir i should say you and me could lick a dozen ordinary chaps without thinking anything of it  i dare say we could gibbons in a stand up fight without weapons but i fancy these fellows will not try that they are foreigners and the first thing they would try would be to put a dagger between my shoulders as i walked up and down on deck at night or more likely still creep into my cabin and stab me while i was asleep if the voyage were only to last one night i might sit up pistol in hand but if the wind is foul we might be a week we are a pretty strong party mr chetwyndyou know himis going with me there will also be two runners from bow street and i want you to take another good man with you of course on board we shall separate the bow street men will watch the passengers and you and your mate will smoke your pipes and keep yourselves ready to join in if you see there is going to be a row but i rather think that the passage will be a quiet one at amsterdam until i have got rid of the diamonds i certainly should not care about going out into the street after nightfall without having you close behind me  all right sir i should say tom tring would be as good a man as one could get at the job what is the money to be mr thorndyke  well what do you think yourself gibbons  i take it you pay all expenses sir  yes everything  would five and twenty guineas a head be too much  no i will do better than that i will give you five and twenty guineas each when we get to amsterdam and i will give you another twentyfive each if i come back here safe and sound  well i call that handsome one could not want more and you can rely on it that tring will jump at the offer he has not been able to get a fight on lately and he is rather in low water  well you will both get up as quiet traders i dont know what other passengers there may be but i dont want them to know that you belong to the fancy  i twig sir we will get up quiet like  then i want you tomorrow morning gibbons to go down to holmes  moore no 67 tower street and take two first class tickets to amsterdam on board the essex which sails on saturday i dont know what the passage money will be but this is sure to be enough and we can settle accounts afterwards you will find out what time of day she will start  all right governor i suppose you will be here again before that  no i dont suppose i shall unless there is some change in the arrangements if for any reasons tring cannot go with you you will get somebody else instead you are sure that you quite understand your instructions here is the name and address of the people in tower street  all right sir you may make sure that when you go down to the ship you will see the two of us on board  it needed but a few minutes at bow street to inform the chief of the arrangements that had been made  i have told off chester and malcolm one of them shall go down and take their tickets of course they will take their passages in the fore cabin as the danger if there is danger may come from there and you will have your other two men with you aft i fancy myself that there is hardly any chance of your being in any way troubled while on board it will be considered that there will be a vastly greater chance of carrying out any plan they may have formed at amsterdam than there would be on board a ship you see if there were any struggle whatever on board there would be no escape for them  for myself of course i cannot give any opinion worth having in a matter so different from anything we have to do with here and i should have unhesitatingly scoffed at the idea of anyone watching the movements of people for a long number of years in order to obtain the possession of jewels however valuable however your uncle was well acquainted with the habits of hindoos and was not a man to be lightly alarmed you yourself after your year with us should not be deceived in such a matter as being yourself followed under these circumstances you are quite right to take every precaution and as you pay well for the services of our two men even if i had no belief whatever in the existence of danger to you i should not feel justified in refusing to let you have them  having arranged these matters mark spent the rest of his time that day and the next at islington  i am going across to amsterdam on saturday with a diamond bracelet to sell there  millicent looked at him in reproachful surprise  why surely mark there can be no hurry about that i think you might have stayed a little longer before running away  i should do so you may be quite sure millicent if i consulted my own inclinations but i am bearing out your fathers wishes this bracelet is the most valuable of all the things he had and i believe that it has some sort of history attached to it he told my father that he had sent all the gems home principally to get these diamonds out of his possession he said that as soon as my father got hold of the things he was to take the diamonds straight over to amsterdam and sell them there for he considered that they were much too valuable to be kept in the house and that it was possible that some of the hindoos might endeavor to get possession of them at the time he spoke he believed that my father would at his death go to the bank and get the jewels as of course he would have done if he had known where to find them my father promised him that they should be taken to amsterdam at once and although so many years have passed since his death i think i am bound to carry out that promise  i have never been able to understand mark how it was that my father when he gave all these instructions about me and these jewels and so on did not at the same time tell uncle where to find them  it was a fancy of his he was in very bad health and he thought so much over these diamonds that it had become almost a sort of mania with him that not only was there danger in their possession but that he was watched night and day wherever he went he thought even if he whispered where the hiding place was to be discovered it might be heard therefore he deferred telling it until too late of course all this was but a fancy on his part although it is probable enough that the possession of the diamonds was a source of danger in india and might have been a source of danger here had any thieves known that such valuable gems were kept in a private house or carried about at any rate i shall be glad to be free of the responsibility and although naturally i dont like leaving you at the present time i think it best to carry out your fathers instructions at once and to get them off my mind altogether dick chetwynd is going with me so it will be a pleasant little trip  well i am glad he is going with you mark for although i know well enough that they could never be watching for those diamonds to turn up all these years i feel sure i should fidget and worry if you were alone you are not going to take the others with you  no only this particular bracelet none of the others are exceptionally valuable so far as i know at any rate your father did not specially allude to them i have no doubt that there are some really valuable jewels among them for my uncle prided himself on being a judge of precious stones and as he invested a large amount of money in them they are no doubt worth a great deal still i dont suppose there will be any difficulty in selling them here and at any rate i dont want to be delayed at amsterdam by having to sell perhaps fifty or a hundred pieces of jewelry any time will do for that i fancy that i ought to be able to dispose of the bracelet in three or four days at the outside i have got from bow street a list of all the principal diamond merchants in amsterdam that is a matter of great interest to the force as almost all precious stones stolen in this country are sent across there and if there is any special jewel robbery we send over a list of all the articles taken to the merchants there as a rule that would not prevent their dealing in them but there are some who will not touch things that have been dishonestly come by and we occasionally get hints that enable us to lay hands upon thieves over there  i hate to hear you say the force mark just as if you were still a detective it is bad enough that you should have belonged to it even for the purpose you did but you have done with it now  yes but you see it is rather difficult to get out of the habit when one has been for over a year constantly at work at a thing this will be my last absence on business millicent henceforward i shall be able to be always with you  well now that i know what you have been doing all this time mark i must admit that you have been very good to have been with us as much as you have i often used to wonder how you passed your time of course i knew that you were trying to find that man out but it did not seem to me that you could be always at that and i never dreamt that you had become a regular detective i am very glad i did not know it till a short time before you gave it up in the first place i should have been horrified and in the second place i should have been constantly uneasy about you however as this is to be the last time i will let you go without grumbling  by the way millicent what do you wish me to say about our engagement i dont see that there is the slightest occasion for us to keep up the farce of your being miss conyers any longer you cannot be married under a false name you know and now that you have escaped what your father was so afraid of and are going to be married for love and not for money i dont see why there should be any more mystery about it  but how would you account for my having been called conyers all this time  i should simply tell the truth that your father having a great fear that you might be married for money left the estate to my father to be held by him until you came of age and that it was at his particular request that you were brought up simply as his ward and dropped the family name and passed by your two christian names i should say that we have all been aware for a long time of the facts of the case and i should also say that your father had left a very large fortune in addition to the estate between us and had expressed a hope that we should when the time came marry each other  then people will think that we have only married to keep the fortune together mark  well my dear i dont suppose there are a great many people who will be interested in the matter and those who get to know you will see at once that as far as i am concerned there was no great difficulty in falling in with your fathers ideas while on the other hand they may consider that you made a noble sacrifice of yourself in agreeing to the plan  nonsense sir i am not going to flatter you as no doubt you expect but at any rate i am perfectly content with my share of the bargain  well there is one thing millicent all who knew us down at reigate will say that it is a very sensible arrangement and will be glad to know that i shall retain the estate they have hitherto considered to be mine well then you agree to my mentioning to my intimate friends that you are my cousin and that we are engaged  yes i suppose it is the best thing mark and as you say i must marry under my proper name and it is just as well to get the talk over down at reigate now as for it all to come as a wonder when we are married  when is that going to be millicent  oh i dont know of course it will be a long time before we even think of that  i beg your pardon i am thinking of it now and i can see no reason whatever why it should be delayed we know each other well enough i should think and there is no probability of our changing our minds on discovering all sorts of faults that we never dreamt in each other i may be away for a fortnight and i would suggest that you had better make your preparations at once so that we can be married a fortnight after i come back  you say that there is no fear of our discovering faults in each other i can assure you that i have just discovered a very serious fault namely that you are altogether too masterful too bent upon having your own way i know you always were so when you were a boy but i hoped you had grown out of it now i see that i was altogether mistaken seriously mark your proposal is absurd  where does the absurdity come in millicent  well everywhere she said gravely  which in the present case means nowhere he said do you mean to tell me millicent that in this town there are not a hundred dressmakers each of whom could turn you out a wedding dress and as many other garments as you can possibly require in the course of a month or even if that effort were too stupendous that you could not divide the work among a dozen of them  well i dont say that could not be done millicent admitted reluctantly  well what other objection is there  well you see one does not like to be bustled in such a matter as this mark one likes to think it all over and to realize it to ones self  well dear you will have a fortnight while i am away to think and to realize as much as you like i can see no advantage myself in waiting a single day longer than there is a necessity for i have been for the last year coming here merely as a visitor and i want to take possession of you and have you all to myself i suppose mrs cunningham will be coming in presently and i will put the matter to her if she says you cannot be ready in a month i must give you another week but i dont think that she will say so by the way how about her  i was thinking of that last night mark it would be very lonely for her to live by herself now and you see she has always been as a mother to me  quite so dear and i am sure that i should have no objection to her coming back to crowswood and living there as a friend and helping you in the housekeeping  thank you very much mark i should like that in every way you see i know nothing whatever about housekeeping and besides when you are out it would be a great thing to have her with me for it would be very lonely by myself in that big house  well we will have her there by all means dear if she likes to come you had better talk it over with her ah here she is  we were just talking over the time it will take millicent to get ready he said and i shall be glad of your opinion i have been telling her that i am going away for a fortnight and have proposed that the marriage should come off a fortnight later i cannot see any use in delay and she does not either at least i suppose not for the only objection she has advanced is that there will be but a short time in which to get her things ready that strikes me as being all nonsense i could get things ready for ten weddings in that time what do you think  i see no reason for delay mrs cunningham said and assuredly a month ought to be sufficient to get everything made  thank you mrs cunningham then we can consider that settled millicent  i call this tyranny mrs cunningham millicent protested he says he proposes that we shall be married in a month it is not a proposal at all it is an order if he had wanted me in such a hurry he might have said so a year ago and now that he has made up his mind at last he wants everything done in a hurry  it is the nature of men my dear they are all alike in that respect i think you had better make up your mind to it especially as i have no doubt in this case the order is not a very unpleasant one  you are too bad mrs cunningham millicent said i made sure that i should find you on my side and it seems you have gone over altogether to the enemy  where are you going to asked mrs cunningham of mark  i am going across to amsterdam to sell that bracelet my uncle expressed a particular wish to my father that he should do so immediately it came into his possession dick chetwynd is going over with me and if the weather is fair it will be a pleasant trip  where are you thinking of going after the marriage  we have not talked it over yet my own idea is that as neither of us has been abroad we might as well take this opportunity for seeing something of the continent of course we cannot go to france things are in too disturbed a state there but we might go to brussels and then into germany and perhaps as far as vienna and then down into italy but of course if millicent prefers it we will simply take a tour through england and scotland  oh i am glad that i am to have some voice in the matter millicent said however i should like the tour you propose very much mark i have often thought that i should like to see italy above all places  well then we will consider that settled and now what are you going to do for today     chapter xix   the essex was to sail at eleven oclock half an hour before that time marks hackney coach drew up at the wharf ten minutes later dick chetwynd who had like mark driven by a circuitous route and had made several stoppages joined him and as they shook hands slipped a parcel into his hand and this mark at once pocketed and buttoned his coat up tightly then hailing a boat they went on board together they had sent their luggage on the previous evening on getting on board mark saw the two prize fighters walking up and down the deck aft they were quietly dressed and save for their size would have attracted no attention and would have been taken for two countrymen on their way to holland on business  the two detectives were seated forward their appearance being that of two quiet business men commercial travelers or small traders the two friends first went below and saw to the cabin which they were to share and found their luggage was all there then they returned on deck four or five other passengers were standing watching the last bales of goods coming on board the tide was just on the turn and a quarter of an hour later the warps were thrown off and some of the sails hoisted and the essex began to move through the water  look there dick mark exclaimed do you see that boat lying on its oars in the middle of the stream that man sitting in the stern is a foreigner either from southern europe or from india  he is certainly a dark man mark still that may be only a coincidence  it is rather a curious one mark said we are too far off to see his features but he is apparently watching us off there the oars are dipping into the water now he sees that we are fairly under way  well mark i shall begin to think that you are right i am bound to say that hitherto i thought that it was ridiculous to suppose that you could have been watched as you thought and that you had got these diamonds on your brain till you had really become fanciful however it certainly looks as if you were right but even if you were how on earth could they have found out that we were going by this ship  that is more than i can tell if they have been watching me they must have known that i was intimate with you they have seen me come out of cotters bank and afterwards enter your lodgings they would feel sure that i had heard that there would be danger connected with the diamonds and might suppose that i should get some friend to take them from the bank and may have followed your movements as well as mine in that case they would have found out that you also went to cotters bank may have followed you to tower street and found out that you had taken a passage for two to amsterdam they may again have seen you go to the bank this morning and have guessed that you had the diamonds about you and then seeing us together on the wharf would feel pretty certain that it was so one of them may have hired that boat and watched the essex to see that neither of us went on shore again  now they see that we are off they will know that their game is up chetwynd said  i am not so sure of that dick there are craft going every day to antwerp and flushing and for anything we know some of them may be on board a craft already dropping down like ourselves by this tide but even if we had twelve hours start by landing say at flushing they would have time to cross by land to amsterdam and get there before us  yes i suppose they would anyhow it is pretty certain that we shall not be troubled on the voyage  yes i never thought there was much danger of that because even if they were on board they would see that you and i being always together could not be got rid of without an alarm being given  not until they were passing greenwich did either of the detectives come near mark then as he and dick were standing by the bulwarks looking at the hospital chester strolled across the deck and pointing to the building as if asking him some question about it said  there is a colored man forward dressed as a sailor  is that so mark said i see no one aft here who looks suspicious and i dont think they will try anything till we get to amsterdam there was a colored man in a boat watching us as we set sail  i saw him sir can he get to amsterdam before us  yes i have no doubt he can if he lands at flushing or antwerp and takes a post chaise or a diligence i should say he could get there twentyfour hours before us certainly he could do so if he landed at the hague as we have to go a long way round to get into the zuyder zee that is where the real danger will be still you had better keep a sharp lookout on the man forward  no more was said mark was not long in getting into conversation with the other passengers aft and later on strolled forward with dick asking the sailors some questions as to what sort of passage they were likely to have and how the wind suited the men agreed that unless the wind shifted they would not be likely to make a quick passage  the wind is northeasterly one of them said we can only just lay our course now and it will be dead against us in some of the reaches still i think we shall manage to make down to sea with only a tack or two but when we are once fairly out of the river it will be a long leg and a short one and going up round the texel it will be dead against us except that it would be a bit worse if it had a little more east in it it is about as foul a wind as we could have and i dont see any sign of a change worse luck  presently moving about among them he got next to gibbons  i dont think we shall have any trouble on board he said if there is any it will be after we have landed but you can keep an eye on that foreign sailor standing alone there up in the bows  all right sir if you like i can manage to get into a quarrel with him and can warrant that he wont get out of his berth before it is time to go ashore  no i would leave him alone gibbons as long as he is forward he can do no harm but if you see him working his way aft after it gets dark it will do him no harm if you manage to stumble against him and give him a clout on the head  all right sir if i hit him once he wont want another the fellow seems quiet enough and as far as strength goes he dont look stronger than a girl  after chatting for some time longer mark and dick chetwynd went aft again the essex did not put into any intermediate port and it was only on the sixth day after sailing that she approached amsterdam the voyage had passed off without any incident except that at nine oclock one evening there had been a slight noise on deck and the sound of a fall the friends went up at once several of the sailors had run aft and gibbons was explaining matters to them  i was walking up and down the deck he said when i saw this chap staring down through the skylight and i said to him i dont call it good manners to be prying down into your betters cabin he did not answer or move so i gave him a push when he turned upon me like a wild cat and drew his knife from his girdle there it is on the other side of the deck as i did not want daylight put into me i just knocked him down  served him right one of the sailors said he had no right to come aft at all and if he drew his knife on you you were quite right in laying him out but you must have hit him mighty hard for you have knocked the life pretty near out of him well we may as well carry him forward and throw a bucket of water over him that is the worst of these foreign chaps they are always so ready with their knives however i dont think he will be likely to try his hand on an englishman again  mark and his friend went below again in the morning mark asked one of the sailors if the foreigner was much hurt  well he is a good bit hurt sir that big chap looks as strong as a bullock and his blow has flattened the foreign chaps nose he cannot see out of his eyes this morning and is keeping his bunk they cannot stand a blow those foreign chaps but i dont suppose that any of us would have stood such a blow as that without feeling it pretty heavy the man who hit him is quite sorry this morning that he hit him quite so hot but as he says when a fellow draws a knife on you you have not got much time for thinking it over and you have got to hit quick and hard i told him he neednt be sorry about it i consider when a fellow draws a knife that hanging aint too bad for him whether he gets it into a man or not  there was a growl of assent from two or three sailors standing round for in those days the use of the knife was almost unknown in england and was abhorrent to englishmen both as being cowardly and unfair and as being a purely foreign crime  it will be dark before we get alongside mark said to the two detectives do you two walk first we will keep just behind you and the others shall follow as close as they can keep to us if anyone is looking out for us they will see that we are a strong party and that it would be no good to attack us for even if they were to stab me it would not be possible to search me for the diamonds when i am with a party like this  it was indeed quite dark when the brig brought up outside a tier of vessels lying by the wharf a few oil lamps burning by the quay showed that there were a good many people still sauntering about the party waited until the rest of the passengers had landed they learned from one of those who knew the place that the hotel to which they were going was but three or four hundred yards away and obtained directions how to find it  now we will go mark said gibbons you had better keep a sharp lookout on your own account that fellow you knocked down may try to put a knife into you  i will keep a sharp lookout sir never you fear  i think tring you had better watch gibbons he is more in danger than i am have you seen the man go on shore  yes he was the very first to cross onto the next vessel tring said  the loungers on the quay had gathered together to watch the passengers as they left the ship and by the dim light from one of the oil lamps it could be seen that the majority of them were of the roughest class as they were passing through them a man with a cry of rage sprang at gibbons with an uplifted knife trings fist struck him under the ear as he was in the act of striking and he fell like a log there was a cry of down with them and a rush of a score of men most of whom were armed with heavy bludgeons  the party was at once broken up heavy blows were exchanged the two pugilists rolling their assailants over like ninepins but receiving several heavy blows from their assailants clubs a rush of five or six men separated mark from the others those in front of him he struck down but a moment later received a tremendous blow on the back of the head which struck him to the ground unconscious his companions were all too busy defending themselves against their assailants to notice what had been done and as the attack had taken place in the center of the roadway behind the quay there was no lamp and the fight was taking place in almost total darkness  by this time many people had run up at the sound of the fray a minute later there was a cry that the watch were coming and four or five men with lanterns emerged from one of the streets leading down to the quays and hurried towards the spot the fight at once ceased the men who had attacked mingled with the crowd and when the watch came up they found the five englishmen clustered together and ten or twelve men lying on the ground  the instant that the fight had ceased dick chetwynd asked where is mr thorndyke  no answer was given the other four men simultaneously uttered exclamations of alarm the crowd was thinning fast as the watch came up  what is all this about one of them asked in dutch  do any of you speak english dick asked  i do one of them said  we landed five minutes ago from that craft continued dick and as we came across we were attacked by a band of ruffians an englishman one of our party is missing  whose bodies are these the watchman asked raising his lantern and pointing to them  perhaps mr thorndyke is among them dick chetwynd said  the fallen figures were examined by the light of the lanterns mark was not among them the watchmen uttered an exclamation of astonishment as they looked at the mens faces  what did you strike them with the one who spoke first asked  struck them with our fists of course gibbons replied they will do well enough you need not bother about them they will come round again presently the question is where is mr thorndyke  the whole of the lookers on had dispersed each fearing that he might be charged with taking part in the outrage  this is a very serious matter chetwynd said we have every reason to believe that the attack was premeditated for the gentleman who is missing was known to have some valuables on him all these fellows ought to be taken and locked up and made to give an account of themselves we are going to the hotel dhollande where you can find us at any time i dare say some of these scoundrels are known to you and that may give you a clew as to where mr thorndyke is  i have but little hope that he will be found alive no doubt he has been stabbed and his body carried off so that they can search his clothes at their leisure we came in a strong party to prevent the risk of an attack upon mr thorndyke here is my card it is of no use our attempting to search by ourselves but if you will get these fellows taken to the watch house and will call at the hotel we will join your party and help you to search the places you think he has most likely been taken to  i think sir you had better come with me to the watch house and see the lieutenant and tell him what has happened  i will just take my friends to the hotel and shall be back from there before you have got men to take these fellows away if you go to one of those ships and borrow a bucket empty it over each of them you will find that will bring them to  as soon as they arrived at the hotel dick ordered a private sitting room and five bedrooms  we have made a terrible mess of this lads he said gloomily i dont say that it is any of our faults but it is a horrible affair i have not the least doubt that mr thorndyke has been killed and it is no satisfaction to us that we have pretty nearly done for a dozen of those scoundrels  i would not have had it happen for a hundred pounds nor a thousand sir if there had been daylight we could have licked a score of them in spite of their bludgeons but they came with such a rush at us that we got separated before we knew where we were i dont think that it was our fault i feel as much ashamed as if i had thrown up the sponge in the ring at the end of the first round to think that we came over here four of us and yourself sir on purpose to take care of mr thorndyke all well save a few knocks with those sticks and mr thorndyke killed and carried off before we have been on shore five minutes a better young fellow i never put on the gloves with and gibbons passed the back of his hand across his eyes  well i must be off now chetwynd said i feel heartbroken over it i have known him since we were boys together and what makes it worse is that only three days ago he became engaged to be married how we are going to take the news back god only knows  as he hurried down the street towards the wharf he saw a number of lanterns coming towards him and ten or twelve watchmen came along escorting the prisoners many of whose faces were covered with blood then came four other watchmen carrying a body on a stretcher  one of them is dead the watchman who had before spoken said to dick a foreign seaman a lascar i should say from his color we found an open knife by his side  that is the man who began the fray chetwynd said he was on the point of stabbing one of my companions when another hit him under the ear  what the watchman said he must have been hit like the kick of a horse all these prisoners seem to have been struck but once two of them cannot speak i think their jaws are broken four of them have broken noses and another has had all his front teeth knocked out while the others are nearly as bad  i see you have brought with you some of their bludgeons dick said pointing to one of the watchmen carrying a great bundle of sticks over his shoulder  yes sir twentythree of them it certainly seems to show that it was a planned thing most of these fellows faces are so bruised that i cannot say who they are at present but two or three are known as the worst ruffians in the city and i have no doubt we shall find that they all belong to the same gang  by this time they had arrived at the watch house a building of considerable size the prisoners were first lodged in a strong room with barred windows and very heavy doors and then the watchman went with chetwynd to the lieutenants room the officer had just returned having hurried down with a reinforcement to the wharf as soon as he had heard of the fray and tried to obtain some information from the people who had gathered round attracted by the lanterns of the watch he had already learned from the watchmen all they knew about the affair as he spoke english well he at once addressed dick  this is a serious affair sir  a very serious affair for indeed i am afraid that my dearest friend has been murdered  will you kindly give me the particulars the officer said sitting down to the table with a pen in his hand  dick chetwynd told him the story of how mr thorndyke having some very valuable jewels that he wished to dispose of and believing that he would be attacked by a band of robbers had asked him to accompany him and had brought four detective officers and pugilists to protect him against any sudden attack  ah that accounts for the terrible blows that these fellows received the officer said and your friend was he a strong man  he was a man exceptionally strong and a match for either of the pugilists that he brought over i have no doubt that he was stabbed though of course he might have been brought down by a blow from one of the bludgeons he must have been completely insensible when carried off  the watchman here tells me that three or four of these ruffians are known and perhaps if you will give orders for the blood to be washed off the others faces some more may be recognized and prove an aid in enabling you to form an idea where mr thorndyke has been carried i trust that you will send out a party to search for him i and the four men with me will gladly join them and may be of use if any resistance is offered  the lieutenant at once gave orders to the watchman to go down and see that the prisoners all washed their faces as soon as he returned with the report that this was done the officer went down with dick chetwynd to examine them three or four of the men with lanterns also went in eight out of eleven men were recognized the other three whose features were so swollen that they could not see out of their eyes could not be made out but their companions on being questioned gave their names  they all belong to a gang of wharf thieves and plunderers they live in a slum near the water i will have men posted in the lanes leading to it and will myself go with you to see that a search is made of every house but first i will try to find out from these fellows where he was to be taken  now my men he said anyone of you who will tell me where one of the party you attacked was to be taken to will find things made easy for him at his trial  none of the men spoke for a minute and then one said  we know nothing about it how should we when we were all knocked stupid  no but you might know where he was to be taken  i know nothing about that we all got word to mind we were on the wharf when a brig that was seen coming up came alongside and that we were to have a hundred francs each for attacking some passengers as they landed six of them came along together and one said these are the men a black sailor came up first and spoke to two or three men in some foreign language i dont know who the men were it was too dark to see their faces it was one of them who gave the order it seemed an easy job enough when there were twentyfive of us with heavy sticks but it didnt turn out so i only know that i hit one big fellow a blow that ought to have knocked him down and the next moment there was a crash and i dont know anything more about it until a lot of water was thrown over me and one of the watch helped me to my feet i dont know whether the others know more than i do but i dont think they do  all the others protested at once that they were equally ignorant they had gone to earn a hundred francs they had been told that the money was all right but who found it or who were the men to be attacked they had not the least idea  how was it that you all had these bludgeonsthere were no knives found on any of you  the man who spoke before said  the order was no knives and before we went down to the wharf each of us was searched and a stick given to us i suppose from that that whoever paid for the job didnt want blood to be shed it suited us well enough for it was a job there was sure to be a row over and i dont suppose any of us wanted to put his head in a noose i know that we all said to each other as we went out that it did not want such sticks as we had to give a man a thrashing but the man who hired us whoever he was knew his customers better than we did  the officer translated the mans words as they were spoken to dick and on hearing the last speech the latter said  then there is still hope that thorndyke may only have been stunned that is a greater reason for our losing no time in looking for him for i am afraid that they wont hesitate to kill him when they have got him hidden away  i expect the lieutenant said they thought that if any of the watch came upon them as they were carrying him off they might be at once arrested if it was found that they were carrying a dead man whilst if he were only stunned they would say that it was a drunken comrade who had fallen and knocked his head against something i agree with you sir we had better start on our search at once  will you pass the hotel dhollande if not i will run and bring my men  yes i will go that way it will be no further  dick walked on fast  we have no news of him he said as he entered the room where the four men were anxiously awaiting him but we and the watch are now going to search the slums where the men who were taken prisoners all live come down now and i will tell you what i have learned before the others come up  there is reason for believing that he was not stabbed he went on as they reached the street for the men all say that they were armed only with clubs and that the strictest orders were given that none were to carry knives therefore there is little doubt that he was at the time only stunned but i am bound to say that this gives me very small ground for hoping that we may find him alive i fear they only stunned him so that they might carry him safely to their haunts for if stopped they could say that it was a drunken comrade who had fallen and hurt himself i fear that when they get him into one of their dens they will make short work of him therefore it is clear that there is not a moment to be lost ah here comes the watch  there were eight men with the lieutenant  i have already sent off ten others he said as he joined chetwynd to watch the lanes and let no one go in or out i thought it best not to lose a moment about that for when the men see that we have learned from the others where the gang came from and have closed the avenues of escape they will hesitate about murdering their prisoner if he was still alive when my men got there  in a quarter of an hour they arrived at the end of a narrow lane where two watchmen were standing with lanterns  you have seen nor heard nothing the lieutenant asked him  no sir we have not seen a man moving in the lane  there is just one hope that we might be in time the lieutenant said as he went on down the lane and that is that the fellows when they gather will be so dismayed at finding that nearly half their number are missing and knowing that some of them are pretty sure to make a clean breast of it they will hesitate to complete their crime it is one thing to rob a man in the streets quite another to murder him in cold blood there is likely to be a good deal of difference of opinion among them some of the more desperate being in favor of carrying the thing through but others are sure to be against it and nothing may have been done you may be sure that the sight of my men at the end of the lanes will still further alarm them i have no doubt the news that we have surrounded the district has already been circulated and that if alive now he is safe for they will think it is better to suffer a year or twos imprisonment than to be tried for murder we are sure to make some captures for it is probable that several of the others will bear marks of the fight each man we take we will question separately one or other of them is pretty safe to be ready to say where your friend was taken to if i promise him that he shant be prosecuted  every house in the district was searched from top to bottom six men with cut and bruised faces were found shamming sleep and were separately questioned closely all declared that they knew nothing whatever of anyone being carried there  it is of no use your denying your share in the affair the lieutenant said your comrades have confessed that there were twentyfive of you hired to carry out this and that you received a hundred francs each now if this gentleman is not found it will be a hanging matter for some of you and you had better tell all you know if you will tell us where he is i will promise that you shant be included in the list of those who will be prosecuted  the reply although put in different words was identical with that of the prisoners  we had nothing to do with carrying him off we were hired only to knock the men down who were pointed out to us not a word was said about carrying them off he may have been carried off that we cannot say but he has certainly not been brought here and none of us had anything to do with it  morning was breaking before the search was concluded the detectives accustomed as they were to visit the worst slums of london were horrified at the crowding the squalor and the misery of the places they entered  my opinion mr chetwynd gibbons growled is that the best thing to do would be to put a score of soldiers at the end of all these lanes and then to burn the whole place down and make a clean sweep of it i never saw such a villainous looking crew in all my life i have been in hopes all along that some of them would resist it would have been a real pleasure to have let fly at them  they are a villainous set of wretches gibbons but they may not be all criminals  well i dont know sir but i know that if i were on a jury and any of the lot were in the dock i should not want to hear any evidence against them their faces are enough to hang them  at last the search was over and they were glad indeed when they emerged from the lanes and breathed the pure air outside for all the englishmen felt sick at the poisonous air of the dens they had entered the prisoners as they were taken had been sent off to the watch house  i begin to think that the story these fellows tell is a true one mr chetwynd the lieutenant said and that they had nothing to do with carrying your friend off in the first place they all tell the same story that in itself would not be much as that might have been settled beforehand but it is hardly likely that one of the lot would not have been ready to purchase his life by turning on the others there is very little honor among thieves and as they know that we have taken their matesfor no doubt we were watched as we marched them up the townthey would make sure that someone would turn traitor and would think they might as well be beforehand i fancy that the men whoever they are who hired this gang to attack you carried out that part of the business themselves  i am afraid that is so dick agreed and i fear in that case that he is in even worse hands than if these ruffians here had taken him  well sir can you furnish us with any clew  the only clew is that they were most probably dark men that man who was killed was undoubtedly one of them i should say that they would probably be got up as foreign sailors  well that is something to go upon at any rate i will send round men at once to all the places by the quays where sailors board and if three or four of them have been together at any place we are sure to hear of it and the moment i have news i will send to your hotel  thank you i dont see that we can be of any use at present but you will find us ready to turn out again the moment we hear that you have news  when the party returned to the hotel they sat talking the matter over for upwards of an hour all were greatly discouraged for they had little hope indeed of ever learning what had become of mark as they had started out dick had told the night porter that he could not say what time they might return but that before the house closed he must have a couple of bottles of spirits and some tumblers sent up to their sitting room together with some bread and cold meat for that they might not return until morning and would need something before they went to bed as they had had nothing since their dinner at one oclock  it wants something to take the taste of that place out of ones mouth tring said to dick as directly they entered he poured some spirits into the glasses i feel as queer as if i had been hocussed  all indeed were feeling the same and it was not until they had eaten their supper and considerably lowered the spirits in the two bottles that they began to talk the two detectives were the principal speakers and both of these were of opinion that the only shadow of hope remaining rested upon mark himself  unless they finished him before he came round malcolm said they would find him an awkward customer to deal with mr thorndyke has got his head screwed on right and if as you say they are indians mr chetwynd i should think that if he once comes fairly round unless he is tied up he will be a match for them even with their knives that is the only chance i see even if the watch do find out that three or four foreign sailors have been at one of the boarding houses and did not turn up last night i dont think we shall be much nearer they will probably only have carried him some distance along the wharf got to some quiet place where there is a big pile of wood or something of that sort then put a knife into him searched for the diamonds which you may be sure they would find easily enough wherever he had hidden them and then make off most likely for rotterdam or the hague they could be at either of these places by this time and will mostly likely divide the diamonds and get on board different craft bound for london or hull or indeed any other port and then ship for india from what mr thorndyke said they did not want the diamonds to sell but only to carry back to some temple from which they were stolen twenty years ago  chester was of precisely the same opinion  i am afraid mr chetwynd he added as they rose to go to their rooms for two or three hours sleep the only news that we shall get in the morning is that mr thorndykes body has been found     chapter xx   at ten oclock a constable came with a message from the lieutenant to mr chetwynd that he would be glad if he would come down to the watch house dick did not wake the others but freshening himself up by pouring a jug of water over his head went at once with the constable  have you news he asked eagerly as he entered  yes the men returned an hour ago at four of the houses they went to a foreign sailor had been lodging there for the last day or so but yesterday afternoon all had paid their reckoning and left then the idea struck me that it would be as well to ask if they had been seen on the quays and i sent off a fresh batch of men to make inquiries a quarter of an hour ago one of them came back with the news that he had learned from a sailor that he had noticed a dark colored foreigner whom he took to be a lascar sailor talking to a boatman and that they had rowed off together to a barge anchored a short way out he did not notice anything more about him  now i should not be at all surprised if the fellow went off to arrange with the bargeman for a passage for himself and four or five comrades to some port or other it might be anywhere it would make no difference to them where the barge was bound for no doubt he saw the man again after the brig was sighted and told him that they should come on board soon after it got dark and told him to have the boat at the stairs you see in that case they might not have carried mr thorndyke above fifty yards they would probably get him on board as one of their party who had been drunk the barge no doubt got under way about nine oclock which is the hour when the tide was high last night and during the night the indians could easily drop your friend overboardand may even have done so before they got under way which would have been the easiest thing to do there would have been no one at the helm and they could have chosen a moment when the crew probably only three were below i am afraid that this is not a cheering lookout but i have little doubt that it is the correct one  i have told my men to find out what barge was lying at the spot the sailor pointed out and if we discover her name which we are likely to be able to do there will be no difficulty in finding out to whom she belongs and where she was bound for then we can follow it up though there is little likelihood of our finding the murderers still on board  thank you very much for the pains that you are taking sir dick said i am afraid that there is no shadow of hope of finding my poor friend alive i have no doubt that the thing has happened exactly as you suggest the whole course of the affair shows how carefully it was planned and i have no hope that any scruple about taking life would be felt by them for a moment i will go back to the hotel and i shall be obliged if you will let me know as soon as you obtain any clew as to the barge  an hour and a half later the officer himself came round to the room where dick chetwynd and the two pugilists were sitting the detectives had started out to make inquiries on their own account taking with them a hanger on at the hotel who spoke english  the barges name was the julie he said she has a cargo on board for rotterdam  i think the best thing would be to take a carriage and drive there at once dick said  you can do that sir but i dont think you will be there before the barge they have something like eighteen hours start for you and the wind has been all the time in the east i should say that they would be there by eight oclock this morning  no i dont know that it would be of any use but at least it would be doing something i suppose we could be there in four hours  from that to five but even if the barge were delayed and you got there first which is very unlikely i do not think that there would be the remotest chance of finding those villains on board i reckon they would as we agreed launch the body overboard even before they got under way here and they may either have landed again before the craft got under way pretending that they had changed their minds and then walked across to the hague or to haarlem or have gone on with the barge for two hours or even until daybreak if by that time they were near rotterdam they may have stayed on board till they got there if not they may have landed and finished the journey on foot but they would certainly not have stopped on board after six or seven oclock this morning they would calculate that possibly we might get on their track at an early hour this morning and set out in pursuit at once  however it will doubtless be a satisfaction to you to be moving and at least you will be able to overhaul the barge when you get to rotterdam and to hear what the boatmen say the chances are they will not even have noticed that one of the men who came on board was missing the men may very well have made up a long bundle carried it on shore with them or three of them may have carried a fourth ashore and in the dark the bargemen were unlikely to have noticed that the number was less than when they came on board however it will be something for you to find out when and where the fellows landed  yes i should certainly like to lay hands on them though i am afraid we should find it very hard to prove that they had anything to do with this affair  i think that also mr chetwynd morally we may feel absolutely certain but unless the boatmen noticed that one of their number was missing when they landed we have at present no evidence to connect them with it  we will set out as soon as my other two men return i told them to be back soon after twelve i will write to you this evening from rotterdam ah here are the men  the door opened and to the stupefaction of the party mark thorndyke entered the room  good heavens mark dick exclaimed springing forward and seizing his hand is it really you alive in the flesh we had given you up for dead we have been searching the town for you all night and were just going to set out for rotterdam in search of a barge on which we believed you were carried why it seems almost a miracle  the two prize fighters also came forward and shook hands with a pressure that would have made most men shrink  i am as glad mr thorndyke gibbons said as if anyone had given me a thousand pounds i have never quite given up hope for as i said to mr chetwynd if you got but a shadow of a chance you would polish off those nigger fellows in no time but i was afraid that they never would give you a chance well i am glad sir  mark this is the lieutenant of the watch here dick said he has been most kind and has himself headed the search that has been made for you all night now tell us all about it  first of all give me something to drink for except some water i have had nothing since dinner yesterday you are right dick it is almost a miracle even to me that i am here i would not have given a penny for my chance of life and i can no more account for the fact that i am here than you can  mark drank off a tumbler of weak spirits and water that gibbons poured out for him chetwynd rang the bell and ordered lunch to be brought up at once just at this moment the two detectives came in and were astonished and delighted at finding mark there  now he said i will tell you as much as i know which is little enough when i came to my senses i found myself lying on the deck of a craft of some sort it was a long time before i could at all understand how i got there i think it was the pain from the back of my head that brought it to my mind that i must have been knocked down and stunned in that fight for some time i was very vague in my brain as to that but it all came back suddenly and i recalled that we had all got separated i was hitting out and then there was a crash yes i must have been knocked down and stunned and i could only suppose that in the darkness and confusion i had been carried off and taken on board without any of you missing me my hands and feet were tied and there was something shoved into my mouth that prevented me from speaking  i should think that it must have been an hour before i quite recovered my senses and got the thing fairly into my mind then a man with a knife leant over me and made signs that if i spoke he would stab me and another took the gag out of my mouth and poured some water down my throat and then put it in again i saw that he was a dark colored man and i then understood it all it was those hindoos who had got up the attack upon us and had carried me off i had no doubt they had got the diamonds i had sewn up in the waistband of my trousers  i wondered why they were keeping me but was sure they would stab me presently and throw me overboard i knew that they had killed two soldiers for the sake of the diamonds and if it hadnt been that they had given me the water i should not have had a shadow of doubt about my fate  i puzzled over why they should have done so and came to the conclusion that they dared not do it on board because of the crew and that they intended to take me on shore somewhere and there dispose of me i made many attempts to loosen my ropes but they would not give the slightest at last i think i dozed off for a time after i had had the water they drew a blanket or something of that sort over me it had been there before but it had only been pulled up as high as my nose and i felt sure that it was only done to prevent the dutchmen on the boat seeing that i was bound and gagged this time they pulled it right over my face when they took it off again i could see it was nearly morning for there was a faint light in the sky they were moving about on the deck and presently i saw one of the sailors get into the boat and pull it along hand over hand by the rail until he was close to me then four lascar sort of chapsi could scarcely make out their featureslifted me and lowered me into the boat and got in themselves  i did not attempt to struggle no doubt they had made up some tale that i was mad or something of that sort and i thought that i had best pretend to be quiet and peaceable till i could see some sort of chance of making a fight for it it was but a few yards from the shore the man lifted me out onto the bank and the sailor then started to row back to the barge they carried me a few yards away and then laid me face downwards on some grass now i thought to myself it is all over they are going to stab me and make off to my surprise i felt they were doing somethingi could not make out whatto the ropes then there was quiet i lay there i should think for half an hour wondering why on earth they did not finish me at last i made up my mind to move and turned round onto my back as i lay there i could see no one and raising my head looked round to my amazement i found that i was alone it was now almost light and as i craned my head in all directions i assured myself that they had gone then i began to try again at the ropes  to my surprise i found that they were much looser than they were before although still tight enough to give me nearly an hours work before i got my hands free then it took me almost as long to get the ropes off my legs for they had knotted them in such a fearfully intricate way that it was a long time before i could even discover where the ends were at last i finished the job stood up and looked round a quarter of a mile off there was a good sized town but not a soul could i see  till now i had hardly thought of the diamonds i put my hands to my waistband and found as i expected that they were gone i think i felt nothing but pleasure the confounded things had given trouble enough and i was well rid of them why they should have spared my life i could not imagine if they had finished me which they could have done without any risk to themselves when they got me ashore they could have gone off with the diamonds without the slightest fear of pursuit while now there was of course a chance that i might follow and recognize them  would you know them again the lieutenant interrupted  not in the slightest it was light enough to see that they were dark but from the time the boat came along the blanket was over my head and except when they gave me the water i had no chance of seeing any of their features still if i had gone straight to the town i saw and reported the matter to the authorities and sent mounted men to all the ports to warn them not to let any colored men embark i might have given them a lot of trouble but i dont suppose any of them would ever have been caught after the craft they had shown in the whole matter it is certain that they would have laid their plans for escape so well that the law would never have laid hands upon them i put my hand mechanically to my watch to see the time and to my astonishment discovered that i still had it in my pocket and was equally surprised to find that the money in my trousers pockets was also untouched the watch had of course stopped i first of all went down to the water and had a good wash then i proceeded to the town and going to a hotel ordered breakfast  why i thought you said that you had had nothing to eat mark  yes well i had forgotten all about that breakfast the people looked a good deal surprised at an englishman walking in in that way while i was eating my breakfast two menwho were i suppose authorities of some kindwho spoke english came and questioned me as i had made up my mind to say nothing more about the affair i merely told them that i had come for a sail from amsterdam and that i wanted a carriage to take me back they were evidently astonished at my choosing a dark night for such a trip but i said that i had some curiosity to see how the boatmen navigated their vessel when there were no lighthouses or anything to steer by they asked a few more questions and then went away evidently thinking that i was a little mad however they must have spoken to the landlord who in a short time made signs that the carriage was at the door  i had avoided asking the men either the name of the place or how far it was from any big town because that would have made the whole affair more singular it was a quarter past eight when i started and beyond the fact that i know by the sun we came pretty nearly due east i have not the slightest idea of the road the coachman could not speak a word of english i should say we came about seven miles an hour and stopped once to bait the horses so i suppose that it must have been between four and five miles from rotterdam when i landed  lunch had by this time been laid on the table and at dicks invitation the lieutenant joined them  it is an extraordinary story he said that your life should have been spared is altogether beyond my comprehension still more so why they should have left you your money and watch  the whole story is extraordinary dick chetwynd said for we have every reason to believe that those fellows or at least one or two of them have been patiently watching for a chance of carrying off those diamonds for twenty years when my friend told me of it ten days ago i did not believe that it could be possible but he has certainly shown that he was correct in his opinion  mark then related the history of the jewels surprising the pugilists and detectives as much as the lieutenant  it is extraordinary indeed the latter said i should not have believed it possible that men would devote so many years to such a purpose nor that they could have succeeded in tracing the diamonds in spite of the precaution taken by your uncle and afterwards by yourself it would seem that from the time he landed in england he and after him your father and yourself must have been watched almost night and day i can understand now why they did not take your watch and money they evidently acted from a sort of religious enthusiasm and were no ordinary thieves but as evidently they did not hesitate to kill i cannot understand why they should have added to their risks by sparing you  no that is what puzzles me mark agreed i was thinking it over while we were driving here now let me hear about the fight dick how did you all come out of it  as well as could be expected gibbons and tring both got some heavy blows with the cudgels as indeed we all did more or less but they did great execution eleven fellows were left senseless on the ground and one of them that black fellow who came over with us was killed the other ten are all in prison all of us did our best and managed to leave our mark on eight others who were in consequence picked out and are also in jail  dick went on to relate the particulars of the search  you see our friend here had traced you to the barge and found out her destination and if you had come ten minutes later you would have found that we had all just started for rotterdam i was only waiting for chester and malcolm to return to set out i am sorry mark that you have lost your diamonds not so much because they are gone for i can well understand you to be thoroughly glad to be rid of such dangerous articles but because they have carried them off in our teeth after we have been specially retained to protect you i certainly thought that with such a bodyguard you were absolutely safe from any number of hindoos  yes we made a regular mess of it mr thorndyke gibbons said i never felt so certain of winning a battle as i did that you would not be touched as long as we were looking after you tring and i if we had been asked would have said that we could each have taken on a dozen foreigners easily mr chetwynd is handy with his fists too though he hasnt your weight and reach and your two other friends are both pretty well accustomed to deal with rough customers as for tring and me it makes one feel small to know that we have been bested by a handful of niggers or hindoos or whatever the chaps are whom a good sized boy of twelve ought to be able to polish off  now mark what is to be done next dick chetwynd asked  the next thing will be to get back as soon as we can dick i for one have had enough of holland to last me for a lifetime  i am afraid gentlemen the lieutenant said you will have to wait a day or two before you can leave i have nineteen men in prison and there will be a meeting of magistrates this afternoon now you have come back mr thorndyke the charge against them wont be as serious as it would have been before but they are guilty of a desperate and premeditated assault upon six passengers on their arrival here they have already admitted that they were paid for their work and as among them are some of the worst characters in the city you may be sure that now we have got them fairly in our hands we shall not let them go it is so simple an affair that the investigation ought not to take long but we shall want to find out if we can who acted as the intermediary between the hindoos and the prisoners i should think that two meetings ought to be sufficient for the present but i am afraid that there may then be a long remand and that you will either have to remain here or to come over again  it would be a horrible nuisance dick said still it would be better to come back again than to wait here indefinitely and anyhow i dont suppose it would be necessary for all of us to come back again  i should not mind if it could be arranged for me to be here again in a months time mark agreed for to tell you the truth i am going to be married in less than three weeks and as i had intended to come to brussels and afterwards to travel for a while i could make a visit here without greatly putting myself out  i will try and arrange that mr thorndyke  i shall be glad mark said if you can manage to get the men sentenced without going into the question of the diamonds at all and treat the matter as a mere attempt at robbery it surely would not be necessary to bring the question of my being carried away into the matter at all i can give evidence that i was knocked down and stunned and that i was robbed of some jewels that i had about me which were the object of the attack  i think we should have to admit that the lieutenant said it must come out that the attack was an organized one  well if it must it must mark said reluctantly but then you see no end of questions would be asked and the thing might be delayed while a search is being made for the men who stole the bracelet  well we will keep it out of the inquiry if we can the lieutenant said the meeting will be at three oclock i will send a man to take you to the town hall  at the appointed hour the party proceeded to the court and the eighteen prisoners under a strong guard having been brought in six magistrates took their places on the bench the rest of the court was crowded the fray on the wharf and the number of captures having created quite a stir in the city they had arranged that tring should first give his evidence which he did the lieutenant of the watch acting as interpreter though most of the magistrates understood english the appearance of the prisoners created quite a sensation in the court for the injuries that they had received were now even more conspicuous than they had been when they were first captured some of them had to be led into court their eyes being completely closed others had their heads bandaged and all showed signs of tremendous punishment tring related that he with five others had come ashore together one of his companions had a row on board a ship they had crossed in with a lascar sailor who was a passenger and they kept together as they were crossing the wharf thinking that possibly the man might attempt to stab his companion  i was walking behind him tring went on when the lascar jumped suddenly out from among the men standing about and was about to stab my companion when i hit him just in time and he went down then there was a rush and we all got separated and did as well as we could until the watch came up that is all that i know about it  is the lascar among the prisoners one of the magistrates asked the lieutenant of the watch  no sir when picked up by one of my men he was found to be dead the blow had apparently killed him instantly  the other five then gave their evidence it was similar to that of tring save that being in front of him they knew nothing of the attack by the lascar all they knew about it was that there was a sudden rush upon them by a number of men armed with bludgeons that they were separated and that each defended himself until the guard came up  some of the watch then gave evidence and told how on arriving at the spot eleven of the prisoners were found lying senseless how on recovering they were all taken to the watch house where several of them were recognized as notoriously bad characters they had admitted that they were paid to make the attack which was apparently the result of the private enmity of some person or persons unknown to one or more of those attacked  the lieutenant then related the steps that he had taken to capture others connected with the attack and that he found eight men bearing marks of the fray and that all these were also notorious characters and associates of the prisoners first taken the first witnesses were again questioned five of them said that so far as they knew they had no personal enemies mark who was the last to get into the witness box said that he himself had no enemies but that an uncle of his who was in the british indian service had a sort of feud with some members of a sect there on account of some jewels that he had purchased and which had they declared been stolen from a temple two soldiers through whose hands these things had passed had been successively killed by them and his uncle had to the day of his death believed that their vengeance would one day fall upon him  i can only suppose continued mark that i have inherited the enmity they bore him as i inherited the jewels and that the attack was really designed solely against me and the consequences might have been fatal to me had it not been for the strength and courage of my fellow passengers  did they come with you for your protection mr thorndyke  to some extent yes the fact is that i have for some time been convinced that i was followed about by natives of india and remembering what my uncle had said on the subject i became to some degree apprehensive and thought it as well to leave london for a short time that this attack was really instigated by the men i have no doubt whatever since as you have heard it was begun by a lascar who tried to stab one of my companions and who received a knockdown blow that caused his death from one of the others it is a well known fact that these people will cherish for many years a determination to avenge any injury however i hope that after the failure of this attempt upon my life i shall hear no more of them  were any knives found on the prisoners the magistrates asked the lieutenant of the watch  no sir all carried clubs and they told me that they had been especially ordered not to take knives and had indeed been searched before they came out  what impression do you gather from that mr thorndyke  my impression is sir that they desired to overpower those with me and to beat them down in order to carry out their revenge upon me  after some consultation the magistrate who had before spoken said  the prisoners will be remanded it is necessary that we should find out who was the chief culprit who bribed this gang  as soon as the prisoners were taken out of court mark slipped across to the magistrates accompanied by the lieutenant as interpreter  i hope gentlemen that our presence here will not be necessary for it would be a matter of extreme inconvenience i may say that my marriage is fixed for today three weeks hence you can well imagine that i want to return as soon as possible two of the men are as you have heard bow street officers whose presence could not well be spared  the magistrates again consulted together  your evidence has all been taken down by the clerk of the court certainly we should not require your presence at the remand but whether we should do so at the trial would of course depend upon whether these men all own their guilt which having been taken red handed it is likely enough they will do we will consent therefore to your leaving if you will give us an undertaking to return for the trial if your presence is necessary and that you will bring with you the man who struck down the lascar who commenced the fray and one of the others  that i will do willingly mark replied we are much obliged to you for your consideration i shall be traveling for a time after my marriage but i will as i pass through belgium after my marriage give you the route i intend to take and the address at which letters will find me and if you send me a sufficiently long notice i will at once return for the trial     chapter xxi   you managed that very well mark dick said you kept well within the limits of truth without bringing the real facts of the attack upon us into the case  well you see dick after working as a detective one gets into the way of telling stories with the smallest amount of deviation possible from the truth what will these fellows get done to them lieutenant  i should say that they will get two or three years imprisonment the only charge now is rioting and assault it is lucky for them that they had clubs instead of knives for that would have brought the matter under the head of attempted murder the matter of the gems was not important in the case but there is sure to be a great fuss and search for the missing indians i suppose you will soon be off home now  yes i shall find out tonight what vessel leaves for england tomorrow and take a berth in the first that sails for london it is too late to think of starting this evening and indeed i feel that i want a long nights rest for i did not sleep much last night and have not quite recovered from that crack on my head  on his return to the hotel mark sent out a man to inquire at the shipping offices and finding that a bark would sail at nine oclock the next morning they went down and took berths and sailed in her next day the voyage home was a rapid one for the wind blew steadily from the east and the vessel made the passage to the mouth of the river in two days and the next took them up to london  i will call round tomorrow or next day gibbons with the checks for you both mark said as he prepared to go ashore  no sir we are both of one mind that we could not take them we went over to prevent you being robbed of those sparklers and to see that you came to no harm well the things are lost and you got knocked down and carried away it is no thanks to us that you are alive now it is a mortifying job that with two detectives to watch over things and with us to fight we should have been fairly beat by a few black niggers  if there had been any bungling on your part gibbons there might be something in what you say but no one could have foreseen that before we had been on shore two minutes we should have been attacked in that way you both did all that men could do as was shown by the condition of the fellows who were taken i was just as much separated from you as you were from me and the fact that we were surprised as we were is really due to my not determining to stay on board until the morning which i could no doubt have done with the captains permission it never struck me for a moment that we should be attacked in force i thought it probable that an attempt at assassination would be made but it certainly did not seem probable that it would be attempted while you were all with me you are not in the slightest degree to blame for your part of the agreement was carried out to my satisfaction i shall certainly carry out mine as i have arrived home safe and sound  well governor it is very good of you but i tell you it will go against the grain for us to take your money  on landing mark parted with dick chetwynd who had arranged to drop marks bag at his lodgings on his way home and at once took a hackney coach to islington millicent gave a cry of delight as he entered the room  you are back earlier than i expected mark you told me before you started that the wind was in the east and that you might be a long time getting to amsterdam unless it changed i have been watching the vane on the church and it has been pointing east ever since  well you have sold the diamonds i hope she said after the first greeting was over  no i have bad news for you millicent the jewels have been stolen  well it does not make much difference mark we have much more than enough without them so dont bother yourself in the least how did it happen  well it is rather a long story i will tell it you when mrs cunningham is here so as not to have to go over it twice how are the dresses getting on  i suppose they are getting on all right she said i have done nothing for the last two days but try them on you see we put them out to three milliners and they all three seem to reach the same point together and i start after breakfast and it takes about two hours at each place you dont know what trouble you have given me by hurrying things on so unreasonably  well it is better to have it all done and over he said than to have the thing hanging over you for a couple of months  that is what mrs cunningham says now i want to hear about your adventures and i will call her down   only think mrs cunningham millicent said presently with a laugh after she had returned with her this silly boy has actually let the diamonds be stolen from him   no really millicent  yes indeed fancy his not being fit to be trusted to look after them however i tell him it is of no consequence i dont know how they went he would not tell me the story until you came down  i am sorry to say it is true mrs cunningham although i can assure you that i really cannot blame myself for either carelessness or stupidity i knew when i started that there was a very great risk and took what seemed to me every possible precaution for in addition to dick chetwynd going with me i took two detectives from bow street and two prize fighters  exclamations of surprise broke from both ladies  and yet in spite of all that these things were stolen millicent said how on earth did they do it i should have sewn them up in my pockets inside my dress  i sewed them up in the waistband of my trousers millicent and yet they managed in spite of us to steal them and now i must begin by telling you the whole history of those diamonds and you will understand why i thought it necessary to take a strong party with me  he then told them repeating the history the colonel had given his father of the diamonds and the conviction that he had that he had been followed by hindoos and the instructions he had given for the disposal of the bracelet  as you know he said nothing happened to confirm my uncles belief that there were men over here in search of the diamonds during my fathers life but since then i have come to the same conclusion that he had and felt positive that i was being constantly followed wherever i went as soon as i heard where the treasure was i began to take every precaution in my power i avoided going to the bank after my first visit there and as you know would not bring the things for you to look at i got dick chetwynd to go there open the case and take out these diamonds he did not bring them away with him but fetched them from there the morning we started he went down and took the passage for us both at the shipping office and the pugilists and the detectives each took passages for themselves so that i hoped however closely i was followed they would not learn that i was taking them to amsterdam  it was very wrong mark very wrong indeed millicent broke in you had no right to run such a terrible risk it would have been better for you to have taken the diamonds and thrown them into the thames  that would not have improved matters he said the indians would not have known that i had got rid of them and would have continued their efforts to find them and i should always have been in danger instead of getting it over once for all however i did not think that there was any danger going over as i did with two of the best prize fighters in england to say nothing of the detectives who were the men who were with me when i caught bastow the only danger was that i might be stabbed but as they would know it was no use their stabbing me unless they could search me quietly and that they could not do unless i was alone and in some lonely neighborhood and i had made up my mind not to stir out unless the whole party were with me i found out when we got on board that in spite of all the precautions i had taken they had discovered that i was going to sail for amsterdam which they could only have done by following dick as well as myself there was a dark faced foreign sailor who i had no doubt was a hindoo already on board and i saw another in a boat watching us start this was unpleasant but as i felt sure that they could not have known that i had with me detectives and pugilists i still felt that they would be able to do nothing when i got to amsterdam  then he told them the whole story of the attack of his being carried away and of his unexpected release of the search that had been made for him and the arrest of eighteen of his assailants millicent grew pale as he continued and burst into tears when she heard of his being a prisoner in the hands of the hindoos  i shall never let you go out of my sight again mark she exclaimed when he had finished it was bad enough before when you were searching for that man here and i used to be terribly anxious but that was nothing to this  well there is an end of it now millicent the men have got the diamonds and will soon be on their way to india if they have not started already  nasty things she said i shall never like diamonds again they will always remind me of the terrible danger that you have run isnt it extraordinary that for twenty years four or five men should be spending their lives waiting for a chance of getting them back  i do not expect there were so many as that probably there was only one he would have no difficulty in learning that my father had not received any extraordinary gems from my uncle and probably supposed that they would not be taken out from wherever they might be until you came of age after the death of my father he might suppose that i should take them out or that at any rate i should go to whoever had them and see that they were all right and he then perhaps engaged half a dozen lascarsthere are plenty of them at the docksand had me watched wherever i went and do you know that i believe i once owed my life to them  how was that mark  well i was captured by some fellows who suspected me to be a bow street runner and i think that it would have gone very hard with me if a party of five or six prize fighters had not broken into the house pretty nearly killed the men in whose hands i was and rescued me they said that they had heard of my danger from a foreign sailor who called at gibbons with whom i was in the habit of boxing and told him about it you see until they learned where the jewels were my life was valuable to them for possibly i was the only person who knew where they were hidden so really i dont think i have any reason for bearing a grudge against them they saved my life in the first place and spared it at what was a distinct risk to themselves on the other hand they were content with regaining the bracelet not even as i told you taking my watch or purse you see with them it was a matter of religion they had no animosity against me personally but i have no doubt they would have stabbed me without the slightest compunction had there been no other way of getting the things still i think that i owe a debt of gratitude to them rather than the reverse and after all the loss of the bracelet is not a serious one to us  i am glad it is gone millicent said you say it had already caused the death of two men and if you had succeeded in selling it i cant help thinking that the money would have brought ill fortune to us i am heartily glad that the diamonds are gone mark i suppose they were very handsome  they were magnificent he said dick and cotter both agreed that they had never seen their equal and i fancy that they must have been worth a great deal more than your father valued them at  well it does not matter at all there is no history attached to the others i hope mark  not in any way dear they were bought as the colonel told my father in the ordinary course of things and some no doubt were obtained at the capture of some of the native princes treasuries but it was solely on account of this bracelet that he had any anxiety you can wear all the others if you have a fancy for keeping them without a shadow of risk  no mark we will sell them every one i dont think that i shall ever care to wear any jewels again and if i am ever presented at court and have to do so i would rather that you should buy some new ones fresh from a jewelers shop than wear anything that has come from india  tomorrow you shall both go to the bank with me to see them and then i will take them to some firstclass jewelers and get him to value them  the visit was paid next day both millicent and mrs cunningham were somewhat disappointed at the jewels  it is hardly fair to see them like this philip cotter said they would look very different if reset no indian jewels i have ever seen show to advantage in their native settings but many of the stones are very large and without knowing anything about them i should say that they are worth the 50000 pounds at which you say colonel thorndyke valued them he was not likely to be mistaken he was evidently a judge of these matters and would hardly be likely to be far wrong  we will go with you to the jewelers mark millicent said in the first place i shall not feel quite comfortable until i know that they are out of your hands and in the next place i should like to hear what he thinks of them  i have a number of indian jewels that i wish you to value for me mark said as carrying the case he entered the jewelers shop they were collected by colonel thorndyke an uncle of mine during service in india  the jeweler took them with him into a room behind the shop the case was opened and the man took out sixtyeight small parcels it contained and opened them one after the other  i shall need a very careful examination of these before i can form any estimate of their value he said after inspecting some of the more important pieces of jewelry carefully they are a most magnificent collection and had they been properly cut in the first place they would have been worth a very large sum unfortunately the indian princes think more of size than of lustre and have their stones cut very much too flat to show off their full brilliancy some of these large ones i should certainly advise to be recut for what they will lose in weight they will gain in beauty and value however sir i will go through them and give you an estimate of the selling value of each piece i need not say that they ought all to be reset in the prevailing fashion but the gold which is in some cases unnecessarily massive will go some distance towards defraying the expense  when shall i call again mark asked  i should be glad if you can give me a week the jeweler said some of the things for instance that great pearl necklace i could appraise without much difficulty but all the gems must be taken out of their settings before i could form a fair idea of their value  then i will call in a weeks time mark said i am in no particular hurry about them but i would rather that they were in your care than mine  yes if the cracksmen got word that there was such a collection as this in any private house it would need a couple of men with pistols to keep guard over them  a week later mark again called  i have the list ready for you sir you will see that they are not marked according to their setting but according to their size and value thus you see the largest stones are priced separately the smaller ones are in groups according to their weight the total comes to 42000 pounds i do not know whether that at all equals your expectations i may say that i have shown the stones to two or three of our principal diamond merchants and that the prices i have put down are those at which they would be willing to buy them possibly some would be worth more i had the merchants here together and they spent some hours going through them and the sums put down are those at which one or other were willing to purchase  it quite answers my expectations mark said my uncles estimate indeed was somewhat higher but doubtless he judged them at the price which they would fetch in india well sir i authorize you to close with the offers and to dispose of them for me i will give you a written authority to do so in the meantime i wish to buy a suite of jewels as a wedding present a tiara necklace and bracelets but i do not want any diamonds to be among them  i am afraid i have nothing in stock without diamonds of course i have both necklaces and bracelets of almost any stones that you might select but i have no complete set without diamonds the effect would be somber and few ladies would like them  we have some unpleasant associations with diamonds mark said and on that point i am quite determined but if you used pearls instead of diamonds the effect might be as good i dont care whether the stones are emeralds or rubies at any rate i should like to see some and then perhaps you might be able to make me a set on the same model  several superb sets were brought in mark selected one of emeralds and diamonds  what would be the price of this set he asked  that set is 6000 pounds sir the stones are exceptionally fine ones but if you substituted pearls of equal size for the diamonds it would cost considerably less i could not give you the exact price until it is made but i should say that it would be about 4500 pounds  very well then i will take that how long will it be making  i should not like to say less than three months at the earliest it will require some time to collect as fine a set of emeralds as these indeed i think that most probably i shall use these emeralds or the greater part of them and collect others to take their places at my leisure i do not know whether the best plan would not be to take the diamonds out and substitute pearls there would be no difficulty in getting them and in that case i might have it ready for you in a month  i think that will be the best plan but you need not be in any particular hurry about them my marriage will take place in less than a fortnight and after that i shall probably be three or four months before i return to london i will get you to keep the things until i come back  i have sold the jewels millicent he said when he returned to islington the jeweler has found purchasers for them all and the total comes to 42000 pounds  whatever shall we do with all our money mark  i rather wonder myself dear however there is one thing there are always plenty of people who will be glad to relieve us of anything that we dont want i can tell you that in the course of my search for bastow i have seen an amount of poverty and misery such as i never dreamt of and i certainly should like to do something to relieve it the best thing that i know of would be to give a handsome sum to three or four of the great hospitals i dont know of any better means of helping the very poor  suppose mark the girl said putting her hand on his arm we give this 42000 pounds as a thank offering we never expected to get it and my fathers jewels have nearly cost you your life we have such an abundance without that i should like above all things to give this money away  i think that is an excellent plan millicent and a very happy thought on your part we cannot do it now as we have not yet got the money but as soon as we do we will send off checks for 10000 guineas each to st bartholomews guys and st thomasthose are the three principal ones the others we can settle afterwards but i should say that the foundling would be as good as any and i believe that they are rather short of funds at present then there is the london mendicity society and many other good charities perhaps it would be better to divide the whole among eight of them instead of four but we need not settle that until we return  do you think we shall have to go to this horrid amsterdam mark  i hope not dear but i shall no doubt hear from the lieutenant of the watch during the next week or ten days  when the letter came it was satisfactory the prisoners seeing the hopelessness of any defense had all admitted their guilt and the name of the man who had dealt with them had also been given up except in his case there would be no trial the others would have sentences passed on them at once and three who had been promised comparatively slight punishment would go into the box to give evidence against the man who had engaged them before starting for holland mark had consulted millicent as to whether she would prefer being married in london or at crowswood she had replied  i should greatly prefer crowswood mark here we know no one there we should be among all our friends certainly if we dont go we must get mr greg to come up and marry us here i am sure he would feel very disappointed if anyone else were asked at the same time i should not like to go home when we come back from our trip it will be different but it would be a great trial now and however happy we might be i should feel there was a gloom over the house  i quite agree with you millicent when we come back we can see about entirely refurnishing it and perhaps adding some rooms to it and we need not go down until a complete change has been made we shall be able to manage it somehow or other and i quite agree with you that anything will be better than going back to the house for a day or two before the wedding  on the voyage back from holland mark had talked the matter over with dick chetwynd and said that he thought of taking rooms for mrs cunningham and millicent at reigate and stopping at the hotel himself and having the wedding breakfast there  of course dick you will be my best man  i should think so dick laughed why if you had asked anyone else i should have made a personal matter of it with him and have given him the option of resigning the position or going out with me but your other plans are foolish and i shall take the matter into my own hands i shall insist upon the two ladies coming down to the park and i will get my aunt to come and preside generally over things i shall fill up the house with bridesmaids and shall have a dance the evening before you can put up at the hotel if you like but you know very well that there are a dozen houses where they will be delighted to have you there is no doubt that when they know what is coming off you will get a dozen invitations and then after church all those invited will drive off to the park to the wedding breakfast after that is over you can start in a post chaise to canterbury or dover wherever you may decide to make your first halt  but my dear dick i could not put you to all this trouble  nonsense man i should enjoy it immensely besides i shall be really glad of a good reason to try and open the doors of the park again i have been there very little since my fathers death and i think i shall make it my headquarters in future i am getting rather tired of bachelor life in london and must look out for a wife so nothing could be more appropriate than this idea dont bother yourself any further about it i shall ride down and establish myself there tomorrow and spend a couple of days in driving round to our friends and in sending out invitations i shall still have nearly a fortnight for making all preparations why it will cause quite an excitement in the neighborhood i shall be hailed as a benefactor and i shall let everyone know that your fathers ward was really your cousin but that by the will of her father she was to drop her surname until she came of age and that until that time your father was to have the entire control of the property i shall add that although the estate of course is hers your uncle has left you a very big fortune and that nothing could be more suitable in all respects than the marriage  that will do excellently dick that will be quite enough without going into details at all you can mention that we intend to have the house entirely refurnished and on the return from our wedding trip abroad to settle there i am sure i am extremely obliged to you for your offer which will certainly clear away all sorts of small difficulties  a day or two after his return mark wrote to mr greg telling him the relations in which millicent and he stood to each other and of the near approach of their marriage he said that millicent would be married from dick chetwynds but that it would be at crowswood church in return he received a warm letter of congratulation from the rector telling him that the news was in every respect delightful and that his wife and the children were in a state of the highest excitement not only at the marriage but at their coming down to reside again at crowswood  the village he said will be scarcely less pleased than i am for though everything goes on as you ordered and the people get their milk broths and jellies as before they dont look at it as the same thing as it was in the old days i cannot say that the news of your engagement to miss conyersi ought to say miss thorndykeis surprising for i had thought that it would be quite the natural thing for you to fall in love with each other and indeed my wife declares that she saw it coming on distinctly during the last few months before you left here your postscript saying that bastow had been captured and had committed suicide gave me a distinct feeling of relief for no one could tell whether the deadly enmity that he felt for your father might not extend to you i have cut this note rather short but i have just heard the door shut and i am quite sure that my wife has gone down to tell the good news in the village and i really cannot deny myself the pleasure of telling some of the people myself and seeing their faces brighten up at the news  as dick had foretold would be the case mark received a very warm letter from sir charles harris congratulating him upon his approaching marriage and insisting upon his taking up his quarters with him  i am sending a man down with this to hand it to the guard as the up coach goes through the town chetwynd told me that his call on me was the first he had paid so i feel fairly confident that i shall forestall the rest of your friends and that you will give me the pleasure of your company  mark wrote back accepting the invitation at once which enabled him to decline half a dozen others without the necessity of making a choice everything turned out as arranged millicent and mrs cunningham went down in a post chaise two days before the wedding and mark drove down in his gig with them dick chetwynd met them on horseback just outside reigate and escorted the ladies to his house mark driving on to that of sir charles harris millicent found the house full of her special friends whom she had asked to be her bridesmaids she was almost bewildered by the warmth of their welcome and overpowered by the questions poured upon her  the news quite took all our breath away millicent one of them said it seems extraordinary that you should have been miss thorndyke all the time though i dont think that any of us were at all surprised that you should take the name now you must have been surprised when you heard that you were the heiress of crowswood  i was a great deal more disgusted than surprised she said rather indignantly i did not think that it was fair at all that i should step into marks shoes  well it has all come right now millicent and i dare say you thought that it would even then  i can assure you that i did not quite the contrary i thought that it never would come right i was very unhappy about it for a time  now young ladies dick chetwynd laughed will you please take mrs cunningham and miss thorndyke up to their rooms i dont suppose i shall see any more of you before dinner time there are those trunks to be opened and examined talked over and admired mind i have fifteen more for the most part men coming to dinner so those of you who aspire to follow miss thorndykes example had best prepare yourselves for conquest  the ball on the following evening was a great success dick had determined that it should be a memorable one and there was a consensus of opinion that it was the most brilliant that had taken place in that part of the country for many years  crowswood church and village presented a most festive appearance on the following day there was not a cottage that had not great posies of flowers in its windows and that had not made some sort of attempt at decoration with flags or flowers a huge arch of evergreens with sheaves of wheat and flowers had been erected on the top of the hill and every man woman and child turned out in their best and cheered lustily first when mark drove up in his gig and equally lustily when the chetwynd carriage drawn by four gray horses dashed up preceded by a large number of others with the bridesmaids and friends the church was already crowded and mr greg was visibly moved at seeing the son and niece of the man to whom he owed his living made man and wife when the wedding breakfast at which more than fifty sat down and the necessary toasts were over mr and mrs thorndyke started for canterbury     chapter xxii   it was not until easter that mark thorndyke and his wife returned to england they had spent the greater portion of that time in italy lingering for a month at venice and had then journeyed quietly homewards through bavaria and saxony they were in no hurry as before starting on their honeymoon mark had consulted an architect had told him exactly what he wanted and had left the matter in his hands mrs cunningham had from time to time kept them informed how things were going on the part of the house in which the squires room had been situated was entirely pulled down and a new wing built in its stead millicent had been specially wishful that this should be done  i dont know that i am superstitious mark she had said but i do think that when a murder has taken place in a house it is better to make a complete change the servants always think they see or hear something that part of the house is avoided and it is difficult to get anyone to stay there i think it is very much more important to do that than it is to get the house refurnished we can do anything in that way you like when we get back but i should certainly like very much to have the great alteration made before we return  the architect was a clever one and the house which was some two hundred years old was greatly improved in appearance by the new wing which was made to harmonize well with the rest but was specially designed to give as much variety as possible to the general outline millicent uttered an exclamation of pleasure when they first caught a glimpse of the house as they rode through the village they were again welcomed as heartily as they were on their wedding day mrs cunningham received them she had been established there for a month and had placed the house entirely on its old footing they first examined the new portion of the house and millicent was greatly pleased with the rooms that had been prepared for them mark having requested mrs cunningham to put the furnishing into the hands of the best known firm of the day  i have asked mrs cunningham said the rector and his wife and mr chetwynd to dine with us this evening they can scarcely be termed company and i thought that you might find it pleasant to have these old friends here the first evening there is a letter for you on the library table mark it may almost be called a packet it has been here nearly a month  in our days a newly married couple would find on their return from foreign travel basketfuls of letters circulars and catalogues from tradesmen of all kinds happily our forefathers were saved from these inflictions and mark at once went to the library with almost a feeling of surprise as to who could have written to him he saw at once that it was a ships letter for on the top was written favored by the surinam  why it is ramoos writing i suppose he gave it to someone he knew and that instead of its being put in the mail bag in india he brought it on with him what a tremendously long epistle he exclaimed glancing his eye down the first page and then a puzzled expression came across his face he sat down and began to read from the first slowly and carefully  honored sahib  i do not know why i should write to tell you the true history of all these matters i have thought it over many times but i feel that it is right that you should know clearly what has happened and how it has come about and more especially that you should know that you need never fear any troubles such as those that have taken place i am beginning to write this while we are yet sailing and shall send it to you by ship from the cape or if it chances that we meet any ship on her way to england our letters may be put on board her  why this letter must be more than a year old mark said to himself there was no date to the letter but turning to the last sheet he saw as a postscript after the signature the words january 26tha ship the surinam is lying a short distance from us and will take our letters to england  yes it must be a year old but what he means by the way he begins is more than i can imagine and he turned back to the point at which he had broken off  i would tell it you in order as it happened i ramoo am a brahmin twenty years ago i was the head priest of a great temple i shall not say where the temple was it matters not in any way there was fighting as there is always fighting in india there were companys sepoys and white troops and one night the most sacred bracelet of the great god of our temple was stolen  good heavens mark exclaimed laying down the letter then it has been ramoo who has all this time been in pursuit of the diamonds and to think that my uncle never even suspected him  then suddenly he continued now i understand why it was my life was spared by those fellows by jove this is astounding then he took up the letter again  two of the brahmins under me had observed at a festival the day before the bracelet was lost a white soldier staring at it with covetous eyes one of them was in charge of the temple on the night when it was stolen and on the day following he came to me and said i desire to devote my life to the recovery of the jewels of the god bondah will go with me we will return no more until we bring them back it is good i said the god must be appeased or terrible misfortunes may happen then we held a solemn service in the temple the two men removed the caste marks from their foreheads prostrated themselves before the god and went out from amongst us as outcasts until the day of their death two months later a messenger came from the one who had spoken to me saying that they had found the man but had for a long time had no opportunity of finding the bracelet then bondah had met him in a lonely place and had attacked him bondah had lost his life but the soldier was though sorely wounded able to get back to his regiment he had died but he had the writer was convinced passed the jewels on to a comrade whom he would watch then i saw that one man was not sufficient for such a task then i too the chief brahmin of the temple saw that it was my duty to go forth also  i laid the matter before the others and they said you are right it is you who as the chief in the service of the god should bring back his jewels so again there was a service and i went forth as an outcast and a wanderer knowing that i must do many things that were forbidden to my caste that i must touch unclean things must eat forbidden food and must take life if needs be you sahib cannot understand how terrible was the degradation to me who was of the purest blood of the brahmins i had taken the most solemn vows to devote my life to this i knew that whether successful or not although i might be forgiven my offense by the god yet that never again could i recover my caste even though the heaviest penances were performed henceforth i must stand alone in the world without kindred without friends without help save such as the god might give me in the search  i was rich the greater part of my goods i gave to the temple and yet retained a considerable sum for i should need money to carry out my quest and after i had accomplished it i should hand over what remained for the benefit of the poor i should myself become a fakir i want you to understand sahib that henceforth i had but one object in life a supreme one to accomplish in which nothing must stand in my way and that what would be in others a crime was but a sacrifice on my part most acceptable to the god i journeyed down to the place where my comrade was dressed as one of the lowest class even as a sweeper and he and i strove by all the means in our power to discover what this man had done with the jewels night after night we crawled into his tent we searched his bed and his clothes with sharp rods we tried every inch of the soil believing that he had hidden the diamonds underground but we failed  there my comrade said i must give my life to find out where he hides these things i will watch night after night by the door of his tent and if he comes out i will stab him it shall be a mortal wound but i will not kill him outright before he dies he will doubtless as the other did pass the jewels on to some comrade and then it will be for you to follow him up it is good i said this man may have hidden them away somewhere during the time they have marched through the country in spite of the watch you have kept he may have said to himself i will return though it be years hence your plan is good i said i envy you tis better to die thus than to live in sin as we are doing  that evening the man was stabbed but an officer running up killed my comrade the soldier was taken to the hospital and i lay down beside the tent with my eye to a slit that i had cut and watched till morning  then i took my broom and swept the ground i had not been hired as one of the camp sweepers and so could move about and sweep where i chose no one ever asked me any questions the soldiers heeded me no more than if i had been a dog and of course supposed that i was acting by the order of the head of the sweepers presently i saw one of the servants of the hospital go across to the tent of the officer who had killed my comrade he came over and went into the hospital tent i felt sure that it was the wounded man who had sent for him he was in there some time presently a soldier came out and went to the tent of the wounded man and returned bringing a musket then i said to myself the god has blinded us he wills that we shall go through many more toils before we regain the bracelet doubtless the man had carried the bracelet in his musket all the time and we blind that we were had never thought of it  presently the officer came out again i noticed that as he did so he looked round on all sides as if to see if he were watched then i knew that it was as i had thought the soldier had given the bracelet to him at this i was pleased it would be far more easy to search the tent of an officer than of a soldier who sleeps surrounded by his comrades i thought that there was no hurry now it would need but patience and i should be sure to find them i had not calculated that he would have better opportunities than the soldier for going about and that doubtless the soldier had warned him of his danger two hours later the officer mounted his horse and rode towards the camp of another regiment a mile and a quarter away there was nothing in that but i watched for his return all that day and all that night and when he did not come back i felt that he was doing something to get rid of the diamonds  he was away three days and when he returned i was almost sure that he had not the diamonds about him as he had ridden off he had looked about just as he had when he left the hospital he was uneasy just as if he was watched now he was uneasy no longer then i knew that my search would be a long one and might fail altogether i went away and for three months i prayed and fasted then i returned i bought different clothes i painted my forehead with another caste mark then i bought from the servant of an officer in another regiment his papers of service recommendations from former masters then i went to the officeryou will guess sahib that it was the major your uncleand i paid his servant to leave his service and to present me as a brother of his who had been accustomed to serve white sahibs and was like himself a good servant so i took his place  he was a good master and i came to love him though i knew that i might yet have to kill him you have heard that i saved his life three times i did so partly because i loved him but chiefly because his life was most precious to me for if he had died i should have lost all clew to the bracelet i had of course made sure that he had not got them with him over and over again i searched every article in his possession i ripped open his saddle lest they might be sewn up in its stuffing all that could be done i did until i was quite sure that he had not got them he on his part came to like me he thought that i was the most faithful of servants and after the last time i saved his life he took me with him everywhere he went down to madras and was married there i watched his every movement after that he went down frequently then a child was born and six months afterwards his wife died  the regiment was stationed at the fort at that time he was at many placesthe governors the other officer sahibs the merchants and others i could not follow him but i was sure by his manner that he had not taken back the bracelet from whoever he had sent it to i knew him so well by this time that i should have noticed any change in his manner in a moment at last the child went away in the charge of mrs cunningham i bribed the childs ayah and she searched mrs cunninghams boxes and every garment she had and found no small sealed parcel or box amongst them three years more passed by this time the colonel treated me more as a friend than as a servant he said one day laughing it is a long time since my things have been turned topsy turvy ramoo i think the thieves have come to the conclusion that i have not got what they are looking for what is that sahib i asked some special jewels he said they are extremely valuable but i have got them and a lot of other things so safely stowed that no one will ever find them unless i give them the clew but suppose you are killed sahib i said your little daughter will never get the things i have provided for that he answered if i am killed i have arranged that she shall know all about it either when she comes to the age of eighteen or twentyone  a few weeks after that he was wounded very badly i nursed him night and day for weeks and when he came to england he brought me with him as you know sahib he died when he was in london he went to see mrs cunningham and the child and several times to the office of the lawyer who attended your fathers funeral then he came down to your father and i know he had long and earnest conversations with him i did all i could to listen but the colonel always had the windows and doors shut before he began to speak i could see that your father was troubled then the colonel died after his death i could never find his snuff box he had carried it about with him for some years once or twice i had examined it but it was too small for the diamonds to be hidden in i suppose that he had given it to the sahib your father but as i could never find it i guessed that there was some mystery attached to it though what i could not tell  then your father took me down to crowswood with him and mrs cunningham and the little girl came down i was surprised to find that your father seemed to be master of the estate and that no one thought anything of the child whose name had been changed i spoke one day to mrs cunningham about it your father seemed to me a just and good man and i could not believe that he was robbing his brothers daughter mrs cunningham told me that the colonel did not wish her to be known as an heiress and that he had left the estate to his brother until she came of age your father was as good a master as the colonel had been i watched and watched and once or twice i overheard him talking to himself in the library and discovered that your father himself was altogether ignorant of the hiding place of the property that the colonel had mentioned in his will i knew then that i should have to wait until the child was either eighteen or twentyone  it was a long time but i had learnt to be patient i was not unhappy i loved your father i loved the colonels little daughter and i was very fond of you all these things were small to me in comparison to my vow and the finding the jewels of the god but they shortened the years of waiting then a year before the young mistress was eighteen came the shot through the window i did not know who had fired it but i saw that your fathers life was in danger and i said to myself he will tell the young sahib what he knows about the bracelet after you had gone into the library i opened the door quietly and listened i could hear much that was said but not all i heard him say something about a snuff box and some means of finding the lost things being hidden in it and that he had kept them all these years in a secret hiding place which he described you were to search for the diamonds and i guessed from that that he did not know what he was to be told when the young memsahib came of age or perhaps when she was eighteen it was not until i had thought over what i heard that i came to the conclusion that if i could find the things he spoke of i might be able to find the jewels by that time your father had gone to bed i was foolish not to have been patient but my blood boiled after waiting for eighteen or nineteen years the god seemed to have sent me the chance and it seemed to me that i should take it at once i knew that he generally slept with his window open and it seemed to me that it would be easy to slip in there and to get those things from the cabinet i knew where the ladder was kept i took a file from the tool chest and cut the chain  here mark dropped the letter in horror  good heavens he exclaimed then bastow spoke truly and he was not my fathers murderer never did a single suspicion of ramoo enter my head this is appalling but i cannot read any more now it is time for me to go and dress for dinner  is anything the matter with you mark millicent asked anxiously as she met him in the drawing room you look as white as a sheet  i have been reading ramoos letter and he has told me some things that have surprised and shocked me i will tell you about them after dinner dear it is a long story but you wont have to wait until dick and the gregs are gone they are interested in all that interests us and shall hear the letter read no i think i will ask them and dick to come in the morning i should not like anything to sadden the first evening of our coming home  then it is something sad  yes but it does not affect us though it does affect ramoo now clear your brow dear and dismiss the subject from your mind else our guests will fancy that our marriage has not been altogether so satisfactory as they had hoped  as if they could think such a thing as that mark she said indignantly but there is the sound of wheels it is mr chetwynds gig  the three visitors all came in together having met at the door mark with a great effort put aside the letter from his mind and a cheerful evening was spent they had much to tell of their travels many questions to ask about the parish and their mutual friends and the neighborhood generally and when they rose to go mark said  would you mind riding over again tomorrow morning dick i have a letter to read to you that will interest you greatly  certainly what time shall i be here  say at eleven oclock it is a long epistle and will take us an hour to get through after that we can stroll round and of course you will stop to lunch  i should be glad if you and mrs greg can come over too he added turning to the rector you will be much interested also in the matter   the next day the party met in the library at the hour named i may tell you mr greg that i specially asked you and your wife here because this letter throws some light on arthur bastows connection with my fathers murder you were friends with his father and i think you ought to know as to you dick the letter will interest you from beginning to end and will surprise as much as it will interest you  even i dont know what it is mrs greg millicent said i know it quite upset mark yesterday but he said he would sooner i did not know anything about it until today as he did not want me to be saddened on the first evening of our return home now please go on mark you have said quite enough to excite us all  mark had read but a short distance when dick chetwynd exclaimed  then ramoo was at the bottom of that indian business after all i almost wonder you never suspected it mark  well i hardly could do so mark said when my uncle was so fond of him and he had served him so faithfully  as he approached the point at which he had laid down the letter on the previous evening millicents color faded  suddenly an exclamation of horror broke from her when he read the last line  oh mark she said with quivering lips dont say it was ramoo he always seemed so kind and good  it was here i stopped last night he said but i fear there can be no doubt about it i must say that it is evident from this letter that no thought of doing my father harm was in his mind when he placed that ladder against the window now i will go on  the letter continued as follows  having placed the ladder i clambered to the window and quietly entered the room it was quite dark but i knew the place of every piece of furniture so well that i was able to go without hesitation to the cabinet your father was speaking very slowly and distinctly when he told you how it was to be opened and i was able to do it easily but i did not know that the back opened with a sharp click and the noise startled me and woke your father in an instant he was out of bed and seized me by the throat now he was a much stronger man than i was i struggled in vain i felt that in a moment i should become insensible my vow and my duty to the god flashed across me and scarce knowing what i did i drew a little dagger i always carried and struck blindly he fell and i fell beside him for a time i was insensible when i recovered i was seized with the bitterest remorse that i had killed one i loved but i seemed to hear the voice of the god saying you have done well ramoo i am your great master and you are bound to my service  i got up almost blindly felt in the cabinet and found a coin and a piece of paper and a feeling of exultation came over me that after nearly twenty years i should succeed in carrying out my vow and taking his bracelet back to the god i descended the ladder crept in the back door by which i had come out went up to my room where i had kept a light burning and examined my treasures then i saw that all had been in vain they were doubtless a key to the mystery but until a clew was given they were absolutely useless i sat for hours staring at them i would have gone back and replaced them in the cabinet and left all as it had been before but i dared not enter the room again the next day i heard you say that you suspected that the talk with your father had been overheard and that the man who had earlier in the evening before shot at him had returned and while listening had heard something said about the hiding place and thought that he would find some sort of treasure there i thought that in the talk your father might have told you how to use these things though i had not caught it and it was therefore important that you should have them back again so i went into the room after the inquest was over and placed the things in their hiding place again  then thinking it over i determined to leave your service you would be trying to find the treasure and i must watch you and this i could not do as long as i was a house servant so i came up to london and you thought i had sailed for india but i did not go i hired four lascars men of my own religion and paid them to watch every movement that you made to see where you visited and where you went i paid them well and they served me well it was so that i was able to bring those men to your help when but for that you would have lost your life it was for this to some extent that i had you followed for i soon found out that you were on the search for the man who had fired through the window and who you believed had killed your father rather than for the jewels i knew that you might run into danger and partly because i loved you and partly because it was possible that it would be essential for that coin and piece of paper to be produced in order that the treasure might be obtained i kept guard over you  when the 18th of august approached we were all on the watch i felt sure that you would take every possible precaution while you had the bracelet in your possession we knew who were your principal friends the bankers son and mr chetwynd on the 18th of august everything went on as usual on the following day the bankers son came to you and as soon as he left you you went to the lawyers and afterwards to the bankers i felt sure now that it was at that bank that the jewels had been placed and that you had been waiting till the young memsahibs birthday for the news that they might be taken out then you went to mr chetwynds and he went to the bank i had no doubt that he was to take them out for you and after that one of the men never took his eyes off him when he was outside of his house afterwards you went to the place where the men used to fight and the man who was watching you went in and had beer and saw you talking with the big man you used to fight with in the parlor behind the bar the watcher went out to follow you but left another to watch this man we found that both mr chetwynd and he went to a shipping office in tower street and we then guessed that you intended to take the bracelet at once across the sea  i went myself and found out that a vessel was sailing in two days to amsterdam i took a passage for a man in the cheap cabin and asked to look at the list of passengers as i believed that some friend would be sailing by her there were two mens names down together in one handwriting among the first class passengers and i guessed that these were you and mr chetwynd i also saw the name of the big man which i had heard long before down in the list of passengers and another name next to his in the same handwriting i did not know his name but guessed that it was another of the fighting men and that they were going to look after you until you had got rid of the diamonds on the morning that she was to sail one of the lascars was on board i thought it possible that in order to throw anyone who might be following you off your scent you might at the last moment go ashore and that mr chetwynd might take the diamonds over so i watched and saw you on the deck with your friend  i and the other three lascars then took passage that evening in a craft for rotterdam and got to amsterdam two days before your ship arrived we went to different houses and going separately into the worst parts of the town soon found a man who kept a gambling den and who was a man who could be trusted i offered him a thousand francs to collect twentyfive men who were to be paid a hundred francs each and to be ready if your ship arrived after dark to attack two passengers i would point out to them i did not want you to be hurt so bargained that all knives were to be left behind and that he was to supply the men only with clubs if the ship came in in daylight you were to be attacked the first time you went out after dark you know how that was carried out you had two more men with you than i had expected but i thought that with a sudden rush you might all be separated you know the rest the moment you were knocked down i and three others carried you to a boat it had been lying near the stairs and we took you off to the barge in which i had arranged you should be taken to rotterdam  we told them that you were a drunken man who had been stunned in a fight in a public house as soon as we were off i searched you and found the diamonds then as you know we put you ashore we all crossed to england that night two days later i sailed in this ship the brahmapootra i am not afraid of telling you this because i know that the diamonds will not shine on the gods arm until all fear of search and inquiry are over my task will be done when i hand them over to the man who holds the office i once held then i shall bear the penances imposed on me for having broken my caste in every way and for having taken life and for the rest of my days i shall wander as a fakir through india i shall be supported by the knowledge that i have done my duty to my god and have sacrificed all in his service but it will ever be a grief to me that in so doing it was necessary to sacrifice the life of one who had ever shown me kindness you may wonder why i have written this but i felt that i must own the truth to you and that you should know that if in the course of my duty to the god it was my misfortune to slay your father i have twice saved your life just as three times i saved that of the colonel sahib your uncle  there was silence for some little time after mark had finished reading  it is a strange story indeed mr greg said but it is not for us to judge the man he has acted according to his lights and none can do more he sacrificed himself and his life solely to the service of his god well knowing that even were he successful his reward would be penance and suffering and a life of what cannot but be misery to a man brought up as he has been to consider himself of the highest and holiest rank of the people i think mark we need neither say nor think anything harshly of him  certainly not mark agreed i can understand that according to his view of the matter anything that stood between him and his goal was but an obstacle to be swept aside assuredly there was no premeditation in the killing of my father i have no doubt that the man was attached to him and that he killed him not to save his own life but in order that his mission might be carried out  quite so mark it was done in the same spirit if i may say so that abraham would have sacrificed his son at the order of his god what years of devotion that man has passed through accustomed as you see to a lofty position to the respect and veneration of those around him he became a servant and performed duties that were in his opinion not only humiliating but polluting and destructive to his caste and which rendered him an outcast even among the lowest of his people do you not think so mrs thorndyke  millicent who was crying quietly looked up  i can only think of him as the man who twice saved marks life she said  i understand why you have wished to tell me this story the rector went on to mark you wish me to know that arthur bastow did not add this to his other crimes that he was spared from being the murderer of your father but from no want of will on his part and as we know he killed many others the last but an hour or two before he put an end to his own life still i am glad that this terrible crime is not his it seemed to be so revolting and unnatural it was the squires father who had given the living to his father and the squire himself had been his friend in the greatest of his trials and had given him a shelter and a home in his old age i am glad at least that the man evil as he was was spared this last crime of the grossest ingratitude  well mark dick chetwynd said cheerfully in order to turn the subject i am heartily glad that we have got to the bottom of this jewel mystery i have been puzzling over it all the time that you have been away and i have never been able to understand how in spite of the precautions that we took they should have found out that the jewels were at cotters and that you had them on board with you and above all why they spared your life when they could so easily and safely have put you out of the way it is certainly strange that while you were thinking over everything connected with the jewels the idea that ramoo was the leading spirit in the whole business should never once have occurred to you  a month later when mark went up to town he called at leadenhall street  of course you have not heard of the arrival of the brahmapootra at madras yet may i ask when she left the cape  she never left the cape sir the clerk replied and there are very grave fears for her safety she spoke the surinam and gave her mails for england when the latter was eight days out from the cape and the surinam reported that a day later she encountered a terrible gale lost several spars and narrowly escaped being blown onto the african coast since then we have had no news of the brahmapootra a number of indiamen have arrived since the latest came in only yesterday and up to the time when she left no news had been received of the ship three small craft had been sent up the coast weeks before to make inquiries for her but had returned without being able to obtain any intelligence and had seen no wreckage on the coast although they had gone several hundred miles beyond where she had spoken the surinam therefore there can be little doubt that she foundered with all hands during the gale you had no near relatives on board i hope sir  no near relatives but there was one on board in whom i was greatly interested here is my card i should feel greatly obliged if you would write me a line should you hear anything of her  i will do so sir we have had innumerable inquiries from friends and relatives of those on board and although of late we have been obliged to say that there can no longer be any hope that she will ever be heard of not a day passes but many persons still come in to inquire  no letter ever came to mark no news was ever heard of the brahmapootra ramoos sacrifice was in vain and never again did the diamond bracelet glisten on the arm of the idol in the unknown temple    the end
