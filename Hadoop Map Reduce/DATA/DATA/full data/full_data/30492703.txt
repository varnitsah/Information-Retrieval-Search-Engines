the death of halpin frayser    i  for by death is wrought greater change than hath been shown  whereas in general the spirit that removed cometh back upon occasion and is sometimes seen of those in flesh appearing in the form of the body it bore yet it hath happened that the veritable body without the spirit hath walked  and it is attested of those encountering who have lived to speak thereon that a lich so raised up hath no natural affection nor remembrance thereof but only hate  also it is known that some spirits which in life were benign become by death evil altogetherhali   one dark night in midsummer a man waking from a dreamless sleep in a forest lifted his head from the earth and staring a few moments into the blackness said  catherine larue  he said nothing more no reason was known to him why he should have said so much  the man was halpin frayser  he lived in st helena but where he lives now is uncertain for he is dead  one who practices sleeping in the woods with nothing under him but the dry leaves and the damp earth and nothing over him but the branches from which the leaves have fallen and the sky from which the earth has fallen cannot hope for great longevity and frayser had already attained the age of thirtytwo  there are persons in this world millions of persons and far and away the best persons who regard that as a very advanced age  they are the children  to those who view the voyage of life from the port of departure the bark that has accomplished any considerable distance appears already in close approach to the farther shore  however it is not certain that halpin frayser came to his death by exposure  he had been all day in the hills west of the napa valley looking for doves and such small game as was in season  late in the afternoon it had come on to be cloudy and he had lost his bearings and although he had only to go always downhilleverywhere the way to safety when one is lostthe absence of trails had so impeded him that he was overtaken by night while still in the forest  unable in the darkness to penetrate the thickets of manzanita and other undergrowth utterly bewildered and overcome with fatigue he had lain down near the root of a large madrono and fallen into a dreamless sleep  it was hours later in the very middle of the night that one of gods mysterious messengers gliding ahead of the incalculable host of his companions sweeping westward with the dawn line pronounced the awakening word in the ear of the sleeper who sat upright and spoke he knew not why a name he knew not whose  halpin frayser was not much of a philosopher nor a scientist  the circumstance that waking from a deep sleep at night in the midst of a forest he had spoken aloud a name that he had not in memory and hardly had in mind did not arouse an enlightened curiosity to investigate the phenomenon  he thought it odd and with a little perfunctory shiver as if in deference to a seasonal presumption that the night was chill he lay down again and went to sleep  but his sleep was no longer dreamless  he thought he was walking along a dusty road that showed white in the gathering darkness of a summer night  whence and whither it led and why he traveled it he did not know though all seemed simple and natural as is the way in dreams for in the land beyond the bed surprises cease from troubling and the judgment is at rest  soon he came to a parting of the ways leading from the highway was a road less traveled having the appearance indeed of having been long abandoned because he thought it led to something evil yet he turned into it without hesitation impelled by some imperious necessity  as he pressed forward he became conscious that his way was haunted by invisible existences whom he could not definitely figure to his mind from among the trees on either side he caught broken and incoherent whispers in a strange tongue which yet he partly understood  they seemed to him fragmentary utterances of a monstrous conspiracy against his body and soul  it was now long after nightfall yet the interminable forest through which he journeyed was lit with a wan glimmer having no point of diffusion for in its mysterious lumination nothing cast a shadow  a shallow pool in the guttered depression of an old wheel rut as from a recent rain met his eye with a crimson gleam  he stooped and plunged his hand into it  it stained his fingers it was blood blood he then observed was about him everywhere  the weeds growing rankly by the roadside showed it in blots and splashes on their big broad leaves  patches of dry dust between the wheelways were pitted and spattered as with a red rain  defiling the trunks of the trees were broad maculations of crimson and blood dripped like dew from their foliage  all this he observed with a terror which seemed not incompatible with the fulfillment of a natural expectation  it seemed to him that it was all in expiation of some crime which though conscious of his guilt he could not rightly remember  to the menaces and mysteries of his surroundings the consciousness was an added horror  vainly he sought by tracing life backward in memory to reproduce the moment of his sin scenes and incidents came crowding tumultuously into his mind one picture effacing another or commingling with it in confusion and obscurity but nowhere could he catch a glimpse of what he sought  the failure augmented his terror he felt as one who has murdered in the dark not knowing whom nor why  so frightful was the situationthe mysterious light burned with so silent and awful a menace the noxious plants the trees that by common consent are invested with a melancholy or baleful character so openly in his sight conspired against his peace from overhead and all about came so audible and startling whispers and the sighs of creatures so obviously not of earththat he could endure it no longer and with a great effort to break some malign spell that bound his faculties to silence and inaction he shouted with the full strength of his lungs his voice broken it seemed into an infinite multitude of unfamiliar sounds went babbling and stammering away into the distant reaches of the forest died into silence and all was as before  but he had made a beginning at resistance and was encouraged  he said  i will not submit unheard  there may be powers that are not malignant traveling this accursed road  i shall leave them a record and an appeal  i shall relate my wrongs the persecutions that i endurei a helpless mortal a penitent an unoffending poet halpin frayser was a poet only as he was a penitent  in his dream  taking from his clothing a small redleather pocketbook onehalf of which was leaved for memoranda he discovered that he was without a pencil  he broke a twig from a bush dipped it into a pool of blood and wrote rapidly  he had hardly touched the paper with the point of his twig when a low wild peal of laughter broke out at a measureless distance away and growing ever louder seemed approaching ever nearer a soulless heartless and unjoyous laugh like that of the loon solitary by the lakeside at midnight a laugh which culminated in an unearthly shout close at hand then died away by slow gradations as if the accursed being that uttered it had withdrawn over the verge of the world whence it had come  but the man felt that this was not sothat it was near by and had not moved  a strange sensation began slowly to take possession of his body and his mind  he could not have said which if any of his senses was affected he felt it rather as a consciousnessa mysterious mental assurance of some overpowering presencesome supernatural malevolence different in kind from the invisible existences that swarmed about him and superior to them in power  he knew that it had uttered that hideous laugh  and now it seemed to be approaching him from what direction he did not knowdared not conjecture  all his former fears were forgotten or merged in the gigantic terror that now held him in thrall  apart from that he had but one thought  to complete his written appeal to the benign powers who traversing the haunted wood might some time rescue him if he should be denied the blessing of annihilation  he wrote with terrible rapidity the twig in his fingers rilling blood without renewal but in the middle of a sentence his hands denied their service to his will his arms fell to his sides the book to the earth and powerless to move or cry out he found himself staring into the sharply drawn face and blank dead eyes of his own mother standing white and silent in the garments of the grave  ii  in his youth halpin frayser had lived with his parents in nashville tennessee  the fraysers were welltodo having a good position in such society as had survived the wreck wrought by civil war  their children had the social and educational opportunities of their time and place and had responded to good associations and instruction with agreeable manners and cultivated minds  halpin being the youngest and not over robust was perhaps a trifle spoiled  he had the double disadvantage of a mothers assiduity and a fathers neglect  frayser pere was what no southern man of means is nota politician  his country or rather his section and state made demands upon his time and attention so exacting that to those of his family he was compelled to turn an ear partly deafened by the thunder of the political captains and the shouting his own included  young halpin was of a dreamy indolent and rather romantic turn somewhat more addicted to literature than law the profession to which he was bred  among those of his relations who professed the modern faith of heredity it was well understood that in him the character of the late myron bayne a maternal greatgrandfather had revisited the glimpses of the moonby which orb bayne had in his lifetime been sufficiently affected to be a poet of no small colonial distinction  if not specially observed it was observable that while a frayser who was not the proud possessor of a sumptuous copy of the ancestral poetical works printed at the family expense and long ago withdrawn from an inhospitable market was a rare frayser indeed there was an illogical indisposition to honor the great deceased in the person of his spiritual successor  halpin was pretty generally deprecated as an intellectual black sheep who was likely at any moment to disgrace the flock by bleating in meter  the tennessee fraysers were a practical folknot practical in the popular sense of devotion to sordid pursuits but having a robust contempt for any qualities unfitting a man for the wholesome vocation of politics  in justice to young halpin it should be said that while in him were pretty faithfully reproduced most of the mental and moral characteristics ascribed by history and family tradition to the famous colonial bard his succession to the gift and faculty divine was purely inferential  not only had he never been known to court the muse but in truth he could not have written correctly a line of verse to save himself from the killer of the wise  still there was no knowing when the dormant faculty might wake and smite the lyre  in the meantime the young man was rather a loose fish anyhow between him and his mother was the most perfect sympathy for secretly the lady was herself a devout disciple of the late and great myron bayne though with the tact so generally and justly admired in her sex despite the hardy calumniators who insist that it is essentially the same thing as cunning she had always taken care to conceal her weakness from all eyes but those of him who shared it their common guilt in respect of that was an added tie between them if in halpins youth his mother had spoiled him he had assuredly done his part toward being spoiled  as he grew to such manhood as is attainable by a southerner who does not care which way elections go the attachment between him and his beautiful motherwhom from early childhood he had called katybecame yearly stronger and more tender in these two romantic natures was manifest in a signal way that neglected phenomenon the dominance of the sexual element in all the relations of life strengthening softening and beautifying even those of consanguinity  the two were nearly inseparable and by strangers observing their manner were not infrequently mistaken for lovers  entering his mothers boudoir one day halpin frayser kissed her upon the forehead toyed for a moment with a lock of her dark hair which had escaped from its confining pins and said with an obvious effort at calmness  would you greatly mind katy if i were called away to california for a few weeks  it was hardly needful for katy to answer with her lips a question to which her telltale cheeks had made instant reply  evidently she would greatly mind and the tears too sprang into her large brown eyes as corroborative testimony  ah my son she said looking up into his face with infinite tenderness i should have known that this was coming  did i not lie awake a half of the night weeping because during the other half grandfather bayne had come to me in a dream and standing by his portraityoung too and handsome as thatpointed to yours on the same wall  and when i looked it seemed that i could not see the features you had been painted with a face cloth such as we put upon the dead  your father has laughed at me but you and i dear know that such things are not for nothing  and i saw below the edge of the cloth the marks of hands on your throatforgive me but we have not been used to keep such things from each other  perhaps you have another interpretation  perhaps it does not mean that you will go to california  or maybe you will take me with you  it must be confessed that this ingenious interpretation of the dream in the light of newly discovered evidence did not wholly commend itself to the sons more logical mind he had for the moment at least a conviction that it foreshadowed a more simple and immediate if less tragic disaster than a visit to the pacific coast  it was halpin fraysers impression that he was to be garroted on his native heath  are there not medicinal springs in california mrs frayser resumed before he had time to give her the true reading of the dreamplaces where one recovers from rheumatism and neuralgia  lookmy fingers feel so stiff and i am almost sure they have been giving me great pain while i slept  she held out her hands for his inspection  what diagnosis of her case the young man may have thought it best to conceal with a smile the historian is unable to state but for himself he feels bound to say that fingers looking less stiff and showing fewer evidences of even insensible pain have seldom been submitted for medical inspection by even the fairest patient desiring a prescription of unfamiliar scenes  the outcome of it was that of these two odd persons having equally odd notions of duty the one went to california as the interest of his client required and the other remained at home in compliance with a wish that her husband was scarcely conscious of entertaining  while in san francisco halpin frayser was walking one dark night along the water front of the city when with a suddenness that surprised and disconcerted him he became a sailor  he was in fact shanghaied aboard a gallant gallant ship and sailed for a far countree  nor did his misfortunes end with the voyage for the ship was cast ashore on an island of the south pacific and it was six years afterward when the survivors were taken off by a venturesome trading schooner and brought back to san francisco  though poor in purse frayser was no less proud in spirit than he had been in the years that seemed ages and ages ago  he would accept no assistance from strangers and it was while living with a fellow survivor near the town of st helena awaiting news and remittances from home that he had gone gunning and dreaming  iii  the apparition confronting the dreamer in the haunted woodthe thing so like yet so unlike his motherwas horrible  it stirred no love nor longing in his heart it came unattended with pleasant memories of a golden pastinspired no sentiment of any kind all the finer emotions were swallowed up in fear  he tried to turn and run from before it but his legs were as lead he was unable to lift his feet from the ground  his arms hung helpless at his sides of his eyes only he retained control and these he dared not remove from the lusterless orbs of the apparition which he knew was not a soul without a body but that most dreadful of all existences infesting that haunted wooda body without a soul  in its blank stare was neither love nor pity nor intelligencenothing to which to address an appeal for mercy  an appeal will not lie he thought with an absurd reversion to professional slang making the situation more horrible as the fire of a cigar might light up a tomb  for a time which seemed so long that the world grew gray with age and sin and the haunted forest having fulfilled its purpose in this monstrous culmination of its terrors vanished out of his consciousness with all its sights and sounds the apparition stood within a pace regarding him with the mindless malevolence of a wild brute then thrust its hands forward and sprang upon him with appalling ferocity  the act released his physical energies without unfettering his will his mind was still spellbound but his powerful body and agile limbs endowed with a blind insensate life of their own resisted stoutly and well  for an instant he seemed to see this unnatural contest between a dead intelligence and a breathing mechanism only as a spectatorsuch fancies are in dreams then he regained his identity almost as if by a leap forward into his body and the straining automaton had a directing will as alert and fierce as that of its hideous antagonist  but what mortal can cope with a creature of his dream  the imagination creating the enemy is already vanquished the combats result is the combats cause  despite his strugglesdespite his strength and activity which seemed wasted in a void he felt the cold fingers close upon his throat  borne backward to the earth he saw above him the dead and drawn face within a hands breadth of his own and then all was black  a sound as of the beating of distant drumsa murmur of swarming voices a sharp far cry signing all to silence and halpin frayser dreamed that he was dead  iv  a warm clear night had been followed by a morning of drenching fog at about the middle of the afternoon of the preceding day a little whiff of light vapora mere thickening of the atmosphere the ghost of a cloudhad been observed clinging to the western side of mount st helena away up along the barren altitudes near the summit  it was so thin so diaphanous so like a fancy made visible that one would have said  look quickly in a moment it will be gone  in a moment it was visibly larger and denser  while with one edge it clung to the mountain with the other it reached farther and farther out into the air above the lower slopes  at the same time it extended itself to north and south joining small patches of mist that appeared to come out of the mountainside on exactly the same level with an intelligent design to be absorbed  and so it grew and grew until the summit was shut out of view from the valley and over the valley itself was an everextending canopy opaque and gray  at calistoga which lies near the head of the valley and the foot of the mountain there were a starless night and a sunless morning  the fog sinking into the valley had reached southward swallowing up ranch after ranch until it had blotted out the town of st helena nine miles away  the dust in the road was laid trees were adrip with moisture birds sat silent in their coverts the morning light was wan and ghastly with neither color nor fire  two men left the town of st helena at the first glimmer of dawn and walked along the road northward up the valley toward calistoga  they carried guns on their shoulders yet no one having knowledge of such matters could have mistaken them for hunters of bird or beast  they were a deputy sheriff from napa and a detective from san francisco holker and jaralson respectively  their business was manhunting  how far is it inquired holker as they strode along their feet stirring white the dust beneath the damp surface of the road  the white church  only a half mile farther the other answered by the way he added it is neither white nor a church it is an abandoned schoolhouse gray with age and neglect  religious services were once held in itwhen it was white and there is a graveyard that would delight a poet  can you guess why i sent for you and told you to come heeled  oh i never have bothered you about things of that kind  ive always found you communicative when the time came  but if i may hazard a guess you want me to help you arrest one of the corpses in the graveyard  you remember branscom said jaralson treating his companions wit with the inattention that it deserved  the chap who cut his wifes throat  i ought i wasted a weeks work on him and had my expenses for my trouble  there is a reward of five hundred dollars but none of us ever got a sight of him  you dont mean to say  yes i do  he has been under the noses of you fellows all the time he comes by night to the old graveyard at the white church  the devil  thats where they buried his wife  well you fellows might have had sense enough to suspect that he would return to her grave some time  the very last place that anyone would have expected him to return to  but you had exhausted all the other places  learning your failure at them i laid for him there  and you found him  damn it he found me  the rascal got the drop on meregularly held me up and made me travel  its gods mercy that he didnt go through me  oh hes a good one and i fancy the half of that reward is enough for me if youre needy  holker laughed good humoredly and explained that his creditors were never more importunate  i wanted merely to show you the ground and arrange a plan with you the detective explained  i thought it as well for us to be heeled even in daylight  the man must be insane said the deputy sheriff  the reward is for his capture and conviction  if hes mad he wont be convicted  mr holker was so profoundly affected by that possible failure of justice that he involuntarily stopped in the middle of the road then resumed his walk with abated zeal  well he looks it assented jaralson  im bound to admit that a more unshaven unshorn unkempt and uneverything wretch i never saw outside the ancient and honorable order of tramps  but ive gone in for him and cant make up my mind to let go  theres glory in it for us anyhow  not another soul knows that he is this side of the mountains of the moon  all right holker said we will go and view the ground and he added in the words of a once favorite inscription for tombstones where you must shortly liei mean if old branscom ever gets tired of you and your impertinent intrusion  by the way i heard the other day that branscom was not his real name  what is  i cant recall it  i had lost all interest in the wretch and it did not fix itself in my memorysomething like pardee  the woman whose throat he had the bad taste to cut was a widow when he met her she had come to california to look up some relativesthere are persons who will do that sometimes  but you know all that  naturally  but not knowing the right name by what happy inspiration did you find the right grave  the man who told me what the name was said it had been cut on the headboard  i dont know the right grave  jaralson was apparently a trifle reluctant to admit his ignorance of so important a point of his plan i have been watching about the place generally  a part of our work this morning will be to identify that grave  here is the white church  for a long distance the road had been bordered by fields on both sides but now on the left there was a forest of oaks madronos and gigantic spruces whose lower parts only could be seen dim and ghostly in the fog  the undergrowth was in places thick but nowhere impenetrable  for some moments holker saw nothing of the building but as they turned into the woods it revealed itself in faint gray outline through the fog looking huge and far away  a few steps more and it was within an arms length distinct dark with moisture and insignificant in size  it had the usual country schoolhouse formbelonged to the packingbox order of architecture had an underpinning of stones a mossgrown roof and blank window spaces whence both glass and sash had long departed  it was ruined but not a ruina typical californian substitute for what are known to guidebookers abroad as monuments of the past  with scarcely a glance at this uninteresting structure jaralson moved on into the dripping undergrowth beyond  i will show you where he held me up he said  this is the graveyard  here and there among the bushes were small inclosures containing graves sometimes no more than one  they were recognized as graves by the discolored stones or rotting boards at head and foot leaning at all angles some prostrate by the ruined picket fences surrounding them or infrequently by the mound itself showing its gravel through the fallen leaves  in many instances nothing marked the spot where lay the vestiges of some poor mortalwho leaving a large circle of sorrowing friends had been left by them in turn except a depression in the earth more lasting than that in the spirits of the mourners  the paths if any paths had been were long obliterated trees of a considerable size had been permitted to grow up from the graves and thrust aside with root or branch the inclosing fences  over all was that air of abandonment and decay which seems nowhere so fit and significant as in a village of the forgotten dead  as the two men jaralson leading pushed their way through the growth of young trees that enterprising man suddenly stopped and brought up his shotgun to the height of his breast uttered a low note of warning and stood motionless his eyes fixed upon something ahead as well as he could obstructed by brush his companion though seeing nothing imitated the posture and so stood prepared for what might ensue  a moment later jaralson moved cautiously forward the other following  under the branches of an enormous spruce lay the dead body of a man standing silent above it they noted such particulars as first strike the attentionthe face the attitude the clothing whatever most promptly and plainly answers the unspoken question of a sympathetic curiosity  the body lay upon its back the legs wide apart  one arm was thrust upward the other outward but the latter was bent acutely and the hand was near the throat  both hands were tightly clenched  the whole attitude was that of desperate but ineffectual resistance to what  near by lay a shotgun and a game bag through the meshes of which was seen the plumage of shot birds  all about were evidences of a furious struggle small sprouts of poisonoak were bent and denuded of leaf and bark dead and rotting leaves had been pushed into heaps and ridges on both sides of the legs by the action of other feet than theirs alongside the hips were unmistakable impressions of human knees  the nature of the struggle was made clear by a glance at the dead mans throat and face  while breast and hands were white those were purplealmost black  the shoulders lay upon a low mound and the head was turned back at an angle otherwise impossible the expanded eyes staring blankly backward in a direction opposite to that of the feet  from the froth filling the open mouth the tongue protruded black and swollen  the throat showed horrible contusions not mere fingermarks but bruises and lacerations wrought by two strong hands that must have buried themselves in the yielding flesh maintaining their terrible grasp until long after death  breast throat face were wet the clothing was saturated drops of water condensed from the fog studded the hair and mustache  all this the two men observed without speakingalmost at a glance then holker said  poor devil he had a rough deal  jaralson was making a vigilant circumspection of the forest his shotgun held in both hands and at full cock his finger upon the trigger  the work of a maniac he said without withdrawing his eyes from the inclosing wood  it was done by branscompardee  something half hidden by the disturbed leaves on the earth caught holkers attention  it was a redleather pocketbook  he picked it up and opened it  it contained leaves of white paper for memoranda and upon the first leaf was the name halpin frayser  written in red on several succeeding leavesscrawled as if in haste and barely legiblewere the following lines which holker read aloud while his companion continued scanning the dim gray confines of their narrow world and hearing matter of apprehension in the drip of water from every burdened branch   enthralled by some mysterious spell i stood in the lit gloom of an enchanted wood    the cypress there and myrtle twined their boughs significant in baleful brotherhood  the brooding willow whispered to the yew beneath the deadly nightshade and the rue    with immortelles selfwoven into strange funereal shapes and horrid nettles grew  no song of bird nor any drone of bees nor light leaf lifted by the wholesome breeze    the air was stagnant all and silence was a living thing that breathed among the trees  conspiring spirits whispered in the gloom halfheard the stilly secrets of the tomb    with blood the trees were all adrip the leaves shone in the witchlight with a ruddy bloom  i cried aloudthe spell unbroken still rested upon my spirit and my will    unsouled unhearted hopeless and forlorn i strove with monstrous presages of ill  at last the viewless   holker ceased reading there was no more to read  the manuscript broke off in the middle of a line  that sounds like bayne said jaralson who was something of a scholar in his way  he had abated his vigilance and stood looking down at the body  whos bayne holker asked rather incuriously  myron bayne a chap who flourished in the early years of the nation more than a century ago  wrote mighty dismal stuff i have his collected works  that poem is not among them but it must have been omitted by mistake  it is cold said holker let us leave here we must have up the coroner from napa  jaralson said nothing but made a movement in compliance  passing the end of the slight elevation of earth upon which the dead mans head and shoulders lay his foot struck some hard substance under the rotting forest leaves and he took the trouble to kick it into view it was a fallen headboard and painted on it were the hardly decipherable words catharine larue  larue larue exclaimed holker with sudden animation  why that is the real name of branscomnot pardee  andbless my soul how it all comes to methe murdered womans name had been frayser  there is some rascally mystery here said detective jaralson  i hate anything of that kind  there came to them out of the fogseemingly from a great distance the sound of a laugh a low deliberate soulless laugh which had no more of joy than that of a hyena nightprowling in the desert a laugh that rose by slow gradation louder and louder clearer more distinct and terrible until it seemed barely outside the narrow circle of their vision a laugh so unnatural so unhuman so devilish that it filled those hardy manhunters with a sense of dread unspeakable  they did not move their weapons nor think of them the menace of that horrible sound was not of the kind to be met with arms  as it had grown out of silence so now it died away from a culminating shout which had seemed almost in their ears it drew itself away into the distance until its failing notes joyless and mechanical to the last sank to silence at a measureless remove    the secret of macargers gulch    north westwardly from indian hill about nine miles as the crow flies is macargers gulch  it is not much of a gulcha mere depression between two wooded ridges of inconsiderable height  from its mouth up to its headfor gulches like rivers have an anatomy of their ownthe distance does not exceed two miles and the width at bottom is at only one place more than a dozen yards for most of the distance on either side of the little brook which drains it in winter and goes dry in the early spring there is no level ground at all the steep slopes of the hills covered with an almost impenetrable growth of manzanita and chemisal are parted by nothing but the width of the water course  no one but an occasional enterprising hunter of the vicinity ever goes into macargers gulch and five miles away it is unknown even by name  within that distance in any direction are far more conspicuous topographical features without names and one might try in vain to ascertain by local inquiry the origin of the name of this one  about midway between the head and the mouth of macargers gulch the hill on the right as you ascend is cloven by another gulch a short dry one and at the junction of the two is a level space of two or three acres and there a few years ago stood an old board house containing one small room  how the component parts of the house few and simple as they were had been assembled at that almost inaccessible point is a problem in the solution of which there would be greater satisfaction than advantage  possibly the creek bed is a reformed road  it is certain that the gulch was at one time pretty thoroughly prospected by miners who must have had some means of getting in with at least pack animals carrying tools and supplies their profits apparently were not such as would have justified any considerable outlay to connect macargers gulch with any center of civilization enjoying the distinction of a sawmill  the house however was there most of it  it lacked a door and a window frame and the chimney of mud and stones had fallen into an unlovely heap overgrown with rank weeds  such humble furniture as there may once have been and much of the lower weatherboarding had served as fuel in the camp fires of hunters as had also probably the curbing of an old well which at the time i write of existed in the form of a rather wide but not very deep depression near by  one afternoon in the summer of 1874 i passed up macargers gulch from the narrow valley into which it opens by following the dry bed of the brook  i was quailshooting and had made a bag of about a dozen birds by the time i had reached the house described of whose existence i was until then unaware  after rather carelessly inspecting the ruin i resumed my sport and having fairly good success prolonged it until near sunset when it occurred to me that i was a long way from any human habitationtoo far to reach one by nightfall  but in my game bag was food and the old house would afford shelter if shelter were needed on a warm and dewless night in the foothills of the sierra nevada where one may sleep in comfort on the pine needles without covering  i am fond of solitude and love the night so my resolution to camp out was soon taken and by the time that it was dark i had made my bed of boughs and grasses in a corner of the room and was roasting a quail at a fire that i had kindled on the hearth  the smoke escaped out of the ruined chimney the light illuminated the room with a kindly glow and as i ate my simple meal of plain bird and drank the remains of a bottle of red wine which had served me all the afternoon in place of the water which the region did not supply i experienced a sense of comfort which better fare and accommodations do not always give  nevertheless there was something lacking  i had a sense of comfort but not of security  i detected myself staring more frequently at the open doorway and blank window than i could find warrant for doing  outside these apertures all was black and i was unable to repress a certain feeling of apprehension as my fancy pictured the outer world and filled it with unfriendly entities natural and supernaturalchief among which in their respective classes were the grizzly bear which i knew was occasionally still seen in that region and the ghost which i had reason to think was not unfortunately our feelings do not always respect the law of probabilities and to me that evening the possible and the impossible were equally disquieting  everyone who has had experience in the matter must have observed that one confronts the actual and imaginary perils of the night with far less apprehension in the open air than in a house with an open doorway  i felt this now as i lay on my leafy couch in a corner of the room next to the chimney and permitted my fire to die out  so strong became my sense of the presence of something malign and menacing in the place that i found myself almost unable to withdraw my eyes from the opening as in the deepening darkness it became more and more indistinct  and when the last little flame flickered and went out i grasped the shotgun which i had laid at my side and actually turned the muzzle in the direction of the now invisible entrance my thumb on one of the hammers ready to cock the piece my breath suspended my muscles rigid and tense  but later i laid down the weapon with a sense of shame and mortification  what did i fear and whyi to whom the night had been      a more familiar face than that of man    i in whom that element of hereditary superstition from which none of us is altogether free had given to solitude and darkness and silence only a more alluring interest and charm  i was unable to comprehend my folly and losing in the conjecture the thing conjectured of i fell asleep  and then i dreamed  i was in a great city in a foreign landa city whose people were of my own race with minor differences of speech and costume yet precisely what these were i could not say my sense of them was indistinct  the city was dominated by a great castle upon an overlooking height whose name i knew but could not speak  i walked through many streets some broad and straight with high modern buildings some narrow gloomy and tortuous between the gables of quaint old houses whose overhanging stories elaborately ornamented with carvings in wood and stone almost met above my head  i sought someone whom i had never seen yet knew that i should recognize when found  my quest was not aimless and fortuitous it had a definite method  i turned from one street into another without hesitation and threaded a maze of intricate passages devoid of the fear of losing my way  presently i stopped before a low door in a plain stone house which might have been the dwelling of an artisan of the better sort and without announcing myself entered  the room rather sparely furnished and lighted by a single window with small diamondshaped panes had but two occupants a man and a woman  they took no notice of my intrusion a circumstance which in the manner of dreams appeared entirely natural  they were not conversing they sat apart unoccupied and sullen  the woman was young and rather stout with fine large eyes and a certain grave beauty my memory of her expression is exceedingly vivid but in dreams one does not observe the details of faces about her shoulders was a plaid shawl  the man was older dark with an evil face made more forbidding by a long scar extending from near the left temple diagonally downward into the black mustache though in my dreams it seemed rather to haunt the face as a thing aparti can express it no otherwisethan to belong to it  the moment that i found the man and woman i knew them to be husband and wife  what followed i remember indistinctly all was confused and inconsistentmade so i think by gleams of consciousness  it was as if two pictures the scene of my dream and my actual surroundings had been blended one overlying the other until the former gradually fading disappeared and i was broad awake in the deserted cabin entirely and tranquilly conscious of my situation  my foolish fear was gone and opening my eyes i saw that my fire not altogether burned out had revived by the falling of a stick and was again lighting the room  i had probably slept only a few minutes but my commonplace dream had somehow so strongly impressed me that i was no longer drowsy and after a little while i rose pushed the embers of my fire together and lighting my pipe proceeded in a rather ludicrously methodical way to meditate upon my vision  it would have puzzled me then to say in what respect it was worth attention  in the first moment of serious thought that i gave to the matter i recognized the city of my dream as edinburgh where i had never been so if the dream was a memory it was a memory of pictures and description  the recognition somehow deeply impressed me it was as if something in my mind insisted rebelliously against will and reason on the importance of all this  and that faculty whatever it was asserted also a control of my speech  surely i said aloud quite involuntarily the macgregors must have come here from edinburgh  at the moment neither the substance of this remark nor the fact of my making it surprised me in the least it seemed entirely natural that i should know the name of my dreamfolk and something of their history  but the absurdity of it all soon dawned upon me  i laughed aloud knocked the ashes from my pipe and again stretched myself upon my bed of boughs and grass where i lay staring absently into my failing fire with no further thought of either my dream or my surroundings  suddenly the single remaining flame crouched for a moment then springing upward lifted itself clear of its embers and expired in air  the darkness was absolute  at that instantalmost it seemed before the gleam of the blaze had faded from my eyesthere was a dull dead sound as of some heavy body falling upon the floor which shook beneath me as i lay  i sprang to a sitting posture and groped at my side for my gun my notion was that some wild beast had leaped in through the open window  while the flimsy structure was still shaking from the impact i heard the sound of blows the scuffling of feet upon the floor and thenit seemed to come from almost within reach of my hand the sharp shrieking of a woman in mortal agony  so horrible a cry i had never heard nor conceived it utterly unnerved me i was conscious for a moment of nothing but my own terror  fortunately my hand now found the weapon of which it was in search and the familiar touch somewhat restored me  i leaped to my feet straining my eyes to pierce the darkness  the violent sounds had ceased but more terrible than these i heard at what seemed long intervals the faint intermittent gasping of some living dying thing  as my eyes grew accustomed to the dim light of the coals in the fireplace i saw first the shapes of the door and window looking blacker than the black of the walls  next the distinction between wall and floor became discernible and at last i was sensible to the form and full expanse of the floor from end to end and side to side nothing was visible and the silence was unbroken  with a hand that shook a little the other still grasping my gun i restored my fire and made a critical examination of the place  there was nowhere any sign that the cabin had been entered  my own tracks were visible in the dust covering the floor but there were no others  i relit my pipe provided fresh fuel by ripping a thin board or two from the inside of the housei did not care to go into the darkness out of doorsand passed the rest of the night smoking and thinking and feeding my fire not for added years of life would i have permitted that little flame to expire again   some years afterward i met in sacramento a man named morgan to whom i had a note of introduction from a friend in san francisco  dining with him one evening at his home i observed various trophies upon the wall indicating that he was fond of shooting  it turned out that he was and in relating some of his feats he mentioned having been in the region of my adventure  mr morgan i asked abruptly do you know a place up there called macargers gulch  i have good reason to he replied it was i who gave to the newspapers last year the accounts of the finding of the skeleton there  i had not heard of it the accounts had been published it appeared while i was absent in the east  by the way said morgan the name of the gulch is a corruption it should have been called macgregors  my dear he added speaking to his wife mr elderson has upset his wine  that was hardly accuratei had simply dropped it glass and all  there was an old shanty once in the gulch morgan resumed when the ruin wrought by my awkwardness had been repaired but just previously to my visit it had been blown down or rather blown away for its debris was scattered all about the very floor being parted plank from plank  between two of the sleepers still in position i and my companion observed the remnant of a plaid shawl and examining it found that it was wrapped about the shoulders of the body of a woman of which but little remained besides the bones partly covered with fragments of clothing and brown dry skin  but we will spare mrs morgan he added with a smile  the lady had indeed exhibited signs of disgust rather than sympathy  it is necessary to say however he went on that the skull was fractured in several places as by blows of some blunt instrument and that instrument itselfa pickhandle still stained with blood lay under the boards near by  mr morgan turned to his wife  pardon me my dear he said with affected solemnity for mentioning these disagreeable particulars the natural though regrettable incidents of a conjugal quarrel resulting doubtless from the luckless wifes insubordination  i ought to be able to overlook it the lady replied with composure you have so many times asked me to in those very words  i thought he seemed rather glad to go on with his story  from these and other circumstances he said the coroners jury found that the deceased janet macgregor came to her death from blows inflicted by some person to the jury unknown but it was added that the evidence pointed strongly to her husband thomas macgregor as the guilty person  but thomas macgregor has never been found nor heard of  it was learned that the couple came from edinburgh but notmy dear do you not observe that mr eldersons boneplate has water in it  i had deposited a chicken bone in my finger bowl  in a little cupboard i found a photograph of macgregor but it did not lead to his capture  will you let me see it i said  the picture showed a dark man with an evil face made more forbidding by a long scar extending from near the temple diagonally downward into the black mustache  by the way mr elderson said my affable host may i know why you asked about macargers gulch  i lost a mule near there once i replied and the mischance has has quiteupset me  my dear said mr morgan with the mechanical intonation of an interpreter translating the loss of mr eldersons mule has peppered his coffee    one summer night    the fact that henry armstrong was buried did not seem to him to prove that he was dead  he had always been a hard man to convince  that he really was buried the testimony of his senses compelled him to admit  his postureflat upon his back with his hands crossed upon his stomach and tied with something that he easily broke without profitably altering the situationthe strict confinement of his entire person the black darkness and profound silence made a body of evidence impossible to controvert and he accepted it without cavil  but deadno he was only very very ill  he had withal the invalids apathy and did not greatly concern himself about the uncommon fate that had been allotted to him  no philosopher was he just a plain commonplace person gifted for the time being with a pathological indifference  the organ that he feared consequences with was torpid  so with no particular apprehension for his immediate future he fell asleep and all was peace with henry armstrong  but something was going on overhead  it was a dark summer night shot through with infrequent shimmers of lightning silently firing a cloud lying low in the west and portending a storm  these brief stammering illuminations brought out with ghastly distinctness the monuments and headstones of the cemetery and seemed to set them dancing  it was not a night in which any credible witness was likely to be straying about a cemetery so the three men who were there digging into the grave of henry armstrong felt reasonably secure  two of them were young students from a medical college a few miles away the third was a gigantic negro known as jess  for many years jess had been employed about the cemetery as a manofallwork and it was his favorite pleasantry that he knew every soul in the place from the nature of what he was now doing it was inferable that the place was not so populous as its register may have shown it to be  outside the wall at the part of the grounds farthest from the public road were a horse and a light wagon waiting  the work of excavation was not difficult  the earth with which the grave had been loosely filled a few hours before offered little resistance and was soon thrown out  removal of the casket from its box was less easy but it was taken out for it was a perquisite of jess who carefully unscrewed the cover and laid it aside exposing the body in black trousers and white shirt  at that instant the air sprang to flame a cracking shock of thunder shook the stunned world and henry armstrong tranquilly sat up  with inarticulate cries the men fled in terror each in a different direction  for nothing on earth could two of them have been persuaded to return  but jess was of another breed  in the gray of the morning the two students pallid and haggard from anxiety and with the terror of their adventure still beating tumultuously in their blood met at the medical college  you saw it cried one  god yeswhat are we to do  they went around to the rear of the building where they saw a horse attached to a light wagon hitched to a gatepost near the door of the dissectingroom  mechanically they entered the room  on a bench in the obscurity sat the negro jess  he rose grinning all eyes and teeth  im waiting for my pay he said  stretched naked on a long table lay the body of henry armstrong the head defiled with blood and clay from a blow with a spade    the moonlit road    istatement of joel hetman jr  i am the most unfortunate of men  rich respected fairly well educated and of sound healthwith many other advantages usually valued by those having them and coveted by those who have them noti sometimes think that i should be less unhappy if they had been denied me for then the contrast between my outer and my inner life would not be continually demanding a painful attention  in the stress of privation and the need of effort i might sometimes forget the somber secret ever baffling the conjecture that it compels  i am the only child of joel and julia hetman  the one was a wellto do country gentleman the other a beautiful and accomplished woman to whom he was passionately attached with what i now know to have been a jealous and exacting devotion  the family home was a few miles from nashville tennessee a large irregularly built dwelling of no particular order of architecture a little way off the road in a park of trees and shrubbery  at the time of which i write i was nineteen years old a student at yale  one day i received a telegram from my father of such urgency that in compliance with its unexplained demand i left at once for home  at the railway station in nashville a distant relative awaited me to apprise me of the reason for my recall  my mother had been barbarously murderedwhy and by whom none could conjecture but the circumstances were these  my father had gone to nashville intending to return the next afternoon  something prevented his accomplishing the business in hand so he returned on the same night arriving just before the dawn  in his testimony before the coroner he explained that having no latchkey and not caring to disturb the sleeping servants he had with no clearly defined intention gone round to the rear of the house  as he turned an angle of the building he heard a sound as of a door gently closed and saw in the darkness indistinctly the figure of a man which instantly disappeared among the trees of the lawn  a hasty pursuit and brief search of the grounds in the belief that the trespasser was some one secretly visiting a servant proving fruitless he entered at the unlocked door and mounted the stairs to my mothers chamber  its door was open and stepping into black darkness he fell headlong over some heavy object on the floor  i may spare myself the details it was my poor mother dead of strangulation by human hands  nothing had been taken from the house the servants had heard no sound and excepting those terrible fingermarks upon the dead womans throatdear god that i might forget themno trace of the assassin was ever found  i gave up my studies and remained with my father who naturally was greatly changed  always of a sedate taciturn disposition he now fell into so deep a dejection that nothing could hold his attention yet anythinga footfall the sudden closing of a dooraroused in him a fitful interest one might have called it an apprehension  at any small surprise of the senses he would start visibly and sometimes turn pale then relapse into a melancholy apathy deeper than before i suppose he was what is called a nervous wreck  as to me i was younger then than nowthere is much in that  youth is gilead in which is balm for every wound  ah that i might again dwell in that enchanted land  unacquainted with grief i knew not how to appraise my bereavement i could not rightly estimate the strength of the stroke  one night a few months after the dreadful event my father and i walked home from the city  the full moon was about three hours above the eastern horizon the entire countryside had the solemn stillness of a summer night our footfalls and the ceaseless song of the katydids were the only sound aloof  black shadows of bordering trees lay athwart the road which in the short reaches between gleamed a ghostly white  as we approached the gate to our dwelling whose front was in shadow and in which no light shone my father suddenly stopped and clutched my arm saying hardly above his breath  god  god what is that  i hear nothing i replied  but seesee he said pointing along the road directly ahead  i said  nothing is there  come father let us go inyou are ill  he had released my arm and was standing rigid and motionless in the center of the illuminated roadway staring like one bereft of sense his face in the moonlight showed a pallor and fixity inexpressibly distressing  i pulled gently at his sleeve but he had forgotten my existence  presently he began to retire backward step by step never for an instant removing his eyes from what he saw or thought he saw  i turned half round to follow but stood irresolute  i do not recall any feeling of fear unless a sudden chill was its physical manifestation  it seemed as if an icy wind had touched my face and enfolded my body from head to foot i could feel the stir of it in my hair  at that moment my attention was drawn to a light that suddenly streamed from an upper window of the house  one of the servants awakened by what mysterious premonition of evil who can say and in obedience to an impulse that she was never able to name had lit a lamp  when i turned to look for my father he was gone and in all the years that have passed no whisper of his fate has come across the borderland of conjecture from the realm of the unknown  iistatement of caspar grattan  today i am said to live tomorrow here in this room will lie a senseless shape of clay that all too long was i  if anyone lift the cloth from the face of that unpleasant thing it will be in gratification of a mere morbid curiosity  some doubtless will go further and inquire who was he  in this writing i supply the only answer that i am able to makecaspar grattan  surely that should be enough  the name has served my small need for more than twenty years of a life of unknown length  true i gave it to myself but lacking another i had the right  in this world one must have a name it prevents confusion even when it does not establish identity some though are known by numbers which also seem inadequate distinctions  one day for illustration i was passing along a street of a city far from here when i met two men in uniform one of whom half pausing and looking curiously into my face said to his companion that man looks like 767  something in the number seemed familiar and horrible  moved by an uncontrollable impulse i sprang into a side street and ran until i fell exhausted in a country lane  i have never forgotten that number and always it comes to memory attended by gibbering obscenity peals of joyless laughter the clang of iron doors  so i say a name even if selfbestowed is better than a number  in the register of the potters field i shall soon have both  what wealth  of him who shall find this paper i must beg a little consideration it is not the history of my life the knowledge to write that is denied me  this is only a record of broken and apparently unrelated memories some of them as distinct and sequent as brilliant beads upon a thread others remote and strange having the character of crimson dreams with interspaces blank and blackwitchfires glowing still and red in a great desolation  standing upon the shore of eternity i turn for a last look landward over the course by which i came  there are twenty years of footprints fairly distinct the impressions of bleeding feet  they lead through poverty and pain devious and unsure as of one staggering beneath a burden    remote unfriended melancholy slow   ah the poets prophecy of mehow admirable how dreadfully admirable  backward beyond the beginning of this via dolorosathis epic of suffering with episodes of sini see nothing clearly it comes out of a cloud  i know that it spans only twenty years yet i am an old man  one does not remember ones birthone has to be told  but with me it was different life came to me fullhanded and dowered me with all my faculties and powers  of a previous existence i know no more than others for all have stammering intimations that may be memories and may be dreams  i know only that my first consciousness was of maturity in body and minda consciousness accepted without surprise or conjecture  i merely found myself walking in a forest halfclad footsore unutterably weary and hungry  seeing a farmhouse i approached and asked for food which was given me by one who inquired my name  i did not know yet knew that all had names  greatly embarrassed i retreated and night coming on lay down in the forest and slept  the next day i entered a large town which i shall not name  nor shall i recount further incidents of the life that is now to enda life of wandering always and everywhere haunted by an overmastering sense of crime in punishment of wrong and of terror in punishment of crime  let me see if i can reduce it to narrative  i seem once to have lived near a great city a prosperous planter married to a woman whom i loved and distrusted  we had it sometimes seems one child a youth of brilliant parts and promise  he is at all times a vague figure never clearly drawn frequently altogether out of the picture  one luckless evening it occurred to me to test my wifes fidelity in a vulgar commonplace way familiar to everyone who has acquaintance with the literature of fact and fiction  i went to the city telling my wife that i should be absent until the following afternoon  but i returned before daybreak and went to the rear of the house purposing to enter by a door with which i had secretly so tampered that it would seem to lock yet not actually fasten  as i approached it i heard it gently open and close and saw a man steal away into the darkness  with murder in my heart i sprang after him but he had vanished without even the bad luck of identification  sometimes now i cannot even persuade myself that it was a human being  crazed with jealousy and rage blind and bestial with all the elemental passions of insulted manhood i entered the house and sprang up the stairs to the door of my wifes chamber  it was closed but having tampered with its lock also i easily entered and despite the black darkness soon stood by the side of her bed  my groping hands told me that although disarranged it was unoccupied  she is below i thought and terrified by my entrance has evaded me in the darkness of the hall  with the purpose of seeking her i turned to leave the room but took a wrong directionthe right one  my foot struck her cowering in a corner of the room  instantly my hands were at her throat stifling a shriek my knees were upon her struggling body and there in the darkness without a word of accusation or reproach i strangled her till she died  there ends the dream  i have related it in the past tense but the present would be the fitter form for again and again the somber tragedy reenacts itself in my consciousnessover and over i lay the plan i suffer the confirmation i redress the wrong  then all is blank and afterward the rains beat against the grimy windowpanes or the snows fall upon my scant attire the wheels rattle in the squalid streets where my life lies in poverty and mean employment if there is ever sunshine i do not recall it if there are birds they do not sing  there is another dream another vision of the night  i stand among the shadows in a moonlit road  i am aware of another presence but whose i cannot rightly determine  in the shadow of a great dwelling i catch the gleam of white garments then the figure of a woman confronts me in the roadmy murdered wife  there is death in the face there are marks upon the throat  the eyes are fixed on mine with an infinite gravity which is not reproach nor hate nor menace nor anything less terrible than recognition  before this awful apparition i retreat in terrora terror that is upon me as i write i can no longer rightly shape the words  see they   now i am calm but truly there is no more to tell  the incident ends where it beganin darkness and in doubt  yes i am again in control of myself  the captain of my soul  but that is not respite it is another stage and phase of expiation  my penance constant in degree is mutable in kind  one of its variants is tranquillity  after all it is only a lifesentence  to hell for lifethat is a foolish penalty  the culprit chooses the duration of his punishment  today my term expires  to each and all the peace that was not mine  iiistatement of the late julia hetman through the medium bayrolles  i had retired early and fallen almost immediately into a peaceful sleep from which i awoke with that indefinable sense of peril which is i think a common experience in that other earlier life  of its unmeaning character too i was entirely persuaded yet that did not banish it  my husband joel hetman was away from home the servants slept in another part of the house  but these were familiar conditions they had never before distressed me  nevertheless the strange terror grew so insupportable that conquering my reluctance to move i sat up and lit the lamp at my bedside  contrary to my expectation this gave me no relief the light seemed rather an added danger for i reflected that it would shine out under the door disclosing my presence to whatever evil thing might lurk outside you that are still in the flesh subject to horrors of the imagination think what a monstrous fear that must be which seeks in darkness security from malevolent existences of the night  that is to spring to close quarters with an unseen enemythe strategy of despair  extinguishing the lamp i pulled the bedclothing about my head and lay trembling and silent unable to shriek forgetful to pray  in this pitiable state i must have lain for what you call hourswith us there are no hours there is no time  at last it camea soft irregular sound of footfalls on the stairs they were slow hesitant uncertain as of something that did not see its way to my disordered reason all the more terrifying for that as the approach of some blind and mindless malevolence to which is no appeal  i even thought that i must have left the hall lamp burning and the groping of this creature proved it a monster of the night this was foolish and inconsistent with my previous dread of the light but what would you have  fear has no brains it is an idiot the dismal witness that it bears and the cowardly counsel that it whispers are unrelated  we know this well we who have passed into the realm of terror who skulk in eternal dusk among the scenes of our former lives invisible even to ourselves and one another yet hiding forlorn in lonely places yearning for speech with our loved ones yet dumb and as fearful of them as they of us  sometimes the disability is removed the law suspended  by the deathless power of love or hate we break the spellwe are seen by those whom we would warn console or punish  what form we seem to them to bear we know not we know only that we terrify even those whom we most wish to comfort and from whom we most crave tenderness and sympathy  forgive i pray you this inconsequent digression by what was once a woman  you who consult us in this imperfect wayyou do not understand  you ask foolish questions about things unknown and things forbidden  much that we know and could impart in our speech is meaningless in yours  we must communicate with you through a stammering intelligence in that small fraction of our language that you yourselves can speak  you think that we are of another world no we have knowledge of no world but yours though for us it holds no sunlight no warmth no music no laughter no song of birds nor any companionship  o god what a thing it is to be a ghost cowering and shivering in an altered world a prey to apprehension and despair  no i did not die of fright  the thing turned and went away  i heard it go down the stairs hurriedly i thought as if itself in sudden fear  then i rose to call for help  hardly had my shaking hand found the doorknob whenmerciful heaveni heard it returning its footfalls as it remounted the stairs were rapid heavy and loud they shook the house  i fled to an angle of the wall and crouched upon the floor  i tried to pray  i tried to call the name of my dear husband  then i heard the door thrown open  there was an interval of unconsciousness and when i revived i felt a strangling clutch upon my throatfelt my arms feebly beating against something that bore me backwardfelt my tongue thrusting itself from between my teeth  and then i passed into this life  no i have no knowledge of what it was  the sum of what we knew at death is the measure of what we know afterward of all that went before  of this existence we know many things but no new light falls upon any page of that in memory is written all of it that we can read  here are no heights of truth overlooking the confused landscape of that dubitable domain  we still dwell in the valley of the shadow lurk in its desolate places peering from brambles and thickets at its mad malign inhabitants  how should we have new knowledge of that fading past  what i am about to relate happened on a night  we know when it is night for then you retire to your houses and we can venture from our places of concealment to move unafraid about our old homes to look in at the windows even to enter and gaze upon your faces as you sleep  i had lingered long near the dwelling where i had been so cruelly changed to what i am as we do while any that we love or hate remain  vainly i had sought some method of manifestation some way to make my continued existence and my great love and poignant pity understood by my husband and son  always if they slept they would wake or if in my desperation i dared approach them when they were awake would turn toward me the terrible eyes of the living frightening me by the glances that i sought from the purpose that i held  on this night i had searched for them without success fearing to find them they were nowhere in the house nor about the moonlit lawn  for although the sun is lost to us forever the moon full orbed or slender remains to us  sometimes it shines by night sometimes by day but always it rises and sets as in that other life  i left the lawn and moved in the white light and silence along the road aimless and sorrowing  suddenly i heard the voice of my poor husband in exclamations of astonishment with that of my son in reassurance and dissuasion and there by the shadow of a group of trees they stoodnear so near  their faces were toward me the eyes of the elder man fixed upon mine  he saw meat last at last he saw me  in the consciousness of that my terror fled as a cruel dream  the deathspell was broken  love had conquered law  mad with exultation i shoutedi must have shouted he sees he sees he will understand  then controlling myself i moved forward smiling and consciously beautiful to offer myself to his arms to comfort him with endearments and with my sons hand in mine to speak words that should restore the broken bonds between the living and the dead  alas alas his face went white with fear his eyes were as those of a hunted animal  he backed away from me as i advanced and at last turned and fled into the woodwhither it is not given to me to know  to my poor boy left doubly desolate i have never been able to impart a sense of my presence  soon he too must pass to this life invisible and be lost to me forever    a diagnosis of death    i am not so superstitious as some of your physiciansmen of science as you are pleased to be called said hawver replying to an accusation that had not been made  some of youonly a few i confessbelieve in the immortality of the soul and in apparitions which you have not the honesty to call ghosts  i go no further than a conviction that the living are sometimes seen where they are not but have beenwhere they have lived so long perhaps so intensely as to have left their impress on everything about them  i know indeed that ones environment may be so affected by ones personality as to yield long afterward an image of ones self to the eyes of another  doubtless the impressing personality has to be the right kind of personality as the perceiving eyes have to be the right kind of eyesmine for example  yes the right kind of eyes conveying sensations to the wrong kind of brain said dr frayley smiling  thank you one likes to have an expectation gratified that is about the reply that i supposed you would have the civility to make  pardon me  but you say that you know  that is a good deal to say dont you think  perhaps you will not mind the trouble of saying how you learned  you will call it an hallucination hawver said but that does not matter  and he told the story  last summer i went as you know to pass the hot weather term in the town of meridian  the relative at whose house i had intended to stay was ill so i sought other quarters  after some difficulty i succeeded in renting a vacant dwelling that had been occupied by an eccentric doctor of the name of mannering who had gone away years before no one knew where not even his agent  he had built the house himself and had lived in it with an old servant for about ten years  his practice never very extensive had after a few years been given up entirely  not only so but he had withdrawn himself almost altogether from social life and become a recluse  i was told by the village doctor about the only person with whom he held any relations that during his retirement he had devoted himself to a single line of study the result of which he had expounded in a book that did not commend itself to the approval of his professional brethren who indeed considered him not entirely sane  i have not seen the book and cannot now recall the title of it but i am told that it expounded a rather startling theory  he held that it was possible in the case of many a person in good health to forecast his death with precision several months in advance of the event  the limit i think was eighteen months  there were local tales of his having exerted his powers of prognosis or perhaps you would say diagnosis and it was said that in every instance the person whose friends he had warned had died suddenly at the appointed time and from no assignable cause  all this however has nothing to do with what i have to tell i thought it might amuse a physician  the house was furnished just as he had lived in it  it was a rather gloomy dwelling for one who was neither a recluse nor a student and i think it gave something of its character to me perhaps some of its former occupants character for always i felt in it a certain melancholy that was not in my natural disposition nor i think due to loneliness  i had no servants that slept in the house but i have always been as you know rather fond of my own society being much addicted to reading though little to study whatever was the cause the effect was dejection and a sense of impending evil this was especially so in dr mannerings study although that room was the lightest and most airy in the house  the doctors lifesize portrait in oil hung in that room and seemed completely to dominate it  there was nothing unusual in the picture the man was evidently rather good looking about fifty years old with irongray hair a smoothshaven face and dark serious eyes something in the picture always drew and held my attention  the mans appearance became familiar to me and rather haunted me  one evening i was passing through this room to my bedroom with a lampthere is no gas in meridian  i stopped as usual before the portrait which seemed in the lamplight to have a new expression not easily named but distinctly uncanny  it interested but did not disturb me  i moved the lamp from one side to the other and observed the effects of the altered light  while so engaged i felt an impulse to turn round  as i did so i saw a man moving across the room directly toward me  as soon as he came near enough for the lamplight to illuminate the face i saw that it was dr mannering himself it was as if the portrait were walking  i beg your pardon i said somewhat coldly but if you knocked i did not hear  he passed me within an arms length lifted his right forefinger as in warning and without a word went on out of the room though i observed his exit no more than i had observed his entrance  of course i need not tell you that this was what you will call an hallucination and i call an apparition  that room had only two doors of which one was locked the other led into a bedroom from which there was no exit  my feeling on realizing this is not an important part of the incident  doubtless this seems to you a very commonplace ghost storyone constructed on the regular lines laid down by the old masters of the art  if that were so i should not have related it even if it were true  the man was not dead i met him today in union street  he passed me in a crowd  hawver had finished his story and both men were silent  dr frayley absently drummed on the table with his fingers  did he say anything today he askedanything from which you inferred that he was not dead  hawver stared and did not reply  perhaps continued frayley he made a sign a gesturelifted a finger as in warning  its a trick he hada habit when saying something seriousannouncing the result of a diagnosis for example  yes he didjust as his apparition had done  but good god did you ever know him  hawver was apparently growing nervous  i knew him  i have read his book as will every physician some day it is one of the most striking and important of the centurys contributions to medical science  yes i knew him i attended him in an illness three years ago  he died  hawver sprang from his chair manifestly disturbed  he strode forward and back across the room then approached his friend and in a voice not altogether steady said  doctor have you anything to say to meas a physician  no hawver you are the healthiest man i ever knew  as a friend i advise you to go to your room  you play the violin like an angel play it play something light and lively  get this cursed bad business off your mind  the next day hawver was found dead in his room the violin at his neck the bow upon the strings his music open before him at chopins funeral march    moxons master    are you seriousdo you really believe that a machine thinks  i got no immediate reply moxon was apparently intent upon the coals in the grate touching them deftly here and there with the firepoker till they signified a sense of his attention by a brighter glow  for several weeks i had been observing in him a growing habit of delay in answering even the most trivial of commonplace questions  his air however was that of preoccupation rather than deliberation  one might have said that he had something on his mind  presently he said  what is a machine  the word has been variously defined  here is one definition from a popular dictionary  any instrument or organization by which power is applied and made effective or a desired effect produced  well then is not a man a machine  and you will admit that he thinksor thinks he thinks  if you do not wish to answer my question i said rather testily why not say soall that you say is mere evasion  you know well enough that when i say machine i do not mean a man but something that man has made and controls  when it does not control him he said rising abruptly and looking out of a window whence nothing was visible in the blackness of a stormy night  a moment later he turned about and with a smile said i beg your pardon i had no thought of evasion  i considered the dictionary mans unconscious testimony suggestive and worth something in the discussion  i can give your question a direct answer easily enough  i do believe that a machine thinks about the work that it is doing  that was direct enough certainly  it was not altogether pleasing for it tended to confirm a sad suspicion that moxons devotion to study and work in his machineshop had not been good for him  i knew for one thing that he suffered from insomnia and that is no light affliction  had it affected his mind  his reply to my question seemed to me then evidence that it had perhaps i should think differently about it now  i was younger then and among the blessings that are not denied to youth is ignorance  incited by that great stimulant to controversy i said  and what pray does it think within the absence of a brain  the reply coming with less than his customary delay took his favorite form of counterinterrogation  with what does a plant thinkin the absence of a brain  ah plants also belong to the philosopher class  i should be pleased to know some of their conclusions you may omit the premises  perhaps he replied apparently unaffected by my foolish irony you may be able to infer their convictions from their acts  i will spare you the familiar examples of the sensitive mimosa the several insectivorous flowers and those whose stamens bend down and shake their pollen upon the entering bee in order that he may fertilize their distant mates  but observe this  in an open spot in my garden i planted a climbing vine  when it was barely above the surface i set a stake into the soil a yard away  the vine at once made for it but as it was about to reach it after several days i removed it a few feet  the vine at once altered its course making an acute angle and again made for the stake  this manoeuvre was repeated several times but finally as if discouraged the vine abandoned the pursuit and ignoring further attempts to divert it traveled to a small tree further away which it climbed  roots of the eucalyptus will prolong themselves incredibly in search of moisture  a wellknown horticulturist relates that one entered an old drain pipe and followed it until it came to a break where a section of the pipe had been removed to make way for a stone wall that had been built across its course  the root left the drain and followed the wall until it found an opening where a stone had fallen out  it crept through and following the other side of the wall back to the drain entered the unexplored part and resumed its journey  and all this  can you miss the significance of it  it shows the consciousness of plants  it proves that they think  even if it didwhat then  we were speaking not of plants but of machines  they may be composed partly of woodwood that has no longer vitalityor wholly of metal  is thought an attribute also of the mineral kingdom  how else do you explain the phenomena for example of crystallization  i do not explain them  because you cannot without affirming what you wish to deny namely intelligent cooperation among the constituent elements of the crystals  when soldiers form lines or hollow squares you call it reason  when wild geese in flight take the form of a letter v you say instinct  when the homogeneous atoms of a mineral moving freely in solution arrange themselves into shapes mathematically perfect or particles of frozen moisture into the symmetrical and beautiful forms of snowflakes you have nothing to say  you have not even invented a name to conceal your heroic unreason  moxon was speaking with unusual animation and earnestness  as he paused i heard in an adjoining room known to me as his machine shop which no one but himself was permitted to enter a singular thumping sound as of some one pounding upon a table with an open hand  moxon heard it at the same moment and visibly agitated rose and hurriedly passed into the room whence it came  i thought it odd that any one else should be in there and my interest in my friend with doubtless a touch of unwarrantable curiosityled me to listen intently though i am happy to say not at the keyhole  there were confused sounds as of a struggle or scuffle the floor shook  i distinctly heard hard breathing and a hoarse whisper which said damn you  then all was silent and presently moxon reappeared and said with a rather sorry smile  pardon me for leaving you so abruptly  i have a machine in there that lost its temper and cut up rough  fixing my eyes steadily upon his left cheek which was traversed by four parallel excoriations showing blood i said  how would it do to trim its nails  i could have spared myself the jest he gave it no attention but seated himself in the chair that he had left and resumed the interrupted monologue as if nothing had occurred  doubtless you do not hold with those i need not name them to a man of your reading who have taught that all matter is sentient that every atom is a living feeling conscious being  i do  there is no such thing as dead inert matter  it is all alive all instinct with force actual and potential all sensitive to the same forces in its environment and susceptible to the contagion of higher and subtler ones residing in such superior organisms as it may be brought into relation with as those of man when he is fashioning it into an instrument of his will  it absorbs something of his intelligence and purposemore of them in proportion to the complexity of the resulting machine and that of its work  do you happen to recall herbert spencers definition of life  i read it thirty years ago  he may have altered it afterward for anything i know but in all that time i have been unable to think of a single word that could profitably be changed or added or removed it seems to me not only the best definition but the only possible one  life he says is a definite combination of heterogeneous changes both simultaneous and successive in correspondence with external coexistences and sequences  that defines the phenomenon i said but gives no hint of its cause  that he replied is all that any definition can do  as mill points out we know nothing of cause except as an antecedentnothing of effect except as a consequent  of certain phenomena one never occurs without another which is dissimilar  the first in point of time we call cause the second effect  one who had many times seen a rabbit pursued by a dog and had never seen rabbits and dogs otherwise would think the rabbit the cause of the dog  but i fear he added laughing naturally enough that my rabbit is leading me a long way from the track of my legitimate quarry  im indulging in the pleasure of the chase for its own sake  what i want you to observe is that in herbert spencers definition of life the activity of a machine is includedthere is nothing in the definition that is not applicable to it  according to this sharpest of observers and deepest of thinkers if a man during his period of activity is alive so is a machine when in operation  as an inventor and constructor of machines i know that to be true  moxon was silent for a long time gazing absently into the fire  it was growing late and i thought it time to be going but somehow i did not like the notion of leaving him in that isolated house all alone except for the presence of some person of whose nature my conjectures could go no further than that it was unfriendly perhaps malign leaning toward him and looking earnestly into his eyes while making a motion with my hand through the door of his workshop i said  moxon whom have you in there  somewhat to my surprise he laughed lightly and answered without hesitation  nobody the incident that you have in mind was caused by my folly in leaving a machine in action with nothing to act upon while i undertook the interminable task of enlightening your understanding do you happen to know that consciousness is the creature of rhythm  o bother them both i replied rising and laying hold of my overcoat  im going to wish you good night and ill add the hope that the machine which you inadvertently left in action will have her gloves on the next time you think it needful to stop her  without waiting to observe the effect of my shot i left the house  rain was falling and the darkness was intense  in the sky beyond the crest of a hill toward which i groped my way along precarious plank sidewalks and across miry unpaved streets i could see the faint glow of the citys lights but behind me nothing was visible but a single window of moxons house  it glowed with what seemed to me a mysterious and fateful meaning  i knew it was an uncurtained aperture in my friends machineshop and i had little doubt that he had resumed the studies interrupted by his duties as my instructor in mechanical consciousness and the fatherhood of rhythm  odd and in some degree humorous as his convictions seemed to me at that time i could not wholly divest myself of the feeling that they had some tragic relation to his life and characterperhaps to his destinyalthough i no longer entertained the notion that they were the vagaries of a disordered mind  whatever might be thought of his views his exposition of them was too logical for that  over and over his last words came back to me  consciousness is the creature of rhythm  bald and terse as the statement was i now found it infinitely alluring  at each recurrence it broadened in meaning and deepened in suggestion  why here i thought is something upon which to found a philosophy  if consciousness is the product of rhythm all things are conscious for all have motion and all motion is rhythmic  i wondered if moxon knew the significance and breadth of his thoughtthe scope of this momentous generalization or had he arrived at his philosophic faith by the tortuous and uncertain road of observation  that faith was then new to me and all moxons expounding had failed to make me a convert but now it seemed as if a great light shone about me like that which fell upon saul of tarsus and out there in the storm and darkness and solitude i experienced what lewes calls the endless variety and excitement of philosophic thought  i exulted in a new sense of knowledge a new pride of reason  my feet seemed hardly to touch the earth it was as if i were uplifted and borne through the air by invisible wings  yielding to an impulse to seek further light from him whom i now recognized as my master and guide i had unconsciously turned about and almost before i was aware of having done so found myself again at moxons door  i was drenched with rain but felt no discomfort unable in my excitement to find the doorbell i instinctively tried the knob  it turned and entering i mounted the stairs to the room that i had so recently left  all was dark and silent moxon as i had supposed was in the adjoining roomthe machineshop  groping along the wall until i found the communicating door i knocked loudly several times but got no response which i attributed to the uproar outside for the wind was blowing a gale and dashing the rain against the thin walls in sheets  the drumming upon the shingle roof spanning the unceiled room was loud and incessant  i had never been invited into the machineshophad indeed been denied admittance as had all others with one exception a skilled metal worker of whom no one knew anything except that his name was haley and his habit silence  but in my spiritual exaltation discretion and civility were alike forgotten and i opened the door what i saw took all philosophical speculation out of me in short order  moxon sat facing me at the farther side of a small table upon which a single candle made all the light that was in the room  opposite him his back toward me sat another person  on the table between the two was a chessboard the men were playing  i knew little of chess but as only a few pieces were on the board it was obvious that the game was near its close  moxon was intensely interestednot so much it seemed to me in the game as in his antagonist upon whom he had fixed so intent a look that standing though i did directly in the line of his vision i was altogether unobserved  his face was ghastly white and his eyes glittered like diamonds  of his antagonist i had only a back view but that was sufficient i should not have cared to see his face  he was apparently not more than five feet in height with proportions suggesting those of a gorillaa tremendous breadth of shoulders thick short neck and broad squat head which had a tangled growth of black hair and was topped with a crimson fez  a tunic of the same color belted tightly to the waist reached the seatapparently a boxupon which he sat his legs and feet were not seen  his left forearm appeared to rest in his lap he moved his pieces with his right hand which seemed disproportionately long  i had shrunk back and now stood a little to one side of the doorway and in shadow  if moxon had looked farther than the face of his opponent he could have observed nothing now except that the door was open  something forbade me either to enter or to retire a feeling i know not how it camethat i was in the presence of an imminent tragedy and might serve my friend by remaining  with a scarcely conscious rebellion against the indelicacy of the act i remained  the play was rapid  moxon hardly glanced at the board before making his moves and to my unskilled eye seemed to move the piece most convenient to his hand his motions in doing so being quick nervous and lacking in precision  the response of his antagonist while equally prompt in the inception was made with a slow uniform mechanical and i thought somewhat theatrical movement of the arm that was a sore trial to my patience  there was something unearthly about it all and i caught myself shuddering  but i was wet and cold  two or three times after moving a piece the stranger slightly inclined his head and each time i observed that moxon shifted his king  all at once the thought came to me that the man was dumb  and then that he was a machinean automaton chessplayer  then i remembered that moxon had once spoken to me of having invented such a piece of mechanism though i did not understand that it had actually been constructed  was all his talk about the consciousness and intelligence of machines merely a prelude to eventual exhibition of this deviceonly a trick to intensify the effect of its mechanical action upon me in my ignorance of its secret  a fine end this of all my intellectual transportsmy endless variety and excitement of philosophic thought  i was about to retire in disgust when something occurred to hold my curiosity  i observed a shrug of the things great shoulders as if it were irritated  and so natural was thisso entirely humanthat in my new view of the matter it startled me  nor was that all for a moment later it struck the table sharply with its clenched hand  at that gesture moxon seemed even more startled than i  he pushed his chair a little backward as in alarm  presently moxon whose play it was raised his hand high above the board pounced upon one of his pieces like a sparrowhawk and with the exclamation checkmate rose quickly to his feet and stepped behind his chair  the automaton sat motionless  the wind had now gone down but i heard at lessening intervals and progressively louder the rumble and roll of thunder  in the pauses between i now became conscious of a low humming or buzzing which like the thunder grew momentarily louder and more distinct  it seemed to come from the body of the automaton and was unmistakably a whirring of wheels  it gave me the impression of a disordered mechanism which had escaped the repressive and regulating action of some controlling partan effect such as might be expected if a pawl should be jostled from the teeth of a ratchetwheel  but before i had time for much conjecture as to its nature my attention was taken by the strange motions of the automaton itself  a slight but continuous convulsion appeared to have possession of it  in body and head it shook like a man with palsy or an ague chill and the motion augmented every moment until the entire figure was in violent agitation  suddenly it sprang to its feet and with a movement almost too quick for the eye to follow shot forward across table and chair with both arms thrust forth to their full lengththe posture and lunge of a diver  moxon tried to throw himself backward out of reach but he was too late  i saw the horrible things hands close upon his throat his own clutch its wrists  then the table was overturned the candle thrown to the floor and extinguished and all was black dark  but the noise of the struggle was dreadfully distinct and most terrible of all were the raucous squawking sounds made by the strangled mans efforts to breathe  guided by the infernal hubbub i sprang to the rescue of my friend but had hardly taken a stride in the darkness when the whole room blazed with a blinding white light that burned into my brain and heart and memory a vivid picture of the combatants on the floor moxon underneath his throat still in the clutch of those iron hands his head forced backward his eyes protruding his mouth wide open and his tongue thrust out andhorrible contrastupon the painted face of his assassin an expression of tranquil and profound thought as in the solution of a problem in chess  this i observed then all was blackness and silence  three days later i recovered consciousness in a hospital  as the memory of that tragic night slowly evolved in my ailing brain recognized in my attendant moxons confidential workman haley responding to a look he approached smiling  tell me about it i managed to say faintlyall about it  certainly he said you were carried unconscious from a burning housemoxons  nobody knows how you came to be there  you may have to do a little explaining  the origin of the fire is a bit mysterious too  my own notion is that the house was struck by lightning  and moxon  buried yesterdaywhat was left of him  apparently this reticent person could unfold himself on occasion when imparting shocking intelligence to the sick he was affable enough  after some moments of the keenest mental suffering i ventured to ask another question  who rescued me  well if that interests youi did  thank you mr haley and may god bless you for it  did you rescue also that charming product of your skill the automaton chessplayer that murdered its inventor  the man was silent a long time looking away from me  presently he turned and gravely said  do you know that  i do i replied i saw it done  that was many years ago  if asked today i should answer less confidently    a tough tussle    one night in the autumn of 1861 a man sat alone in the heart of a forest in western virginia  the region was one of the wildest on the continentthe cheat mountain country  there was no lack of people close at hand however within a mile of where the man sat was the now silent camp of a whole federal brigade  somewhere aboutit might be still nearerwas a force of the enemy the numbers unknown it was this uncertainty as to its numbers and position that accounted for the mans presence in that lonely spot he was a young officer of a federal infantry regiment and his business there was to guard his sleeping comrades in the camp against a surprise  he was in command of a detachment of men constituting a picketguard  these men he had stationed just at nightfall in an irregular line determined by the nature of the ground several hundred yards in front of where he now sat  the line ran through the forest among the rocks and laurel thickets the men fifteen or twenty paces apart all in concealment and under injunction of strict silence and unremitting vigilance  in four hours if nothing occurred they would be relieved by a fresh detachment from the reserve now resting in care of its captain some distance away to the left and rear  before stationing his men the young officer of whom we are writing had pointed out to his two sergeants the spot at which he would be found if it should be necessary to consult him or if his presence at the front line should be required  it was a quiet enough spotthe fork of an old woodroad on the two branches of which prolonging themselves deviously forward in the dim moonlight the sergeants were themselves stationed a few paces in rear of the line  if driven sharply back by a sudden onset of the enemyand pickets are not expected to make a stand after firingthe men would come into the converging roads and naturally following them to their point of intersection could be rallied and formed  in his small way the author of these dispositions was something of a strategist if napoleon had planned as intelligently at waterloo he would have won that memorable battle and been overthrown later  secondlieutenant brainerd byring was a brave and efficient officer young and comparatively inexperienced as he was in the business of killing his fellowmen  he had enlisted in the very first days of the war as a private with no military knowledge whatever had been made firstsergeant of his company on account of his education and engaging manner and had been lucky enough to lose his captain by a confederate bullet in the resulting promotions he had gained a commission  he had been in several engagements such as they were at philippi rich mountain carricks ford and greenbrierand had borne himself with such gallantry as not to attract the attention of his superior officers  the exhilaration of battle was agreeable to him but the sight of the dead with their clay faces blank eyes and stiff bodies which when not unnaturally shrunken were unnaturally swollen had always intolerably affected him  he felt toward them a kind of reasonless antipathy that was something more than the physical and spiritual repugnance common to us all  doubtless this feeling was due to his unusually acute sensibilitieshis keen sense of the beautiful which these hideous things outraged  whatever may have been the cause he could not look upon a dead body without a loathing which had in it an element of resentment  what others have respected as the dignity of death had to him no existencewas altogether unthinkable  death was a thing to be hated  it was not picturesque it had no tender and solemn sidea dismal thing hideous in all its manifestations and suggestions  lieutenant byring was a braver man than anybody knew for nobody knew his horror of that which he was ever ready to incur  having posted his men instructed his sergeants and retired to his station he seated himself on a log and with senses all alert began his vigil  for greater ease he loosened his swordbelt and taking his heavy revolver from his holster laid it on the log beside him he felt very comfortable though he hardly gave the fact a thought so intently did he listen for any sound from the front which might have a menacing significancea shout a shot or the footfall of one of his sergeants coming to apprise him of something worth knowing from the vast invisible ocean of moonlight overhead fell here and there a slender broken stream that seemed to plash against the intercepting branches and trickle to earth forming small white pools among the clumps of laurel  but these leaks were few and served only to accentuate the blackness of his environment which his imagination found it easy to people with all manner of unfamiliar shapes menacing uncanny or merely grotesque  he to whom the portentous conspiracy of night and solitude and silence in the heart of a great forest is not an unknown experience needs not to be told what another world it all ishow even the most commonplace and familiar objects take on another character  the trees group themselves differently they draw closer together as if in fear  the very silence has another quality than the silence of the day  and it is full of halfheard whisperswhispers that startleghosts of sounds long dead  there are living sounds too such as are never heard under other conditions  notes of strange nightbirds the cries of small animals in sudden encounters with stealthy foes or in their dreams a rustling in the dead leavesit may be the leap of a woodrat it may be the footfall of a panther what caused the breaking of that twigwhat the low alarmed twittering in that bushful of birds  there are sounds without a name forms without substance translations in space of objects which have not been seen to move movements wherein nothing is observed to change its place  ah children of the sunlight and the gaslight how little you know of the world in which you live  surrounded at a little distance by armed and watchful friends byring felt utterly alone  yielding himself to the solemn and mysterious spirit of the time and place he had forgotten the nature of his connection with the visible and audible aspects and phases of the night  the forest was boundless men and the habitations of men did not exist  the universe was one primeval mystery of darkness without form and void himself the sole dumb questioner of its eternal secret  absorbed in thoughts born of this mood he suffered the time to slip away unnoted  meantime the infrequent patches of white light lying amongst the treetrunks had undergone changes of size form and place  in one of them near by just at the roadside his eye fell upon an object that he had not previously observed  it was almost before his face as he sat he could have sworn that it had not before been there  it was partly covered in shadow but he could see that it was a human figure  instinctively he adjusted the clasp of his swordbelt and laid hold of his pistolagain he was in a world of war by occupation an assassin  the figure did not move  rising pistol in hand he approached  the figure lay upon its back its upper part in shadow but standing above it and looking down upon the face he saw that it was a dead body  he shuddered and turned from it with a feeling of sickness and disgust resumed his seat upon the log and forgetting military prudence struck a match and lit a cigar  in the sudden blackness that followed the extinction of the flame he felt a sense of relief he could no longer see the object of his aversion  nevertheless he kept his eyes set in that direction until it appeared again with growing distinctness  it seemed to have moved a trifle nearer  damn the thing he muttered  what does it want  it did not appear to be in need of anything but a soul  byring turned away his eyes and began humming a tune but he broke off in the middle of a bar and looked at the dead body  its presence annoyed him though he could hardly have had a quieter neighbor  he was conscious too of a vague indefinable feeling that was new to him  it was not fear but rather a sense of the supernaturalin which he did not at all believe  i have inherited it he said to himself  i suppose it will require a thousand agesperhaps ten thousandfor humanity to outgrow this feeling  where and when did it originate  away back probably in what is called the cradle of the human racethe plains of central asia  what we inherit as a superstition our barbarous ancestors must have held as a reasonable conviction  doubtless they believed themselves justified by facts whose nature we cannot even conjecture in thinking a dead body a malign thing endowed with some strange power of mischief with perhaps a will and a purpose to exert it  possibly they had some awful form of religion of which that was one of the chief doctrines sedulously taught by their priesthood as ours teach the immortality of the soul  as the aryans moved slowly on to and through the caucasus passes and spread over europe new conditions of life must have resulted in the formulation of new religions  the old belief in the malevolence of the dead body was lost from the creeds and even perished from tradition but it left its heritage of terror which is transmitted from generation to generationis as much a part of us as are our blood and bones  in following out his thought he had forgotten that which suggested it but now his eye fell again upon the corpse  the shadow had now altogether uncovered it  he saw the sharp profile the chin in the air the whole face ghastly white in the moonlight  the clothing was gray the uniform of a confederate soldier  the coat and waistcoat unbuttoned had fallen away on each side exposing the white shirt  the chest seemed unnaturally prominent but the abdomen had sunk in leaving a sharp projection at the line of the lower ribs  the arms were extended the left knee was thrust upward  the whole posture impressed byring as having been studied with a view to the horrible  bah he exclaimed he was an actorhe knows how to be dead  he drew away his eyes directing them resolutely along one of the roads leading to the front and resumed his philosophizing where he had left off  it may be that our central asian ancestors had not the custom of burial  in that case it is easy to understand their fear of the dead who really were a menace and an evil  they bred pestilences children were taught to avoid the places where they lay and to run away if by inadvertence they came near a corpse  i think indeed id better go away from this chap  he half rose to do so then remembered that he had told his men in front and the officer in the rear who was to relieve him that he could at any time be found at that spot  it was a matter of pride too  if he abandoned his post he feared they would think he feared the corpse  he was no coward and he was unwilling to incur anybodys ridicule  so he again seated himself and to prove his courage looked boldly at the body  the right armthe one farthest from him was now in shadow  he could barely see the hand which he had before observed lay at the root of a clump of laurel  there had been no change a fact which gave him a certain comfort he could not have said why  he did not at once remove his eyes that which we do not wish to see has a strange fascination sometimes irresistible of the woman who covers her eyes with her hands and looks between the fingers let it be said that the wits have dealt with her not altogether justly  byring suddenly became conscious of a pain in his right hand  he withdrew his eyes from his enemy and looked at it  he was grasping the hilt of his drawn sword so tightly that it hurt him  he observed too that he was leaning forward in a strained attitude crouching like a gladiator ready to spring at the throat of an antagonist  his teeth were clenched and he was breathing hard  this matter was soon set right and as his muscles relaxed and he drew a long breath he felt keenly enough the ludicrousness of the incident it affected him to laughter  heavens what sound was that what mindless devil was uttering an unholy glee in mockery of human merriment  he sprang to his feet and looked about him not recognizing his own laugh  he could no longer conceal from himself the horrible fact of his cowardice he was thoroughly frightened  he would have run from the spot but his legs refused their office they gave way beneath him and he sat again upon the log violently trembling  his face was wet his whole body bathed in a chill perspiration  he could not even cry out  distinctly he heard behind him a stealthy tread as of some wild animal and dared not look over his shoulder  had the soulless living joined forces with the soulless deadwas it an animal  ah if he could but be assured of that  but by no effort of will could he now unfix his gaze from the face of the dead man  i repeat that lieutenant byring was a brave and intelligent man  but what would you have  shall a man cope singlehanded with so monstrous an alliance as that of night and solitude and silence and the deadwhile an incalculable host of his own ancestors shriek into the ear of his spirit their coward counsel sing their doleful deathsongs in his heart and disarm his very blood of all its iron the odds are too greatcourage was not made for so rough use as that  one sole conviction now had the man in possession  that the body had moved  it lay nearer to the edge of its plot of lightthere could be no doubt of it  it had also moved its arms for look they are both in the shadow  a breath of cold air struck byring full in the face the boughs of trees above him stirred and moaned  a strongly defined shadow passed across the face of the dead left it luminous passed back upon it and left it half obscured  the horrible thing was visibly moving  at that moment a single shot rang out upon the picketlinea lonelier and louder though more distant shot than ever had been heard by mortal ear  it broke the spell of that enchanted man it slew the silence and the solitude dispersed the hindering host from central asia and released his modern manhood with a cry like that of some great bird pouncing upon its prey he sprang forward hothearted for action  shot after shot now came from the front  there were shoutings and confusion hoofbeats and desultory cheers  away to the rear in the sleeping camp were a singing of bugles and grumble of drums pushing through the thickets on either side the roads came the federal pickets in full retreat firing backward at random as they ran  a straggling group that had followed back one of the roads as instructed suddenly sprang away into the bushes as half a hundred horsemen thundered by them striking wildly with their sabres as they passed  at headlong speed these mounted madmen shot past the spot where byring had sat and vanished round an angle of the road shouting and firing their pistols  a moment later there was a roar of musketry followed by dropping shotsthey had encountered the reserveguard in line and back they came in dire confusion with here and there an empty saddle and many a maddened horse bullet stung snorting and plunging with pain  it was all overan affair of outposts  the line was reestablished with fresh men the roll called the stragglers were reformed  the federal commander with a part of his staff imperfectly clad appeared upon the scene asked a few questions looked exceedingly wise and retired  after standing at arms for an hour the brigade in camp swore a prayer or two and went to bed  early the next morning a fatigueparty commanded by a captain and accompanied by a surgeon searched the ground for dead and wounded at the fork of the road a little to one side they found two bodies lying close togetherthat of a federal officer and that of a confederate private  the officer had died of a swordthrust through the heart but not apparently until he had inflicted upon his enemy no fewer than five dreadful wounds  the dead officer lay on his face in a pool of blood the weapon still in his breast  they turned him on his back and the surgeon removed it  gad said the captainit is byringadding with a glance at the other they had a tough tussle  the surgeon was examining the sword  it was that of a line officer of federal infantryexactly like the one worn by the captain  it was in fact byrings own  the only other weapon discovered was an undischarged revolver in the dead officers belt  the surgeon laid down the sword and approached the other body  it was frightfully gashed and stabbed but there was no blood  he took hold of the left foot and tried to straighten the leg  in the effort the body was displaced  the dead do not wish to be movedit protested with a faint sickening odor  where it had lain were a few maggots manifesting an imbecile activity  the surgeon looked at the captain  the captain looked at the surgeon    one of twins a letter found among the papers of the late mortimer barr    you ask me if in my experience as one of a pair of twins i ever observed anything unaccountable by the natural laws with which we have acquaintance  as to that you shall judge perhaps we have not all acquaintance with the same natural laws  you may know some that i do not and what is to me unaccountable may be very clear to you  you knew my brother johnthat is you knew him when you knew that i was not present but neither you nor i believe any human being could distinguish between him and me if we chose to seem alike  our parents could not ours is the only instance of which i have any knowledge of so close resemblance as that  i speak of my brother john but i am not at all sure that his name was not henry and mine john  we were regularly christened but afterward in the very act of tattooing us with small distinguishing marks the operator lost his reckoning and although i bear upon my forearm a small h and he bore a j it is by no means certain that the letters ought not to have been transposed  during our boyhood our parents tried to distinguish us more obviously by our clothing and other simple devices but we would so frequently exchange suits and otherwise circumvent the enemy that they abandoned all such ineffectual attempts and during all the years that we lived together at home everybody recognized the difficulty of the situation and made the best of it by calling us both jehnry  i have often wondered at my fathers forbearance in not branding us conspicuously upon our unworthy brows but as we were tolerably good boys and used our power of embarrassment and annoyance with commendable moderation we escaped the iron  my father was in fact a singularly goodnatured man and i think quietly enjoyed natures practical joke  soon after we had come to california and settled at san jose where the only good fortune that awaited us was our meeting with so kind a friend as you the family as you know was broken up by the death of both my parents in the same week  my father died insolvent and the homestead was sacrificed to pay his debts  my sisters returned to relatives in the east but owing to your kindness john and i then twentytwo years of age obtained employment in san francisco in different quarters of the town  circumstances did not permit us to live together and we saw each other infrequently sometimes not oftener than once a week  as we had few acquaintances in common the fact of our extraordinary likeness was little known  i come now to the matter of your inquiry  one day soon after we had come to this city i was walking down market street late in the afternoon when i was accosted by a welldressed man of middle age who after greeting me cordially said  stevens i know of course that you do not go out much but i have told my wife about you and she would be glad to see you at the house  i have a notion too that my girls are worth knowing  suppose you come out tomorrow at six and dine with us en famille and then if the ladies cant amuse you afterward ill stand in with a few games of billiards  this was said with so bright a smile and so engaging a manner that i had not the heart to refuse and although i had never seen the man in my life i promptly replied  you are very good sir and it will give me great pleasure to accept the invitation  please present my compliments to mrs margovan and ask her to expect me  with a shake of the hand and a pleasant parting word the man passed on  that he had mistaken me for my brother was plain enough  that was an error to which i was accustomed and which it was not my habit to rectify unless the matter seemed important  but how had i known that this mans name was margovan  it certainly is not a name that one would apply to a man at random with a probability that it would be right  in point of fact the name was as strange to me as the man  the next morning i hastened to where my brother was employed and met him coming out of the office with a number of bills that he was to collect  i told him how i had committed him and added that if he didnt care to keep the engagement i should be delighted to continue the impersonation  thats queer he said thoughtfully  margovan is the only man in the office here whom i know well and like  when he came in this morning and we had passed the usual greetings some singular impulse prompted me to say  oh i beg your pardon mr margovan but i neglected to ask your address  i got the address but what under the sun i was to do with it i did not know until now  its good of you to offer to take the consequence of your impudence but ill eat that dinner myself if you please  he ate a number of dinners at the same placemore than were good for him i may add without disparaging their quality for he fell in love with miss margovan proposed marriage to her and was heartlessly accepted  several weeks after i had been informed of the engagement but before it had been convenient for me to make the acquaintance of the young woman and her family i met one day on kearney street a handsome but somewhat dissipatedlooking man whom something prompted me to follow and watch which i did without any scruple whatever  he turned up geary street and followed it until he came to union square  there he looked at his watch then entered the square  he loitered about the paths for some time evidently waiting for someone  presently he was joined by a fashionably dressed and beautiful young woman and the two walked away up stockton street i following  i now felt the necessity of extreme caution for although the girl was a stranger it seemed to me that she would recognize me at a glance  they made several turns from one street to another and finally after both had taken a hasty look all aboutwhich i narrowly evaded by stepping into a doorwaythey entered a house of which i do not care to state the location  its location was better than its character  i protest that my action in playing the spy upon these two strangers was without assignable motive  it was one of which i might or might not be ashamed according to my estimate of the character of the person finding it out  as an essential part of a narrative educed by your question it is related here without hesitancy or shame  a week later john took me to the house of his prospective fatherin law and in miss margovan as you have already surmised but to my profound astonishment i recognized the heroine of that discreditable adventure  a gloriously beautiful heroine of a discreditable adventure i must in justice admit that she was but that fact has only this importance  her beauty was such a surprise to me that it cast a doubt upon her identity with the young woman i had seen before how could the marvelous fascination of her face have failed to strike me at that time  but nothere was no possibility of error the difference was due to costume light and general surroundings  john and i passed the evening at the house enduring with the fortitude of long experience such delicate enough banter as our likeness naturally suggested  when the young lady and i were left alone for a few minutes i looked her squarely in the face and said with sudden gravity  you too miss margovan have a double  i saw her last tuesday afternoon in union square  she trained her great gray eyes upon me for a moment but her glance was a trifle less steady than my own and she withdrew it fixing it on the tip of her shoe  was she very like me she asked with an indifference which i thought a little overdone  so like said i that i greatly admired her and being unwilling to lose sight of her i confess that i followed her untilmiss margovan are you sure that you understand  she was now pale but entirely calm  she again raised her eyes to mine with a look that did not falter  what do you wish me to do she asked  you need not fear to name your terms  i accept them  it was plain even in the brief time given me for reflection that in dealing with this girl ordinary methods would not do and ordinary exactions were needless  miss margovan i said doubtless with something of the compassion in my voice that i had in my heart it is impossible not to think you the victim of some horrible compulsion  rather than impose new embarrassments upon you i would prefer to aid you to regain your freedom  she shook her head sadly and hopelessly and i continued with agitation  your beauty unnerves me  i am disarmed by your frankness and your distress  if you are free to act upon conscience you will i believe do what you conceive to be best if you are notwell heaven help us all  you have nothing to fear from me but such opposition to this marriage as i can try to justify onon other grounds  these were not my exact words but that was the sense of them as nearly as my sudden and conflicting emotions permitted me to express it  i rose and left her without another look at her met the others as they reentered the room and said as calmly as i could  i have been bidding miss margovan good evening it is later than i thought  john decided to go with me  in the street he asked if i had observed anything singular in julias manner  i thought her ill i replied that is why i left  nothing more was said  the next evening i came late to my lodgings  the events of the previous evening had made me nervous and ill i had tried to cure myself and attain to clear thinking by walking in the open air but i was oppressed with a horrible presentiment of evila presentiment which i could not formulate  it was a chill foggy night my clothing and hair were damp and i shook with cold  in my dressing gown and slippers before a blazing grate of coals i was even more uncomfortable  i no longer shivered but shudderedthere is a difference  the dread of some impending calamity was so strong and dispiriting that i tried to drive it away by inviting a real sorrow tried to dispel the conception of a terrible future by substituting the memory of a painful past  i recalled the death of my parents and endeavored to fix my mind upon the last sad scenes at their bedsides and their graves  it all seemed vague and unreal as having occurred ages ago and to another person  suddenly striking through my thought and parting it as a tense cord is parted by the stroke of steeli can think of no other comparisoni heard a sharp cry as of one in mortal agony  the voice was that of my brother and seemed to come from the street outside my window  i sprang to the window and threw it open  a street lamp directly opposite threw a wan and ghastly light upon the wet pavement and the fronts of the houses  a single policeman with upturned collar was leaning against a gatepost quietly smoking a cigar  no one else was in sight  i closed the window and pulled down the shade seated myself before the fire and tried to fix my mind upon my surroundings  by way of assisting by performance of some familiar act i looked at my watch it marked halfpast eleven  again i heard that awful cry  it seemed in the roomat my side  i was frightened and for some moments had not the power to move  a few minutes lateri have no recollection of the intermediate timei found myself hurrying along an unfamiliar street as fast as i could walk  i did not know where i was nor whither i was going but presently sprang up the steps of a house before which were two or three carriages and in which were moving lights and a subdued confusion of voices  it was the house of mr margovan  you know good friend what had occurred there  in one chamber lay julia margovan hours dead by poison in another john stevens bleeding from a pistol wound in the chest inflicted by his own hand as i burst into the room pushed aside the physicians and laid my hand upon his forehead he unclosed his eyes stared blankly closed them slowly and died without a sign  i knew no more until six weeks afterward when i had been nursed back to life by your own saintly wife in your own beautiful home  all of that you know but what you do not know is thiswhich however has no bearing upon the subject of your psychological researchesat least not upon that branch of them in which with a delicacy and consideration all your own you have asked for less assistance than i think i have given you  one moonlight night several years afterward i was passing through union square  the hour was late and the square deserted  certain memories of the past naturally came into my mind as i came to the spot where i had once witnessed that fateful assignation and with that unaccountable perversity which prompts us to dwell upon thoughts of the most painful character i seated myself upon one of the benches to indulge them  a man entered the square and came along the walk toward me  his hands were clasped behind him his head was bowed he seemed to observe nothing  as he approached the shadow in which i sat i recognized him as the man whom i had seen meet julia margovan years before at that spot  but he was terribly alteredgray worn and haggard  dissipation and vice were in evidence in every look illness was no less apparent  his clothing was in disorder his hair fell across his forehead in a derangement which was at once uncanny and picturesque  he looked fitter for restraint than libertythe restraint of a hospital  with no defined purpose i rose and confronted him  he raised his head and looked me full in the face  i have no words to describe the ghastly change that came over his own it was a look of unspeakable terrorhe thought himself eye to eye with a ghost  but he was a courageous man  damn you john stevens he cried and lifting his trembling arm he dashed his fist feebly at my face and fell headlong upon the gravel as i walked away  somebody found him there stonedead  nothing more is known of him not even his name  to know of a man that he is dead should be enough    the haunted valley    ihow trees are felled in china  a halfmile north from jo dunfers on the road from huttons to mexican hill the highway dips into a sunless ravine which opens out on either hand in a halfconfidential manner as if it had a secret to impart at some more convenient season  i never used to ride through it without looking first to the one side and then to the other to see if the time had arrived for the revelation  if i saw nothingand i never did see anythingthere was no feeling of disappointment for i knew the disclosure was merely withheld temporarily for some good reason which i had no right to question that i should one day be taken into full confidence i no more doubted than i doubted the existence of jo dunfer himself through whose premises the ravine ran  it was said that jo had once undertaken to erect a cabin in some remote part of it but for some reason had abandoned the enterprise and constructed his present hermaphrodite habitation half residence and half groggery at the roadside upon an extreme corner of his estate as far away as possible as if on purpose to show how radically he had changed his mind  this jo dunferor as he was familiarly known in the neighborhood whisky jowas a very important personage in those parts  he was apparently about forty years of age a long shockheaded fellow with a corded face a gnarled arm and a knotty hand like a bunch of prisonkeys  he was a hairy man with a stoop in his walk like that of one who is about to spring upon something and rend it  next to the peculiarity to which he owed his local appellation mr dunfers most obvious characteristic was a deepseated antipathy to the chinese  i saw him once in a towering rage because one of his herdsmen had permitted a travelheated asian to slake his thirst at the horsetrough in front of the saloon end of jos establishment i ventured faintly to remonstrate with jo for his unchristian spirit but he merely explained that there was nothing about chinamen in the new testament and strode away to wreak his displeasure upon his dog which also i suppose the inspired scribes had overlooked  some days afterward finding him sitting alone in his barroom i cautiously approached the subject when greatly to my relief the habitual austerity of his expression visibly softened into something that i took for condescension  you young easterners he said are a mileandahalf too good for this country and you dont catch on to our play  people who dont know a chileno from a kanaka can afford to hang out liberal ideas about chinese immigration but a fellow that has to fight for his bone with a lot of mongrel coolies hasnt any time for foolishness  this long consumer who had probably never done an honest dayswork in his life sprung the lid of a chinese tobaccobox and with thumb and forefinger forked out a wad like a small haycock  holding this reinforcement within supporting distance he fired away with renewed confidence  theyre a flight of devouring locusts and theyre going for everything green in this god blest land if you want to know  here he pushed his reserve into the breach and when his gabblegear was again disengaged resumed his uplifting discourse  i had one of them on this ranch five years ago and ill tell you about it so that you can see the nub of this whole question  i didnt pan out particularly well those daysdrank more whisky than was prescribed for me and didnt seem to care for my duty as a patriotic american citizen so i took that pagan in as a kind of cook  but when i got religion over at the hill and they talked of running me for the legislature it was given to me to see the light but what was i to do  if i gave him the go somebody else would take him and mightnt treat him white  what was i to do  what would any good christian do especially one new to the trade and full to the neck with the brotherhood of man and the fatherhood of god  jo paused for a reply with an expression of unstable satisfaction as of one who has solved a problem by a distrusted method  presently he rose and swallowed a glass of whisky from a full bottle on the counter then resumed his story  besides he didnt count for muchdidnt know anything and gave himself airs  they all do that  i said him nay but he muled it through on that line while he lasted but after turning the other cheek seventy and seven times i doctored the dice so that he didnt last forever  and im almighty glad i had the sand to do it  jos gladness which somehow did not impress me was duly and ostentatiously celebrated at the bottle  about five years ago i started in to stick up a shack  that was before this one was built and i put it in another place  i set ah wee and a little cuss named gopher to cutting the timber  of course i didnt expect ah wee to help much for he had a face like a day in june and big black eyesi guess maybe they were the damndest eyes in this neck o woods  while delivering this trenchant thrust at common sense mr dunfer absently regarded a knothole in the thin board partition separating the bar from the livingroom as if that were one of the eyes whose size and color had incapacitated his servant for good service  now you eastern galoots wont believe anything against the yellow devils he suddenly flamed out with an appearance of earnestness not altogether convincing but i tell you that chink was the perversest scoundrel outside san francisco  the miserable pigtail mongolian went to hewing away at the saplings all round the stems like a worm o the dust gnawing a radish  i pointed out his error as patiently as i knew how and showed him how to cut them on two sides so as to make them fall right but no sooner would i turn my back on him like thisand he turned it on me amplifying the illustration by taking some more liquorthan he was at it again  it was just this way while i looked at him soregarding me rather unsteadily and with evident complexity of visionhe was all right but when i looked away sotaking a long pull at the bottlehe defied me  then id gaze at him reproachfully so and butter wouldnt have melted in his mouth  doubtless mr dunfer honestly intended the look that he fixed upon me to be merely reproachful but it was singularly fit to arouse the gravest apprehension in any unarmed person incurring it and as i had lost all interest in his pointless and interminable narrative i rose to go  before i had fairly risen he had again turned to the counter and with a barely audible so had emptied the bottle at a gulp  heavens what a yell  it was like a titan in his last strong agony jo staggered back after emitting it as a cannon recoils from its own thunder and then dropped into his chair as if he had been knocked in the head like a beefhis eyes drawn sidewise toward the wall with a stare of terror  looking in the same direction i saw that the knothole in the wall had indeed become a human eyea full black eye that glared into my own with an entire lack of expression more awful than the most devilish glitter  i think i must have covered my face with my hands to shut out the horrible illusion if such it was and jos little white manofallwork coming into the room broke the spell and i walked out of the house with a sort of dazed fear that delirium tremens might be infectious  my horse was hitched at the wateringtrough and untying him i mounted and gave him his head too much troubled in mind to note whither he took me  i did not know what to think of all this and like every one who does not know what to think i thought a great deal and to little purpose the only reflection that seemed at all satisfactory was that on the morrow i should be some miles away with a strong probability of never returning  a sudden coolness brought me out of my abstraction and looking up i found myself entering the deep shadows of the ravine  the day was stifling and this transition from the pitiless visible heat of the parched fields to the cool gloom heavy with pungency of cedars and vocal with twittering of the birds that had been driven to its leafy asylum was exquisitely refreshing  i looked for my mystery as usual but not finding the ravine in a communicative mood dismounted led my sweating animal into the undergrowth tied him securely to a tree and sat down upon a rock to meditate  i began bravely by analyzing my pet superstition about the place having resolved it into its constituent elements i arranged them in convenient troops and squadrons and collecting all the forces of my logic bore down upon them from impregnable premises with the thunder of irresistible conclusions and a great noise of chariots and general intellectual shouting  then when my big mental guns had overturned all opposition and were growling almost inaudibly away on the horizon of pure speculation the routed enemy straggled in upon their rear massed silently into a solid phalanx and captured me bag and baggage  an indefinable dread came upon me  i rose to shake it off and began threading the narrow dell by an old grassgrown cowpath that seemed to flow along the bottom as a substitute for the brook that nature had neglected to provide  the trees among which the path straggled were ordinary wellbehaved plants a trifle perverted as to trunk and eccentric as to bough but with nothing unearthly in their general aspect  a few loose bowlders which had detached themselves from the sides of the depression to set up an independent existence at the bottom had dammed up the pathway here and there but their stony repose had nothing in it of the stillness of death  there was a kind of death chamber hush in the valley it is true and a mysterious whisper above  the wind was just fingering the tops of the treesthat was all  i had not thought of connecting jo dunfers drunken narrative with what i now sought and only when i came into a clear space and stumbled over the level trunks of some small trees did i have the revelation  this was the site of the abandoned shack  the discovery was verified by noting that some of the rotting stumps were hacked all round in a most unwoodmanlike way while others were cut straight across and the butt ends of the corresponding trunks had the blunt wedgeform given by the axe of a master  the opening among the trees was not more than thirty paces across at one side was a little knolla natural hillock bare of shrubbery but covered with wild grass and on this standing out of the grass the headstone of a grave  i do not remember that i felt anything like surprise at this discovery  i viewed that lonely grave with something of the feeling that columbus must have had when he saw the hills and headlands of the new world  before approaching it i leisurely completed my survey of the surroundings  i was even guilty of the affectation of winding my watch at that unusual hour and with needless care and deliberation  then i approached my mystery  the gravea rather short onewas in somewhat better repair than was consistent with its obvious age and isolation and my eyes i dare say widened a trifle at a clump of unmistakable garden flowers showing evidence of recent watering  the stone had clearly enough done duty once as a doorstep  in its front was carved or rather dug an inscription  it read thus   ah weechinaman  age unknown  worked for jo dunfer this monument is erected by him to keep the chinks memory green likewise as a warning to celestials not to take on airs  devil take em she was a good egg   i cannot adequately relate my astonishment at this uncommon inscription  the meagre but sufficient identification of the deceased the impudent candor of confession the brutal anathema the ludicrous change of sex and sentimentall marked this record as the work of one who must have been at least as much demented as bereaved i felt that any further disclosure would be a paltry anticlimax and with an unconscious regard for dramatic effect turned squarely about and walked away  nor did i return to that part of the county for four years   iiwho drives sane oxen should himself be sane   geeup there old fuddyduddy  this unique adjuration came from the lips of a queer little man perched upon a wagonful of firewood behind a brace of oxen that were hauling it easily along with a simulation of mighty effort which had evidently not imposed on their lord and master  as that gentleman happened at the moment to be staring me squarely in the face as i stood by the roadside it was not altogether clear whether he was addressing me or his beasts nor could i say if they were named fuddy and duddy and were both subjects of the imperative verb to geeup anyhow the command produced no effect on us and the queer little man removed his eyes from mine long enough to spear fuddy and duddy alternately with a long pole remarking quietly but with feeling dern your skin as if they enjoyed that integument in common observing that my request for a ride took no attention and finding myself falling slowly astern i placed one foot upon the inner circumference of a hind wheel and was slowly elevated to the level of the hub whence i boarded the concern sans ceremonie and scrambling forward seated myself beside the driverwho took no notice of me until he had administered another indiscriminate castigation to his cattle accompanied with the advice to buckle down you derned incapable  then the master of the outfit or rather the former master for i could not suppress a whimsical feeling that the entire establishment was my lawful prize trained his big black eyes upon me with an expression strangely and somewhat unpleasantly familiar laid down his rodwhich neither blossomed nor turned into a serpent as i half expectedfolded his arms and gravely demanded wat did you do to wisky  my natural reply would have been that i drank it but there was something about the query that suggested a hidden significance and something about the man that did not invite a shallow jest  and so having no other answer ready i merely held my tongue but felt as if i were resting under an imputation of guilt and that my silence was being construed into a confession  just then a cold shadow fell upon my cheek and caused me to look up we were descending into my ravine  i cannot describe the sensation that came upon me  i had not seen it since it unbosomed itself four years before and now i felt like one to whom a friend has made some sorrowing confession of crime long past and who has basely deserted him in consequence  the old memories of jo dunfer his fragmentary revelation and the unsatisfying explanatory note by the headstone came back with singular distinctness  i wondered what had become of jo andi turned sharply round and asked my prisoner  he was intently watching his cattle and without withdrawing his eyes replied  geeup old terrapin  he lies aside of ah wee up the gulch  like to see it  they always come back to the spotive been expectin you  hwoa  at the enunciation of the aspirate fuddyduddy the incapable terrapin came to a dead halt and before the vowel had died away up the ravine had folded up all his eight legs and lain down in the dusty road regardless of the effect upon his derned skin  the queer little man slid off his seat to the ground and started up the dell without deigning to look back to see if i was following  but i was  it was about the same season of the year and at near the same hour of the day of my last visit  the jays clamored loudly and the trees whispered darkly as before and i somehow traced in the two sounds a fanciful analogy to the open boastfulness of mr jo dunfers mouth and the mysterious reticence of his manner and to the mingled hardihood and tenderness of his sole literary productionthe epitaph  all things in the valley seemed unchanged excepting the cowpath which was almost wholly overgrown with weeds  when we came out into the clearing however there was change enough  among the stumps and trunks of the fallen saplings those that had been hacked china fashion were no longer distinguishable from those that were cut melican way  it was as if the oldworld barbarism and the newworld civilization had reconciled their differences by the arbitration of an impartial decayas is the way of civilizations the knoll was there but the hunnish brambles had overrun and all but obliterated its effete grasses and the patrician gardenviolet had capitulated to his plebeian brotherperhaps had merely reverted to his original type  another gravea long robust moundhad been made beside the first which seemed to shrink from the comparison and in the shadow of a new headstone the old one lay prostrate with its marvelous inscription illegible by accumulation of leaves and soil  in point of literary merit the new was inferior to the old was even repulsive in its terse and savage jocularity   jo dunfer  done for   i turned from it with indifference and brushing away the leaves from the tablet of the dead pagan restored to light the mocking words which fresh from their long neglect seemed to have a certain pathos  my guide too appeared to take on an added seriousness as he read it and i fancied that i could detect beneath his whimsical manner something of manliness almost of dignity  but while i looked at him his former aspect so subtly inhuman so tantalizingly familiar crept back into his big eyes repellant and attractive  i resolved to make an end of the mystery if possible  my friend i said pointing to the smaller grave did jo dunfer murder that chinaman  he was leaning against a tree and looking across the open space into the top of another or into the blue sky beyond  he neither withdrew his eyes nor altered his posture as he slowly replied  no sir he justifiably homicided him  then he really did kill him  kill im  i should say he did rather  doesnt everybody know that  didnt he stan up before the coroners jury and confess it and didnt they find a verdict of came to is death by a wholesome christian sentiment workin in the caucasian breast  an didnt the church at the hill turn wisky down for it  and didnt the sovereign people elect him justice of the peace to get even on the gospelers i dont know where you were brought up  but did jo do that because the chinaman did not or would not learn to cut down trees like a white man  sureit stans so on the record which makes it true an legal my knowin better doesnt make any difference with legal truth it wasnt my funeral and i wasnt invited to deliver an oration  but the fact is wisky was jealous o meand the little wretch actually swelled out like a turkeycock and made a pretense of adjusting an imaginary necktie noting the effect in the palm of his hand held up before him to represent a mirror  jealous of you i repeated with illmannered astonishment  thats what i said  why notdont i look all right  he assumed a mocking attitude of studied grace and twitched the wrinkles out of his threadbare waistcoat  then suddenly dropping his voice to a low pitch of singular sweetness he continued  wisky thought a lot o that chink nobody but me knew how e doted on im  couldnt bear im out of is sight the derned protoplasm and wen e came down to this clearin one day an found him an me neglectin our workhim asleep an me grapplin a tarantula out of is sleevewisky laid hold of my axe and let us have it good an hard  i dodged just then for the spider bit me but ah wee got it bad in the side an tumbled about like anything  wisky was just weighin me out one wen e saw the spider fastened on my finger then e knew hed made a jack ass of imself  he threw away the axe and got down on is knees alongside of ah wee who gave a last little kick and opened is eyeshe had eyes like minean puttin up is hands drew down wiskys ugly head and held it there wile e stayed that wasnt long for a tremblin ran through im and e gave a bit of a moan an beat the game  during the progress of the story the narrator had become transfigured  the comic or rather the sardonic element was all out of him and as he painted that strange scene it was with difficulty that i kept my composure  and this consummate actor had somehow so managed me that the sympathy due to his dramatis persone was given to himself  i stepped forward to grasp his hand when suddenly a broad grin danced across his face and with a light mocking laugh he continued  wen wisky got is nut out o that e was a sight to see  all his fine clotheshe dressed mighty blindin those dayswere spoiled everlastin is hair was towsled and his facewhat i could see of itwas whiter than the ace of lilies e stared once at me and looked away as if i didnt count an then there were shootin pains chasin one another from my bitten finger into my head and it was gopher to the dark  thats why i wasnt at the inquest  but why did you hold your tongue afterward i asked  its that kind of tongue he replied and not another word would he say about it  after that wisky took to drinkin harder an harder and was rabider an rabider anticoolie but i dont think e was ever particularly glad that e dispelled ah wee  he didnt put on so much dog about it wen we were alone as wen he had the ear of a derned spectacular extravaganza like you e put up that headstone and gouged the inscription accordin to his varyin moods  it took im three weeks workin between drinks  i gouged his in one day  when did jo die i asked rather absently  the answer took my breath  pretty soon after i looked at him through that knothole wen you had put something in his wisky you derned borgia  recovering somewhat from my surprise at this astounding charge i was halfminded to throttle the audacious accuser but was restrained by a sudden conviction that came to me in the light of a revelation  i fixed a grave look upon him and asked as calmly as i could  and when did you go luny  nine years ago he shrieked throwing out his clenched handsnine years ago wen that big brute killed the woman who loved him better than she did meme who had followed er from san francisco where e won er at draw pokerme who had watched over er for years wen the scoundrel she belonged to was ashamed to acknowledge er and treat er whiteme who for her sake kept is cussed secret till it ate im upme who wen you poisoned the beast fulfilled is last request to lay im alongside er and give im a stone to the head of im  and ive never since seen er grave till now for i didnt want to meet im here  meet him  why gopher my poor fellow he is dead  thats why im afraid of im  i followed the little wretch back to his wagon and wrung his hand at parting  it was now nightfall and as i stood there at the roadside in the deepening gloom watching the blank outlines of the receding wagon a sound was borne to me on the evening winda sound as of a series of vigorous thumpsand a voice came out of the night  geeup there you derned old geranium    a jug of sirup    this narrative begins with the death of its hero  silas deemer died on the 16th day of july 1863 and two days later his remains were buried  as he had been personally known to every man woman and wellgrown child in the village the funeral as the local newspaper phrased it was largely attended  in accordance with a custom of the time and place the coffin was opened at the graveside and the entire assembly of friends and neighbors filed past taking a last look at the face of the dead  and then before the eyes of all silas deemer was put into the ground  some of the eyes were a trifle dim but in a general way it may be said that at that interment there was lack of neither observance nor observation silas was indubitably dead and none could have pointed out any ritual delinquency that would have justified him in coming back from the grave  yet if human testimony is good for anything and certainly it once put an end to witchcraft in and about salem he came back  i forgot to state that the death and burial of silas deemer occurred in the little village of hillbrook where he had lived for thirtyone years  he had been what is known in some parts of the union which is admittedly a free country as a merchant that is to say he kept a retail shop for the sale of such things as are commonly sold in shops of that character  his honesty had never been questioned so far as is known and he was held in high esteem by all  the only thing that could be urged against him by the most censorious was a too close attention to business  it was not urged against him though many another who manifested it in no greater degree was less leniently judged  the business to which silas was devoted was mostly his ownthat possibly may have made a difference  at the time of deemers death nobody could recollect a single day sundays excepted that he had not passed in his store since he had opened it more than a quartercentury before  his health having been perfect during all that time he had been unable to discern any validity in whatever may or might have been urged to lure him astray from his counter and it is related that once when he was summoned to the county seat as a witness in an important law case and did not attend the lawyer who had the hardihood to move that he be admonished was solemnly informed that the court regarded the proposal with surprise  judicial surprise being an emotion that attorneys are not commonly ambitious to arouse the motion was hastily withdrawn and an agreement with the other side effected as to what mr deemer would have said if he had been therethe other side pushing its advantage to the extreme and making the supposititious testimony distinctly damaging to the interests of its proponents  in brief it was the general feeling in all that region that silas deemer was the one immobile verity of hillbrook and that his translation in space would precipitate some dismal public ill or strenuous calamity  mrs deemer and two grown daughters occupied the upper rooms of the building but silas had never been known to sleep elsewhere than on a cot behind the counter of the store  and there quite by accident he was found one night dying and passed away just before the time for taking down the shutters  though speechless he appeared conscious and it was thought by those who knew him best that if the end had unfortunately been delayed beyond the usual hour for opening the store the effect upon him would have been deplorable  such had been silas deemersuch the fixity and invariety of his life and habit that the village humorist who had once attended college was moved to bestow upon him the sobriquet of old ibidem and in the first issue of the local newspaper after the death to explain without offence that silas had taken a day off  it was more than a day but from the record it appears that well within a month mr deemer made it plain that he had not the leisure to be dead  one of hillbrooks most respected citizens was alvan creede a banker  he lived in the finest house in town kept a carriage and was a most estimable man variously  he knew something of the advantages of travel too having been frequently in boston and once it was thought in new york though he modestly disclaimed that glittering distinction  the matter is mentioned here merely as a contribution to an understanding of mr creedes worth for either way it is creditable to himto his intelligence if he had put himself even temporarily into contact with metropolitan culture to his candor if he had not  one pleasant summer evening at about the hour of ten mr creede entering at his garden gate passed up the gravel walk which looked very white in the moonlight mounted the stone steps of his fine house and pausing a moment inserted his latchkey in the door  as he pushed this open he met his wife who was crossing the passage from the parlor to the library  she greeted him pleasantly and pulling the door further back held it for him to enter  instead he turned and looking about his feet in front of the threshold uttered an exclamation of surprise  whywhat the devil he said has become of that jug  what jug alvan his wife inquired not very sympathetically  a jug of maple sirupi brought it along from the store and set it down here to open the door  what the  there there alvan please dont swear again said the lady interrupting  hillbrook by the way is not the only place in christendom where a vestigial polytheism forbids the taking in vain of the evil ones name  the jug of maple sirup which the easy ways of village life had permitted hillbrooks foremost citizen to carry home from the store was not there  are you quite sure alvan  my dear do you suppose a man does not know when he is carrying a jug  i bought that sirup at deemers as i was passing  deemer himself drew it and lent me the jug and i  the sentence remains to this day unfinished  mr creede staggered into the house entered the parlor and dropped into an armchair trembling in every limb  he had suddenly remembered that silas deemer was three weeks dead  mrs creede stood by her husband regarding him with surprise and anxiety  for heavens sake she said what ails you  mr creedes ailment having no obvious relation to the interests of the better land he did not apparently deem it necessary to expound it on that demand he said nothingmerely stared  there were long moments of silence broken by nothing but the measured ticking of the clock which seemed somewhat slower than usual as if it were civilly granting them an extension of time in which to recover their wits  jane i have gone madthat is it  he spoke thickly and hurriedly you should have told me you must have observed my symptoms before they became so pronounced that i have observed them myself  i thought i was passing deemers store it was open and lit upthat is what i thought of course it is never open now  silas deemer stood at his desk behind the counter  my god jane i saw him as distinctly as i see you  remembering that you had said you wanted some maple sirup i went in and bought somethat is alli bought two quarts of maple sirup from silas deemer who is dead and underground but nevertheless drew that sirup from a cask and handed it to me in a jug  he talked with me too rather gravely i remember even more so than was his way but not a word of what he said can i now recall  but i saw himgood lord i saw and talked with himand he is dead  so i thought but im mad jane im as crazy as a beetle and you have kept it from me  this monologue gave the woman time to collect what faculties she had  alvan she said you have given no evidence of insanity believe me  this was undoubtedly an illusionhow should it be anything else  that would be too terrible  but there is no insanity you are working too hard at the bank  you should not have attended the meeting of directors this evening any one could see that you were ill i knew something would occur  it may have seemed to him that the prophecy had lagged a bit awaiting the event but he said nothing of that being concerned with his own condition  he was calm now and could think coherently  doubtless the phenomenon was subjective he said with a somewhat ludicrous transition to the slang of science  granting the possibility of spiritual apparition and even materialization yet the apparition and materialization of a halfgallon brown clay juga piece of coarse heavy pottery evolved from nothingthat is hardly thinkable  as he finished speaking a child ran into the roomhis little daughter  she was clad in a bedgown  hastening to her father she threw her arms about his neck saying  you naughty papa you forgot to come in and kiss me  we heard you open the gate and got up and looked out  and papa dear eddy says maynt he have the little jug when it is empty  as the full import of that revelation imparted itself to alvan creedes understanding he visibly shuddered  for the child could not have heard a word of the conversation  the estate of silas deemer being in the hands of an administrator who had thought it best to dispose of the business the store had been closed ever since the owners death the goods having been removed by another merchant who had purchased them en bloc  the rooms above were vacant as well for the widow and daughters had gone to another town  on the evening immediately after alvan creedes adventure which had somehow got out a crowd of men women and children thronged the sidewalk opposite the store  that the place was haunted by the spirit of the late silas deemer was now well known to every resident of hillbrook though many affected disbelief  of these the hardiest and in a general way the youngest threw stones against the front of the building the only part accessible but carefully missed the unshuttered windows  incredulity had not grown to malice  a few venturesome souls crossed the street and rattled the door in its frame struck matches and held them near the window attempted to view the black interior  some of the spectators invited attention to their wit by shouting and groaning and challenging the ghost to a footrace  after a considerable time had elapsed without any manifestation and many of the crowd had gone away all those remaining began to observe that the interior of the store was suffused with a dim yellow light at this all demonstrations ceased the intrepid souls about the door and windows fell back to the opposite side of the street and were merged in the crowd the small boys ceased throwing stones  nobody spoke above his breath all whispered excitedly and pointed to the now steadily growing light  how long a time had passed since the first faint glow had been observed none could have guessed but eventually the illumination was bright enough to reveal the whole interior of the store and there standing at his desk behind the counter silas deemer was distinctly visible  the effect upon the crowd was marvelous  it began rapidly to melt away at both flanks as the timid left the place  many ran as fast as their legs would let them others moved off with greater dignity turning occasionally to look backward over the shoulder  at last a score or more mostly men remained where they were speechless staring excited  the apparition inside gave them no attention it was apparently occupied with a book of accounts  presently three men left the crowd on the sidewalk as if by a common impulse and crossed the street  one of them a heavy man was about to set his shoulder against the door when it opened apparently without human agency and the courageous investigators passed in  no sooner had they crossed the threshold than they were seen by the awed observers outside to be acting in the most unaccountable way  they thrust out their hands before them pursued devious courses came into violent collision with the counter with boxes and barrels on the floor and with one another  they turned awkwardly hither and thither and seemed trying to escape but unable to retrace their steps  their voices were heard in exclamations and curses  but in no way did the apparition of silas deemer manifest an interest in what was going on  by what impulse the crowd was moved none ever recollected but the entire massmen women children dogsmade a simultaneous and tumultuous rush for the entrance  they congested the doorway pushing for precedenceresolving themselves at length into a line and moving up step by step  by some subtle spiritual or physical alchemy observation had been transmuted into actionthe sightseers had become participants in the spectaclethe audience had usurped the stage  to the only spectator remaining on the other side of the street alvan creede the bankerthe interior of the store with its inpouring crowd continued in full illumination all the strange things going on there were clearly visible  to those inside all was black darkness  it was as if each person as he was thrust in at the door had been stricken blind and was maddened by the mischance they groped with aimless imprecision tried to force their way out against the current pushed and elbowed struck at random fell and were trampled rose and trampled in their turn  they seized one another by the garments the hair the beardfought like animals cursed shouted called one another opprobrious and obscene names when finally alvan creede had seen the last person of the line pass into that awful tumult the light that had illuminated it was suddenly quenched and all was as black to him as to those within  he turned away and left the place  in the early morning a curious crowd had gathered about deemers it was composed partly of those who had run away the night before but now had the courage of sunshine partly of honest folk going to their daily toil  the door of the store stood open the place was vacant but on the walls the floor the furniture were shreds of clothing and tangles of hair  hillbrook militant had managed somehow to pull itself out and had gone home to medicine its hurts and swear that it had been all night in bed  on the dusty desk behind the counter was the salesbook  the entries in it in deemers handwriting had ceased on the 16th day of july the last of his life  there was no record of a later sale to alvan creede  that is the entire storyexcept that mens passions having subsided and reason having resumed its immemorial sway it was confessed in hillbrook that considering the harmless and honorable character of his first commercial transaction under the new conditions silas deemer deceased might properly have been suffered to resume business at the old stand without mobbing  in that judgment the local historian from whose unpublished work these facts are compiled had the thoughtfulness to signify his concurrence    staley flemings hallucination    of two men who were talking one was a physician  i sent for you doctor said the other but i dont think you can do me any good  may be you can recommend a specialist in psychopathy  i fancy im a bit loony  you look all right the physician said  you shall judgei have hallucinations  i wake every night and see in my room intently watching me a big black newfoundland dog with a white forefoot  you say you wake are you sure about that  hallucinations are sometimes only dreams  oh i wake all right  sometimes i lie still a long time looking at the dog as earnestly as the dog looks at mei always leave the light going  when i cant endure it any longer i sit up in bedand nothing is there  m mwhat is the beasts expression  it seems to me sinister  of course i know that except in art an animals face in repose has always the same expression  but this is not a real animal  newfoundland dogs are pretty mild looking you know whats the matter with this one  really my diagnosis would have no value  i am not going to treat the dog  the physician laughed at his own pleasantry but narrowly watched his patient from the corner of his eye  presently he said  fleming your description of the beast fits the dog of the late atwell barton  fleming halfrose from his chair sat again and made a visible attempt at indifference  i remember barton he said i believe he wasit was reported thatwasnt there something suspicious in his death  looking squarely now into the eyes of his patient the physician said  three years ago the body of your old enemy atwell barton was found in the woods near his house and yours  he had been stabbed to death  there have been no arrests there was no clew  some of us had theories  i had one  have you  i  why bless your soul what could i know about it  you remember that i left for europe almost immediately afterwarda considerable time afterward  in the few weeks since my return you could not expect me to construct a theory  in fact i have not given the matter a thought  what about his dog  it was first to find the body  it died of starvation on his grave  we do not know the inexorable law underlying coincidences  staley fleming did not or he would perhaps not have sprung to his feet as the night wind brought in through the open window the long wailing howl of a distant dog  he strode several times across the room in the steadfast gaze of the physician then abruptly confronting him almost shouted  what has all this to do with my trouble dr halderman  you forget why you were sent for  rising the physician laid his hand upon his patients arm and said gently  pardon me  i cannot diagnose your disorder offhandto morrow perhaps  please go to bed leaving your door unlocked i will pass the night here with your books  can you call me without rising  yes there is an electric bell  good  if anything disturbs you push the button without sitting up good night  comfortably installed in an armchair the man of medicine stared into the glowing coals and thought deeply and long but apparently to little purpose for he frequently rose and opening a door leading to the staircase listened intently then resumed his seat  presently however he fell asleep and when he woke it was past midnight  he stirred the failing fire lifted a book from the table at his side and looked at the title  it was dennekers meditations  he opened it at random and began to read  forasmuch as it is ordained of god that all flesh hath spirit and thereby taketh on spiritual powers so also the spirit hath powers of the flesh even when it is gone out of the flesh and liveth as a thing apart as many a violence performed by wraith and lemure sheweth  and there be who say that man is not single in this but the beasts have the like evil inducement and  the reading was interrupted by a shaking of the house as by the fall of a heavy object  the reader flung down the book rushed from the room and mounted the stairs to flemings bedchamber  he tried the door but contrary to his instructions it was locked  he set his shoulder against it with such force that it gave way  on the floor near the disordered bed in his night clothes lay fleming gasping away his life  the physician raised the dying mans head from the floor and observed a wound in the throat  i should have thought of this he said believing it suicide  when the man was dead an examination disclosed the unmistakable marks of an animals fangs deeply sunken into the jugular vein  but there was no animal    a resumed identity    ithe review as a form of welcome  one summer night a man stood on a low hill overlooking a wide expanse of forest and field  by the full moon hanging low in the west he knew what he might not have known otherwise  that it was near the hour of dawn  a light mist lay along the earth partly veiling the lower features of the landscape but above it the taller trees showed in welldefined masses against a clear sky  two or three farmhouses were visible through the haze but in none of them naturally was a light  nowhere indeed was any sign or suggestion of life except the barking of a distant dog which repeated with mechanical iteration served rather to accentuate than dispel the loneliness of the scene  the man looked curiously about him on all sides as one who among familiar surroundings is unable to determine his exact place and part in the scheme of things  it is so perhaps that we shall act when risen from the dead we await the call to judgment  a hundred yards away was a straight road showing white in the moonlight  endeavoring to orient himself as a surveyor or navigator might say the man moved his eyes slowly along its visible length and at a distance of a quartermile to the south of his station saw dim and gray in the haze a group of horsemen riding to the north behind them were men afoot marching in column with dimly gleaming rifles aslant above their shoulders  they moved slowly and in silence  another group of horsemen another regiment of infantry another and anotherall in unceasing motion toward the mans point of view past it and beyond  a battery of artillery followed the cannoneers riding with folded arms on limber and caisson  and still the interminable procession came out of the obscurity to south and passed into the obscurity to north with never a sound of voice nor hoof nor wheel  the man could not rightly understand  he thought himself deaf said so and heard his own voice although it had an unfamiliar quality that almost alarmed him it disappointed his ears expectancy in the matter of timbre and resonance  but he was not deaf and that for the moment sufficed  then he remembered that there are natural phenomena to which some one has given the name acoustic shadows  if you stand in an acoustic shadow there is one direction from which you will hear nothing  at the battle of gainess mill one of the fiercest conflicts of the civil war with a hundred guns in play spectators a mile and a half away on the opposite side of the chickahominy valley heard nothing of what they clearly saw  the bombardment of port royal heard and felt at st  augustine a hundred and fifty miles to the south was inaudible two miles to the north in a still atmosphere  a few days before the surrender at appomattox a thunderous engagement between the commands of sheridan and pickett was unknown to the latter commander a mile in the rear of his own line  these instances were not known to the man of whom we write but less striking ones of the same character had not escaped his observation he was profoundly disquieted but for another reason than the uncanny silence of that moonlight march  good lord he said to himselfand again it was as if another had spoken his thoughtif those people are what i take them to be we have lost the battle and they are moving on nashville  then came a thought of selfan apprehensiona strong sense of personal peril such as in another we call fear  he stepped quickly into the shadow of a tree  and still the silent battalions moved slowly forward in the haze  the chill of a sudden breeze upon the back of his neck drew his attention to the quarter whence it came and turning to the east he saw a faint gray light along the horizonthe first sign of returning day  this increased his apprehension  i must get away from here he thought or i shall be discovered and taken  he moved out of the shadow walking rapidly toward the graying east from the safer seclusion of a clump of cedars he looked back  the entire column had passed out of sight  the straight white road lay bare and desolate in the moonlight  puzzled before he was now inexpressibly astonished  so swift a passing of so slow an armyhe could not comprehend it  minute after minute passed unnoted he had lost his sense of time  he sought with a terrible earnestness a solution of the mystery but sought in vain  when at last he roused himself from his abstraction the suns rim was visible above the hills but in the new conditions he found no other light than that of day his understanding was involved as darkly in doubt as before  on every side lay cultivated fields showing no sign of war and wars ravages  from the chimneys of the farmhouses thin ascensions of blue smoke signaled preparations for a days peaceful toil  having stilled its immemorial allocution to the moon the watchdog was assisting a negro who prefixing a team of mules to the plow was flatting and sharping contentedly at his task  the hero of this tale stared stupidly at the pastoral picture as if he had never seen such a thing in all his life then he put his hand to his head passed it through his hair and withdrawing it attentively considered the palma singular thing to do  apparently reassured by the act he walked confidently toward the road   iiwhen you have lost your life consult a physician   dr stilling malson of murfreesboro having visited a patient six or seven miles away on the nashville road had remained with him all night  at daybreak he set out for home on horseback as was the custom of doctors of the time and region  he had passed into the neighborhood of stones river battlefield when a man approached him from the roadside and saluted in the military fashion with a movement of the right hand to the hatbrim  but the hat was not a military hat the man was not in uniform and had not a martial bearing  the doctor nodded civilly half thinking that the strangers uncommon greeting was perhaps in deference to the historic surroundings  as the stranger evidently desired speech with him he courteously reined in his horse and waited  sir said the stranger although a civilian you are perhaps an enemy  i am a physician was the noncommittal reply  thank you said the other  i am a lieutenant of the staff of general hazen  he paused a moment and looked sharply at the person whom he was addressing then added of the federal army  the physician merely nodded  kindly tell me continued the other what has happened here where are the armies  which has won the battle  the physician regarded his questioner curiously with halfshut eyes after a professional scrutiny prolonged to the limit of politeness pardon me he said one asking information should be willing to impart it  are you wounded he added smiling  not seriouslyit seems  the man removed the unmilitary hat put his hand to his head passed it through his hair and withdrawing it attentively considered the palm  i was struck by a bullet and have been unconscious  it must have been a light glancing blow  i find no blood and feel no pain  i will not trouble you for treatment but will you kindly direct me to my commandto any part of the federal armyif you know  again the doctor did not immediately reply  he was recalling much that is recorded in the books of his professionsomething about lost identity and the effect of familiar scenes in restoring it  at length he looked the man in the face smiled and said  lieutenant you are not wearing the uniform of your rank and service  at this the man glanced down at his civilian attire lifted his eyes and said with hesitation  that is true  ii dont quite understand  still regarding him sharply but not unsympathetically the man of science bluntly inquired  how old are you  twentythreeif that has anything to do with it  you dont look it i should hardly have guessed you to be just that  the man was growing impatient  we need not discuss that he said i want to know about the army  not two hours ago i saw a column of troops moving northward on this road  you must have met them  be good enough to tell me the color of their clothing which i was unable to make out and ill trouble you no more  you are quite sure that you saw them  sure  my god sir i could have counted them  why really said the physician with an amusing consciousness of his own resemblance to the loquacious barber of the arabian nights this is very interesting  i met no troops  the man looked at him coldly as if he had himself observed the likeness to the barber  it is plain he said that you do not care to assist me  sir you may go to the devil  he turned and strode away very much at random across the dewy fields his halfpenitent tormentor quietly watching him from his point of vantage in the saddle till he disappeared beyond an array of trees   iiithe danger of looking into a pool of water   after leaving the road the man slackened his pace and now went forward rather deviously with a distinct feeling of fatigue  he could not account for this though truly the interminable loquacity of that country doctor offered itself in explanation  seating himself upon a rock he laid one hand upon his knee back upward and casually looked at it  it was lean and withered  he lifted both hands to his face  it was seamed and furrowed he could trace the lines with the tips of his fingers  how strangea mere bullet stroke and a brief unconsciousness should not make one a physical wreck  i must have been a long time in hospital he said aloud  why what a fool i am  the battle was in december and it is now summer he laughed  no wonder that fellow thought me an escaped lunatic he was wrong  i am only an escaped patient  at a little distance a small plot of ground enclosed by a stone wall caught his attention  with no very definite intent he rose and went to it  in the center was a square solid monument of hewn stone  it was brown with age weatherworn at the angles spotted with moss and lichen  between the massive blocks were strips of grass the leverage of whose roots had pushed them apart  in answer to the challenge of this ambitious structure time had laid his destroying hand upon it and it would soon be one with nineveh and tyre  in an inscription on one side his eye caught a familiar name  shaking with excitement he craned his body across the wall and read   hazens brigade to the memory of its soldiers who fell at stone river dec 31 1862   the man fell back from the wall faint and sick  almost within an arms length was a little depression in the earth it had been filled by a recent raina pool of clear water  he crept to it to revive himself lifted the upper part of his body on his trembling arms thrust forward his head and saw the reflection of his face as in a mirror  he uttered a terrible cry  his arms gave way he fell face downward into the pool and yielded up the life that had spanned another life    a baby tramp    if you had seen little jo standing at the street corner in the rain you would hardly have admired him  it was apparently an ordinary autumn rainstorm but the water which fell upon jo who was hardly old enough to be either just or unjust and so perhaps did not come under the law of impartial distribution appeared to have some property peculiar to itself  one would have said it was dark and adhesivesticky  but that could hardly be so even in blackburg where things certainly did occur that were a good deal out of the common  for example ten or twelve years before a shower of small frogs had fallen as is credibly attested by a contemporaneous chronicle the record concluding with a somewhat obscure statement to the effect that the chronicler considered it good growingweather for frenchmen  some years later blackburg had a fall of crimson snow it is cold in blackburg when winter is on and the snows are frequent and deep there can be no doubt of itthe snow in this instance was of the color of blood and melted into water of the same hue if water it was not blood  the phenomenon had attracted wide attention and science had as many explanations as there were scientists who knew nothing about it  but the men of blackburgmen who for many years had lived right there where the red snow fell and might be supposed to know a good deal about the mattershook their heads and said something would come of it  and something did for the next summer was made memorable by the prevalence of a mysterious diseaseepidemic endemic or the lord knows what though the physicians didntwhich carried away a full half of the population  most of the other half carried themselves away and were slow to return but finally came back and were now increasing and multiplying as before but blackburg had not since been altogether the same  of quite another kind though equally out of the common was the incident of hetty parlows ghost  hetty parlows maiden name had been brownon and in blackburg that meant more than one would think  the brownons had from time immemorialfrom the very earliest of the old colonial daysbeen the leading family of the town  it was the richest and it was the best and blackburg would have shed the last drop of its plebeian blood in defense of the brownon fair fame  as few of the familys members had ever been known to live permanently away from blackburg although most of them were educated elsewhere and nearly all had traveled there was quite a number of them  the men held most of the public offices and the women were foremost in all good works  of these latter hetty was most beloved by reason of the sweetness of her disposition the purity of her character and her singular personal beauty  she married in boston a young scapegrace named parlow and like a good brownon brought him to blackburg forthwith and made a man and a town councilman of him  they had a child which they named joseph and dearly loved as was then the fashion among parents in all that region  then they died of the mysterious disorder already mentioned and at the age of one whole year joseph set up as an orphan  unfortunately for joseph the disease which had cut off his parents did not stop at that it went on and extirpated nearly the whole brownon contingent and its allies by marriage and those who fled did not return  the tradition was broken the brownon estates passed into alien hands and the only brownons remaining in that place were underground in oak hill cemetery where indeed was a colony of them powerful enough to resist the encroachment of surrounding tribes and hold the best part of the grounds  but about the ghost  one night about three years after the death of hetty parlow a number of the young people of blackburg were passing oak hill cemetery in a wagonif you have been there you will remember that the road to greenton runs alongside it on the south  they had been attending a may day festival at greenton and that serves to fix the date  altogether there may have been a dozen and a jolly party they were considering the legacy of gloom left by the towns recent somber experiences  as they passed the cemetery the man driving suddenly reined in his team with an exclamation of surprise  it was sufficiently surprising no doubt for just ahead and almost at the roadside though inside the cemetery stood the ghost of hetty parlow  there could be no doubt of it for she had been personally known to every youth and maiden in the party  that established the things identity its character as ghost was signified by all the customary signsthe shroud the long undone hair the faraway lookeverything  this disquieting apparition was stretching out its arms toward the west as if in supplication for the evening star which certainly was an alluring object though obviously out of reach  as they all sat silent so the story goes every member of that party of merrymakersthey had merrymade on coffee and lemonade onlydistinctly heard that ghost call the name joey joey  a moment later nothing was there  of course one does not have to believe all that  now at that moment as was afterward ascertained joey was wandering about in the sagebrush on the opposite side of the continent near winnemucca in the state of nevada  he had been taken to that town by some good persons distantly related to his dead father and by them adopted and tenderly cared for  but on that evening the poor child had strayed from home and was lost in the desert  his after history is involved in obscurity and has gaps which conjecture alone can fill  it is known that he was found by a family of piute indians who kept the little wretch with them for a time and then sold himactually sold him for money to a woman on one of the eastbound trains at a station a long way from winnemucca  the woman professed to have made all manner of inquiries but all in vain  so being childless and a widow she adopted him herself  at this point of his career jo seemed to be getting a long way from the condition of orphanage the interposition of a multitude of parents between himself and that woeful state promised him a long immunity from its disadvantages  mrs darnell his newest mother lived in cleveland ohio  but her adopted son did not long remain with her  he was seen one afternoon by a policeman new to that beat deliberately toddling away from her house and being questioned answered that he was a doin home  he must have traveled by rail somehow for three days later he was in the town of whiteville which as you know is a long way from blackburg  his clothing was in pretty fair condition but he was sinfully dirty  unable to give any account of himself he was arrested as a vagrant and sentenced to imprisonment in the infants sheltering homewhere he was washed  jo ran away from the infants sheltering home at whitevillejust took to the woods one day and the home knew him no more forever  we find him next or rather get back to him standing forlorn in the cold autumn rain at a suburban street corner in blackburg and it seems right to explain now that the raindrops falling upon him there were really not dark and gummy they only failed to make his face and hands less so  jo was indeed fearfully and wonderfully besmirched as by the hand of an artist  and the forlorn little tramp had no shoes his feet were bare red and swollen and when he walked he limped with both legs  as to clothingah you would hardly have had the skill to name any single garment that he wore or say by what magic he kept it upon him  that he was cold all over and all through did not admit of a doubt he knew it himself  anyone would have been cold there that evening but for that reason no one else was there how jo came to be there himself he could not for the flickering little life of him have told even if gifted with a vocabulary exceeding a hundred words  from the way he stared about him one could have seen that he had not the faintest notion of where nor why he was  yet he was not altogether a fool in his day and generation being cold and hungry and still able to walk a little by bending his knees very much indeed and putting his feet down toes first he decided to enter one of the houses which flanked the street at long intervals and looked so bright and warm  but when he attempted to act upon that very sensible decision a burly dog came bowsing out and disputed his right  inexpressibly frightened and believing no doubt with some reason too that brutes without meant brutality within he hobbled away from all the houses and with gray wet fields to right of him and gray wet fields to left of himwith the rain half blinding him and the night coming in mist and darkness held his way along the road that leads to greenton  that is to say the road leads those to greenton who succeed in passing the oak hill cemetery a considerable number every year do not  jo did not  they found him there the next morning very wet very cold but no longer hungry  he had apparently entered the cemetery gatehoping perhaps that it led to a house where there was no dogand gone blundering about in the darkness falling over many a grave no doubt until he had tired of it all and given up  the little body lay upon one side with one soiled cheek upon one soiled hand the other hand tucked away among the rags to make it warm the other cheek washed clean and white at last as for a kiss from one of gods great angels  it was observedthough nothing was thought of it at the time the body being as yet unidentifiedthat the little fellow was lying upon the grave of hetty parlow  the grave however had not opened to receive him  that is a circumstance which without actual irreverence one may wish had been ordered otherwise    the nightdoings at deadmans a story that is untrue    it was a singularly sharp night and clear as the heart of a diamond clear nights have a trick of being keen  in darkness you may be cold and not know it when you see you suffer  this night was bright enough to bite like a serpent  the moon was moving mysteriously along behind the giant pines crowning the south mountain striking a cold sparkle from the crusted snow and bringing out against the black west the ghostly outlines of the coast range beyond which lay the invisible pacific  the snow had piled itself in the open spaces along the bottom of the gulch into long ridges that seemed to heave and into hills that appeared to toss and scatter spray  the spray was sunlight twice reflected  dashed once from the moon once from the snow  in this snow many of the shanties of the abandoned mining camp were obliterated a sailor might have said they had gone down and at irregular intervals it had overtopped the tall trestles which had once supported a river called a flume for of course flume is flumen  among the advantages of which the mountains cannot deprive the goldhunter is the privilege of speaking latin  he says of his dead neighbor he has gone up the flume  this is not a bad way to say his life has returned to the fountain of life  while putting on its armor against the assaults of the wind this snow had neglected no coign of vantage  snow pursued by the wind is not wholly unlike a retreating army  in the open field it ranges itself in ranks and battalions where it can get a foothold it makes a stand where it can take cover it does so  you may see whole platoons of snow cowering behind a bit of broken wall  the devious old road hewn out of the mountain side was full of it  squadron upon squadron had struggled to escape by this line when suddenly pursuit had ceased  a more desolate and dreary spot than deadmans gulch in a winter midnight it is impossible to imagine  yet mr hiram beeson elected to live there the sole inhabitant  away up the side of the north mountain his little pinelog shanty projected from its single pane of glass a long thin beam of light and looked not altogether unlike a black beetle fastened to the hillside with a bright new pin  within it sat mr beeson himself before a roaring fire staring into its hot heart as if he had never before seen such a thing in all his life  he was not a comely man he was gray he was ragged and slovenly in his attire his face was wan and haggard his eyes were too bright  as to his age if one had attempted to guess it one might have said fortyseven then corrected himself and said seventyfour  he was really twentyeight emaciated he was as much perhaps as he dared be with a needy undertaker at bentleys flat and a new and enterprising coroner at sonora  poverty and zeal are an upper and a nether millstone  it is dangerous to make a third in that kind of sandwich  as mr beeson sat there with his ragged elbows on his ragged knees his lean jaws buried in his lean hands and with no apparent intention of going to bed he looked as if the slightest movement would tumble him to pieces  yet during the last hour he had winked no fewer than three times  there was a sharp rapping at the door  a rap at that time of night and in that weather might have surprised an ordinary mortal who had dwelt two years in the gulch without seeing a human face and could not fail to know that the country was impassable but mr beeson did not so much as pull his eyes out of the coals  and even when the door was pushed open he only shrugged a little more closely into himself as one does who is expecting something that he would rather not see  you may observe this movement in women when in a mortuary chapel the coffin is borne up the aisle behind them  but when a long old man in a blanket overcoat his head tied up in a handkerchief and nearly his entire face in a muffler wearing green goggles and with a complexion of glittering whiteness where it could be seen strode silently into the room laying a hard gloved hand on mr beesons shoulder the latter so far forgot himself as to look up with an appearance of no small astonishment whomever he may have been expecting he had evidently not counted on meeting anyone like this  nevertheless the sight of this unexpected guest produced in mr beeson the following sequence  a feeling of astonishment a sense of gratification a sentiment of profound good will  rising from his seat he took the knotty hand from his shoulder and shook it up and down with a fervor quite unaccountable for in the old mans aspect was nothing to attract much to repel  however attraction is too general a property for repulsion to be without it the most attractive object in the world is the face we instinctively cover with a cloth  when it becomes still more attractive fascinatingwe put seven feet of earth above it  sir said mr beeson releasing the old mans hand which fell passively against his thigh with a quiet clack it is an extremely disagreeable night  pray be seated i am very glad to see you  mr beeson spoke with an easy good breeding that one would hardly have expected considering all things  indeed the contrast between his appearance and his manner was sufficiently surprising to be one of the commonest of social phenomena in the mines  the old man advanced a step toward the fire glowing cavernously in the green goggles  mr beeson resumed  you bet your life i am  mr beesons elegance was not too refined it had made reasonable concessions to local taste  he paused a moment letting his eyes drop from the muffled head of his guest down along the row of moldy buttons confining the blanket overcoat to the greenish cowhide boots powdered with snow which had begun to melt and run along the floor in little rills  he took an inventory of his guest and appeared satisfied  who would not have been  then he continued  the cheer i can offer you is unfortunately in keeping with my surroundings but i shall esteem myself highly favored if it is your pleasure to partake of it rather than seek better at bentleys flat  with a singular refinement of hospitable humility mr beeson spoke as if a sojourn in his warm cabin on such a night as compared with walking fourteen miles up to the throat in snow with a cutting crust would be an intolerable hardship  by way of reply his guest unbuttoned the blanket overcoat  the host laid fresh fuel on the fire swept the hearth with the tail of a wolf and added  but i think youd better skedaddle  the old man took a seat by the fire spreading his broad soles to the heat without removing his hat  in the mines the hat is seldom removed except when the boots are  without further remark mr beeson also seated himself in a chair which had been a barrel and which retaining much of its original character seemed to have been designed with a view to preserving his dust if it should please him to crumble  for a moment there was silence then from somewhere among the pines came the snarling yelp of a coyote and simultaneously the door rattled in its frame  there was no other connection between the two incidents than that the coyote has an aversion to storms and the wind was rising yet there seemed somehow a kind of supernatural conspiracy between the two and mr beeson shuddered with a vague sense of terror  he recovered himself in a moment and again addressed his guest  there are strange doings here  i will tell you everything and then if you decide to go i shall hope to accompany you over the worst of the way as far as where baldy peterson shot ben hikei dare say you know the place  the old man nodded emphatically as intimating not merely that he did but that he did indeed  two years ago began mr beeson i with two companions occupied this house but when the rush to the flat occurred we left along with the rest  in ten hours the gulch was deserted  that evening however i discovered i had left behind me a valuable pistol that is it and returned for it passing the night here alone as i have passed every night since  i must explain that a few days before we left our chinese domestic had the misfortune to die while the ground was frozen so hard that it was impossible to dig a grave in the usual way  so on the day of our hasty departure we cut through the floor there and gave him such burial as we could  but before putting him down i had the extremely bad taste to cut off his pigtail and spike it to that beam above his grave where you may see it at this moment or preferably when warmth has given you leisure for observation  i stated did i not that the chinaman came to his death from natural causes  i had of course nothing to do with that and returned through no irresistible attraction or morbid fascination but only because i had forgotten a pistol  this is clear to you is it not sir  the visitor nodded gravely  he appeared to be a man of few words if any  mr beeson continued  according to the chinese faith a man is like a kite  he cannot go to heaven without a tail  well to shorten this tedious story which however i thought it my duty to relateon that night while i was here alone and thinking of anything but him that chinaman came back for his pigtail  he did not get it  at this point mr beeson relapsed into blank silence  perhaps he was fatigued by the unwonted exercise of speaking perhaps he had conjured up a memory that demanded his undivided attention  the wind was now fairly abroad and the pines along the mountainside sang with singular distinctness  the narrator continued  you say you do not see much in that and i must confess i do not myself  but he keeps coming  there was another long silence during which both stared into the fire without the movement of a limb  then mr beeson broke out almost fiercely fixing his eyes on what he could see of the impassive face of his auditor  give it him  sir in this matter i have no intention of troubling anyone for advice  you will pardon me i am surehere he became singularly persuasivebut i have ventured to nail that pigtail fast and have assumed the somewhat onerous obligation of guarding it  so it is quite impossible to act on your considerate suggestion  do you play me for a modoc  nothing could exceed the sudden ferocity with which he thrust this indignant remonstrance into the ear of his guest  it was as if he had struck him on the side of the head with a steel gauntlet  it was a protest but it was a challenge  to be mistaken for a cowardto be played for a modoc  these two expressions are one  sometimes it is a chinaman  do you play me for a chinaman is a question frequently addressed to the ear of the suddenly dead  mr beesons buffet produced no effect and after a moments pause during which the wind thundered in the chimney like the sound of clods upon a coffin he resumed  but as you say it is wearing me out  i feel that the life of the last two years has been a mistakea mistake that corrects itself you see how  the grave  no there is no one to dig it  the ground is frozen too  but you are very welcome  you may say at bentleys but that is not important  it was very tough to cut  they braid silk into their pigtails  kwaagh  mr beeson was speaking with his eyes shut and he wandered  his last word was a snore  a moment later he drew a long breath opened his eyes with an effort made a single remark and fell into a deep sleep  what he said was this  they are swiping my dust  then the aged stranger who had not uttered one word since his arrival arose from his seat and deliberately laid off his outer clothing looking as angular in his flannels as the late signorina festorazzi an irish woman six feet in height and weighing fifty six pounds who used to exhibit herself in her chemise to the people of san francisco  he then crept into one of the bunks having first placed a revolver in easy reach according to the custom of the country  this revolver he took from a shelf and it was the one which mr beeson had mentioned as that for which he had returned to the gulch two years before  in a few moments mr beeson awoke and seeing that his guest had retired he did likewise  but before doing so he approached the long plaited wisp of pagan hair and gave it a powerful tug to assure himself that it was fast and firm  the two bedsmere shelves covered with blankets not overcleanfaced each other from opposite sides of the room the little square trapdoor that had given access to the chinamans grave being midway between  this by the way was crossed by a double row of spikeheads  in his resistance to the supernatural mr beeson had not disdained the use of material precautions  the fire was now low the flames burning bluely and petulantly with occasional flashes projecting spectral shadows on the wallsshadows that moved mysteriously about now dividing now uniting  the shadow of the pendent queue however kept moodily apart near the roof at the further end of the room looking like a note of admiration  the song of the pines outside had now risen to the dignity of a triumphal hymn  in the pauses the silence was dreadful  it was during one of these intervals that the trap in the floor began to lift  slowly and steadily it rose and slowly and steadily rose the swaddled head of the old man in the bunk to observe it  then with a clap that shook the house to its foundation it was thrown clean back where it lay with its unsightly spikes pointing threateningly upward  mr beeson awoke and without rising pressed his fingers into his eyes  he shuddered his teeth chattered  his guest was now reclining on one elbow watching the proceedings with the goggles that glowed like lamps  suddenly a howling gust of wind swooped down the chimney scattering ashes and smoke in all directions for a moment obscuring everything when the firelight again illuminated the room there was seen sitting gingerly on the edge of a stool by the hearthside a swarthy little man of prepossessing appearance and dressed with faultless taste nodding to the old man with a friendly and engaging smile  from san francisco evidently thought mr beeson who having somewhat recovered from his fright was groping his way to a solution of the evenings events  but now another actor appeared upon the scene  out of the square black hole in the middle of the floor protruded the head of the departed chinaman his glassy eyes turned upward in their angular slits and fastened on the dangling queue above with a look of yearning unspeakable  mr beeson groaned and again spread his hands upon his face  a mild odor of opium pervaded the place  the phantom clad only in a short blue tunic quilted and silken but covered with gravemold rose slowly as if pushed by a weak spiral spring  its knees were at the level of the floor when with a quick upward impulse like the silent leaping of a flame it grasped the queue with both hands drew up its body and took the tip in its horrible yellow teeth  to this it clung in a seeming frenzy grimacing ghastly surging and plunging from side to side in its efforts to disengage its property from the beam but uttering no sound  it was like a corpse artificially convulsed by means of a galvanic battery  the contrast between its superhuman activity and its silence was no less than hideous  mr beeson cowered in his bed  the swarthy little gentleman uncrossed his legs beat an impatient tattoo with the toe of his boot and consulted a heavy gold watch  the old man sat erect and quietly laid hold of the revolver  bang  like a body cut from the gallows the chinaman plumped into the black hole below carrying his tail in his teeth  the trapdoor turned over shutting down with a snap  the swarthy little gentleman from san francisco sprang nimbly from his perch caught something in the air with his hat as a boy catches a butterfly and vanished into the chimney as if drawn up by suction  from away somewhere in the outer darkness floated in through the open door a faint far crya long sobbing wail as of a child death strangled in the desert or a lost soul borne away by the adversary it may have been the coyote  in the early days of the following spring a party of miners on their way to new diggings passed along the gulch and straying through the deserted shanties found in one of them the body of hiram beeson stretched upon a bunk with a bullet hole through the heart  the ball had evidently been fired from the opposite side of the room for in one of the oaken beams overhead was a shallow blue dint where it had struck a knot and been deflected downward to the breast of its victim  strongly attached to the same beam was what appeared to be an end of a rope of braided horsehair which had been cut by the bullet in its passage to the knot  nothing else of interest was noted excepting a suit of moldy and incongruous clothing several articles of which were afterward identified by respectable witnesses as those in which certain deceased citizens of deadmans had been buried years before  but it is not easy to understand how that could be unless indeed the garments had been worn as a disguise by death himselfwhich is hardly credible    beyond the wall    many years ago on my way from hongkong to new york i assed a week in san francisco  a long time had gone by since i had been in that city during which my ventures in the orient had prospered beyond my hope i was rich and could afford to revisit my own country to renew my friendship with such of the companions of my youth as still lived and remembered me with the old affection  chief of these i hoped was mohun dampier an old schoolmate with whom i had held a desultory correspondence which had long ceased as is the way of correspondence between men  you may have observed that the indisposition to write a merely social letter is in the ratio of the square of the distance between you and your correspondent  it is a law  i remembered dampier as a handsome strong young fellow of scholarly tastes with an aversion to work and a marked indifference to many of the things that the world cares for including wealth of which however he had inherited enough to put him beyond the reach of want in his family one of the oldest and most aristocratic in the country it was i think a matter of pride that no member of it had ever been in trade nor politics nor suffered any kind of distinction  mohun was a trifle sentimental and had in him a singular element of superstition which led him to the study of all manner of occult subjects although his sane mental health safeguarded him against fantastic and perilous faiths  he made daring incursions into the realm of the unreal without renouncing his residence in the partly surveyed and charted region of what we are pleased to call certitude  the night of my visit to him was stormy  the californian winter was on and the incessant rain plashed in the deserted streets or lifted by irregular gusts of wind was hurled against the houses with incredible fury  with no small difficulty my cabman found the right place away out toward the ocean beach in a sparsely populated suburb  the dwelling a rather ugly one apparently stood in the center of its grounds which as nearly as i could make out in the gloom were destitute of either flowers or grass  three or four trees writhing and moaning in the torment of the tempest appeared to be trying to escape from their dismal environment and take the chance of finding a better one out at sea  the house was a twostory brick structure with a tower a story higher at one corner  in a window of that was the only visible light  something in the appearance of the place made me shudder a performance that may have been assisted by a rill of rainwater down my back as i scuttled to cover in the doorway  in answer to my note apprising him of my wish to call dampier had written dont ringopen the door and come up  i did so  the staircase was dimly lighted by a single gasjet at the top of the second flight  i managed to reach the landing without disaster and entered by an open door into the lighted square room of the tower dampier came forward in gown and slippers to receive me giving me the greeting that i wished and if i had held a thought that it might more fitly have been accorded me at the front door the first look at him dispelled any sense of his inhospitality  he was not the same  hardly past middle age he had gone gray and had acquired a pronounced stoop  his figure was thin and angular his face deeply lined his complexion deadwhite without a touch of color  his eyes unnaturally large glowed with a fire that was almost uncanny  he seated me proffered a cigar and with grave and obvious sincerity assured me of the pleasure that it gave him to meet me  some unimportant conversation followed but all the while i was dominated by a melancholy sense of the great change in him  this he must have perceived for he suddenly said with a bright enough smile you are disappointed in menon sum qualis eram  i hardly knew what to reply but managed to say  why really i dont know  your latin is about the same  he brightened again  no he said being a dead language it grows in appropriateness  but please have the patience to wait  where i am going there is perhaps a better tongue  will you care to have a message in it  the smile faded as he spoke and as he concluded he was looking into my eyes with a gravity that distressed me  yet i would not surrender myself to his mood nor permit him to see how deeply his prescience of death affected me  i fancy that it will be long i said before human speech will cease to serve our need and then the need with its possibilities of service will have passed  he made no reply and i too was silent for the talk had taken a dispiriting turn yet i knew not how to give it a more agreeable character  suddenly in a pause of the storm when the dead silence was almost startling by contrast with the previous uproar i heard a gentle tapping which appeared to come from the wall behind my chair the sound was such as might have been made by a human hand not as upon a door by one asking admittance but rather i thought as an agreed signal an assurance of someones presence in an adjoining room most of us i fancy have had more experience of such communications than we should care to relate  i glanced at dampier if possibly there was something of amusement in the look he did not observe it  he appeared to have forgotten my presence and was staring at the wall behind me with an expression in his eyes that i am unable to name although my memory of it is as vivid today as was my sense of it then  the situation was embarrassing i rose to take my leave  at this he seemed to recover himself  please be seated he said it is nothingno one is there  but the tapping was repeated and with the same gentle slow insistence as before  pardon me i said it is late  may i call tomorrow  he smileda little mechanically i thought  it is very delicate of you said he but quite needless  really this is the only room in the tower and no one is there  at least he left the sentence incomplete rose and threw up a window the only opening in the wall from which the sound seemed to come  see  not clearly knowing what else to do i followed him to the window and looked out  a streetlamp some little distance away gave enough light through the murk of the rain that was again falling in torrents to make it entirely plain that no one was there  in truth there was nothing but the sheer blank wall of the tower  dampier closed the window and signing me to my seat resumed his own  the incident was not in itself particularly mysterious any one of a dozen explanations was possible though none has occurred to me yet it impressed me strangely the more perhaps from my friends effort to reassure me which seemed to dignify it with a certain significance and importance  he had proved that no one was there but in that fact lay all the interest and he proffered no explanation  his silence was irritating and made me resentful  my good friend i said somewhat ironically i fear i am not disposed to question your right to harbor as many spooks as you find agreeable to your taste and consistent with your notions of companionship that is no business of mine  but being just a plain man of affairs mostly of this world i find spooks needless to my peace and comfort  i am going to my hotel where my fellowguests are still in the flesh  it was not a very civil speech but he manifested no feeling about it  kindly remain he said  i am grateful for your presence here  what you have heard tonight i believe myself to have heard twice before  now i know it was no illusion  that is much to me more than you know  have a fresh cigar and a good stock of patience while i tell you the story  the rain was now falling more steadily with a low monotonous susurration interrupted at long intervals by the sudden slashing of the boughs of the trees as the wind rose and failed  the night was well advanced but both sympathy and curiosity held me a willing listener to my friends monologue which i did not interrupt by a single word from beginning to end  ten years ago he said i occupied a groundfloor apartment in one of a row of houses all alike away at the other end of the town on what we call rincon hill  this had been the best quarter of san francisco but had fallen into neglect and decay partly because the primitive character of its domestic architecture no longer suited the maturing tastes of our wealthy citizens partly because certain public improvements had made a wreck of it  the row of dwellings in one of which i lived stood a little way back from the street each having a miniature garden separated from its neighbors by low iron fences and bisected with mathematical precision by a boxbordered gravel walk from gate to door  one morning as i was leaving my lodging i observed a young girl entering the adjoining garden on the left  it was a warm day in june and she was lightly gowned in white  from her shoulders hung a broad straw hat profusely decorated with flowers and wonderfully beribboned in the fashion of the time  my attention was not long held by the exquisite simplicity of her costume for no one could look at her face and think of anything earthly  do not fear i shall not profane it by description it was beautiful exceedingly  all that i had ever seen or dreamed of loveliness was in that matchless living picture by the hand of the divine artist  so deeply did it move me that without a thought of the impropriety of the act i unconsciously bared my head as a devout catholic or wellbred protestant uncovers before an image of the blessed virgin  the maiden showed no displeasure she merely turned her glorious dark eyes upon me with a look that made me catch my breath and without other recognition of my act passed into the house  for a moment i stood motionless hat in hand painfully conscious of my rudeness yet so dominated by the emotion inspired by that vision of incomparable beauty that my penitence was less poignant than it should have been  then i went my way leaving my heart behind  in the natural course of things i should probably have remained away until nightfall but by the middle of the afternoon i was back in the little garden affecting an interest in the few foolish flowers that i had never before observed  my hope was vain she did not appear  to a night of unrest succeeded a day of expectation and disappointment but on the day after as i wandered aimlessly about the neighborhood i met her  of course i did not repeat my folly of uncovering nor venture by even so much as too long a look to manifest an interest in her yet my heart was beating audibly  i trembled and consciously colored as she turned her big black eyes upon me with a look of obvious recognition entirely devoid of boldness or coquetry  i will not weary you with particulars many times afterward i met the maiden yet never either addressed her or sought to fix her attention  nor did i take any action toward making her acquaintance perhaps my forbearance requiring so supreme an effort of self denial will not be entirely clear to you  that i was heels over head in love is true but who can overcome his habit of thought or reconstruct his character  i was what some foolish persons are pleased to call and others more foolish are pleased to be calledan aristocrat and despite her beauty her charms and graces the girl was not of my class  i had learned her namewhich it is needless to speakand something of her family  she was an orphan a dependent niece of the impossible elderly fat woman in whose lodginghouse she lived  my income was small and i lacked the talent for marrying it is perhaps a gift  an alliance with that family would condemn me to its manner of life part me from my books and studies and in a social sense reduce me to the ranks  it is easy to deprecate such considerations as these and i have not retained myself for the defense  let judgment be entered against me but in strict justice all my ancestors for generations should be made codefendants and i be permitted to plead in mitigation of punishment the imperious mandate of heredity  to a mesalliance of that kind every globule of my ancestral blood spoke in opposition  in brief my tastes habits instinct with whatever of reason my love had left meall fought against it  moreover i was an irreclaimable sentimentalist and found a subtle charm in an impersonal and spiritual relation which acquaintance might vulgarize and marriage would certainly dispel  no woman i argued is what this lovely creature seems  love is a delicious dream why should i bring about my own awakening  the course dictated by all this sense and sentiment was obvious honor pride prudence preservation of my idealsall commanded me to go away but for that i was too weak  the utmost that i could do by a mighty effort of will was to cease meeting the girl and that i did  i even avoided the chance encounters of the garden leaving my lodging only when i knew that she had gone to her music lessons and returning after nightfall  yet all the while i was as one in a trance indulging the most fascinating fancies and ordering my entire intellectual life in accordance with my dream  ah my friend as one whose actions have a traceable relation to reason you cannot know the fools paradise in which i lived  one evening the devil put it into my head to be an unspeakable idiot  by apparently careless and purposeless questioning i learned from my gossipy landlady that the young womans bedroom adjoined my own a partywall between  yielding to a sudden and coarse impulse i gently rapped on the wall  there was no response naturally but i was in no mood to accept a rebuke  a madness was upon me and i repeated the folly the offense but again ineffectually and i had the decency to desist  an hour later while absorbed in some of my infernal studies i heard or thought i heard my signal answered  flinging down my books i sprang to the wall and as steadily as my beating heart would permit gave three slow taps upon it  this time the response was distinct unmistakable  one two threean exact repetition of my signal  that was all i could elicit but it was enoughtoo much  the next evening and for many evenings afterward that folly went on i always having the last word  during the whole period i was deliriously happy but with the perversity of my nature i persevered in my resolution not to see her  then as i should have expected i got no further answers  she is disgusted i said to myself with what she thinks my timidity in making no more definite advances and i resolved to seek her and make her acquaintance andwhat  i did not know nor do i now know what might have come of it  i know only that i passed days and days trying to meet her and all in vain she was invisible as well as inaudible  i haunted the streets where we had met but she did not come  from my window i watched the garden in front of her house but she passed neither in nor out  i fell into the deepest dejection believing that she had gone away yet took no steps to resolve my doubt by inquiry of my landlady to whom indeed i had taken an unconquerable aversion from her having once spoken of the girl with less of reverence than i thought befitting  there came a fateful night  worn out with emotion irresolution and despondency i had retired early and fallen into such sleep as was still possible to me  in the middle of the night somethingsome malign power bent upon the wrecking of my peace forevercaused me to open my eyes and sit up wide awake and listening intently for i knew not what  then i thought i heard a faint tapping on the wallthe mere ghost of the familiar signal  in a few moments it was repeated one two threeno louder than before but addressing a sense alert and strained to receive it  i was about to reply when the adversary of peace again intervened in my affairs with a rascally suggestion of retaliation  she had long and cruelly ignored me now i would ignore her  incredible fatuitymay god forgive it  all the rest of the night i lay awake fortifying my obstinacy with shameless justifications andlistening  late the next morning as i was leaving the house i met my landlady entering  good morning mr dampier she said  have you heard the news  i replied in words that i had heard no news in manner that i did not care to hear any  the manner escaped her observation  about the sick young lady next door she babbled on  what you did not know  why she has been ill for weeks  and now  i almost sprang upon her  and now i cried now what  she is dead  that is not the whole story  in the middle of the night as i learned later the patient awakening from a long stupor after a week of delirium had askedit was her last utterancethat her bed be moved to the opposite side of the room  those in attendance had thought the request a vagary of her delirium but had complied  and there the poor passing soul had exerted its failing will to restore a broken connectiona golden thread of sentiment between its innocence and a monstrous baseness owning a blind brutal allegiance to the law of self  what reparation could i make  are there masses that can be said for the repose of souls that are abroad such nights as thisspirits blown about by the viewless windscoming in the storm and darkness with signs and portents hints of memory and presages of doom  this is the third visitation  on the first occasion i was too skeptical to do more than verify by natural methods the character of the incident on the second i responded to the signal after it had been several times repeated but without result  tonights recurrence completes the fatal triad expounded by parapelius necromantius  there is no more to tell  when dampier had finished his story i could think of nothing relevant that i cared to say and to question him would have been a hideous impertinence  i rose and bade him good night in a way to convey to him a sense of my sympathy which he silently acknowledged by a pressure of the hand  that night alone with his sorrow and remorse he passed into the unknown    a psychological shipwreck    in the summer of 1874 i was in liverpool whither i had gone on business for the mercantile house of bronson  jarrett new york  i am william jarrett my partner was zenas bronson  the firm failed last year and unable to endure the fall from affluence to poverty he died  having finished my business and feeling the lassitude and exhaustion incident to its dispatch i felt that a protracted sea voyage would be both agreeable and beneficial so instead of embarking for my return on one of the many fine passenger steamers i booked for new york on the sailing vessel morrow upon which i had shipped a large and valuable invoice of the goods i had bought  the morrow was an english ship with of course but little accommodation for passengers of whom there were only myself a young woman and her servant who was a middleaged negress  i thought it singular that a traveling english girl should be so attended but she afterward explained to me that the woman had been left with her family by a man and his wife from south carolina both of whom had died on the same day at the house of the young ladys father in devonshirea circumstance in itself sufficiently uncommon to remain rather distinctly in my memory even had it not afterward transpired in conversation with the young lady that the name of the man was william jarrett the same as my own  i knew that a branch of my family had settled in south carolina but of them and their history i was ignorant  the morrow sailed from the mouth of the mersey on the 15th of june and for several weeks we had fair breezes and unclouded skies  the skipper an admirable seaman but nothing more favored us with very little of his society except at his table and the young woman miss janette harford and i became very well acquainted  we were in truth nearly always together and being of an introspective turn of mind i often endeavored to analyze and define the novel feeling with which she inspired mea secret subtle but powerful attraction which constantly impelled me to seek her but the attempt was hopeless  i could only be sure that at least it was not love having assured myself of this and being certain that she was quite as wholehearted i ventured one evening i remember it was on the 3d of july as we sat on deck to ask her laughingly if she could assist me to resolve my psychological doubt  for a moment she was silent with averted face and i began to fear i had been extremely rude and indelicate then she fixed her eyes gravely on my own  in an instant my mind was dominated by as strange a fancy as ever entered human consciousness  it seemed as if she were looking at me not with but through those eyesfrom an immeasurable distance behind themand that a number of other persons men women and children upon whose faces i caught strangely familiar evanescent expressions clustered about her struggling with gentle eagerness to look at me through the same orbs  ship ocean skyall had vanished  i was conscious of nothing but the figures in this extraordinary and fantastic scene  then all at once darkness fell upon me and anon from out of it as to one who grows accustomed by degrees to a dimmer light my former surroundings of deck and mast and cordage slowly resolved themselves  miss harford had closed her eyes and was leaning back in her chair apparently asleep the book she had been reading open in her lap  impelled by surely i cannot say what motive i glanced at the top of the page it was a copy of that rare and curious work dennekers meditations and the ladys index finger rested on this passage  to sundry it is given to be drawn away and to be apart from the body for a season for as concerning rills which would flow across each other the weaker is borne along by the stronger so there be certain of kin whose paths intersecting their souls do bear company the while their bodies go foreappointed ways unknowing   miss harford arose shuddering the sun had sunk below the horizon but it was not cold  there was not a breath of wind there were no clouds in the sky yet not a star was visible  a hurried tramping sounded on the deck the captain summoned from below joined the first officer who stood looking at the barometer  good god i heard him exclaim  an hour later the form of janette harford invisible in the darkness and spray was torn from my grasp by the cruel vortex of the sinking ship and i fainted in the cordage of the floating mast to which i had lashed myself  it was by lamplight that i awoke  i lay in a berth amid the familiar surroundings of the stateroom of a steamer  on a couch opposite sat a man half undressed for bed reading a book  i recognized the face of my friend gordon doyle whom i had met in liverpool on the day of my embarkation when he was himself about to sail on the steamer city of prague on which he had urged me to accompany him  after some moments i now spoke his name  he simply said well and turned a leaf in his book without removing his eyes from the page  doyle i repeated did they save her  he now deigned to look at me and smiled as if amused  he evidently thought me but half awake  her  whom do you mean  janette harford  his amusement turned to amazement he stared at me fixedly saying nothing  you will tell me after a while i continued i suppose you will tell me after a while  a moment later i asked  what ship is this  doyle stared again  the steamer city of prague bound from liverpool to new york three weeks out with a broken shaft principal passenger mr gordon doyle ditto lunatic mr william jarrett  these two distinguished travelers embarked together but they are about to part it being the resolute intention of the former to pitch the latter overboard  i sat bolt upright  do you mean to say that i have been for three weeks a passenger on this steamer  yes pretty nearly this is the 3d of july  have i been ill  right as a trivet all the time and punctual at your meals  my god  doyle there is some mystery here do have the goodness to be serious  was i not rescued from the wreck of the ship morrow  doyle changed color and approaching me laid his fingers on my wrist  a moment later what do you know of janette harford he asked very calmly  first tell me what you know of her  mr doyle gazed at me for some moments as if thinking what to do then seating himself again on the couch said  why should i not  i am engaged to marry janette harford whom i met a year ago in london  her family one of the wealthiest in devonshire cut up rough about it and we elopedare eloping rather for on the day that you and i walked to the landing stage to go aboard this steamer she and her faithful servant a negress passed us driving to the ship morrow  she would not consent to go in the same vessel with me and it had been deemed best that she take a sailing vessel in order to avoid observation and lessen the risk of detection  i am now alarmed lest this cursed breaking of our machinery may detain us so long that the morrow will get to new york before us and the poor girl will not know where to go  i lay still in my berthso still i hardly breathed  but the subject was evidently not displeasing to doyle and after a short pause he resumed  by the way she is only an adopted daughter of the harfords  her mother was killed at their place by being thrown from a horse while hunting and her father mad with grief made away with himself the same day  no one ever claimed the child and after a reasonable time they adopted her  she has grown up in the belief that she is their daughter  doyle what book are you reading  oh its called dennekers meditations  its a rum lot janette gave it to me she happened to have two copies  want to see it  he tossed me the volume which opened as it fell  on one of the exposed pages was a marked passage  to sundry it is given to be drawn away and to be apart from the body for a season for as concerning rills which would flow across each other the weaker is borne along by the stronger so there be certain of kin whose paths intersecting their souls do bear company the while their bodies go foreappointed ways unknowing  she hadshe hasa singular taste in reading i managed to say mastering my agitation  yes  and now perhaps you will have the kindness to explain how you knew her name and that of the ship she sailed in  you talked of her in your sleep i said  a week later we were towed into the port of new york  but the morrow was never heard from    the middle toe of the right foot    i  it is well known that the old manton house is haunted  in all the rural district near about and even in the town of marshall a mile away not one person of unbiased mind entertains a doubt of it incredulity is confined to those opinionated persons who will be called cranks as soon as the useful word shall have penetrated the intellectual demesne of the marshall advance  the evidence that the house is haunted is of two kinds  the testimony of disinterested witnesses who have had ocular proof and that of the house itself the former may be disregarded and ruled out on any of the various grounds of objection which may be urged against it by the ingenious but facts within the observation of all are material and controlling  in the first place the manton house has been unoccupied by mortals for more than ten years and with its outbuildings is slowly falling into decaya circumstance which in itself the judicious will hardly venture to ignore  it stands a little way off the loneliest reach of the marshall and harriston road in an opening which was once a farm and is still disfigured with strips of rotting fence and half covered with brambles overrunning a stony and sterile soil long unacquainted with the plow  the house itself is in tolerably good condition though badly weatherstained and in dire need of attention from the glazier the smaller male population of the region having attested in the manner of its kind its disapproval of dwelling without dwellers it is two stories in height nearly square its front pierced by a single doorway flanked on each side by a window boarded up to the very top  corresponding windows above not protected serve to admit light and rain to the rooms of the upper floor  grass and weeds grow pretty rankly all about and a few shade trees somewhat the worse for wind and leaning all in one direction seem to be making a concerted effort to run away  in short as the marshall town humorist explained in the columns of the advance the proposition that the manton house is badly haunted is the only logical conclusion from the premises  the fact that in this dwelling mr manton thought it expedient one night some ten years ago to rise and cut the throats of his wife and two small children removing at once to another part of the country has no doubt done its share in directing public attention to the fitness of the place for supernatural phenomena  to this house one summer evening came four men in a wagon  three of them promptly alighted and the one who had been driving hitched the team to the only remaining post of what had been a fence  the fourth remained seated in the wagon  come said one of his companions approaching him while the others moved away in the direction of the dwellingthis is the place  the man addressed did not move  by god he said harshly this is a trick and it looks to me as if you were in it  perhaps i am the other said looking him straight in the face and speaking in a tone which had something of contempt in it  you will remember however that the choice of place was with your own assent left to the other side  of course if you are afraid of spooks  i am afraid of nothing the man interrupted with another oath and sprang to the ground  the two then joined the others at the door which one of them had already opened with some difficulty caused by rust of lock and hinge  all entered  inside it was dark but the man who had unlocked the door produced a candle and matches and made a light  he then unlocked a door on their right as they stood in the passage  this gave them entrance to a large square room that the candle but dimly lighted  the floor had a thick carpeting of dust which partly muffled their footfalls  cobwebs were in the angles of the walls and depended from the ceiling like strips of rotting lace making undulatory movements in the disturbed air  the room had two windows in adjoining sides but from neither could anything be seen except the rough inner surfaces of boards a few inches from the glass  there was no fireplace no furniture there was nothing besides the cobwebs and the dust the four men were the only objects there which were not a part of the structure  strange enough they looked in the yellow light of the candle  the one who had so reluctantly alighted was especially spectacularhe might have been called sensational  he was of middle age heavily built deep chested and broad shouldered  looking at his figure one would have said that he had a giants strength at his features that he would use it like a giant  he was clean shaven his hair rather closely cropped and gray  his low forehead was seamed with wrinkles above the eyes and over the nose these became vertical  the heavy black brows followed the same law saved from meeting only by an upward turn at what would otherwise have been the point of contact deeply sunken beneath these glowed in the obscure light a pair of eyes of uncertain color but obviously enough too small  there was something forbidding in their expression which was not bettered by the cruel mouth and wide jaw  the nose was well enough as noses go one does not expect much of noses  all that was sinister in the mans face seemed accentuated by an unnatural pallorhe appeared altogether bloodless  the appearance of the other men was sufficiently commonplace  they were such persons as one meets and forgets that he met  all were younger than the man described between whom and the eldest of the others who stood apart there was apparently no kindly feeling they avoided looking at each other  gentlemen said the man holding the candle and keys i believe everything is right  are you ready mr rosser  the man standing apart from the group bowed and smiled  and you mr grossmith  the heavy man bowed and scowled  you will be pleased to remove your outer clothing  their hats coats waistcoats and neckwear were soon removed and thrown outside the door in the passage  the man with the candle now nodded and the fourth manhe who had urged grossmith to leave the wagonproduced from the pocket of his overcoat two long murderous looking bowieknives which he drew now from their leather scabbards  they are exactly alike he said presenting one to each of the two principalsfor by this time the dullest observer would have understood the nature of this meeting  it was to be a duel to the death  each combatant took a knife examined it critically near the candle and tested the strength of blade and handle across his lifted knee their persons were then searched in turn each by the second of the other  if it is agreeable to you mr grossmith said the man holding the light you will place yourself in that corner  he indicated the angle of the room farthest from the door whither grossmith retired his second parting from him with a grasp of the hand which had nothing of cordiality in it  in the angle nearest the door mr rosser stationed himself and after a whispered consultation his second left him joining the other near the door  at that moment the candle was suddenly extinguished leaving all in profound darkness  this may have been done by a draught from the opened door whatever the cause the effect was startling  gentlemen said a voice which sounded strangely unfamiliar in the altered condition affecting the relations of the sensesgentlemen you will not move until you hear the closing of the outer door  a sound of trampling ensued then the closing of the inner door and finally the outer one closed with a concussion which shook the entire building  a few minutes afterward a belated farmers boy met a light wagon which was being driven furiously toward the town of marshall  he declared that behind the two figures on the front seat stood a third with its hands upon the bowed shoulders of the others who appeared to struggle vainly to free themselves from its grasp  this figure unlike the others was clad in white and had undoubtedly boarded the wagon as it passed the haunted house  as the lad could boast a considerable former experience with the supernatural thereabouts his word had the weight justly due to the testimony of an expert  the story in connection with the next days events eventually appeared in the advance with some slight literary embellishments and a concluding intimation that the gentlemen referred to would be allowed the use of the papers columns for their version of the nights adventure  but the privilege remained without a claimant  ii  the events that led up to this duel in the dark were simple enough one evening three young men of the town of marshall were sitting in a quiet corner of the porch of the village hotel smoking and discussing such matters as three educated young men of a southern village would naturally find interesting  their names were king sancher and rosser  at a little distance within easy hearing but taking no part in the conversation sat a fourth  he was a stranger to the others  they merely knew that on his arrival by the stage coach that afternoon he had written in the hotel register the name robert grossmith  he had not been observed to speak to anyone except the hotel clerk  he seemed indeed singularly fond of his own companyor as the personnel of the advance expressed it grossly addicted to evil associations  but then it should be said in justice to the stranger that the personnel was himself of a too convivial disposition fairly to judge one differently gifted and had moreover experienced a slight rebuff in an effort at an interview  i hate any kind of deformity in a woman said king whether natural oracquired  i have a theory that any physical defect has its correlative mental and moral defect  i infer then said rosser gravely that a lady lacking the moral advantage of a nose would find the struggle to become mrs king an arduous enterprise  of course you may put it that way was the reply but seriously i once threw over a most charming girl on learning quite accidentally that she had suffered amputation of a toe  my conduct was brutal if you like but if i had married that girl i should have been miserable for life and should have made her so  whereas said sancher with a light laugh by marrying a gentleman of more liberal views she escaped with a parted throat  ah you know to whom i refer  yes she married manton but i dont know about his liberality im not sure but he cut her throat because he discovered that she lacked that excellent thing in woman the middle toe of the right foot  look at that chap said rosser in a low voice his eyes fixed upon the stranger  that chap was obviously listening intently to the conversation  damn his impudence muttered kingwhat ought we to do  thats an easy one rosser replied rising  sir he continued addressing the stranger i think it would be better if you would remove your chair to the other end of the veranda  the presence of gentlemen is evidently an unfamiliar situation to you  the man sprang to his feet and strode forward with clenched hands his face white with rage  all were now standing  sancher stepped between the belligerents  you are hasty and unjust he said to rosser this gentleman has done nothing to deserve such language  but rosser would not withdraw a word  by the custom of the country and the time there could be but one outcome to the quarrel  i demand the satisfaction due to a gentleman said the stranger who had become more calm  i have not an acquaintance in this region  perhaps you sir bowing to sancher will be kind enough to represent me in this matter  sancher accepted the trustsomewhat reluctantly it must be confessed for the mans appearance and manner were not at all to his liking  king who during the colloquy had hardly removed his eyes from the strangers face and had not spoken a word consented with a nod to act for rosser and the upshot of it was that the principals having retired a meeting was arranged for the next evening  the nature of the arrangements has been already disclosed  the duel with knives in a dark room was once a commoner feature of southwestern life than it is likely to be again  how thin a veneering of chivalry covered the essential brutality of the code under which such encounters were possible we shall see  iii  in the blaze of a midsummer noonday the old manton house was hardly true to its traditions  it was of the earth earthy  the sunshine caressed it warmly and affectionately with evident disregard of its bad reputation  the grass greening all the expanse in its front seemed to grow not rankly but with a natural and joyous exuberance and the weeds blossomed quite like plants  full of charming lights and shadows and populous with pleasantvoiced birds the neglected shade trees no longer struggled to run away but bent reverently beneath their burdens of sun and song  even in the glassless upper windows was an expression of peace and contentment due to the light within  over the stony fields the visible heat danced with a lively tremor incompatible with the gravity which is an attribute of the supernatural  such was the aspect under which the place presented itself to sheriff adams and two other men who had come out from marshall to look at it one of these men was mr king the sheriffs deputy the other whose name was brewer was a brother of the late mrs manton  under a beneficent law of the state relating to property which has been for a certain period abandoned by an owner whose residence cannot be ascertained the sheriff was legal custodian of the manton farm and appurtenances thereunto belonging  his present visit was in mere perfunctory compliance with some order of a court in which mr brewer had an action to get possession of the property as heir to his deceased sister  by a mere coincidence the visit was made on the day after the night that deputy king had unlocked the house for another and very different purpose  his presence now was not of his own choosing  he had been ordered to accompany his superior and at the moment could think of nothing more prudent than simulated alacrity in obedience to the command  carelessly opening the front door which to his surprise was not locked the sheriff was amazed to see lying on the floor of the passage into which it opened a confused heap of mens apparel examination showed it to consist of two hats and the same number of coats waistcoats and scarves all in a remarkably good state of preservation albeit somewhat defiled by the dust in which they lay mr brewer was equally astonished but mr kings emotion is not of record  with a new and lively interest in his own actions the sheriff now unlatched and pushed open a door on the right and the three entered  the room was apparently vacantno as their eyes became accustomed to the dimmer light something was visible in the farthest angle of the wall  it was a human figurethat of a man crouching close in the corner  something in the attitude made the intruders halt when they had barely passed the threshold  the figure more and more clearly defined itself  the man was upon one knee his back in the angle of the wall his shoulders elevated to the level of his ears his hands before his face palms outward the fingers spread and crooked like claws the white face turned upward on the retracted neck had an expression of unutterable fright the mouth half open the eyes incredibly expanded  he was stone dead  yet with the exception of a bowieknife which had evidently fallen from his own hand not another object was in the room  in thick dust that covered the floor were some confused footprints near the door and along the wall through which it opened  along one of the adjoining walls too past the boardedup windows was the trail made by the man himself in reaching his corner  instinctively in approaching the body the three men followed that trail  the sheriff grasped one of the outthrown arms it was as rigid as iron and the application of a gentle force rocked the entire body without altering the relation of its parts  brewer pale with excitement gazed intently into the distorted face  god of mercy he suddenly cried it is manton  you are right said king with an evident attempt at calmness  i knew manton  he then wore a full beard and his hair long but this is he  he might have added  i recognized him when he challenged rosser  i told rosser and sancher who he was before we played him this horrible trick  when rosser left this dark room at our heels forgetting his outer clothing in the excitement and driving away with us in his shirt sleevesall through the discreditable proceedings we knew whom we were dealing with murderer and coward that he was  but nothing of this did mr king say  with his better light he was trying to penetrate the mystery of the mans death  that he had not once moved from the corner where he had been stationed that his posture was that of neither attack nor defense that he had dropped his weapon that he had obviously perished of sheer horror of something that he sawthese were circumstances which mr kings disturbed intelligence could not rightly comprehend  groping in intellectual darkness for a clew to his maze of doubt his gaze directed mechanically downward in the way of one who ponders momentous matters fell upon something which there in the light of day and in the presence of living companions affected him with terror  in the dust of years that lay thick upon the floorleading from the door by which they had entered straight across the room to within a yard of mantons crouching corpsewere three parallel lines of footprintslight but definite impressions of bare feet the outer ones those of small children the inner a womans  from the point at which they ended they did not return they pointed all one way brewer who had observed them at the same moment was leaning forward in an attitude of rapt attention horribly pale  look at that he cried pointing with both hands at the nearest print of the womans right foot where she had apparently stopped and stood  the middle toe is missingit was gertrude  gertrude was the late mrs manton sister to mr brewer    john mortonsons funeral 1    john mortonson was dead  his lines in the tragedy man had all been spoken and he had left the stage  the body rested in a fine mahogany coffin fitted with a plate of glass  all arrangements for the funeral had been so well attended to that had the deceased known he would doubtless have approved  the face as it showed under the glass was not disagreeable to look upon  it bore a faint smile and as the death had been painless had not been distorted beyond the repairing power of the undertaker  at two oclock of the afternoon the friends were to assemble to pay their last tribute of respect to one who had no further need of friends and respect  the surviving members of the family came severally every few minutes to the casket and wept above the placid features beneath the glass  this did them no good it did no good to john mortonson but in the presence of death reason and philosophy are silent  as the hour of two approached the friends began to arrive and after offering such consolation to the stricken relatives as the proprieties of the occasion required solemnly seated themselves about the room with an augmented consciousness of their importance in the scheme funereal  then the minister came and in that overshadowing presence the lesser lights went into eclipse  his entrance was followed by that of the widow whose lamentations filled the room  she approached the casket and after leaning her face against the cold glass for a moment was gently led to a seat near her daughter  mournfully and low the man of god began his eulogy of the dead and his doleful voice mingled with the sobbing which it was its purpose to stimulate and sustain rose and fell seemed to come and go like the sound of a sullen sea  the gloomy day grew darker as he spoke a curtain of cloud underspread the sky and a few drops of rain fell audibly  it seemed as if all nature were weeping for john mortonson  when the minister had finished his eulogy with prayer a hymn was sung and the pallbearers took their places beside the bier  as the last notes of the hymn died away the widow ran to the coffin cast herself upon it and sobbed hysterically  gradually however she yielded to dissuasion becoming more composed and as the minister was in the act of leading her away her eyes sought the face of the dead beneath the glass  she threw up her arms and with a shriek fell backward insensible  the mourners sprang forward to the coffin the friends followed and as the clock on the mantel solemnly struck three all were staring down upon the face of john mortonson deceased  they turned away sick and faint  one man trying in his terror to escape the awful sight stumbled against the coffin so heavily as to knock away one of its frail supports  the coffin fell to the floor the glass was shattered to bits by the concussion  from the opening crawled john mortonsons cat which lazily leapt to the floor sat up tranquilly wiped its crimson muzzle with a forepaw then walked with dignity from the room    the realm of the unreal    for a part of the distance between auburn and newcastle the road first on one side of a creek and then on the otheroccupies the whole bottom of the ravine being partly cut out of the steep hillside and partly built up with bowlders removed from the creek bed by the miners  the hills are wooded the course of the ravine is sinuous  in a dark night careful driving is required in order not to go off into the water  the night that i have in memory was dark the creek a torrent swollen by a recent storm  i had driven up from newcastle and was within about a mile of auburn in the darkest and narrowest part of the ravine looking intently ahead of my horse for the roadway  suddenly i saw a man almost under the animals nose and reined in with a jerk that came near setting the creature upon its haunches  i beg your pardon i said i did not see you sir  you could hardly be expected to see me the man replied civilly approaching the side of the vehicle and the noise of the creek prevented my hearing you  i at once recognized the voice although five years had passed since i had heard it  i was not particularly well pleased to hear it now  you are dr dorrimore i think said i  yes and you are my good friend mr manrich  i am more than glad to see youthe excess he added with a light laugh being due to the fact that i am going your way and naturally expect an invitation to ride with you  which i extend with all my heart  that was not altogether true  dr dorrimore thanked me as he seated himself beside me and i drove cautiously forward as before  doubtless it is fancy but it seems to me now that the remaining distance was made in a chill fog that i was uncomfortably cold that the way was longer than ever before and the town when we reached it cheerless forbidding and desolate it must have been early in the evening yet i do not recollect a light in any of the houses nor a living thing in the streets dorrimore explained at some length how he happened to be there and where he had been during the years that had elapsed since i had seen him  i recall the fact of the narrative but none of the facts narrated  he had been in foreign countries and had returnedthis is all that my memory retains and this i already knew  as to myself i cannot remember that i spoke a word though doubtless i did  of one thing i am distinctly conscious  the mans presence at my side was strangely distasteful and disquietingso much so that when i at last pulled up under the lights of the putnam house i experienced a sense of having escaped some spiritual peril of a nature peculiarly forbidding  this sense of relief was somewhat modified by the discovery that dr dorrimore was living at the same hotel  ii  in partial explanation of my feelings regarding dr dorrimore i will relate briefly the circumstances under which i had met him some years before  one evening a halfdozen men of whom i was one were sitting in the library of the bohemian club in san francisco  the conversation had turned to the subject of sleightofhand and the feats of the prestidigitateurs one of whom was then exhibiting at a local theatre  these fellows are pretenders in a double sense said one of the party they can do nothing which it is worth ones while to be made a dupe by  the humblest wayside juggler in india could mystify them to the verge of lunacy  for example how asked another lighting a cigar  for example by all their common and familiar performancesthrowing large objects into the air which never come down causing plants to sprout grow visibly and blossom in bare ground chosen by spectators putting a man into a wicker basket piercing him through and through with a sword while he shrieks and bleeds and thenthe basket being opened nothing is there tossing the free end of a silken ladder into the air mounting it and disappearing  nonsense i said rather uncivilly i fear  you surely do not believe such things  certainly not  i have seen them too often  but i do said a journalist of considerable local fame as a picturesque reporter  i have so frequently related them that nothing but observation could shake my conviction  why gentlemen i have my own word for it  nobody laughedall were looking at something behind me  turning in my seat i saw a man in evening dress who had just entered the room he was exceedingly dark almost swarthy with a thin face black bearded to the lips an abundance of coarse black hair in some disorder a high nose and eyes that glittered with as soulless an expression as those of a cobra  one of the group rose and introduced him as dr dorrimore of calcutta  as each of us was presented in turn he acknowledged the fact with a profound bow in the oriental manner but with nothing of oriental gravity  his smile impressed me as cynical and a trifle contemptuous  his whole demeanor i can describe only as disagreeably engaging  his presence led the conversation into other channels  he said littlei do not recall anything of what he did say  i thought his voice singularly rich and melodious but it affected me in the same way as his eyes and smile  in a few minutes i rose to go  he also rose and put on his overcoat  mr manrich he said i am going your way  the devil you are i thought  how do you know which way i am going  then i said i shall be pleased to have your company  we left the building together  no cabs were in sight the street cars had gone to bed there was a full moon and the cool night air was delightful we walked up the california street hill  i took that direction thinking he would naturally wish to take another toward one of the hotels  you do not believe what is told of the hindu jugglers he said abruptly  how do you know that i asked  without replying he laid his hand lightly upon my arm and with the other pointed to the stone sidewalk directly in front  there almost at our feet lay the dead body of a man the face upturned and white in the moonlight  a sword whose hilt sparkled with gems stood fixed and upright in the breast a pool of blood had collected on the stones of the sidewalk  i was startled and terrifiednot only by what i saw but by the circumstances under which i saw it  repeatedly during our ascent of the hill my eyes i thought had traversed the whole reach of that sidewalk from street to street  how could they have been insensible to this dreadful object now so conspicuous in the white moonlight  as my dazed faculties cleared i observed that the body was in evening dress the overcoat thrown wide open revealed the dresscoat the white tie the broad expanse of shirt front pierced by the sword andhorrible revelationthe face except for its pallor was that of my companion  it was to the minutest detail of dress and feature dr dorrimore himself  bewildered and horrified i turned to look for the living man  he was nowhere visible and with an added terror i retired from the place down the hill in the direction whence i had come  i had taken but a few strides when a strong grasp upon my shoulder arrested me  i came near crying out with terror  the dead man the sword still fixed in his breast stood beside me  pulling out the sword with his disengaged hand he flung it from him the moonlight glinting upon the jewels of its hilt and the unsullied steel of its blade  it fell with a clang upon the sidewalk ahead andvanished  the man swarthy as before relaxed his grasp upon my shoulder and looked at me with the same cynical regard that i had observed on first meeting him  the dead have not that lookit partly restored me and turning my head backward i saw the smooth white expanse of sidewalk unbroken from street to street  what is all this nonsense you devil i demanded fiercely enough though weak and trembling in every limb  it is what some are pleased to call jugglery he answered with a light hard laugh  he turned down dupont street and i saw him no more until we met in the auburn ravine  iii  on the day after my second meeting with dr dorrimore i did not see him  the clerk in the putnam house explained that a slight illness confined him to his rooms  that afternoon at the railway station i was surprised and made happy by the unexpected arrival of miss margaret corray and her mother from oakland  this is not a love story  i am no storyteller and love as it is cannot be portrayed in a literature dominated and enthralled by the debasing tyranny which sentences letters in the name of the young girl  under the young girls blighting reignor rather under the rule of those false ministers of the censure who have appointed themselves to the custody of her welfarelove      veils her sacred fires and unaware morality expires   famished upon the sifted meal and distilled water of a prudish purveyance  let it suffice that miss corray and i were engaged in marriage  she and her mother went to the hotel at which i lived and for two weeks i saw her daily  that i was happy needs hardly be said the only bar to my perfect enjoyment of those golden days was the presence of dr dorrimore whom i had felt compelled to introduce to the ladies  by them he was evidently held in favor  what could i say  i knew absolutely nothing to his discredit  his manners were those of a cultivated and considerate gentleman and to women a mans manner is the man  on one or two occasions when i saw miss corray walking with him i was furious and once had the indiscretion to protest  asked for reasons i had none to give and fancied i saw in her expression a shade of contempt for the vagaries of a jealous mind  in time i grew morose and consciously disagreeable and resolved in my madness to return to san francisco the next day  of this however i said nothing  iv  there was at auburn an old abandoned cemetery  it was nearly in the heart of the town yet by night it was as gruesome a place as the most dismal of human moods could crave  the railings about the plats were prostrate decayed or altogether gone  many of the graves were sunken from others grew sturdy pines whose roots had committed unspeakable sin  the headstones were fallen and broken across brambles overran the ground the fence was mostly gone and cows and pigs wandered there at will the place was a dishonor to the living a calumny on the dead a blasphemy against god  the evening of the day on which i had taken my madmans resolution to depart in anger from all that was dear to me found me in that congenial spot  the light of the half moon fell ghostly through the foliage of trees in spots and patches revealing much that was unsightly and the black shadows seemed conspiracies withholding to the proper time revelations of darker import  passing along what had been a gravel path i saw emerging from shadow the figure of dr dorrimore  i was myself in shadow and stood still with clenched hands and set teeth trying to control the impulse to leap upon and strangle him  a moment later a second figure joined him and clung to his arm  it was margaret corray  i cannot rightly relate what occurred  i know that i sprang forward bent upon murder i know that i was found in the gray of the morning bruised and bloody with finger marks upon my throat  i was taken to the putnam house where for days i lay in a delirium  all this i know for i have been told  and of my own knowledge i know that when consciousness returned with convalescence i sent for the clerk of the hotel  are mrs corray and her daughter still here i asked  what name did you say  corray  nobody of that name has been here  i beg you will not trifle with me i said petulantly  you see that i am all right now tell me the truth  i give you my word he replied with evident sincerity we have had no guests of that name  his words stupefied me  i lay for a few moments in silence then i asked  where is dr dorrimore  he left on the morning of your fight and has not been heard of since  it was a rough deal he gave you  v  such are the facts of this case  margaret corray is now my wife she has never seen auburn and during the weeks whose history as it shaped itself in my brain i have endeavored to relate was living at her home in oakland wondering where her lover was and why he did not write  the other day i saw in the baltimore sun the following paragraph  professor valentine dorrimore the hypnotist had a large audience last night  the lecturer who has lived most of his life in india gave some marvelous exhibitions of his power hypnotizing anyone who chose to submit himself to the experiment by merely looking at him in fact he twice hypnotized the entire audience reporters alone exempted making all entertain the most extraordinary illusions the most valuable feature of the lecture was the disclosure of the methods of the hindu jugglers in their famous performances familiar in the mouths of travelers  the professor declares that these thaumaturgists have acquired such skill in the art which he learned at their feet that they perform their miracles by simply throwing the spectators into a state of hypnosis and telling them what to see and hear  his assertion that a peculiarly susceptible subject may be kept in the realm of the unreal for weeks months and even years dominated by whatever delusions and hallucinations the operator may from time to time suggest is a trifle disquieting    john bartines watch a story by a physician    the exact time  good god my friend why do you insist  one would thinkbut what does it matter it is easily bedtimeisnt that near enough  but here if you must set your watch take mine and see for yourself  with that he detached his watcha tremendously heavy oldfashioned onefrom the chain and handed it to me then turned away and walking across the room to a shelf of books began an examination of their backs  his agitation and evident distress surprised me they appeared reasonless  having set my watch by his i stepped over to where he stood and said thank you  as he took his timepiece and reattached it to the guard i observed that his hands were unsteady  with a tact upon which i greatly prided myself i sauntered carelessly to the sideboard and took some brandy and water then begging his pardon for my thoughtlessness asked him to have some and went back to my seat by the fire leaving him to help himself as was our custom  he did so and presently joined me at the hearth as tranquil as ever  this odd little incident occurred in my apartment where john bartine was passing an evening  we had dined together at the club had come home in a cab andin short everything had been done in the most prosaic way and why john bartine should break in upon the natural and established order of things to make himself spectacular with a display of emotion apparently for his own entertainment i could nowise understand  the more i thought of it while his brilliant conversational gifts were commending themselves to my inattention the more curious i grew and of course had no difficulty in persuading myself that my curiosity was friendly solicitude  that is the disguise that curiosity usually assumes to evade resentment  so i ruined one of the finest sentences of his disregarded monologue by cutting it short without ceremony  john bartine i said you must try to forgive me if i am wrong but with the light that i have at present i cannot concede your right to go all to pieces when asked the time o night  i cannot admit that it is proper to experience a mysterious reluctance to look your own watch in the face and to cherish in my presence without explanation painful emotions which are denied to me and which are none of my business  to this ridiculous speech bartine made no immediate reply but sat looking gravely into the fire  fearing that i had offended i was about to apologize and beg him to think no more about the matter when looking me calmly in the eyes he said  my dear fellow the levity of your manner does not at all disguise the hideous impudence of your demand but happily i had already decided to tell you what you wish to know and no manifestation of your unworthiness to hear it shall alter my decision  be good enough to give me your attention and you shall hear all about the matter  this watch he said had been in my family for three generations before it fell to me  its original owner for whom it was made was my greatgrandfather bramwell olcott bartine a wealthy planter of colonial virginia and as stanch a tory as ever lay awake nights contriving new kinds of maledictions for the head of mr washington and new methods of aiding and abetting good king george  one day this worthy gentleman had the deep misfortune to perform for his cause a service of capital importance which was not recognized as legitimate by those who suffered its disadvantages  it does not matter what it was but among its minor consequences was my excellent ancestors arrest one night in his own house by a party of mr washingtons rebels  he was permitted to say farewell to his weeping family and was then marched away into the darkness which swallowed him up forever  not the slenderest clew to his fate was ever found after the war the most diligent inquiry and the offer of large rewards failed to turn up any of his captors or any fact concerning his disappearance  he had disappeared and that was all  something in bartines manner that was not in his wordsi hardly knew what it wasprompted me to ask  what is your view of the matterof the justice of it  my view of it he flamed out bringing his clenched hand down upon the table as if he had been in a public house dicing with blackguardsmy view of it is that it was a characteristically dastardly assassination by that damned traitor washington and his ragamuffin rebels  for some minutes nothing was said  bartine was recovering his temper and i waited  then i said  was that all  nothere was something else  a few weeks after my great grandfathers arrest his watch was found lying on the porch at the front door of his dwelling  it was wrapped in a sheet of letter paper bearing the name of rupert bartine his only son my grandfather  i am wearing that watch  bartine paused  his usually restless black eyes were staring fixedly into the grate a point of red light in each reflected from the glowing coals  he seemed to have forgotten me  a sudden threshing of the branches of a tree outside one of the windows and almost at the same instant a rattle of rain against the glass recalled him to a sense of his surroundings  a storm had risen heralded by a single gust of wind and in a few moments the steady plash of the water on the pavement was distinctly heard  i hardly know why i relate this incident it seemed somehow to have a certain significance and relevancy which i am unable now to discern  it at least added an element of seriousness almost solemnity  bartine resumed  i have a singular feeling toward this watcha kind of affection for it i like to have it about me though partly from its weight and partly for a reason i shall now explain i seldom carry it  the reason is this  every evening when i have it with me i feel an unaccountable desire to open and consult it even if i can think of no reason for wishing to know the time  but if i yield to it the moment my eyes rest upon the dial i am filled with a mysterious apprehensiona sense of imminent calamity  and this is the more insupportable the nearer it is to eleven oclockby this watch no matter what the actual hour may be  after the hands have registered eleven the desire to look is gone i am entirely indifferent  then i can consult the thing as often as i like with no more emotion than you feel in looking at your own  naturally i have trained myself not to look at that watch in the evening before eleven nothing could induce me  your insistence this evening upset me a trifle  i felt very much as i suppose an opiumeater might feel if his yearning for his special and particular kind of hell were reenforced by opportunity and advice  now that is my story and i have told it in the interest of your trumpery science but if on any evening hereafter you observe me wearing this damnable watch and you have the thoughtfulness to ask me the hour i shall beg leave to put you to the inconvenience of being knocked down  his humor did not amuse me  i could see that in relating his delusion he was again somewhat disturbed  his concluding smile was positively ghastly and his eyes had resumed something more than their old restlessness they shifted hither and thither about the room with apparent aimlessness and i fancied had taken on a wild expression such as is sometimes observed in cases of dementia perhaps this was my own imagination but at any rate i was now persuaded that my friend was afflicted with a most singular and interesting monomania  without i trust any abatement of my affectionate solicitude for him as a friend i began to regard him as a patient rich in possibilities of profitable study  why not  had he not described his delusion in the interest of science  ah poor fellow he was doing more for science than he knew  not only his story but himself was in evidence  i should cure him if i could of course but first i should make a little experiment in psychology nay the experiment itself might be a step in his restoration  that is very frank and friendly of you bartine i said cordially and im rather proud of your confidence  it is all very odd certainly  do you mind showing me the watch  he detached it from his waistcoat chain and all and passed it to me without a word  the case was of gold very thick and strong and singularly engraved  after closely examining the dial and observing that it was nearly twelve oclock i opened it at the back and was interested to observe an inner case of ivory upon which was painted a miniature portrait in that exquisite and delicate manner which was in vogue during the eighteenth century  why bless my soul i exclaimed feeling a sharp artistic delight how under the sun did you get that done  i thought miniature painting on ivory was a lost art  that he replied gravely smiling is not i it is my excellent greatgrandfather the late bramwell olcott bartine esquire of virginia  he was younger then than laterabout my age in fact  it is said to resemble me do you think so  resemble you  i should say so  barring the costume which i supposed you to have assumed out of compliment to the artor for vraisemblance so to sayand the no mustache that portrait is you in every feature line and expression  no more was said at that time  bartine took a book from the table and began reading  i heard outside the incessant plash of the rain in the street  there were occasional hurried footfalls on the sidewalks and once a slower heavier tread seemed to cease at my doora policeman i thought seeking shelter in the doorway  the boughs of the trees tapped significantly on the window panes as if asking for admittance  i remember it all through these years and years of a wiser graver life  seeing myself unobserved i took the oldfashioned key that dangled from the chain and quickly turned back the hands of the watch a full hour then closing the case i handed bartine his property and saw him replace it on his person  i think you said i began with assumed carelessness that after eleven the sight of the dial no longer affects you  as it is now nearly twelvelooking at my own timepieceperhaps if you dont resent my pursuit of proof you will look at it now  he smiled goodhumoredly pulled out the watch again opened it and instantly sprang to his feet with a cry that heaven has not had the mercy to permit me to forget  his eyes their blackness strikingly intensified by the pallor of his face were fixed upon the watch which he clutched in both hands  for some time he remained in that attitude without uttering another sound then in a voice that i should not have recognized as his he said  damn you it is two minutes to eleven  i was not unprepared for some such outbreak and without rising replied calmly enough  i beg your pardon i must have misread your watch in setting my own by it  he shut the case with a sharp snap and put the watch in his pocket he looked at me and made an attempt to smile but his lower lip quivered and he seemed unable to close his mouth  his hands also were shaking and he thrust them clenched into the pockets of his sackcoat  the courageous spirit was manifestly endeavoring to subdue the coward body  the effort was too great he began to sway from side to side as from vertigo and before i could spring from my chair to support him his knees gave way and he pitched awkwardly forward and fell upon his face  i sprang to assist him to rise but when john bartine rises we shall all rise  the postmortem examination disclosed nothing every organ was normal and sound  but when the body had been prepared for burial a faint dark circle was seen to have developed around the neck at least i was so assured by several persons who said they saw it but of my own knowledge i cannot say if that was true  nor can i set limitations to the law of heredity  i do not know that in the spiritual world a sentiment or emotion may not survive the heart that held it and seek expression in a kindred life ages removed  surely if i were to guess at the fate of bramwell olcott bartine i should guess that he was hanged at eleven oclock in the evening and that he had been allowed several hours in which to prepare for the change  as to john bartine my friend my patient for five minutes and heaven forgive memy victim for eternity there is no more to say he is buried and his watch with himi saw to that  may god rest his soul in paradise and the soul of his virginian ancestor if indeed they are two souls    the damned thing    ione does not always eat what is on the table  by the light of a tallow candle which had been placed on one end of a rough table a man was reading something written in a book  it was an old account book greatly worn and the writing was not apparently very legible for the man sometimes held the page close to the flame of the candle to get a stronger light on it  the shadow of the book would then throw into obscurity a half of the room darkening a number of faces and figures for besides the reader eight other men were present  seven of them sat against the rough log walls silent motionless and the room being small not very far from the table by extending an arm any one of them could have touched the eighth man who lay on the table face upward partly covered by a sheet his arms at his sides  he was dead  the man with the book was not reading aloud and no one spoke all seemed to be waiting for something to occur the dead man only was without expectation  from the blank darkness outside came in through the aperture that served for a window all the ever unfamiliar noises of night in the wildernessthe long nameless note of a distant coyote the stilly pulsing thrill of tireless insects in trees strange cries of night birds so different from those of the birds of day the drone of great blundering beetles and all that mysterious chorus of small sounds that seem always to have been but half heard when they have suddenly ceased as if conscious of an indiscretion  but nothing of all this was noted in that company its members were not overmuch addicted to idle interest in matters of no practical importance that was obvious in every line of their rugged facesobvious even in the dim light of the single candle  they were evidently men of the vicinityfarmers and woodsmen  the person reading was a trifle different one would have said of him that he was of the world worldly albeit there was that in his attire which attested a certain fellowship with the organisms of his environment  his coat would hardly have passed muster in san francisco his footgear was not of urban origin and the hat that lay by him on the floor he was the only one uncovered was such that if one had considered it as an article of mere personal adornment he would have missed its meaning  in countenance the man was rather prepossessing with just a hint of sternness though that he may have assumed or cultivated as appropriate to one in authority  for he was a coroner  it was by virtue of his office that he had possession of the book in which he was reading it had been found among the dead mans effectsin his cabin where the inquest was now taking place  when the coroner had finished reading he put the book into his breast pocket  at that moment the door was pushed open and a young man entered  he clearly was not of mountain birth and breeding  he was clad as those who dwell in cities  his clothing was dusty however as from travel  he had in fact been riding hard to attend the inquest  the coroner nodded no one else greeted him  we have waited for you said the coroner  it is necessary to have done with this business tonight  the young man smiled  i am sorry to have kept you he said  i went away not to evade your summons but to post to my newspaper an account of what i suppose i am called back to relate  the coroner smiled  the account that you posted to your newspaper he said differs probably from that which you will give here under oath  that replied the other rather hotly and with a visible flush is as you please  i used manifold paper and have a copy of what i sent it was not written as news for it is incredible but as fiction  it may go as a part of my testimony under oath  but you say it is incredible  that is nothing to you sir if i also swear that it is true  the coroner was silent for a time his eyes upon the floor  the men about the sides of the cabin talked in whispers but seldom withdrew their gaze from the face of the corpse  presently the coroner lifted his eyes and said  we will resume the inquest  the men removed their hats  the witness was sworn  what is your name the coroner asked  william harker  age  twentyseven  you knew the deceased hugh morgan  yes  you were with him when he died  near him  how did that happenyour presence i mean  i was visiting him at this place to shoot and fish  a part of my purpose however was to study him and his odd solitary way of life he seemed a good model for a character in fiction  i sometimes write stories  i sometimes read them  thank you  stories in generalnot yours  some of the jurors laughed  against a sombre background humor shows high lights  soldiers in the intervals of battle laugh easily and a jest in the death chamber conquers by surprise  relate the circumstances of this mans death said the coroner you may use any notes or memoranda that you please  the witness understood  pulling a manuscript from his breast pocket he held it near the candle and turning the leaves until he found the passage that he wanted began to read  iiwhat may happen in a field of wild oats      the sun had hardly risen when we left the house  we were looking for quail each with a shotgun but we had only one dog morgan said that our best ground was beyond a certain ridge that he pointed out and we crossed it by a trail through the chaparral  on the other side was comparatively level ground thickly covered with wild oats  as we emerged from the chaparral morgan was but a few yards in advance  suddenly we heard at a little distance to our right and partly in front a noise as of some animal thrashing about in the bushes which we could see were violently agitated  weve started a deer i said  i wish we had brought a rifle  morgan who had stopped and was intently watching the agitated chaparral said nothing but had cocked both barrels of his gun and was holding it in readiness to aim  i thought him a trifle excited which surprised me for he had a reputation for exceptional coolness even in moments of sudden and imminent peril  o come i said  you are not going to fill up a deer with quail shot are you  still he did not reply but catching a sight of his face as he turned it slightly toward me i was struck by the intensity of his look  then i understood that we had serious business in hand and my first conjecture was that we had jumped a grizzly  i advanced to morgans side cocking my piece as i moved  the bushes were now quiet and the sounds had ceased but morgan was as attentive to the place as before  what is it  what the devil is it i asked  that damned thing he replied without turning his head  his voice was husky and unnatural  he trembled visibly  i was about to speak further when i observed the wild oats near the place of the disturbance moving in the most inexplicable way  i can hardly describe it  it seemed as if stirred by a streak of wind which not only bent it but pressed it downcrushed it so that it did not rise and this movement was slowly prolonging itself directly toward us  nothing that i had ever seen had affected me so strangely as this unfamiliar and unaccountable phenomenon yet i am unable to recall any sense of fear  i rememberand tell it here because singularly enough i recollected it thenthat once in looking carelessly out of an open window i momentarily mistook a small tree close at hand for one of a group of larger trees at a little distance away  it looked the same size as the others but being more distinctly and sharply defined in mass and detail seemed out of harmony with them  it was a mere falsification of the law of aerial perspective but it startled almost terrified me  we so rely upon the orderly operation of familiar natural laws that any seeming suspension of them is noted as a menace to our safety a warning of unthinkable calamity  so now the apparently causeless movement of the herbage and the slow undeviating approach of the line of disturbance were distinctly disquieting  my companion appeared actually frightened and i could hardly credit my senses when i saw him suddenly throw his gun to his shoulder and fire both barrels at the agitated grain  before the smoke of the discharge had cleared away i heard a loud savage crya scream like that of a wild animaland flinging his gun upon the ground morgan sprang away and ran swiftly from the spot  at the same instant i was thrown violently to the ground by the impact of something unseen in the smokesome soft heavy substance that seemed thrown against me with great force  before i could get upon my feet and recover my gun which seemed to have been struck from my hands i heard morgan crying out as if in mortal agony and mingling with his cries were such hoarse savage sounds as one hears from fighting dogs  inexpressibly terrified i struggled to my feet and looked in the direction of morgans retreat and may heaven in mercy spare me from another sight like that  at a distance of less than thirty yards was my friend down upon one knee his head thrown back at a frightful angle hatless his long hair in disorder and his whole body in violent movement from side to side backward and forward  his right arm was lifted and seemed to lack the handat least i could see none  the other arm was invisible at times as my memory now reports this extraordinary scene i could discern but a part of his body it was as if he had been partly blotted outi cannot otherwise express itthen a shifting of his position would bring it all into view again  all this must have occurred within a few seconds yet in that time morgan assumed all the postures of a determined wrestler vanquished by superior weight and strength  i saw nothing but him and him not always distinctly  during the entire incident his shouts and curses were heard as if through an enveloping uproar of such sounds of rage and fury as i had never heard from the throat of man or brute  for a moment only i stood irresolute then throwing down my gun i ran forward to my friends assistance  i had a vague belief that he was suffering from a fit or some form of convulsion  before i could reach his side he was down and quiet  all sounds had ceased but with a feeling of such terror as even these awful events had not inspired i now saw again the mysterious movement of the wild oats prolonging itself from the trampled area about the prostrate man toward the edge of a wood  it was only when it had reached the wood that i was able to withdraw my eyes and look at my companion  he was dead  iiia man though naked may be in rags  the coroner rose from his seat and stood beside the dead man lifting an edge of the sheet he pulled it away exposing the entire body altogether naked and showing in the candlelight a claylike yellow  it had however broad maculations of bluish black obviously caused by extravasated blood from contusions  the chest and sides looked as if they had been beaten with a bludgeon  there were dreadful lacerations the skin was torn in strips and shreds  the coroner moved round to the end of the table and undid a silk handkerchief which had been passed under the chin and knotted on the top of the head  when the handkerchief was drawn away it exposed what had been the throat  some of the jurors who had risen to get a better view repented their curiosity and turned away their faces witness harker went to the open window and leaned out across the sill faint and sick  dropping the handkerchief upon the dead mans neck the coroner stepped to an angle of the room and from a pile of clothing produced one garment after another each of which he held up a moment for inspection  all were torn and stiff with blood  the jurors did not make a closer inspection  they seemed rather uninterested  they had in truth seen all this before the only thing that was new to them being harkers testimony  gentlemen the coroner said we have no more evidence i think your duty has been already explained to you if there is nothing you wish to ask you may go outside and consider your verdict  the foreman rosea tall bearded man of sixty coarsely clad  i should like to ask one question mr coroner he said  what asylum did this yer last witness escape from  mr harker said the coroner gravely and tranquilly from what asylum did you last escape  harker flushed crimson again but said nothing and the seven jurors rose and solemnly filed out of the cabin  if you have done insulting me sir said harker as soon as he and the officer were left alone with the dead man i suppose i am at liberty to go  yes  harker started to leave but paused with his hand on the door latch the habit of his profession was strong in himstronger than his sense of personal dignity  he turned about and said  the book that you have therei recognize it as morgans diary  you seemed greatly interested in it you read in it while i was testifying  may i see it  the public would like  the book will cut no figure in this matter replied the official slipping it into his coat pocket all the entries in it were made before the writers death  as harker passed out of the house the jury reentered and stood about the table on which the now covered corpse showed under the sheet with sharp definition  the foreman seated himself near the candle produced from his breast pocket a pencil and scrap of paper and wrote rather laboriously the following verdict which with various degrees of effort all signed  we the jury do find that the remains come to their death at the hands of a mountain lion but some of us thinks all the same they had fits  ivan explanation from the tomb  in the diary of the late hugh morgan are certain interesting entries having possibly a scientific value as suggestions  at the inquest upon his body the book was not put in evidence possibly the coroner thought it not worth while to confuse the jury  the date of the first of the entries mentioned cannot be ascertained the upper part of the leaf is torn away the part of the entry remaining follows      would run in a halfcircle keeping his head turned always toward the centre and again he would stand still barking furiously at last he ran away into the brush as fast as he could go  i thought at first that he had gone mad but on returning to the house found no other alteration in his manner than what was obviously due to fear of punishment  can a dog see with his nose  do odors impress some cerebral centre with images of the thing that emitted them     sept 2looking at the stars last night as they rose above the crest of the ridge east of the house i observed them successively disappearfrom left to right  each was eclipsed but an instant and only a few at the same time but along the entire length of the ridge all that were within a degree or two of the crest were blotted out it was as if something had passed along between me and them but i could not see it and the stars were not thick enough to define its outline  ugh  i dont like this     several weeks entries are missing three leaves being torn from the book  sept 27it has been about here againi find evidences of its presence every day  i watched again all last night in the same cover gun in hand doublecharged with buckshot  in the morning the fresh footprints were there as before  yet i would have sworn that i did not sleepindeed i hardly sleep at all  it is terrible insupportable  if these amazing experiences are real i shall go mad if they are fanciful i am mad already  oct 3i shall not goit shall not drive me away  no this is my house my land  god hates a coward     oct 5i can stand it no longer i have invited harker to pass a few weeks with mehe has a level head  i can judge from his manner if he thinks me mad  oct 7i have the solution of the mystery it came to me last nightsuddenly as by revelation  how simplehow terribly simple  there are sounds that we cannot hear  at either end of the scale are notes that stir no chord of that imperfect instrument the human ear  they are too high or too grave  i have observed a flock of blackbirds occupying an entire treetopthe tops of several trees and all in full song  suddenlyin a momentat absolutely the same instantall spring into the air and fly away  how  they could not all see one anotherwhole treetops intervened  at no point could a leader have been visible to all  there must have been a signal of warning or command high and shrill above the din but by me unheard i have observed too the same simultaneous flight when all were silent among not only blackbirds but other birdsquail for example widely separated by busheseven on opposite sides of a hill  it is known to seamen that a school of whales basking or sporting on the surface of the ocean miles apart with the convexity of the earth between will sometimes dive at the same instantall gone out of sight in a moment  the signal has been soundedtoo grave for the ear of the sailor at the masthead and his comrades on the deckwho nevertheless feel its vibrations in the ship as the stones of a cathedral are stirred by the bass of the organ  as with sounds so with colors  at each end of the solar spectrum the chemist can detect the presence of what are known as actinic rays  they represent colorsintegral colors in the composition of lightwhich we are unable to discern  the human eye is an imperfect instrument its range is but a few octaves of the real chromatic scale  i am not mad there are colors that we cannot see  and god help me the damned thing is of such a color    haita the shepherd    in the heart of haita the illusions of youth had not been supplanted by those of age and experience  his thoughts were pure and pleasant for his life was simple and his soul devoid of ambition  he rose with the sun and went forth to pray at the shrine of hastur the god of shepherds who heard and was pleased  after performance of this pious rite haita unbarred the gate of the fold and with a cheerful mind drove his flock afield eating his morning meal of curds and oat cake as he went occasionally pausing to add a few berries cold with dew or to drink of the waters that came away from the hills to join the stream in the middle of the valley and be borne along with it he knew not whither  during the long summer day as his sheep cropped the good grass which the gods had made to grow for them or lay with their forelegs doubled under their breasts and chewed the cud haita reclining in the shadow of a tree or sitting upon a rock played so sweet music upon his reed pipe that sometimes from the corner of his eye he got accidental glimpses of the minor sylvan deities leaning forward out of the copse to hear but if he looked at them directly they vanished  from thisfor he must be thinking if he would not turn into one of his own sheephe drew the solemn inference that happiness may come if not sought but if looked for will never be seen for next to the favor of hastur who never disclosed himself haita most valued the friendly interest of his neighbors the shy immortals of the wood and stream  at nightfall he drove his flock back to the fold saw that the gate was secure and retired to his cave for refreshment and for dreams  so passed his life one day like another save when the storms uttered the wrath of an offended god  then haita cowered in his cave his face hidden in his hands and prayed that he alone might be punished for his sins and the world saved from destruction sometimes when there was a great rain and the stream came out of its banks compelling him to urge his terrified flock to the uplands he interceded for the people in the cities which he had been told lay in the plain beyond the two blue hills forming the gateway of his valley  it is kind of thee o hastur so he prayed to give me mountains so near to my dwelling and my fold that i and my sheep can escape the angry torrents but the rest of the world thou must thyself deliver in some way that i know not of or i will no longer worship thee  and hastur knowing that haita was a youth who kept his word spared the cities and turned the waters into the sea  so he had lived since he could remember  he could not rightly conceive any other mode of existence  the holy hermit who dwelt at the head of the valley a full hours journey away from whom he had heard the tale of the great cities where dwelt peoplepoor souls who had no sheep gave him no knowledge of that early time when so he reasoned he must have been small and helpless like a lamb  it was through thinking on these mysteries and marvels and on that horrible change to silence and decay which he felt sure must some time come to him as he had seen it come to so many of his flockas it came to all living things except the birdsthat haita first became conscious how miserable and hopeless was his lot  it is necessary he said that i know whence and how i came for how can one perform his duties unless able to judge what they are by the way in which he was intrusted with them  and what contentment can i have when i know not how long it is going to last  perhaps before another sun i may be changed and then what will become of the sheep  what indeed will have become of me  pondering these things haita became melancholy and morose  he no longer spoke cheerfully to his flock nor ran with alacrity to the shrine of hastur  in every breeze he heard whispers of malign deities whose existence he now first observed  every cloud was a portent signifying disaster and the darkness was full of terrors his reed pipe when applied to his lips gave out no melody but a dismal wail the sylvan and riparian intelligences no longer thronged the thicketside to listen but fled from the sound as he knew by the stirred leaves and bent flowers  he relaxed his vigilance and many of his sheep strayed away into the hills and were lost  those that remained became lean and ill for lack of good pasturage for he would not seek it for them but conducted them day after day to the same spot through mere abstraction while puzzling about life and deathof immortality he knew not  one day while indulging in the gloomiest reflections he suddenly sprang from the rock upon which he sat and with a determined gesture of the right hand exclaimed  i will no longer be a suppliant for knowledge which the gods withhold  let them look to it that they do me no wrong  i will do my duty as best i can and if i err upon their own heads be it  suddenly as he spoke a great brightness fell about him causing him to look upward thinking the sun had burst through a rift in the clouds but there were no clouds  no more than an arms length away stood a beautiful maiden  so beautiful she was that the flowers about her feet folded their petals in despair and bent their heads in token of submission so sweet her look that the humming birds thronged her eyes thrusting their thirsty bills almost into them and the wild bees were about her lips  and such was her brightness that the shadows of all objects lay divergent from her feet turning as she moved  haita was entranced  rising he knelt before her in adoration and she laid her hand upon his head  come she said in a voice that had the music of all the bells of his flockcome thou art not to worship me who am no goddess but if thou art truthful and dutiful i will abide with thee  haita seized her hand and stammering his joy and gratitude arose and hand in hand they stood and smiled into each others eyes  he gazed on her with reverence and rapture  he said  i pray thee lovely maid tell me thy name and whence and why thou comest  at this she laid a warning finger on her lip and began to withdraw her beauty underwent a visible alteration that made him shudder he knew not why for still she was beautiful  the landscape was darkened by a giant shadow sweeping across the valley with the speed of a vulture  in the obscurity the maidens figure grew dim and indistinct and her voice seemed to come from a distance as she said in a tone of sorrowful reproach  presumptuous and ungrateful youth must i then so soon leave thee  would nothing do but thou must at once break the eternal compact  inexpressibly grieved haita fell upon his knees and implored her to remainrose and sought her in the deepening darknessran in circles calling to her aloud but all in vain  she was no longer visible but out of the gloom he heard her voice saying  nay thou shalt not have me by seeking  go to thy duty faithless shepherd or we shall never meet again  night had fallen the wolves were howling in the hills and the terrified sheep crowding about haitas feet  in the demands of the hour he forgot his disappointment drove his sheep to the fold and repairing to the place of worship poured out his heart in gratitude to hastur for permitting him to save his flock then retired to his cave and slept  when haita awoke the sun was high and shone in at the cave illuminating it with a great glory  and there beside him sat the maiden  she smiled upon him with a smile that seemed the visible music of his pipe of reeds  he dared not speak fearing to offend her as before for he knew not what he could venture to say  because she said thou didst thy duty by the flock and didst not forget to thank hastur for staying the wolves of the night i am come to thee again  wilt thou have me for a companion  who would not have thee forever replied haita  oh never again leave me untiluntil ichange and become silent and motionless  haita had no word for death  i wish indeed he continued that thou wert of my own sex that we might wrestle and run races and so never tire of being together  at these words the maiden arose and passed out of the cave and haita springing from his couch of fragrant boughs to overtake and detain her observed to his astonishment that the rain was falling and the stream in the middle of the valley had come out of its banks the sheep were bleating in terror for the rising waters had invaded their fold  and there was danger for the unknown cities of the distant plain  it was many days before haita saw the maiden again  one day he was returning from the head of the valley where he had gone with ewes milk and oat cake and berries for the holy hermit who was too old and feeble to provide himself with food  poor old man he said aloud as he trudged along homeward  i will return tomorrow and bear him on my back to my own dwelling where i can care for him  doubtless it is for this that hastur has reared me all these many years and gives me health and strength  as he spoke the maiden clad in glittering garments met him in the path with a smile that took away his breath  i am come again she said to dwell with thee if thou wilt now have me for none else will  thou mayest have learned wisdom and art willing to take me as i am nor care to know  haita threw himself at her feet  beautiful being he cried if thou wilt but deign to accept all the devotion of my heart and soul after hastur be servedit is thine forever  but alas thou art capricious and wayward  before tomorrows sun i may lose thee again  promise i beseech thee that however in my ignorance i may offend thou wilt forgive and remain always with me  scarcely had he finished speaking when a troop of bears came out of the hills racing toward him with crimson mouths and fiery eyes  the maiden again vanished and he turned and fled for his life  nor did he stop until he was in the cot of the holy hermit whence he had set out  hastily barring the door against the bears he cast himself upon the ground and wept  my son said the hermit from his couch of straw freshly gathered that morning by haitas hands it is not like thee to weep for bearstell me what sorrow hath befallen thee that age may minister to the hurts of youth with such balms as it hath of its wisdom  haita told him all  how thrice he had met the radiant maid and thrice she had left him forlorn  he related minutely all that had passed between them omitting no word of what had been said  when he had ended the holy hermit was a moment silent then said my son i have attended to thy story and i know the maiden  i have myself seen her as have many  know then that her name which she would not even permit thee to inquire is happiness  thou saidst the truth to her that she is capricious for she imposeth conditions that man cannot fulfill and delinquency is punished by desertion  she cometh only when unsought and will not be questioned  one manifestation of curiosity one sign of doubt one expression of misgiving and she is away  how long didst thou have her at any time before she fled  only a single instant answered haita blushing with shame at the confession  each time i drove her away in one moment  unfortunate youth said the holy hermit but for thine indiscretion thou mightst have had her for two    an inhabitant of carcosa    for there be divers sorts of deathsome wherein the body remaineth and in some it vanisheth quite away with the spirit  this commonly occurreth only in solitude such is gods will and none seeing the end we say the man is lost or gone on a long journeywhich indeed he hath but sometimes it hath happened in sight of many as abundant testimony showeth  in one kind of death the spirit also dieth and this it hath been known to do while yet the body was in vigor for many years  sometimes as is veritably attested it dieth with the body but after a season is raised up again in that place where the body did decay  pondering these words of hali whom god rest and questioning their full meaning as one who having an intimation yet doubts if there be not something behind other than that which he has discerned i noted not whither i had strayed until a sudden chill wind striking my face revived in me a sense of my surroundings  i observed with astonishment that everything seemed unfamiliar  on every side of me stretched a bleak and desolate expanse of plain covered with a tall overgrowth of sere grass which rustled and whistled in the autumn wind with heaven knows what mysterious and disquieting suggestion protruded at long intervals above it stood strangely shaped and sombercolored rocks which seemed to have an understanding with one another and to exchange looks of uncomfortable significance as if they had reared their heads to watch the issue of some foreseen event  a few blasted trees here and there appeared as leaders in this malevolent conspiracy of silent expectation  the day i thought must be far advanced though the sun was invisible and although sensible that the air was raw and chill my consciousness of that fact was rather mental than physicali had no feeling of discomfort  over all the dismal landscape a canopy of low leadcolored clouds hung like a visible curse  in all this there were a menace and a portenta hint of evil an intimation of doom  bird beast or insect there was none  the wind sighed in the bare branches of the dead trees and the gray grass bent to whisper its dread secret to the earth but no other sound nor motion broke the awful repose of that dismal place  i observed in the herbage a number of weatherworn stones evidently shaped with tools  they were broken covered with moss and half sunken in the earth  some lay prostrate some leaned at various angles none was vertical  they were obviously headstones of graves though the graves themselves no longer existed as either mounds or depressions the years had leveled all  scattered here and there more massive blocks showed where some pompous tomb or ambitious monument had once flung its feeble defiance at oblivion  so old seemed these relics these vestiges of vanity and memorials of affection and piety so battered and worn and stainedso neglected deserted forgotten the place that i could not help thinking myself the discoverer of the burialground of a prehistoric race of men whose very name was long extinct  filled with these reflections i was for some time heedless of the sequence of my own experiences but soon i thought how came i hither  a moments reflection seemed to make this all clear and explain at the same time though in a disquieting way the singular character with which my fancy had invested all that i saw or heard i was ill  i remembered now that i had been prostrated by a sudden fever and that my family had told me that in my periods of delirium i had constantly cried out for liberty and air and had been held in bed to prevent my escape outofdoors  now i had eluded the vigilance of my attendants and had wandered hither toto where  i could not conjecture  clearly i was at a considerable distance from the city where i dweltthe ancient and famous city of carcosa  no signs of human life were anywhere visible nor audible no rising smoke no watchdogs bark no lowing of cattle no shouts of children at playnothing but that dismal burialplace with its air of mystery and dread due to my own disordered brain  was i not becoming again delirious there beyond human aid  was it not indeed all an illusion of my madness  i called aloud the names of my wives and sons reached out my hands in search of theirs even as i walked among the crumbling stones and in the withered grass  a noise behind me caused me to turn about  a wild animala lynx was approaching  the thought came to me  if i break down here in the desertif the fever return and i fail this beast will be at my throat  i sprang toward it shouting  it trotted tranquilly by within a hands breadth of me and disappeared behind a rock  a moment later a mans head appeared to rise out of the ground a short distance away  he was ascending the farther slope of a low hill whose crest was hardly to be distinguished from the general level  his whole figure soon came into view against the background of gray cloud  he was half naked half clad in skins  his hair was unkempt his beard long and ragged  in one hand he carried a bow and arrow the other held a blazing torch with a long trail of black smoke  he walked slowly and with caution as if he feared falling into some open grave concealed by the tall grass  this strange apparition surprised but did not alarm and taking such a course as to intercept him i met him almost face to face accosting him with the familiar salutation god keep you  he gave no heed nor did he arrest his pace  good stranger i continued i am ill and lost  direct me i beseech you to carcosa  the man broke into a barbarous chant in an unknown tongue passing on and away  an owl on the branch of a decayed tree hooted dismally and was answered by another in the distance  looking upward i saw through a sudden rift in the clouds aldebaran and the hyades  in all this there was a hint of nightthe lynx the man with the torch the owl yet i sawi saw even the stars in absence of the darkness  i saw but was apparently not seen nor heard  under what awful spell did i exist  i seated myself at the root of a great tree seriously to consider what it were best to do  that i was mad i could no longer doubt yet recognized a ground of doubt in the conviction  of fever i had no trace  i had withal a sense of exhilaration and vigor altogether unknown to mea feeling of mental and physical exaltation  my senses seemed all alert i could feel the air as a ponderous substance i could hear the silence  a great root of the giant tree against whose trunk i leaned as i sat held inclosed in its grasp a slab of stone a part of which protruded into a recess formed by another root  the stone was thus partly protected from the weather though greatly decomposed  its edges were worn round its corners eaten away its surface deeply furrowed and scaled  glittering particles of mica were visible in the earth about itvestiges of its decomposition  this stone had apparently marked the grave out of which the tree had sprung ages ago  the trees exacting roots had robbed the grave and made the stone a prisoner  a sudden wind pushed some dry leaves and twigs from the uppermost face of the stone i saw the lowrelief letters of an inscription and bent to read it  god in heaven my name in fullthe date of my birththe date of my death  a level shaft of light illuminated the whole side of the tree as i sprang to my feet in terror  the sun was rising in the rosy east  i stood between the tree and his broad red diskno shadow darkened the trunk  a chorus of howling wolves saluted the dawn  i saw them sitting on their haunches singly and in groups on the summits of irregular mounds and tumuli filling a half of my desert prospect and extending to the horizon  and then i knew that these were ruins of the ancient and famous city of carcosa   such are the facts imparted to the medium bayrolles by the spirit hoseib alar robardin    the stranger    a man stepped out of the darkness into the little illuminated circle about our failing campfire and seated himself upon a rock  you are not the first to explore this region he said gravely  nobody controverted his statement he was himself proof of its truth for he was not of our party and must have been somewhere near when we camped  moreover he must have companions not far away it was not a place where one would be living or traveling alone  for more than a week we had seen besides ourselves and our animals only such living things as rattlesnakes and horned toads  in an arizona desert one does not long coexist with only such creatures as these  one must have pack animals supplies armsan outfit  and all these imply comrades  it was perhaps a doubt as to what manner of men this unceremonious strangers comrades might be together with something in his words interpretable as a challenge that caused every man of our halfdozen gentlemen adventurers to rise to a sitting posture and lay his hand upon a weaponan act signifying in that time and place a policy of expectation  the stranger gave the matter no attention and began again to speak in the same deliberate uninflected monotone in which he had delivered his first sentence  thirty years ago ramon gallegos william shaw george w kent and berry davis all of tucson crossed the santa catalina mountains and traveled due west as nearly as the configuration of the country permitted  we were prospecting and it was our intention if we found nothing to push through to the gila river at some point near big bend where we understood there was a settlement  we had a good outfit but no guidejust ramon gallegos william shaw george w kent and berry davis  the man repeated the names slowly and distinctly as if to fix them in the memories of his audience every member of which was now attentively observing him but with a slackened apprehension regarding his possible companions somewhere in the darkness that seemed to enclose us like a black wall in the manner of this volunteer historian was no suggestion of an unfriendly purpose  his act was rather that of a harmless lunatic than an enemy  we were not so new to the country as not to know that the solitary life of many a plainsman had a tendency to develop eccentricities of conduct and character not always easily distinguishable from mental aberration a man is like a tree  in a forest of his fellows he will grow as straight as his generic and individual nature permits alone in the open he yields to the deforming stresses and tortions that environ him  some such thoughts were in my mind as i watched the man from the shadow of my hat pulled low to shut out the firelight  a witless fellow no doubt but what could he be doing there in the heart of a desert  having undertaken to tell this story i wish that i could describe the mans appearance that would be a natural thing to do unfortunately and somewhat strangely i find myself unable to do so with any degree of confidence for afterward no two of us agreed as to what he wore and how he looked and when i try to set down my own impressions they elude me  anyone can tell some kind of story narration is one of the elemental powers of the race  but the talent for description is a gift  nobody having broken silence the visitor went on to say  this country was not then what it is now  there was not a ranch between the gila and the gulf  there was a little game here and there in the mountains and near the infrequent waterholes grass enough to keep our animals from starvation  if we should be so fortunate as to encounter no indians we might get through  but within a week the purpose of the expedition had altered from discovery of wealth to preservation of life  we had gone too far to go back for what was ahead could be no worse than what was behind so we pushed on riding by night to avoid indians and the intolerable heat and concealing ourselves by day as best we could  sometimes having exhausted our supply of wild meat and emptied our casks we were days without food or drink then a waterhole or a shallow pool in the bottom of an arroyo so restored our strength and sanity that we were able to shoot some of the wild animals that sought it also sometimes it was a bear sometimes an antelope a coyote a cougar that was as god pleased all were food  one morning as we skirted a mountain range seeking a practicable pass we were attacked by a band of apaches who had followed our trail up a gulchit is not far from here  knowing that they outnumbered us ten to one they took none of their usual cowardly precautions but dashed upon us at a gallop firing and yelling fighting was out of the question  we urged our feeble animals up the gulch as far as there was footing for a hoof then threw ourselves out of our saddles and took to the chaparral on one of the slopes abandoning our entire outfit to the enemy  but we retained our rifles every manramon gallegos william shaw george w kent and berry davis  same old crowd said the humorist of our party  he was an eastern man unfamiliar with the decent observances of social intercourse  a gesture of disapproval from our leader silenced him and the stranger proceeded with his tale  the savages dismounted also and some of them ran up the gulch beyond the point at which we had left it cutting off further retreat in that direction and forcing us on up the side  unfortunately the chaparral extended only a short distance up the slope and as we came into the open ground above we took the fire of a dozen rifles but apaches shoot badly when in a hurry and god so willed it that none of us fell  twenty yards up the slope beyond the edge of the brush were vertical cliffs in which directly in front of us was a narrow opening  into that we ran finding ourselves in a cavern about as large as an ordinary room in a house  here for a time we were safe a single man with a repeating rifle could defend the entrance against all the apaches in the land  but against hunger and thirst we had no defense  courage we still had but hope was a memory  not one of those indians did we afterward see but by the smoke and glare of their fires in the gulch we knew that by day and by night they watched with ready rifles in the edge of the bushknew that if we made a sortie not a man of us would live to take three steps into the open  for three days watching in turn we held out before our suffering became insupportable  thenit was the morning of the fourth dayramon gallegos said  senores i know not well of the good god and what please him  i have live without religion and i am not acquaint with that of you pardon senores if i shock you but for me the time is come to beat the game of the apache  he knelt upon the rock floor of the cave and pressed his pistol against his temple  madre de dios he said comes now the soul of ramon gallegos  and so he left uswilliam shaw george w kent and berry davis  i was the leader  it was for me to speak  he was a brave man i saidhe knew when to die and how  it is foolish to go mad from thirst and fall by apache bullets or be skinned aliveit is in bad taste  let us join ramon gallegos  that is right said william shaw  that is right said george w kent  i straightened the limbs of ramon gallegos and put a handkerchief over his face  then william shaw said  i should like to look like thata little while  and george w kent said that he felt that way too  it shall be so i said  the red devils will wait a week william shaw and george w  kent draw and kneel  they did so and i stood before them  almighty god our father said i  almighty god our father said william shaw  almighty god our father said george w kent  forgive us our sins said i  forgive us our sins said they  and receive our souls  and receive our souls  amen  amen  i laid them beside ramon gallegos and covered their faces  there was a quick commotion on the opposite side of the campfire one of our party had sprung to his feet pistol in hand  and you he shoutedyou dared to escapeyou dare to be alive you cowardly hound ill send you to join them if i hang for it  but with the leap of a panther the captain was upon him grasping his wrist  hold it in sam yountsey hold it in  we were now all upon our feetexcept the stranger who sat motionless and apparently inattentive  some one seized yountseys other arm  captain i said there is something wrong here  this fellow is either a lunatic or merely a liarjust a plain everyday liar whom yountsey has no call to kill  if this man was of that party it had five members one of whomprobably himselfhe has not named  yes said the captain releasing the insurgent who sat down there is somethingunusual  years ago four dead bodies of white men scalped and shamefully mutilated were found about the mouth of that cave  they are buried there i have seen the graveswe shall all see them tomorrow  the stranger rose standing tall in the light of the expiring fire which in our breathless attention to his story we had neglected to keep going  there were four he saidramon gallegos william shaw george w kent and berry davis  with this reiterated rollcall of the dead he walked into the darkness and we saw him no more  at that moment one of our party who had been on guard strode in among us rifle in hand and somewhat excited  captain he said for the last halfhour three men have been standing out there on the mesa  he pointed in the direction taken by the stranger  i could see them distinctly for the moon is up but as they had no guns and i had them covered with mine i thought it was their move  they have made none but damn it they have got on to my nerves  go back to your post and stay till you see them again said the captain  the rest of you lie down again or ill kick you all into the fire  the sentinel obediently withdrew swearing and did not return  as we were arranging our blankets the fiery yountsey said  i beg your pardon captain but who the devil do you take them to be  ramon gallegos william shaw and george w kent  but how about berry davis  i ought to have shot him  quite needless you couldnt have made him any deader  go to sleep    footnotes  1  rough notes of this tale were found among the papers of the late leigh bierce  it is printed here with such revision only as the author might himself have made in transcription
