and nine counters four red and five grey  the envelope c can be had separately at 3d each  the author will be very grateful for suggestions especially from beginners in logic of any alterations or further explanations that may seem desirable  letters should be addressed to him at 29 bedford street covent garden london    preface    there foamd rebellious logic gaggd and bound   this game requires nine countersfour of one colour and five of another  say four red and five grey  besides the nine counters it also requires one player at least i am not aware of any game that can be played with less than this number  while there are several that require more  take cricket for instance which requires twentytwo  how much easier it is when you want to play a game to find one player than twentytwo at the same time though one player is enough a good deal more amusement may be got by two working at it together and correcting each others mistakes  a second advantage possessed by this game is that besides being an endless source of amusement the number of arguments that may be worked by it being infinite it will give the players a little instruction as well  but is there any great harm in that so long as you get plenty of amusement    contents   chapter                                page     i  new lamps for old          1  propositions                1          2  syllogisms

       all new cakes are nice  there are three propositions for youthe only three kinds we are going to use in this game  and the first thing to be done is to learn how to express them on the board  let us begin with  some new cakes are nice  but before doing so a remark has to be madeone that is rather important and by no means easy to understand all in a moment  so please to read this very carefully  the world contains many things such as buns babies beetles battledores c  and these things possess many attributes such as baked beautiful black broken c  in fact whatever can be attributed to that is said to belong to any thing is an attribute  whenever we wish to mention a thing we use a substantive  when we wish to mention an attribute we use an adjective  people have asked the question can a thing exist without any attributes belonging to it  it is a very puzzling question and im not going to try to answer it  let us turn up our noses and treat it with contemptuous silence as if it really wasnt worth noticing  but if they put it the other way and ask can an attribute exist without any thing for it to belong to we may say at once no  no more than a baby could go a railwayjourney with no one to take care of it  you never saw beautiful floating about in the air or littered about on the floor without any thing to be beautiful now did you  and now what am i driving at in all this long rigmarole  it is this  you may put is or are between names of two things for example some pigs are fat animals or between the names of two attributes for example pink is lightred and in each case it will make good sense  but if you put is or are between the name of a thing and the name of an attribute for example some pigs are pink you do not make good sense for how can a thing be an attribute unless you have an understanding with the person to whom you are speaking  and the simplest understanding would i think be thisthat the substantive shall be supposed to be repeated at the end of the sentence so that the sentence if written out in full would be some pigs are pink pigs  and now the word are makes quite good sense  thus in order to make good sense of the proposition some new cakes are nice we must suppose it to be written out in full in the form some new cakes are nice cakes  now this contains two termsnew cakes being one of them and nice cakes the other  new cakes being the one we are talking about is called the subject of the proposition and nice cakes the predicate also this proposition is said to be a particular one since it does not speak of the whole of its subject but only of a part of it  the other two kinds are said to be universal because they speak of the whole of their subjectsthe one denying niceness and the other asserting it of the whole class of new cakes  lastly if you would like to have a definition of the word proposition itself you may take thisa sentence stating that some or none or all of the things belonging to a certain class called its subject are also things belonging to a certain other class called its predicate  you will find these seven wordsproposition attribute term subject predicate particular universalcharmingly useful if any friend should happen to ask if you have ever studied logic mind you bring all seven words into your answer and you friend will go away deeply impresseda sadder and a wiser man  now please to look at the smaller diagram on the board and suppose it to be a cupboard intended for all the cakes in the world it would have to be a good large one of course  and let us suppose all the new ones to be put into the upper half marked x and all the rest that is the notnew ones into the lower half marked x  thus the lower half would contain elderly cakes aged cakes antediluvian cakesif there are any  i havent seen many myselfand so on  let us also suppose all the nice cakes to be put into the lefthand half marked y and all the rest that is the notnice ones into the righthand half marked y  at present then we must understand x to mean new x notnew y nice and y notnice  and now what kind of cakes would you expect to find in compartment no 5  it is part of the upper half you see so that if it has any cakes in it they must be new and it is part of the lefthand half so that they must be nice  hence if there are any cakes in this compartment they must have the double attribute new and nice or if we use letters the must be x y  observe that the letters x y are written on two of the edges of this compartment  this you will find a very convenient rule for knowing what attributes belong to the things in any compartment take no 7 for instance  if there are any cakes there they must be x y that is they must be notnew and nice  now let us make another agreementthat a red counter in a compartment shall mean that it is occupied that is that there are some cakes in it  the word some in logic means one or more so that a single cake in a compartment would be quite enough reason for saying there are some cakes here  also let us agree that a grey counter in a compartment shall mean that it is empty that is that there are no cakes in it  in the following diagrams i shall put 1 meaning one or more where you are to put a red counter and 0 meaning none where you are to put a grey one  as the subject of our proposition is to be new cakes we are only concerned at present with the upper half of the cupboard where all the cakes have the attribute x that is new  now fixing our attention on this upper half suppose we found it marked like this                                                                                 1                                                                 that is with a red counter in no 5  what would this tell us with regard to the class of new cakes  would it not tell us that there are some of them in the x ycompartment that is that some of them besides having the attribute x which belongs to both compartments have the attribute y that is nice this we might express by saying some xcakes are ycakes or putting words instead of letters   some new cakes are nice cakes   or in a shorter form   some new cakes are nice   at last we have found out how to represent the first proposition of this section  if you have not clearly understood all i have said go no further but read it over and over again till you do understand it  after that is once mastered you will find all the rest quite easy  it will save a little trouble in doing the other propositions if we agree to leave out the word cakes altogether  i find it convenient to call the whole class of things for which the cupboard is intended the universe  thus we might have begun this business by saying let us take a universe of cakes  sounds nice doesnt it  of course any other things would have done just as well as cakes we might make propositions about a universe of lizards or even a universe of hornets  wouldnt that be a charming universe to live in  so far then we have learned that                                                                                 1                                                                 means some x and y ie some new are nice  i think you will see without further explanation that                                                                                      1                                                            means some x are y ie some new are notnice  now let us put a grey counter into no 5 and ask ourselves the meaning of                                                                                 0                                                                 this tells us that the x ycompartment is empty which we may express by no x are y or no new cakes are nice  this is the second of the three propositions at the head of this section  in the same way                                                                                      0                                                            would mean no x are y or no new cakes are notnice  what would you make of this i wonder                                                                                 1    1                                                            i hope you will not have much trouble in making out that this represents a double proposition namely some x are y and some are y ie some new are nice and some are notnice  the following is a little harder perhaps                                                                                 0    0                                                            this means no x are y and none are y ie no new are nice and none are notnice which leads to the rather curious result that no new exist ie no cakes are new  this is because nice and notnice make what we call an exhaustive division of the class new cakes ie between them they exhaust the whole class so that all the new cakes that exist must be found in one or the other of them  and now suppose you had to represent with counters the contradictory to no cakes are new which would be some cakes are new or putting letters for words some cakes are x how would you do it  this will puzzle you a little i expect  evidently you must put a red counter somewhere in the xhalf of the cupboard since you know there are some new cakes  but you must not put it into the lefthand compartment since you do not know them to be nice nor may you put it into the righthand one since you do not know them to be notnice  what then are you to do  i think the best way out of the difficulty is to place the red counter on the divisionline between the xycompartment and the xycompartment  this i shall represent as i always put 1 where you are to put a red counter by the diagram                                                                                   1                                                              our ingenious american cousins have invented a phrase to express the position of a man who wants to join one or the other of two partiessuch as their two parties democrats and republicansbut cant make up his mind which  such a man is said to be sitting on the fence  now that is exactly the position of the red counter you have just placed on the divisionline  he likes the look of no 5 and he likes the look of no 6 and he doesnt know which to jump down into  so there he sits astride silly fellow dangling his legs one on each side of the fence  now i am going to give you a much harder one to make out  what does this mean                                                                                 1    0                                                            this is clearly a double proposition  it tells us not only that some x are y but also the no x are not y  hence the result is all x are y ie  all new cakes are nice which is the last of the three propositions at the head of this section  we see then that the universal proposition   all new cakes are nice   consists of two propositions taken together namely                some new cakes are nice         and no new cakes are notnice   in the same way                                                                                 0    1                                                            would mean all x are y  that is   all new cakes are notnice   now what would you make of such a proposition as the cake you have given me is nice  is it particular or universal   particular of course you readily reply  one single cake is hardly worth calling some even   no my dear impulsive reader it is universal  remember that few as they are and i grant you they couldnt well be fewer they are or rather it is all that you have given me  thus if leaving red out of the question i divide my universe of cakes into two classesthe cakes you have given me to which i assign the upper half of the cupboard and those you havent given me which are to go belowi find the lower half fairly full and the upper one as nearly as possible empty  and then when i am told to put an upright division into each half keeping the nice cakes to the left and the notnice ones to the right i begin by carefully collecting all the cakes you have given me saying to myself from time to time generous creature  how shall i ever repay such kindness and piling them up in the lefthand compartment  and it doesnt take long to do it  here is another universal proposition for you  barzillai beckalegg is an honest man  that means all the barzillai beckaleggs that i am now considering are honest men  you think i invented that name now dont you  but i didnt  its on a carriers cart somewhere down in cornwall  this kind of universal proposition where the subject is a single thing is called an individual proposition  now let us take nice cakes as the subject of proposition that is let us fix our thoughts on the lefthand half of the cupboard where all the cakes have attribute y that is nice                                                  suppose we find it marked like this                                                      1     what would that tell us                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      i hope that it is not necessary after explaining the horizontal oblong so fully to spend much time over the upright one  i hope you will see for yourself that this means some y are x that is   some nice cakes are new   but you will say we have had this case before  you put a red counter into no 5 and you told us it meant some new cakes are nice and now you tell us that it means some nice cakes are new can it mean both  the question is a very thoughtful one and does you great credit dear reader  it does mean both if you choose to take x that is new cakes as your subject and to regard no 5 as part of a horizontal oblong you may read it some x are y that is some new cakes are nice but if you choose to take y that is nice cake as your subject and to regard no 5 as part of an upright oblong then you may read it some y are x that is some nice cakes are new  they are merely two different ways of expressing the very same truth  without more words i will simply set down the other ways in which this upright oblong might be marked adding the meaning in each case  by comparing them with the various cases of the horizontal oblong you will i hope be able to understand them clearly  you will find it a good plan to examine yourself on this table by covering up first one column and then the other and dodging about as the children say  also you will do well to write out for yourself two other tablesone for the lower half of the cupboard and the other for its righthand half  and now i think we have said all we need to say about the smaller diagram and may go on to the larger one                           symbols               meanings                                                  some y are x                     ie some nice are notnew                                     1                                                                                     no y are x        0             ie no nice are new                               observe that this is merely another way of                      expressing no new are nice                                                                                                              no y are x                      ie no nice are notnew                                     0                                                                                           1         some y are x and some are x                     ie some nice are new and some are                         notnew                        1                                                                                           0         no y are x and none are x ie no y                       exist                  ie no cakes are nice                        0                                                                                           1         all y are x                       ie all nice are new                                     0                                                                                           0         all y are x                       ie all nice are notnew                                     1                                          this may be taken to be a cupboard divided in the same way as the last but also divided into two portions for the attribute m  let us give to m the meaning wholesome and let us suppose that all wholesome cakes are placed inside the central square and all the unwholesome ones outside it that is in one or other of the four queershaped outer compartments  we see that just as in the smaller diagram the cakes in each compartment had two attributes so here the cakes in each compartment have three attributes and just as the letters representing the two attributes were written on the edges of the compartment so here they are written at the corners  observe that m is supposed to be written at each of the four outer corners  so that we can tell in a moment by looking at a compartment what three attributes belong to the things in it  for instance take no 12  here we find x y m at the corners so we know that the cakes in it if there are any have the triple attribute xym that is new notnice and wholesome again take no 16  here we find at the corners x y m so the cakes in it are notnew notnice and unwholesome  remarkably untempting cakes  it would take far too long to go through all the propositions containing x and y x and m and y and m which can be represented on this diagram there are ninetysix altogether so i am sure you will excuse me and i must content myself with doing two or three as specimens  you will do well to work out a lot more for yourself  taking the upper half by itself so that our subject is new cakes how are we to represent no new cakes are wholesome  this is writing letters for words no x are m  now this tells us that none of the cakes belonging to the upper half of the cupboard are to be found inside the central square that is the two compartments no 11 and no 12 are empty  and this of course is represented by                                                                                                                                                 0    0                                                               and now how are we to represent the contradictory proposition some x are m  this is a difficulty i have already considered  i think the best way is to place a red counter on the divisionline between no 11 and no 12 and to understand this to mean that one of the two compartments is occupied but that we do not at present know which this i shall represent thus                                                                                                                                                   1                                                                now let us express all x are m  this consists we know of two propositions                    some x are m              and no x are m  let us express the negative part first  this tells us that none of the cakes belonging to the upper half of the cupboard are to be found outside the central square that is the two compartments no 9 and no 10 are empty  this of course is represented by                                          0              0                                                                                                                                                           but we have yet to represent some x are m  this tells us that there are some cakes in the oblong consisting of no 11 and no 12 so we place our red counter as in the previous example on the divisionline between no 11 and no 12 and the result is                                          0              0                                                                                         1                                                                 now let us try one or two interpretations  what are we to make of this with regard to x and y                                                         0                                                                                       1    0                                                               this tells us with regard to the xysquare that it is wholly empty since both compartments are so marked  with regard to the xysquare it tells us that it is occupied  true it is only one compartment of it that is so marked but that is quite enough whether the other be occupied or empty to settle the fact that there is something in the square  if then we transfer our marks to the smaller diagram so as to get rid of the msubdivisions we have a right to mark it                                                                                 1    0                                                            which means you know all x are y  the result would have been exactly the same if the given oblong had been marked thus                                          1              0                                                                                            0                                                               once more how shall we interpret this with regard to x and y                                          0              1                                                                                                                                                            this tells us as to the xysquare that one of its compartments is empty  but this information is quite useless as there is no mark in the other compartment  if the other compartment happened to be empty too the square would be empty and if it happened to be occupied the square would be occupied  so as we do not know which is the case we can say nothing about this square  the other square the xysquare we know as in the previous example to be occupied  if then we transfer our marks to the smaller diagram we get merely this                                                                                      1                                                            which means you know some x are y  these principles may be applied to all the other oblongs  for instance to represent all y are m we should mark the      righthand upright oblong the one            that has the attribute y thus                                                0                                           1                                        0                                                                                                                                       and if we were told to interpret the lower half of the cupboard marked as follows with regard to x and y                                                                                      0                                                                                       1              0                        we should transfer it to the smaller diagram thus                                                                                 1    0                                                            and read it all x are y  two more remarks about propositions need to be made  one is that in every proposition beginning with some or all the actual existence of the subject is asserted  if for instance i say all misers are selfish i mean that misers actually exist if i wished to avoid making this assertion and merely to state the law that miserliness necessarily involves selfishness i should say no misers are unselfish which does not assert that any misers exist at all but merely that if any did exist they would be selfish  the other is that when a proposition begins with some or no and contains more that two attributes these attributes may be rearranged and shifted from one term to the other ad libitum for example some abc are def may be rearranged as some bf are acde each being equivalent to some things are abcdef  again no wise old men are rash and reckless gamblers may be rearranged as no rash old gamblers are wise and reckless each being equivalent to no men are wise old rash reckless gamblers    2  syllogisms   now suppose we divide our universe of things in three ways with regard to three different attributes  out of these three attributes we may make up three different couples for instance if they were a b c we might make up the three couples ab ac bc  also suppose we have two propositions given us containing two of these three couples and that from them we can prove a third proposition containing the third couple  for example if we divide our universe for m x and y and if we have the two propositions given us no m are x and all m are y containing the two couples mx and my it might be possible to prove from them a third proposition containing x and y  in such a case we call the given propositions the premisses the third one the conclusion and the whole set a syllogism  evidently one of the attributes must occur in both premisses or else one must occur in one premiss and its contradictory in the other  in the first case when for example the premisses are some m are x and no m are y the term which occurs twice is called the middle term because it serves as a sort of link between the other two terms  in the second case when for example the premisses are no m are x and all m are y the two terms which contain these contradictory attributes may be called the middle terms  thus in the first case the class of mthings is the middle term and in the second case the two classes of mthings and mthings are the middle terms  the attribute which occurs in the middle term or terms disappears in the conclusion and is said to be eliminated which literally means turned out of doors  now let us try to draw a conclusion from the two premisses            some new cakes are unwholesome            no nice cakes are unwholesome  in order to express them with counters we need to divide cakes in three different ways with regard to newness to niceness and to wholesomeness  for this we must use the larger diagram making x mean new y nice and m wholesome  everything inside the central square is supposed to have the attribute m and everything outside it the attribute m ie notm  you had better adopt the rule to make m mean the attribute which occurs in the middle term or terms  i have chosen m as the symbol because middle begins with m  now in representing the two premisses i prefer to begin with the negative one the one beginning with no because grey counters can always be placed with certainty and will then help to fix the position of the red counters which are sometimes a little uncertain where they will be most welcome  let us express the no nice cakes are unwholesome cakes ie no ycakes are mcakes  this tells us that none of the cakes belonging to the yhalf of the cupboard are in its mcompartments ie the ones outside the central square  hence the two compartments no 9 and no 15 are both empty and we must place a grey counter in each of them thus                                           0                                                                                                                                                             0                                 we have now to express the other premiss namely some new cakes are unwholesome cakes ie  some xcakes are mcakes  this tells us that some of the cakes in the xhalf of the cupboard are in its mcompartments  hence one of the two compartments no 9 and no 10 is occupied and as we are not told in which of these two compartments to place the red counter the usual rule would be to lay it on the divisionline between them but in this case the other premiss has settled the matter for us by declaring no 9 to be empty  hence the red counter has no choice and must go into no 10 thus                                           0        1                                                                                                                                                    0                                 and now what counters will this information enable us to place in the smaller diagram so as to get some proposition involving x and y only leaving out m  let us take its four compartments one by one  first no 5  all we know about this is that its outer portion is empty but we know nothing about its inner portion  thus the square may be empty or it may have something in it  who can tell so we dare not place any counter in this square  secondly what of no 6  here we are a little better off  we know that there is something in it for there is a red counter in its outer portion  it is true we do not know whether its inner portion is empty or occupied but what does that matter  one solitary cake in one corner of the square is quite sufficient excuse for saying this square is occupied and for marking it with a red counter  as to no 7 we are in the same condition as with no 5we find it partly empty but we do not know whether the other part is empty or occupied so we dare not mark this square  and as to no 8 we have simply no information at all  the result is                                                1                                                                          our conclusion then must be got out of the rather meager piece of information that there is a red counter in the xysquare hence our conclusion is some x are y  ie some new cakes are notnice cakes or if you prefer to take y as your subject some notnice cakes are new cakes but the other looks neatest  we will now write out the whole syllogism putting the symbol there4 for therefore and omitting cakes for the sake of brevity at the end of each proposition  note from brett  the use of there4 is a rather arbitrary selection  there is no font available in general practice which renders the therefore symbol correction three dots in a triangular formation  this can be done however in html so if this document is read in a browser then the symbol will be properly recognized  this is a poor mans excuse            some new cakes are unwholesome            no nice cakes are unwholesome            there4 some new cakes are notnice  and you have now worked out successfully your first syllogism permit me to congratulate you and to express the hope that it is but the beginning of a long and glorious series of similar victories  we will work out one other syllogisma rather harder one than the lastand then i think you may be safely left to play the game by yourself or better with any friend whom you can find that is able and willing to take a share in the sport  let us see what we can make of the two premisses                 all dragons are uncanny                all scotchmen are canny   remember i dont guarantee the premisses to be facts  in the first place i never even saw a dragon and in the second place it isnt of the slightest consequence to us as logicians whether our premisses are true or false all we have to do is to make out whether they lead logically to the conclusion so that if they were true it would be true also  you see we must give up the cakes now or our cupboard will be of no use to us  we must take as our universe some class of things which will include dragons and scotchmen shall we say animals  and as canny is evidently the attribute belonging to the middle terms we will let m stand for canny x for dragons and y for scotchmen  so that our two premisses are in full      all dragonanimals are uncanny animals    all scotchmananimals are canny animals   and these may be expressed using letters for words thus                   all x are m                  all y are m   the first premiss consists as you already know of two parts                    some x are m              and no x are m   and the second also consists of two parts                    some y are m              and no y are m   let us take the negative portions first  we have then to mark on the larger diagram first no x are m and secondly no y are m  i think you will see without further explanation that the two results separately are                                               0                                              0  0                                                                                                                         0                                and that these two when combined give us                                           0                                                         0  0                                                                                                0                                 we have now to mark the two positive portions some x are m and some y are m  the only two compartments available for things which are xm are no 9 and no 10  of these no 9 is already marked as empty so our red counter must go into no 10  similarly the only two available for ym are no 11 and no 13 of these no 11 is already marked as empty so our red counter must go into no 13  the final result is                                           0        1                                                0  0                                            1                                                   0                                  and now how much of this information can usefully be transferred to the smaller diagram  let us take its four compartments one by one  as to no 5  this we see is wholly empty so mark it with a grey counter  as to no 6  this we see is occupied  so mark it with a red counter  as to no 7  ditto ditto  as to no 8  no information  the smaller diagram is now pretty liberally marked                                              0  1                                            1                             and now what conclusion can we read off from this  well it is impossible to pack such abundant information into one proposition we shall have to indulge in two this time  first by taking x as subject we get all x are y that is   all dragons are notscotchmen   secondly by taking y as subject we get all y are x that is   all scotchmen are notdragons   let us now write out all together our two premisses and our brace of conclusions           all dragons are uncanny          all scotchmen are canny          there4  all dragons are notscotchmen                   all scotchmen are notdragons   let me mention in conclusion that you may perhaps meet with logical treatises in which it is not assumed that any thing exists at all by some x are y is understood to mean the attributes x y are compatible so that a thing can have both at once and no x are y to mean the attributes x y are incompatible so that nothing can have both at once  in such treatises propositions have quite different meanings from what they have in our game of logic and it will be well to understand exactly what the difference is  first take some x are y  here we understand are to mean are as an actual factwhich of course implies that some xthings exist but they the writers of these other treatises only understand are to mean can be which does not at all imply that any exist so they mean less than we do our meaning includes theirs for of course some x are y includes some x can be y but theirs does not include ours  for example some welsh hippopotami are heavy would be true according to these writers since the attributes welsh and heavy are quite compatible in a hippopotamus but it would be false in our game since there are no welsh hippopotami to be heavy  secondly take no x are y  here we only understand are to mean are as an actual factwhich does not at all imply that no x can be y  but they understand the proposition to mean not only that none are y but that none can possibly be y  so they mean more than we do their meaning includes ours for of course no x can be y includes no x are y but ours does not include theirs for example no policemen are eight feet high would be true in our game since as an actual fact no such splendid specimens are ever found but it would be false according to these writers since the attributes belonging to the police force and eight feet high are quite compatible  there is nothing to prevent a policeman from growing to that height if sufficiently rubbed with rowlands macassar oilwhich said to make hair grow when rubbed on hair and so of course will make a policeman grow when rubbed on a policeman  thirdly take all x are y which consists of the two partial propositions some x are y and no x are y  here of course the treatises mean less than we do in the first part and more than we do in the second  but the two operations dont balance each otherany more than you can console a man for having knocked down one of his chimneys by giving him an extra doorstep  if you meet with syllogisms of this kind you may work them quite easily by the system i have given you you have only to make are mean are capable of being and all will go smoothly  for some x are y will become some x are capable of being y that is the attributes x y are compatible  and no x are y will become no x are capable of being y that is the attributes x y are incompatible  and of course all x are y will become some x are capable of being y and none are capable of being y that is the attributes x y are compatible and the attributes x y are incompatible  in using the diagrams for this system you must understand a red counter to mean there may possibly be something in this compartment and a grey one to mean there cannot possibly be anything in this compartment    3 fallacies   and so you think do you that the chief use of logic in real life is to deduce conclusions from workable premisses and to satisfy yourself that the conclusions deduced by other people are correct i only wish it were  society would be much less liable to panics and other delusions and political life especially would be a totally different thing if even a majority of the arguments that scattered broadcast over the world were correct  but it is all the other way i fear  for one workable pair of premisses i mean a pair that lead to a logical conclusion that you meet with in reading your newspaper or magazine you will probably find five that lead to no conclusion at all and even when the premisses are workable for one instance where the writer draws a correct conclusion there are probably ten where he draws an incorrect one  in the first case you may say the premisses are fallacious in the second the conclusion is fallacious  the chief use you will find in such logical skill as this game may teach you will be in detecting fallacies of these two kinds  the first kind of fallacyfallacious premissesyou will detect when after marking them on the larger diagram you try to transfer the marks to the smaller  you will take its four compartments one by one and ask for each in turn what mark can i place here and in every one the answer will be no information showing that there is no conclusion at all  for instance             all soldiers are brave            some englishmen are brave             there4 some englishmen are soldiers   looks uncommonly like a syllogism and might easily take in a less experienced logician  but you are not to be caught by such a trick  you would simply set out the premisses and would then calmly remark fallacious premisses you wouldnt condescend to ask what conclusion the writer professed to drawknowing that whatever it is it must be wrong  you would be just as safe as that wise mother was who said mary just go up to the nursery and see what babys doing and tell him not to do it  the other kind of fallacyfallacious conclusionyou will not detect till you have marked both diagrams and have read off the correct conclusion and have compared it with the conclusion which the writer has drawn  but mind you mustnt say fallacious conclusion simply because it is not identical with the correct one it may be a part of the correct conclusion and so be quite correct as far as it goes  in this case you would merely remark with a pitying smile defective conclusion suppose of example you were to meet with this syllogism              all unselfish people are generous             no misers are generous                  there4 no misers are unselfish   the premisses of which might be thus expressed in letters                  all x are m                 no y are m   here the correct conclusion would be all x are y that is all unselfish people are not misers while the conclusion drawn by the writer is no y are x which is the same as no x are y and so is part of all x are y  here you would simply say defective conclusion the same thing would happen if you were in a confectioners shop and if a little boy were to come in put down twopence and march off triumphantly with a single pennybun you would shake your head mournfully and would remark defective conclusion  poor little chap  and perhaps you would ask the young lady behind the counter whether she would let you eat the bun which the little boy had paid for and left behind him and perhaps she would reply shant  but if in the above example the writer had drawn the conclusion all misers are selfish that is all y are x this would be going beyond his legitimate rights since it would assert the existence of y which is not contained in the premisses and you would very properly say fallacious conclusion  now when you read other treatises on logic you will meet with various kinds of socalled fallacies which are by no means always so  for example if you were to put before one of these logicians the pair of premisses             no honest men cheat            no dishonest men are trustworthy   and were to ask him what conclusion followed he would probably say none at all  your premisses offend against two distinct rules and are as fallacious as they can well be  then suppose you were bold enough to say the conclusion is no men who cheat are trustworthy i fear your logical friend would turn away hastilyperhaps angry perhaps only scornful in any case the result would be unpleasant i advise you not to try the experiment  but why is this you will say  do you mean to tell us that all these logicians are wrong  far from it dear reader  from their point of view they are perfectly right  but they do not include in their system anything like all the possible forms of syllogisms  they have a sort of nervous dread of attributes beginning with a negative particle  for example such propositions as all notx are y no x are noty are quite outside their system  and thus having from sheer nervousness excluded a quantity of very useful forms they have made rules which though quite applicable to the few forms which they allow of are no use at all when you consider all possible forms  let us not quarrel with them dear reader  there is room enough in the world for both of us  let us quietly take our broader system and if they choose to shut their eyes to all these useful forms and to say they are not syllogisms at all we can but stand aside and let them rush upon their fate  there is scarcely anything of yours upon which it is so dangerous to rush as your fate  you may rush upon your potatobeds or your strawberrybeds without doing much harm you may even rush upon your balcony unless it is a new house built by contract and with no clerk of the works and may survive the foolhardy enterprise but if you once rush upon your fatewhy you must take the consequences      chapter ii  cross questions          the man in the wilderness asked of me          how many

thing is called an attribute  for example baked which can frequently be attributed to buns and beautiful which can seldom be attributed to babies  2  when they are the names of two things for example these pigs are fat animals or of two attributes for example pink is light red  3  when one is the name of a thing and the other the name of an attribute for example these pigs are pink since a thing cannot actually be an attribute  4  that the substantive shall be supposed to be repeated at the end of the sentence for example these pigs are pink pigs  5  a proposition is a sentence stating that some or none or all of the things belonging to a certain class called the subject are also things belonging to a certain other class called the predicate  for example some new cakes are not nice that is written in full some new cakes are not nice cakes where the class new cakes is the subject and the class notnice cakes is the predicate  6  a proposition stating that some of the things belonging to its subject are soandso is called particular  for example some new cakes are nice some new cakes are not nice  a proposition stating that none of the things belonging to its subject or that all of them are soandso is called universal for example no new cakes are nice all new cakes are not nice  7  the things in each compartment possess two attributes whose symbols will be found written on two of the edges of that compartment  8  one or more  9  as a name of the class of things to which the whole diagram is assigned  10  a proposition containing two statements  for example some new cakes are nice and some are notnice  11  when the whole class thus divided is exhausted among the sets into which it is divided there being no member of it which does not belong to some one of them  for example the class new cakes is exhaustively divided into nice and notnice since every new cake must be one or the other  12  when a man cannot make up his mind which of two parties he will join he is said to be sitting on the fencenot being able to decide on which side he will jump down  13  some x are y and no x are y  14  a proposition whose subject is a single thing is called individual  for example i am happy john is not at home these are universal propositions being the same as all the is that exist are happy all the johns that i am now considering are not at home  15  propositions beginning with some or all  16  when they begin with some or no  for example some abc are def may be rearranged as some bf are acde each being equivalent to some abcdef exist  17  some tigers are fierce no tigers are notfierce  18  some hardboiled eggs are unwholesome no hardboiled eggs are wholesome  19  some is are happy no is are unhappy  20  some johns are not at home no johns are at home  21  the things in each compartment of the larger diagram possess three attributes whose symbols will be found written at three of the corners of the compartment except in the case of m which is not actually inserted in the diagram but is supposed to stand at each of its four outer corners  22  if the universe of things be divided with regard to three different attributes and if two propositions be given containing two different couples of these attributes and if from these we can prove a third proposition containing the two attributes that have not yet occurred together the given propositions are called the premisses the third one the conclusion and the whole set a syllogism  for example the premisses might be no m are x and all m are y and it might be possible to prove from them a conclusion containing x and y  23  if an attribute occurs in both premisses the term containing it is called the middle term  for example if the premisses are some m are x and no m are y the class of mthings is the middle term  if an attribute occurs in one premiss and its contradictory in the other the terms containing them may be called the middle terms for example if the premisses are no m are x and all m are y the two classes of mthings and mthings may be called the middle terms  24  because they can be marked with certainty whereas affirmative propositions that is those that begin with some or all sometimes require us to place a red counter sitting on a fence  25  because the only question we are concerned with is whether the conclusion follows logically from the premisses so that if they were true it also would be true  26  by understanding a red counter to mean this compartment can be occupied and a grey one to mean this compartment cannot be occupied or this compartment must be empty  27  fallacious premisses and fallacious conclusion  28  by finding when we try to transfer marks from the larger diagram to the smaller that there is no information for any of its four compartments  29  by finding the correct conclusion and then observing that the conclusion offered to us is neither identical with it nor a part of it  30  when the offered conclusion is part of the correct conclusion in this case we may call it a defective conclusion     2  half of smaller diagram    propositions represented

91  everybody has seen a pig nobody admires a pig     extract a pair of premisses out of each of the following and deduce the conclusion if there is one  92  the lion as any one can tell you who has been chased by them as often as i have is a very savage animal and there are certain individuals among them though i will not guarantee it as a general law who do not drink coffee  93  it was most absurd of you to offer it  you might have known if you had had any sense that no old sailors ever like gruel  but i thought as he was an uncle of yours  an uncle of mine indeed  stuff  you may call it stuff if you like  all i know is my uncles are all old men and they like gruel like anything  well then your uncles are  94  do come away  i cant stand this squeezing any more  no crowded shops are comfortable you know very well  well who expects to be comfortable out shopping  why i do of course  and im sure there are some shops further down the street that are not crowded  so  95  they say no doctors are metaphysical organists and that lets me into a little fact about you you know  why how do you make that out  you never heard me play the organ  no doctor but ive heard you talk about brownings poetry and that showed me that youre metaphysical at any rate  so    extract a syllogism out of each of the following and test its correctness  96  dont talk to me  ive known more rich merchants than you have and i can tell you not one of them was ever an old miser since the world began  and what has that got to do with old mr brown  why isnt he very rich  yes of course he is  and what then  why dont you see that its absurd to call him a miserly merchant either hes not a merchant or hes not a miser  97  it is so kind of you to enquire  im really feeling a great deal better today  and is it nature or art that is to have the credit of this happy change  art i think  the doctor has given me some of that patent medicine of his  well ill never call him a humbug again  theres somebody at any rate that feels better after taking his medicine  98  no i dont like you one bit  and ill go and play with my doll  dolls are never unkind  so you like a doll better than a cousin  oh you little silly  of course i do  cousins are never kindat least no cousins ive ever seen  well and what does that prove id like to know  if you mean that cousins arent dolls who ever said they were  99  what are you talking about geraniums for  you cant tell one flower from another at this distance  i grant you theyre all red flowers it doesnt need a telescope to know that  well some geraniums are red arent they  i dont deny it  and what then  i suppose youll be telling me some of those flowers are geraniums  of course thats what i should tell you if youd the sense to follow an argument  but whats the good of proving anything to you i should like to know  100  boys youve passed a fairly good examination all things considered  now let me give you a word of advice before i go remember that all who are really anxious to learn work hard  i thank you sir in the name of my scholars  and proud am i to think there are some of them at least that are really anxious to learn  very glad to hear it and how do you make it out to be so  why sir i know how hard they worksome of them that is  who should know better    extract from the following speech a series of syllogisms or arguments having the form of syllogisms and test their correctness  it is supposed to be spoken by a fond mother in answer to a friends cautious suggestion that she is perhaps a little overdoing it in the way of lessons with her children  101  well theyve got their own way to make in the world  we cant leave them a fortune apiece  and moneys not to be had as you know without moneys worth they must work if they want to live  and how are they to work if they dont know anything  take my word for it theres no place for ignorance in these times  and all authorities agree that the time to learn is when youre young ones got no memory afterwards worth speaking of  a child will learn more in an hour than a grown man in five  so those that have to learn must learn when theyre young if ever theyre to learn at all  of course that doesnt do unless children are healthy i quite allow that  well the doctor tells me no children are healthy unless theyve got a good colour in their cheeks  and only just look at my darlings  why their cheeks bloom like peonies well now they tell me that to keep children in health you should never give them more than six hours altogether at lessons in the day and at least two halfholidays in the week  and thats exactly our plan i can assure you  we never go beyond six hours and every wednesday and saturday as ever is not one syllable of lessons do they do after their one oclock dinner  so how you can imagine im running any risk in the education of my precious pets is more than i can understand i promise you     the end
