70064453	abraham lincoln by james russell lowell   there have been many painful crises since the impatient vanity of south carolina hurried ten prosperous commonwealths into a crime whose assured retribution was to leave them either at the mercy of the nation they had wronged or of the anarchy they had summoned but could not control when no thoughtful american opened his morning paper without dreading to find that he had no longer a country to love and honor  whatever the result of the convulsion whose first shocks were beginning to be felt there would still be enough square miles of earth for elbowroom but that ineffable sentiment made up of memory and hope of instinct and tradition which swells every mans heart and shapes his thought though perhaps never present to his consciousness would be gone from it leaving it common earth and nothing more  men might gather rich crops from it but that ideal harvest of priceless associations would be reaped no longer that fine virtue which sent up messages of courage and security from every sod of it would have evaporated beyond recall  we should be irrevocably cut off from our past and be forced to splice the ragged ends of our lives upon whatever new conditions chance might leave dangling for us  we confess that we had our doubts at first whether the patriotism of our people were not too narrowly provincial to embrace the proportions of national peril  we felt an only too natural distrust of immense public meetings and enthusiastic cheers  that a reaction should follow the holiday enthusiasm with which the war was entered on that it should follow soon and that the slackening of public spirit should be proportionate to the previous overtension might well be foreseen by all who had studied human nature or history  men acting gregariously are always in extremes as they are one moment capable of higher courage so they are liable the next to baser depression and it is often a matter of chance whether numbers shall multiply confidence or discouragement  nor does deception lead more surely to distrust of men than selfdeception to suspicion of principles  the only faith that wears well and holds its color in all weathers is that which is woven of conviction and set with the sharp mordant of experience  enthusiasm is good material for the orator but the statesman needs something more durable to work inmust be able to rely on the deliberate reason and consequent firmness of the people without which that presence of mind no less essential in times of moral than of material peril will be wanting at the critical moment  would this fervor of the free states hold out  was it kindled by a just feeling of the value of constitutional liberty  had it body enough to withstand the inevitable dampening of checks reverses delays  had our population intelligence enough to comprehend that the choice was between order and anarchy between the equilibrium of a government by law and the tussle of misrule by pronunciamiento  could a war be maintained without the ordinary stimulus of hatred and plunder and with the impersonal loyalty of principle  these were serious questions and with no precedent to aid in answering them  at the beginning of the war there was indeed occasion for the most anxious apprehension  a president known to be infected with the political heresies and suspected of sympathy with the treason of the southern conspirators had just surrendered the reins we will not say of power but of chaos to a successor known only as the representative of a party whose leaders with long training in opposition had none in the conduct of affairs an empty treasury was called on to supply resources beyond precedent in the history of finance the trees were yet growing and the iron unmined with which a navy was to be built and armored officers without discipline were to make a mob into an army and above all the public opinion of europe echoed and reinforced with every vague hint and every specious argument of despondency by a powerful faction at home was either contemptuously sceptical or actively hostile  it would be hard to overestimate the force of this latter element of disintegration and discouragement among a people where every citizen at home and every soldier in the field is a reader of newspapers  the peddlers of rumor in the north were the most effective allies of the rebellion  a nation can be liable to no more insidious treachery than that of the telegraph sending hourly its electric thrill of panic along the remotest nerves of the community till the excited imagination makes every real danger loom heightened with its unreal double  and even if we look only at more palpable difficulties the problem to be solved by our civil war was so vast both in its immediate relations and its future consequences the conditions of its solution were so intricate and so greatly dependent on incalculable and uncontrollable contingencies so many of the data whether for hope or fear were from their novelty incapable of arrangement under any of the categories of historical precedent that there were moments of crisis when the firmest believer in the strength and sufficiency of the democratic theory of government might well hold his breath in vague apprehension of disaster  our teachers of political philosophy solemnly arguing from the precedent of some petty grecian italian or flemish city whose long periods of aristocracy were broken now and then by awkward parentheses of mob had always taught us that democracies were incapable of the sentiment of loyalty of concentrated and prolonged effort of far reaching conceptions were absorbed in material interests impatient of regular and much more of exceptional restraint had no natural nucleus of gravitation nor any forces but centrifugal were always on the verge of civil war and slunk at last into the natural almshouse of bankrupt popular government a military despotism  here was indeed a dreary outlook for persons who knew democracy not by rubbing shoulders with it lifelong but merely from books and america only by the report of some fellowbriton who having eaten a bad dinner or lost a carpetbag here had written to the times demanding redress and drawing a mournful inference of democratic instability  nor were men wanting among ourselves who had so steeped their brains in london literature as to mistake cockneyism for european culture and contempt of their country for cosmopolitan breadth of view and who owing all they had an all they were to democracy thought it had an air of highbreeding to join in the shallow epicedium that our bubble had burst  but beside any disheartening influences which might affect the timid or the despondent there were reasons enough of settled gravity against any overconfidence of hope  a warwhich whether we consider the expanse of the territory at stake the hosts brought into the field or the reach of the principles involved may fairly be reckoned the most momentous of modern timeswas to be waged by a people divided at home unnerved by fifty years of peace under a chief magistrate without experience and without reputation whose every measure was sure to be cunningly hampered by a jealous and unscrupulous minority and who while dealing with unheardof complications at home must soothe a hostile neutrality abroad waiting only a pretext to become war  all this was to be done without warning and without preparation while at the same time a social revolution was to be accomplished in the political condition of four millions of people by softening the prejudices allaying the fears and gradually obtaining the cooperation of their unwilling liberators  surely if ever there were an occasion when the heightened imagination of the historian might see destiny visibly intervening in human affairs here was a knot worthy of her shears  never perhaps was any system of government tried by so continuous and searching a strain as ours during the last three years never has any shown itself stronger and never could that strength be so directly traced to the virtue and intelligence of the peopleto that general enlightenment and prompt efficiency of public opinion possible only under the influence of a political framework like our own  we find it hard to understand how even a foreigner should be blind to the grandeur of the combat of ideas that has been going on hereto the heroic energy persistency and selfreliance of a nation proving that it knows how much dearer greatness is than mere power and we own that it is impossible for us to conceive the mental and moral condition of the american who does not feel his spirit braced and heightened by being even a spectator of such qualities and achievements  that a steady purpose and a definite aim have been given to the jarring forces which at the beginning of the war spent themselves in the discussion of schemes which could only become operative if at all after the war was over that a popular excitement has been slowly intensified into an earnest national will that a somewhat impracticable moral sentiment has been made the unconscious instrument of a practical moral end that the treason of covert enemies the jealousy of rivals the unwise zeal of friends have been made not only useless for mischief but even useful for good that the conscientious sensitiveness of england to the horrors of civil conflict has been prevented from complicating a domestic with a foreign warall these results any one of which might suffice to prove greatness in a ruler have been mainly due to the good sense the goodhumor the sagacity the largemindedness and the unselfish honesty of the unknown man whom a blind fortune as it seemed had lifted from the crowd to the most dangerous and difficult eminence of modern times  it is by presence of mind in untried emergencies that the native metal of a man is tested it is by the sagacity to see and the fearless honesty to admit whatever of truth there may be in an adverse opinion in order more convincingly to expose the fallacy that lurks behind it that a reasoner at length gains for his mere statement of a fact the force of argument it is by a wise forecast which allows hostile combinations to go so far as by the inevitable reaction to become elements of his own power that a politician proves his genius for statecraft and especially it is by so gently guiding public sentiment that he seems to follow it by so yielding doubtful points that he can be firm without seeming obstinate in essential ones and thus gain the advantages of compromise without the weakness of concession by so instinctively comprehending the temper and prejudices of a people as to make them gradually conscious of the superior wisdom of his freedom from temper and prejudiceit is by qualities such as these that a magistrate shows himself worthy to be chief in a commonwealth of freemen  and it is for qualities such as these that we firmly believe history will rank mr lincoln among the most prudent of statesmen and the most successful of rulers  if we wish to appreciate him we have only to conceive the inevitable chaos in which we should now be weltering had a weak man or an unwise one been chosen in his stead  bare is back says the norse proverb without brother behind it and this is by analogy true of an elective magistracy  the hereditary ruler in any critical emergency may reckon on the inexhaustible resources of prestige of sentiment of superstition of dependent interest while the new man must slowly and painfully create all these out of the unwilling material around him by superiority of character by patient singleness of purpose by sagacious presentiment of popular tendencies and instinctive sympathy with the national character  mr lincolns task was one of peculiar and exceptional difficulty  long habit had accustomed the american people to the notion of a party in power and of a president as its creature and organ while the more vital fact that the executive for the time being represents the abstract idea of government as a permanent principle superior to all party and all private interest had gradually become unfamiliar  they had so long seen the public policy more or less directed by views of party and often even of personal advantage as to be ready to suspect the motives of a chief magistrate compelled for the first time in our history to feel himself the head and hand of a great nation and to act upon the fundamental maxim laid down by all publicists that the first duty of a government is to depend and maintain its own existence  accordingly a powerful weapon seemed to be put into the hands of the opposition by the necessity under which the administration found itself of applying this old truth to new relations  nor were the opposition his only nor his most dangerous opponents  the republicans had carried the country upon an issue in which ethics were more directly and visibly mingled with politics than usual  their leaders were trained to a method of oratory which relied for its effect rather on the moral sense than the understanding  their arguments were drawn not so much from experience as from general principles of right and wrong  when the war came their system continued to be applicable and effective for here again the reason of the people was to be reached and kindled through their sentiments  it was one of those periods of excitement gathering contagious universal which while they last exalt and clarify the minds of men giving to the mere words country human rights democracy a meaning and a force beyond that of sober and logical argument  they were convictions maintained and defended by the supreme logic of passion  that penetrating fire ran in and roused those primary instincts that make their lair in the dens and caverns of the mind  what is called the great popular heart was awakened that indefinable something which may be according to circumstances the highest reason or the most brutish unreason  but enthusiasm once cold can never be warmed over into anything better than cantand phrases when once the inspiration that filled them with beneficent power has ebbed away retain only that semblance of meaning which enables them to supplant reason in hasty minds  among the lessons taught by the french revolution there is none sadder or more striking than this that you may make everything else out of the passions of men except a political system that will work and that there is nothing so pitilessly and unconsciously cruel as sincerity formulated into dogma it is always demoralizing to extend the domain of sentiment over questions where it has no legitimate jurisdiction and perhaps the severest strain upon mr lincoln was in resisting a tendency of his own supporters which chimed with his own private desires while wholly opposed to his convictions of what would be wise policy  the change which three years have brought about is too remarkable to be passed over without comment too weighty in its lesson not to be laid to heart  never did a president enter upon office with less means at his command outside his own strength of heart and steadiness of understanding for inspiring confidence in the people and so winning it for himself than mr lincoln  all that was known of him was that he was a good stumpspeaker nominated for his availabilitythat is because he had no historyand chosen by a party with whose more extreme opinions he was not in sympathy  it might well be feared that a man past fifty against whom the ingenuity of hostile partisans could rake up no accusation must be lacking in manliness of character in decision of principle in strength of will that a man who was at best only the representative of a party and who yet did not fairly represent even that would fail of political much more of popular support  and certainly no one ever entered upon office with so few resources of power in the past and so many materials of weakness in the present as mr lincoln  even in that half of the union which acknowledged him as president there was a large and at that time dangerous minority that hardly admitted his claim to the office and even in the party that elected him there was also a large minority that suspected him of being secretly a communicant with the church of laodicea1  all he did was sure to be virulently attacked as ultra by one side all that he left undone to be stigmatized as proof of lukewarmness and backsliding by the other  meanwhile he was to carry on a truly colossal war by means of both he was to disengage the country from diplomatic entanglements of unprecedented peril undisturbed by the help or the hindrance of either and to win from the crowning dangers of his administration in the confidence of the people the means of his safety and their own  he has contrived to do it and perhaps none of our presidents since washington has stood so firm in the confidence of the people as he does after three years of stormy administration  1 see revelation chapter 3 verse 15  mr lincolns policy was a tentative one and rightly so  he laid down no programme which must compel him to be either inconsistent or unwise no castiron theorem to which circumstances must be fitted as they rose or else be useless to his ends  he seemed to have chosen mazarins motto le temps et moi1   the moi to be sure was not very prominent at first but it has grown more and more so till the world is beginning to be persuaded that it stands for a character of marked individuality and capacity for affairs  time was his primeminister and we began to think at one period his generalinchief also  at first he was so slow that he tired out all those who see no evidence of progress but in blowing up the engine then he was so fast that he took the breath away from those who think there is no getting on safety while there is a spark of fire under the boilers  god is the only being who has time enough but a prudent man who knows how to seize occasion can commonly make a shift to find as much as he needs  mr lincoln as it seems to us in reviewing his career though we have sometimes in our impatience thought otherwise has always waited as a wise man should till the right moment brought up all his reserves  semper nocuit differre paratis2 is a sound axiom but the really efficacious man will also be sure to know when he is not ready and be firm against all persuasion and reproach till he is  1 time and i   cardinal mazarin was primeminister of louis xiv of france  time mazarin said was his primeminister 2  it is always bad for those who are ready to put off action  one would be apt to think from some of the criticisms made on mr lincolns course by those who mainly agree with him in principle that the chief object of a statesman should be rather to proclaim his adhesion to certain doctrines than to achieve their triumph by quietly accomplishing his ends  in our opinion there is no more unsafe politician than a conscientiously rigid doctrinaire nothing more sure to end in disaster than a theoretic scheme of policy that admits of no pliability for contingencies  true there is a popular image of an impossible he in whose plastic hands the submissive destinies of mankind become as wax and to whose commanding necessity the toughest facts yield with the graceful pliancy of fiction but in real life we commonly find that the men who control circumstances as it is called are those who have learned to allow for the influence of their eddies and have the nerve to turn them to account at the happy instant  mr lincolns perilous task has been to carry a rather shaky raft through the rapids making fast the unrulier logs as he could snatch opportunity and the country is to be congratulated that he did not think it his duty to run straight at all hazards but cautiously to assure himself with his settingpole where the main current was and keep steadily to that  he is still in wild water but we have faith that his skill and sureness of eye will bring him out right at last  a curious and as we think not inapt parallel might be drawn between mr lincoln and one of the most striking figures in modern historyhenry iv of france  the career of the latter may be more picturesque as that of a daring captain always is but in all its vicissitudes there is nothing more romantic than that sudden change as by a rub of aladdins lamp from the attorneys office in a country town of illinois to the helm of a great nation in times like these  the analogy between the characters and circumstances of the two men is in many respects singularly close  succeeding to a rebellion rather than a crown henrys chief material dependence was the huguenot party whose doctrines sat upon him with a looseness distasteful certainly if not suspicious to the more fanatical among them  king only in name over the greater part of france and with his capital barred against him it yet gradually became clear to the more farseeing even of the catholic party that he was the only centre of order and legitimate authority round which france could reorganize itself  while preachers who held the divine right of kings made the churches of paris ring with declamations in favor of democracy rather than submit to the heretic dog of bearnois1much as our soidisant democrats have lately been preaching the divine right of slavery and denouncing the heresies of the declaration of independence henry bore both parties in hand till he was convinced that only one course of action could possibly combine his own interests and those of france  meanwhile the protestants believed somewhat doubtfully that he was theirs the catholics hoped somewhat doubtfully that he would be theirs and henry himself turned aside remonstrance advice and curiosity alike with a jest or a proverb if a little high he liked them none the worse joking continually as his manner was  we have seen mr lincoln contemptuously compared to sancho panza by persons incapable of appreciating one of the deepest pieces of wisdom in the profoundest romance ever written namely that while don quixote was incomparable in theoretic and ideal statesmanship sancho with his stock of proverbs the ready money of human experience made the best possible practical governor  henry iv was as full of wise saws and modern instances as mr lincoln but beneath all this was the thoughtful practical humane and thoroughly earnest man around whom the fragments of france were to gather themselves till she took her place again as a planet of the first magnitude in the european system  in one respect mr lincoln was more fortunate than henry  however some may think him wanting in zeal the most fanatical can find no taint of apostasy in any measure of his nor can the most bitter charge him with being influenced by motives of personal interest  the leading distinction between the policies of the two is one of circumstances  henry went over to the nation mr lincoln has steadily drawn the nation over to him  one left a united france the other we hope and believe will leave a reunited america  we leave our readers to trace the further points of difference and resemblance for themselves merely suggesting a general similarity which has often occurred to us  one only point of melancholy interest we will allow ourselves to touch upon  that mr lincoln is not handsome nor elegant we learn from certain english tourists who would consider similar revelations in regard to queen victoria as thoroughly american in the want of bienseance   it is no concern of ours nor does it affect his fitness for the high place he so worthily occupies but he is certainly as fortunate as henry in the matter of good looks if we may trust contemporary evidence  mr lincoln has also been reproached with americanism by some not unfriendly british critics but with all deference we cannot say that we like him any the worse for it or see in it any reason why he should govern americans the less wisely  1 one of henrys titles was prince of bearn that being the old province of france from which he came  people of more sensitive organizations may be shocked but we are glad that in this our true war of independence which is to free us forever from the old world we have had at the head of our affairs a man whom america made as god made adam out of the very earth unancestried unprivileged unknown to show us how much truth how much magnanimity and how much statecraft await the call of opportunity in simple manhood when it believes in the justice of god and the worth of man  conventionalities are all very well in their proper place but they shrivel at the touch of nature like stubble in the fire  the genius that sways a nation by its arbitrary will seems less august to us than that which multiplies and reinforces itself in the instincts and convictions of an entire people  autocracy may have something in it more melodramatic than this but falls far short of it in human value and interest  experience would have bred in us a rooted distrust of improved statesmanship even if we did not believe politics to be a science which if it cannot always command men of special aptitude and great powers at least demands the long and steady application of the best powers of such men as it can command to master even its first principles  it is curious that in a country which boasts of its intelligence the theory should be so generally held that the most complicated of human contrivances and one which every day becomes more complicated can be worked at sight by any man able to talk for an hour or two without stopping to think  mr lincoln is sometimes claimed as an example of a readymade ruler  but no case could well be less in point for besides that he was a man of such fairmindedness as is always the raw material of wisdom he had in his profession a training precisely the opposite of that to which a partisan is subjected his experience as a lawyer compelled him not only to see that there is a principle underlying every phenomenon in human affairs but that there are always two sides to every question both of which must be fully understood in order to understand either and that it is of greater advantage to an advocate to appreciate the strength than the weakness of his antagonists position  nothing is more remarkable than the unerring tact with which in his debate with mr douglas he went straight to the reason of the question nor have we ever had a more striking lesson in political tactics than the fact that opposed to a man exceptionally adroit in using popular prejudice and bigotry to his purpose exceptionally unscrupulous in appealing to those baser motives that turn a meeting of citizens into a mob of barbarians he should yet have won his case before a jury of the people  mr lincoln was as far as possible from an impromptu politician  his wisdom was made up of a knowledge of things as well as of men his sagacity resulted from a clear perception and honest acknowledgment of difficulties which enabled him to see that the only durable triumph of political opinion is based not on any abstract right but upon so much of justice the highest attainable at any given moment in human affairs as may be had in the balance of mutual concession  doubtless he had an ideal but it was the ideal of a practical statesmanto aim at the best and to take the next best if he is lucky enough to get even that  his slow but singularly masculine intelligence taught him that precedent is only another name for embodied experience and that it counts for even more in the guidance of communities of men than in that of the individual life  he was not a man who held it good public economy to pull down on the mere chance of rebuilding better  mr lincolns faith in god was qualified by a very wellfounded distrust of the wisdom of man  perhaps it was his want of selfconfidence that more than anything else won him the unlimited confidence of the people for they felt that there would be no need of retreat from any position he had deliberately taken  the cautious but steady advance of his policy during the war was like that of a roman army  he left behind him a firm road on which public confidence could follow he took america with him where he went what he gained he occupied and his advanced posts became colonies  the very homeliness of his genius was its distinction  his kingship was conspicuous by its workday homespun  never was ruler so absolute as he nor so little conscious of it for he was the incarnate commonsense of the people  with all that tenderness of nature whose sweet sadness touched whoever saw him with something of its own pathos there was no trace of sentimentalism in his speech or action  he seems to have had one rule of conduct always that of practical and successful politics to let himself be guided by events when they were sure to bring him out where he wished to go though by what seemed to unpractical minds which let go the possible to grasp at the desirable a longer road  undoubtedly the highest function of statesmanship is by degrees to accommodate the conduct of communities to ethical laws and to subordinate the conflicting selfinterests of the day to higher and more permanent concerns  but it is on the understanding and not on the sentiment of a nation that all safe legislation must be based  voltaires saying that a consideration of petty circumstances is the tomb of great things may be true of individual men but it certainly is not true of governments  it is by a multitude of such considerations each in itself trifling but all together weighty that the framers of policy can alone divine what is practicable and therefore wise  the imputation of inconsistency is one to which every sound politician and every honest thinker must sooner or later subject himself  the foolish and the dead alone never change their opinion  the course of a great statesman resembles that of navigable rivers avoiding immovable obstacles with noble bends of concession seeking the broad levels of opinion on which men soonest settle and longest dwell following and marking the almost imperceptible slopes of national tendency yet always aiming at direct advances always recruited from sources nearer heaven and sometimes bursting open paths of progress and fruitful human commerce through what seem the eternal barriers of both  it is loyalty to great ends even though forced to combine the small and opposing motives of selfish men to accomplish them it is the anchored cling to solid principles of duty and action which knows how to swing with the tide but is never carried away by itthat we demand in public men and not sameness of policy or a conscientious persistency in what is impracticable  for the impracticable however theoretically enticing is always politically unwise sound statesmanship being the application of that prudence to the public business which is the safest guide in that of private men  no doubt slavery was the most delicate and embarrassing question with which mr lincoln was called on to deal and it was one which no man in his position whatever his opinions could evade for though he might withstand the clamor of partisans he must sooner or later yield to the persistent importunacy of circumstances which thrust the problem upon him at every turn and in every shape  it has been brought against us as an accusation abroad and repeated here by people who measure their country rather by what is thought of it than by what is that our war has not been distinctly and avowedly for the extinction of slavery but a war rather for the preservation of our national power and greatness in which the emancipation of the negro has been forced upon us by circumstances and accepted as a necessity  we are very far from denying this nay we admit that it is so far true that we were slow to renounce our constitutional obligations even toward those who had absolved us by their own act from the letter of our duty  we are speaking of the government which legally installed for the whole country was bound so long as it was possible not to overstep the limits of orderly prescription and could not without abnegating its own very nature take the lead off a virginia reel  they forgot what should be forgotten least of all in a system like ours that the administration for the time being represents not only the majority which elects it but the minority as wella minority in this case powerful and so little ready for emancipation that it was opposed even to war  mr lincoln had not been chosen as general agent of the an antislavery society but president of the united states to perform certain functions exactly defined by law  whatever were his wishes it was no less duty than policy to mark out for himself a line of action that would not further distract the country by raising before their time questions which plainly would soon enough compel attention and for which every day was making the answer more easy  meanwhile he must solve the riddle of this new sphinx or be devoured  though mr lincolns policy in this critical affair has not been such as to satisfy those who demand an heroic treatment for even the most trifling occasion and who will not cut their coat according to their cloth unless they can borrow the scissors of atropos1 it has been at least not unworthy of the longheaded king of ithaca2  mr lincoln had the choice of bassanio3 offered him  which of the three caskets held the prize that was to redeem the fortunes of the country  there was the golden one whose showy speciousness might have tempted a vain man the silver of compromise which might have decided the choice of a merely acute one and the leadendull and homelylooking as prudence always isyet with something about it sure to attract the eye of practical wisdom  mr lincoln dallied with his decision perhaps longer than seemed needful to those on whom its awful responsibility was not to rest but when he made it it was worthy of his cautious but surefooted understanding  the moral of the sphinxriddle and it is a deep one lies in the childish simplicity of the solution  those who fail in guessing it fail because they are overingenious and cast about for an answer that shall suit their own notion of the gravity of the occasion and of their own dignity rather than the occasion itself  in a matter which must be finally settled by public opinion and in regard to which the ferment of prejudice and passion on both sides has not yet subsided to that equilibrium of compromise from which alone a sound public opinion can result it is proper enough for the private citizen to press his own convictions with all possible force of argument and persuasion but the popular magistrate whose judgment must become action and whose action involves the whole country is bound to wait till the sentiment of the people is so far advanced toward his own point of view that what he does shall find support in it instead of merely confusing it with new elements of division  it was not unnatural that men earnestly devoted to the saving of their country and profoundly convinced that slavery was its only real enemy should demand a decided policy round which all patriots might rallyand this might have been the wisest course for an absolute ruler  but in the then unsettled state of the public mind with a large party decrying even resistance to the slaveholders rebellion as not only unwise but even unlawful with a majority perhaps even of the wouldbe loyal so long accustomed to regard the constitution as a deed of gift conveying to the south their own judgment as to policy and instinct as to right that they were in doubt at first whether their loyalty were due to the country or to slavery and with a respectable body of honest and influential men who still believed in the possibility of conciliationmr lincoln judged wisely that in laying down a policy in deference to one party he should be giving to the other the very fulcrum for which their disloyalty had been waiting  1 one of the three fates 2 odysseus or ulysses the hero of homers odyssey 3 see shakespeares merchant of venice  it behooved a clearheaded man in his position not to yield so far to an honest indignation against the brokers of treason in the north as to lose sight of the materials for misleading which were their stock in trade and to forget that it is not the falsehood of sophistry which is to be feared but the grain of truth mingled with it to make it speciousthat it is not the knavery of the leaders so much as the honesty of the followers they may seduce that gives them power for evil  it was especially his duty to do nothing which might help the people to forget the true cause of the war in fruitless disputes about its inevitable consequences  the doctrine of state rights can be so handled by an adroit demagogue as easily to confound the distinction between liberty and lawlessness in the minds of ignorant persons accustomed always to be influenced by the sound of certain words rather than to reflect upon the principles which give them meaning  for though secession involves the manifest absurdity of denying to the state the right of making war against any foreign power while permitting it against the united states though it supposes a compact of mutual concessions and guaranties among states without any arbiter in case of dissension though it contradicts commonsense in assuming that the men who framed our government did not know what they meant when they substituted union for confederation though it falsifies history which shows that the main opposition to the adoption of the constitution was based on the argument that it did not allow that independence in the several states which alone would justify them in secedingyet as slavery was universally admitted to be a reserved right an inference could be drawn from any direct attack upon it though only in self defence to a natural right of resistance logical enough to satisfy minds untrained to detect fallacy as the majority of men always are and now too much disturbed by the disorder of the times to consider that the order of events had any legitimate bearing on the argument  though mr lincoln was too sagacious to give the northern allies of the rebels the occasion they desired and even strove to provoke yet from the beginning of the war the most persistent efforts have been made to confuse the public mind as to its origin and motives and to drag the people of the loyal states down from the national position they had instinctively taken to the old level of party squabbles and antipathies  the wholly unprovoked rebellion of an oligarchy proclaiming negro slavery the cornerstone of free institutions and in the first flush of overhasty confidence venturing to parade the logical sequence of their leading dogma that slavery is right in principle and has nothing to do with difference of complexion has been represented as a legitimate and gallant attempt to maintain the true principles of democracy  the rightful endeavor of an established government the least onerous that ever existed to defend itself against a treacherous attack on its very existence has been cunningly made to seem the wicked effort of a fanatical clique to force its doctrines on an oppressed population  even so long ago as when mr lincoln not yet convinced of the danger and magnitude of the crisis was endeavoring to persuade himself of union majorities at the south and to carry on a war that was half peace in the hope of a peace that would have been all war while he was still enforcing the fugitive slave law under some theory that secession however it might absolve states from their obligations could not escheat them of their claims under the constitution and that slaveholders in rebellion had alone among mortals the privilege of having their cake and eating it at the same timethe enemies of free government were striving to persuade the people that the war was an abolition crusade  to rebel without reason was proclaimed as one of the rights of man while it was carefully kept out of sight that to suppress rebellion is the first duty of government  all the evils that have come upon the country have been attributed to the abolitionists though it is hard to see how any party can become permanently powerful except in one of two ways either by the greater truth of its principles or the extravagance of the party opposed to it  to fancy the ship of state riding safe at her constitutional moorings suddenly engulfed by a huge kraken of abolitionism rising from unknown depths and grasping it with slimy tentacles is to look at the natural history of the matter with the eyes of pontoppidan1   to believe that the leaders in the southern treason feared any danger from abolitionism would be to deny them ordinary intelligence though there can be little doubt that they made use of it to stir the passions and excite the fears of their deluded accomplices  they rebelled not because they thought slavery weak but because they believed it strong enough not to overthrow the government but to get possession of it for it becomes daily clearer that they used rebellion only as a means of revolution and if they got revolution though not in the shape they looked for is the american people to save them from its consequences at the cost of its own existence  the election of mr lincoln which it was clearly in their power to prevent had they wished was the occasion merely and not the cause of their revolt  abolitionism till within a year or two was the despised heresy of a few earnest persons without political weight enough to carry the election of a parish constable and their cardinal principle was disunion because they were convinced that within the union the position of slavery was impregnable  in spite of the proverb great effects do not follow from small causesthat is disproportionately smallbut from adequate causes acting under certain required conditions  to contrast the size of the oak with that of the parent acorn as if the poor seed had paid all costs from its slender strong box may serve for a childs wonder but the real miracle lies in that divine league which bound all the forces of nature to the service of the tiny germ in fulfilling its destiny  everything has been at work for the past ten years in the cause of antislavery but garrison and phillips have been far less successful propagandists than the slaveholders themselves with the constantly growing arrogance of their pretensions and encroachments  they have forced the question upon the attention of every voter in the free states by defiantly putting freedom and democracy on the defensive  but even after the kansas outrages there was no widespread desire on the part of the north to commit aggressions though there was a growing determination to resist them  the popular unanimity in favor of the war three years ago was but in small measure the result of antislavery sentiment far less of any zeal for abolition  but every month of the war every movement of the allies of slavery in the free states has been making abolitionists by the thousand  the masses of any people however intelligent are very little moved by abstract principles of humanity and justice until those principles are interpreted for them by the stinging commentary of some infringement upon their own rights and then their instincts and passions once aroused do indeed derive an incalculable reinforcement of impulse and intensity from those higher ideas those sublime traditions which have no motive political force till they are allied with a sense of immediate personal wrong or imminent peril  then at last the stars in their courses begin to fight against sisera  had any one doubted before that the rights of human nature are unitary that oppression is of one hue the world over no matter what the color of the oppressedhad any one failed to see what the real essence of the contest wasthe efforts of the advocates of slavery among ourselves to throw discredit upon the fundamental axioms of the declaration of independence and the radical doctrines of christianity could not fail to sharpen his eyes   1 a danish antiquary and theologian  while every day was bringing the people nearer to the conclusion which all thinking men saw to be inevitable from the beginning it was wise in mr lincoln to leave the shaping of his policy to events  in this country where the rough and ready understanding of the people is sure at last to be the controlling power a profound commonsense is the best genius for statesmanship  hitherto the wisdom of the presidents measures has been justified by the fact that they have always resulted in more firmly uniting public opinion  one of the things particularly admirable in the public utterances of president lincoln is a certain tone of familiar dignity which while it is perhaps the most difficult attainment of mere style is also no doubtful indication of personal character  there must be something essentially noble in an elective ruler who can descend to the level of confidential ease without losing respect something very manly in one who can break through the etiquette of his conventional rank and trust himself to the reason and intelligence of those who have elected him  no higher compliment was ever paid to a nation than the simple confidence the fireside plainness with which mr lincoln always addresses himself to the reason of the american people  this was indeed a true democrat who grounded himself on the assumption that a democracy can think  come let us reason together about this matter has been the tone of all his addresses to the people and accordingly we have never had a chief magistrate who so won to himself the love and at the same time the judgment of his countrymen  to us that simple confidence of his in the rightmindedness of his fellowmen is very touching and its success is as strong an argument as we have ever seen in favor of the theory that men can govern themselves  he never appeals to any vulgar sentiment he never alludes to the humbleness of his origin it probably never occurred to him indeed that there was anything higher to start from than manhood and he put himself on a level with those he addressed not by going down to them but only by taking it for granted that they had brains and would come up to a common ground of reason  in an article lately printed in the nation mr bayard taylor mentions the striking fact that in the foulest dens of the five points he found the portrait of lincoln  the wretched population that makes its hive there threw all its votes and more against him and yet paid this instinctive tribute to the sweet humanity of his nature  their ignorance sold its vote and took its money but all that was left of manhood in them recognized its saint and martyr  mr lincoln is not in the habit of saying this is my opinion or my theory but this is the conclusion to which in my judgment the time has come and to which accordingly the sooner we come the better for us  his policy has been the policy of public opinion based on adequate discussion and on a timely recognition of the influence of passing events in shaping the features of events to come  one secret of mr lincolns remarkable success in captivating the popular mind is undoubtedly an unconsciousness of self which enables him though under the necessity of constantly using the capital i to do it without any suggestion of egotism  there is no single vowel which mens mouths can pronounce with such difference of effect  that which one shall hide away as it were behind the substance of his discourse or if he bring it to the front shall use merely to give an agreeable accent of individuality to what he says another shall make an offensive challenge to the self satisfaction of all his hearers and an unwarranted intrusion upon each mans sense of personal importance irritating every pore of his vanity like a dry northeast wind to a gooseflesh of opposition and hostility  mr lincoln has never studied quintilian1 but he has in the earnest simplicity and unaffected americanism of his own character one art of oratory worth all the rest  he forgets himself so entirely in his object as to give his i the sympathetic and persuasive effect of we with the great body of his countrymen  homely dispassionate showing all the roughedged process of his thought as it goes along yet arriving at his conclusions with an honest kind of everyday logic he is so eminently our representative man that when he speaks it seems as if the people were listening to their own thinking aloud  the dignity of his thought owes nothing to any ceremonial garb of words but to the manly movement that comes of settled purpose and an energy of reason that knows not what rhetoric means  there has been nothing of cleon still less of strepsiades2 striving to underbid him in demagogism to be found in the public utterances of mr lincoln  he has always addressed the intelligence of men never their prejudice their passion or their ignorance  1 a famous latin writer on the art of oratory 2 two athenian demagogues satirized by the dramatist aristophanes                          on the day of his death this simple western attorney who according to one party was a vulgar joker and whom the doctrinaires among his own supporters accused of wanting every element of statesmanship was the most absolute ruler in christendom and this solely by the hold his goodhumored sagacity had laid on the hearts and understandings of his countrymen  nor was this all for it appeared that he had drawn the great majority not only of his fellowcitizens but of mankind also to his side  so strong and so persuasive is honest manliness without a single quality of romance or unreal sentiment to help it  a civilian during times of the most captivating military achievement awkward with no skill in the lower technicalities of manners he left behind him a fame beyond that of any conqueror the memory of a grace higher than that of outward person and of a gentlemanliness deeper than mere breeding  never before that startled april morning did such multitudes of men shed tears for the death of one they had never seen as if with him a friendly presence had been taken away from their lives leaving them colder and darker  never was funeral panegyric so eloquent as the silent look of sympathy which strangers exchanged when they met on that day  their common manhood had lost a kinsman
