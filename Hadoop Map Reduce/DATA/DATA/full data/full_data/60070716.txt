itself but forms the sixth volume of the rover boys series for young americans  this series of books for wideawake american lads was begun several years ago with the publication of the rover boys at school at that time the author had in mind to write not more than three volumes relating the adventures of dick tom and sam rover at putnam hall on the ocean and in the jungle but the publication of these books immediately called for a fourth the rover boys out west and then a fifth the rover boys on the great lakes still my young friends did not appear to be satisfied and so i now present to them this sixth volume which relates the stirring adventures of the three rover boys in the adirondacks whither they had gone to solve the mystery of a certain brasslined money casket found by them on an island in lake huron  in writing this volume i have had a double purpose in view not only to pen a tale which might prove pleasing to all boys but one which might likewise give them a fair idea of the wonderful resources and natural beauty of this section of the united states ours is a wonderful country and none of us can learn too much concerning it  again thanking my young friends for their kindness in the past i place this volume in their hands trusting they will find it as much to their liking as those which have preceded it  affectionately and sincerely yours  arthur m winfield     the rover boys in the mountains     chapter i  the boys of putnam hall   hurrah boys the lake is frozen over well be sure to have good skating by tomorrow afternoon  thats fine news tom came from sam rover ive been fairly aching for a skate ever since that cold snap of two weeks ago  well have to start up some skating matches if good skating does really turn up put in dick rover who had just joined his two brothers in the gymnasium attached to putnam hall dont you remember those matches we had last year  certainly dick answered tom rover didnt i win one of the silver medals  gracious but what a lot has happened since then said sam who was the youngest of the trio weve gotten rid of nearly all of our enemies and old crabtree is in jail and cant bother mrs stanhope or dora any more  we didnt get rid of dan baxter remarked dick he gave us the slip nicely  do you think hell dare to bother us again dick questioned sam anxiously  i hope not but im not certain sam the baxters are a bad lot as all of us know and as dan grows older hell be just as wicked as his father and maybe worse  what a pity a fellow like dan cant turn over a new leaf came from tom rover hes bright enough in his way and would make a firstrate chap  its not in the blood went on dick well have to keep our eyes open thats all if anything dan is probably more angry at us than ever for he believes we were the sole means of his father being put in prison  old baxter deserved all he got murmured sam  so he did  well if dan baxter ever bothers me hell catch it warm came from tom i shant attempt to mince matters with him everybody at this school knows what a bully he was and they know too what a rascal hes been since he left so i say let him beware and so bringing the conversation to an end for the time being tom rover ran across the gymnasium floor leaped up and grasped a turningbar stationed there and was soon going through a number of exercises recently taught to him by the new gym teacher  gracious but tom is getting to be a regular circus gymnast cried sam as he watched his brother in admiration just see what beautiful turns he is making  humph that aint so wonderful came from someone at sams elbow and turning the youngest rover found himself close to billy tubbs a short stocky youth who had entered putnam hall at the opening of the fall term tubbs was a boy of rich parentage and while he was not particularly a bully he considered himself of great importance and vastly superior to the majority of his associates  all right tubby if it isnt so wonderful just you jump up and do it returned sam coldly  look here how many times have i told you not to call me tubby burst out the rich youth i dont like it at all  then what shall we call you asked sam innocently tubblets  no i dont want you to call me tubblets either my name is tubbswilliam philander tubbs  gosh am i to say all that whenever i want to address you demanded sam with a pretended gasp for breath  i dont see why you shouldnt its my name  but tubbyi mean tubbletsno willander philliam tubbsthe name is altogether too long why supposin you were standing on a railroad track looking east and an express train was coming from the west at the rate of seventyfive miles an hour and it got to within a hundred yards of you when i discovered your truly horrible peril and i should start to warn you of the aforesaid truly horrible peril take my word for it before i could utter such an elongated personal handle as that youd be struck and distributed along that track for a distance of a mile and a quarter no tubby my conscience wouldnt allow itreally it wouldnt and sam shook his head seriously  see here what are you giving me roared tubbs wrathfully dont you worry about my standing on a railroad track and asking you to call me off and then he added with a red face as a laugh went up from half a dozen students standing near william philander tubbs is my name and i shant answer to any other after this  good for you washtubs came from a boy in the rear of the crowd  id stick to that resolution by all means buttertubs came from the opposite side of the crowd  and then one older youth who was given to writing songs began to sing softly       rubadubdub     one man in a tub       and who do you think it is     its william philander     whos got up his dander       and isnt he mad gee whizz   the doggerel gotten up on the spur of the moment struck the fancy of fully a score of boys big and little and in an instant all were singing it over and over again at the top of their lungs and at this those who did not sing began to laugh uproariously  i say whats it all about demanded tom as he slid from the turningbar  songbird powell has composed a comic opera in tubbys honor answered larry colby one of the rover boys chums i guess hes going to have it put on the stage after the holidays with tubby as leading man  see here i wont have this roared the rich youth waving his hand wildly first at one boy and then another i dont want you to make up any songs about me  songbird wont charge you anything put in fred garrison another of the students hes a true poet and writes for nothing you ought to feel highly honored  make a speech of thanks thats a good fellow put in george granbury another student  its an outrage shouted tubbs his face growing redder each instant i wont stand it  all right we wont charge you for sitting on it came from the back of the crowd  my right name is  barrel but they call me tubbs for short finished another student hurrah tubby is discovered at last  dont blush washtub you dont look half as pretty as when youre pale  if you feel warm buttertub go out and sit on the thin ice it will soon cool you off came from fred garrison  ill cool you off garry burst out the rich youth and made a wild dash at his tormentor but somebody put out a foot and the tormented boy stumbled headlong at which the crowd set up another shout and then sang louder than ever       rubadubdub     one man in a tub   i say who tripped me up gasped tubbs as soon as he could scramble up tell me who did it and ill soon settle with him  who rolled over the buttertub asked tom solemnly one peanut reward for the first correct answer to this absorbing puzzle please dont all raise your hands at once  i believe you did it tom rover bellowed the rich youth  i never tubby my dear boy i never rolled over a buttertub in my life youve got the wrong number kindly ring the bell next door  then it was sam and ill fix him for it see if i dont  no it wasnt sam he never touched a washtub in his life  i say it was sam cried tubbs who was almost beside himself with rage and im going to teach him a lesson there sam rover how do you like that  as the rich youth finished he caught the youngest rover by the shoulder with his left hand and with his right gave sam a slanting blow on the cheek  stop i didnt trip you exclaimed sam and then as tubbs aimed another blow at him he ducked and broke loose and hit out in return his blow was harder and more truly aimed than he had anticipated and it took tubbs directly on the nose a spurt of blood followed accompanied by a yell of pain and the rich youth fell back  oh oh my nose  you brought it on yourself retorted sam i didnt  stop stop boys what does this mean came in a sudden stern voice and in a moment more the two combatants found themselves confronted by jasper grinder a new teacher fighting eh how often must you be told that such disgraceful conduct is not allowed here you come with me and ill make an example of both of you  and in a moment more the two lads found themselves prisoners in jasper grinders strong grasp and being marched out of the gymnasium toward the school building proper     chapter ii  a glimpse at the past   as old readers of this series of books know the rover boys were three in number dick being the oldest funloving tom next and small but sturdy sam bringing up the rear of a trio of as bright and uptodate a set of american lads as could be found anywhere  the home of the lads was with their father anderson rover and their uncle randolph and aunt martha on a beautiful farm at valley brook in the heart of new york state from this farm they had been sent to putnam hall a semimilitary institute of learning situated near cedarville on cayuga lake this was while their father had mysteriously disappeared while on an exploring tour into the heart of africa  at putnam hall the rover boys made a number of friends some of whom have already been mentioned in these pages and they likewise made several enemies chief among the enemies were josiah crabtree a dictatorial teacher and dan baxter a bully who had done his best to make them knuckle under to him  since those first days at school many changes had taken place so many in fact that but a few can be noted here crabtree had been discharged and was now in prison for trying to hypnotize a lady into marrying him this lady was mrs stanhope the mother of dora stanhope who lived in the vicinity of putnam hall and a girl of whom dick rover thought a good deal  it had not taken the rover boys long to discover that not only the dictatorial old teacher but also the bully dan baxter were rascals and what was more that arnold baxter the father of dan was an old enemy to their father following this had come a journey to africa and into the jungle in search of mr rover and this mission accomplished the rover boys had gone west to establish a mining claim in which their father was interested this claim was disputed by the baxters and when the rovers won out and went for a pleasure trip on the great lakes the baxters did their best to bring dick tom and sam to grief but instead of accomplishing their purpose they failed once more and arnold baxter was returned to the prison from which he had escaped some months before what had become of dan baxter nobody knew but the rover boys were soon to learn as we will see in the chapters which follow  after their stirring adventures on the great lakes and especially on needle point island in lake huron the rover boys were glad enough to get back to dear old putnam hall and to their studies even though the latter were something of a grind as tom declared they all loved captain victor putnam the owner of the institution and it may be added here that the captain thought as much of the rovers as he did of any of the scholars under him and that was a good deal  the coming of jasper grinder as a new underteacher was a shock to many of the boys at the school the principal teacher under captain putnam was professor george strong who was stern but fair and almost as well liked as the captain himself and there were now several others all of whom were on a good footing with the scholars what had induced the captain to take in such a dictatorial and harsh master as jasper grinder was a mystery which nobody could explain  as a matter of fact grinder had come into the hall under a misrepresentation he was from the northwest and claimed to have been a professor at a wellknown california college it was true he had once taught at this college but his record was far from being as satisfactory as captain putnam had been led to believe it was true he was a learned manquite the opposite of josiah crabtree who had been wise only in looksbut it was also true that he was a highstrung passionate man given to strange fits of anger and that he was a miser never spending a cent that was not absolutely required of him  i say let me go cried sam as jasper grinder almost dragged him across the parade ground between the gymnasium and the school building i am not to blame for this row  silence i wont listen to a word until we are in the office commanded the irate teacher  he started the whole thing came from tubbs he called me tubby and got the crowd to singing a song about me  i had nothing to do with the song and all the boys have called you tubby since you came here went on sam  be quiet i tell you cried jasper grinder and clutched the arm of each so tightly that tubbs set up a yell of pain i am master here and i will show you how to mind  at these words sams heart gave a sudden drop it was friday afternoon and the next day would be as usual a holiday taking advantage of this fact professor strong had gone to buffalo to visit a sick relative residing there and only an hour before captain putnam had been driven away behind his team to visit an old army friend living at fordview twelve miles away professor strong would not return until monday morning and it was more than likely the captain would remain away over night during this interval jasper grinder would be in absolute charge of the academy and the pupils  in a few minutes the teacher had led the way into captain putnams office and with a final pinch of their arms which made tubbs cry out once more with pain he flung the pair away from him  dont you know it is disgraceful to fight he thundered  we werent fightingthat is not exactly said tubbs meekly  silence i saw the whole affair why your nose is still bleeding  i dont care it was rovers fault mr grinder he started the boys and they all began to make fun of me he wouldnt stop  and then you fought like a pair of young tigers disgraceful i will have to make an example of both of you  id like to see captain putnam about the matter said sam boldly  at these words jasper grinder fairly trembled with suppressed anger the captain is not here and i shall deal with you as you deserve he said  tubbs sank down on a chair and began to attend to his nose with his handkerchief sam remained standing but his whole manner showed that he did not consider he was being treated fairly  what both of you boys deserve is a good thrashing said the teacher after a pause  at this sam looked his surprise thrashing was not permitted at the hall the worst that could happen to a student was to place him in solitary confinement over night after a supper of bread and water  as i am not permitted by the rules to thrash you i shall put you in the stone cell over night went on jasper grinder  together questioned tubbs from behind his bloodstained handkerchief  no you shall go to the cell and rover shall be placed in the empty storeroom next to it  the cell is ice cold and so is the storeroom protested sam  it is not my fault that you must be placed there and you will have to put up with the cold was the curt answer  i shant stay in a cold room cried sam its not fair  you shall and ill put you there myself ejaculated jasper grinder tubbs dont dare to stir until i return  so speaking the unreasonable teacher caught hold of sam once more and despite the youngest rovers struggles hustled him out of the office and through a long hallway at the end of which was located the storeroom he had mentioned the key to the room was in the lock  now stay there until you are willing to behave yourself said jasper grinder and shoved sam into the apartment for your impudence to me you shall go without your supper tonight  that remains to be seen replied sam but in such a low voice that the teacher did not hear then the door was closed and locked and jasper grinder hurried away with the key in his pocket to make poor tubbs a prisoner in the stone cell  heres a pretty mess and no mistake thought sam as he sank on a bench the only article of furniture the room contained im being treated worse than tom was treated by old crabtree when first we came to the hall and all because i called tubby by his nickname if this keeps on a fellow wont dare to breathe out loud when grinder is around what a passionate fellow he is at times he glares at a fellow as if he was going to eat you up  while sam remained on the bench he heard footsteps in the hallway and a howling protest from tubbs then he heard the rich youth thrown into the stone cell next to the storeroom and left to his fate  it was nipping cold and even with the window tightly closed and nailed over with slats sam could not endure it to remain on the bench long leaping up he began to stamp his feet and slap his arms across his chest to get them warm soon he heard tubbs doing the same thing  i guess hes worse off than i am thought the youngest rover that stone cell hasnt any bench in it any more and it must be twice as cold and damp as this room its a shame to put anyone there in this freezing weather i dont believe captain putnam would stand for it if he was here  he tried to speak to tubbs but the wall between was too thick and he soon gave up the idea then he continued to stamp his feet and slap his arms and even went through an imaginary prize fight in order to warm up it was now growing dark and with the darkness the atmosphere of the storeroom became colder and colder     chapter iii  tom on a tour of discovery   poor sam was removed from the gymnasium so quickly that neither dick nor tom had time to protest and when they reached the main door of the school building they found it shut and locked in their faces  say this is an outrage burst out tom sam wasnt to blame for that fight he didnt trip tubby up  i know he didnt put in fred garrison who had come up also it was larry mason but i shant give larry away  neither will i  mr grinder always carries matters with a high hand when the captain is away put in dick and he gets redhot at the least little thing  he doesnt deserve to be a teacher here came from george granbury who had followed the others to my way of thinking hes worse than old crabtree was even though he is perhaps better educated  id like to know what he is going to do with sam said dick with a serious look on his face sam has made such a good record this term i hate to see it broken  hell do something to punish em both came from fred it will be too bad though if he puts em in the stone cell theyll freeze to death such a night as this is going to be  i wont allow it ejaculated dick why that would be inhuman  im going in by the back way and find out whats going on said tom and promptly disappeared around the corner of the hall he was soon inside the building but to his chagrin found every door leading to captain putnams private apartments and to the stone cell and the storeroom locked having gone through the messrooms and through several of the classrooms he rejoined the others who had gathered around the fire in what was called the students general living rooman apartment set aside during cold weather solely for the boys comfort where they might read study play quiet games or do similar things in order to make themselves feel at home  how did you make out was the question immediately put  made out and thats all said tom gloomily  what do you mean came from dick  every blessed door is locked and so are the windows i cant get within two rooms of the office  did you hear anything asked george  yes i heard a noise like somebody stamping  where did it come from  i think it came from the stone cell but it sounded like somebody stamping on wood  perhaps it came from the empty storeroom cried dick more than likely mr grinder has placed sam and tubby there i wish hed come here id question him  your wish is gratified whispered george here he comes now  the door at the far end of the room had opened and now jasper grinder came forth in a hurry he was about to pass to another room at the rear of the school when dick stopped him  mr grinder may i ask what you have done with sam he asked  i have placed him in confinement until captain putnam returns was the snappy answer  did you put him in the stone cell  it is not for you to question me rover  in this cold weather it isnt fit for anybody to be in that stone cell sam may catch his death of cold  i am the best judge of my own actions rover and need no advice from you your brother has broken the rules of this school and must suffer for so doing  its inhuman to make a fellow freeze burst out tom i dont believe captain putnam would do that  not another word from either of you came sharply from the teacher your brother will not freeze to death but the cold may teach him a useful lesson  if he gets sick ill get my father to hold you legally responsible went on tom  at these words the teacher turned slightly pale a vision of a lawsuit with damages to pay floating across his miserly mind  to ease your mind rover let me say ill see to it that he doesnt get sick he said and before tom or dick could question him further he passed out of the room  if he isnt the worst yet burst out fred who had listened with interest to what was said  i shant stand it returned tom will you dick  dick older and more thoughtful mused for a moment  id certainly like to help sam he said but we must be careful and not get into trouble with captain putnam  im going to find my way to the door of the cell somehow went on tom  old grinder left that door unlocked when he came out said george who had joined them  good im going through before he comes back  as good as his word tom slipped past the various tables at which the students were sitting until he reached the door which connected with captain putnams private apartments  usually this portion of the hall was forbidden ground to the scholars but tom had been inside the rooms a number of times so knew the way well passing through a private sitting room and a small library he came to a narrow hall connecting with the main hall at the end of which were the stone cell and the empty storeroom  he was just about to step into the main hall when he heard somebody coming down from the floor above the party was mrs green the housekeeper a goodnatured lady upon whom tom had played many a joke in the past  gosh i mustnt be discovered he muttered and looked around for some place to hide under the staircase was a recess containing a number of hooks with cloaks and overcoats and into this he crowded drawing one of the overcoats so as to completely cover the upper portion of his body  hardly had he gained the hiding place when mrs green reached the lower hallway tom heard her pause at the foot of the stairs strike a match and light the big swinging lamp hanging from overhead  i might as well mend that overcoat now while the captain is away tom heard her murmur to herself its only a buttonhole thats torn out and a tailor would charge him four times what its worthand he always so good at christmastime  shes looking out for her present thought tom with a grin but thats none of my affair if only she isnt after this overcoat  he heard the housekeeper approach the recess and pause for a moment in front of it he hardly dared to breathe fearing that he would surely be discovered  well i declare if he hasnt gone and worn the very overcoat itself he heard mrs green cry just like him and two good coats ahanging here well i suppose its the warmest hes got and hell have a cold ride back especially if he returns tonight and so speaking mrs green hurried away  a narrow shave and no mistake murmured tom to himself and listened until he heard a distant door close then all was quiet save the distant murmur of the students voices coming from the sitting room  without losing more time tom left the recess and hurried to the door of the stone cell  sam he called out softly are you in there  no im in here came in the voice of tubbs andim almost frozen totodeath the last words with a chattering of teeth that told only too plainly how the rich youth was suffering  sorry for you tubby really i am but where is sam  in thethe storeroom oh rover wont you please ask mr grinder to let me out ill freeze to death here i know i will  ill do what i can but he wont let you out he isnt that kind of a fellow  you might buy him off rover ive heard hes a regular miser and ill give you five dollars of my christmas money if hell let me go  ill see what i can do after ive talked to sam and so speaking tom hurried to the door of the storeroom  tom is it really you cried the youngest rover joyfully  yes how are you making out  horribly i believe my feet and ears are already frozen  grinder is a beast to put you in here sam  i know that well enough he wont give me any supper im afraid  then ill try to get some supper to you  is the key of this door on a hook outside  no if it was id have the door open long ago  sam gave a deep sigh and then began to dance around once more to keep warm  perhaps i can find a key to fit this lock went on tom i know there are keys in some of the other doors  he ran off and soon returned with four keys which he tried one after another the third was a fair fit and with an effort the bolt of the lock was forced back  hurrah the doors open exclaimed tom now you can go where you please  then you wouldnt stay here questioned sam anxiously  not much id hide in one of the dormitories and i wouldnt show myself until captain putnam gets back ill see to it that you get something to eat and when the captain returns you can tell him that if you had remained in this place all night you would have been frozen to death  sam was willing enough to take toms advice and was soon in the hallway then the door was locked again  its heartless to leave poor tubby in that cell said tom lets get him out too  all rightif you can find a key to fit the lock  losing no time the brothers tried one key after another in the lock to the door of the stone cell  whos that came in a chatter from tubbs  tom rover was the answer ive just released sam and now we are going to release you if we can  good for you rover  there she goes cried tom a few seconds later and in a moment more the door was opened and tubbs stood in the hallway with the rover boys  tubbs was about to say something when sam suddenly caught him by the arm  hush he whispered somebody is coming i hope it isnt old grinder     chapter iv  dormitory number two   for the moment none of the three students knew what to do they felt that if the approaching personage should be jasper grinder there would certainly be a warm time of it to say the least  yet the approaching man was not the teacher but peleg snuggers the man of all work around the hall a goodnatured individual well liked by nearly all the students snuggers was in the habit of taking many a joke from the scholars yet he rarely retaliated contenting himself with the saying that boys will be boys  its snuggers whispered sam after a painful pause what shall we do  perhaps we can get him to keep quiet returned tom also in a low voice hes a pretty good sort  dodont trust him put in tubbs in a trembling voice if im put back in that cell ill die i know i will  i have it said tom struck by a sudden idea into the storeroom with you quick  but he may be coming after me said sam  never mindill fix it be quick or the game will be up  on tiptoe the three students hurried into the storeroom and tom shut the door noiselessly then he slipped the key he still held into the lock and turned it  now groan sam he whispered pretend to be nearly dead and ask peleg to bring grinder here  catching the idea sam began to moan and groan most dismally in the midst of which peleg snuggers came up  poor boy i reckon as how hes nearly stiff from the cold murmured snuggers and this bread and water wont warm him up nohow ive most a mind to bring him some hot tea on the sly and a sandwich too  the general utility man tried to insert a key in the lock but failed on account of the key on the inside  oh oh moaned sam help help  whats the row questioned snuggers  is that you snuggers  yes master rover  im most frozen to death my feet and ears are frozen stiff already  its a shame  tell mr grinder to come here  he wont come im afraid he just sent me with some bread and water for you and for master tubbs  water do you want me to turn into ice oh snuggers please send him i know i cant stand this half an hour longer ill be a corpse  all right ill fetch him answered snuggers and setting down the pitcher of water and loaf of bread he had been carrying he hurried off  now is our time whispered tom as soon as he was certain the man of all work was gone  but which way shall we go questioned sam  follow me and ill show you  leaving the storeroom tom led the way through the semidark hallway and up the stairs at the rear of the upper hall was a bedroom reserved for the captains private guests  come in here for the present said tom and when i tap on the window unlock the sash and be prepared to climb from the window to the next which connects with dormitory no 2  good for you said sam but how are you going to get to the dormitory  leave that to me  leaving sam and tubbs to take care of themselves tom left the bedroom and walked out in the upper hall once more  he was just in time to hear peleg snuggers returning with jasper grinder  its all nonsense he heard in the teachers harsh voice the cold will do both of the boys good  he said he was half frozen insisted snuggers if anything seriouslike happened to them i dunno what the captain would say  i know nothing serious will happen growled jasper grinder he was merely trying to work upon your sympathies both could stay there till morning easily enough  the wretch murmured tom to himself im mighty glad i let them out  a few seconds later he heard a cry of dismay  rover is gone  gone came from snuggers  yes gone snuggers did you leave the door unlocked  no sir i couldnt get the key in the lock here it is and the general utility man produced it  ah here is a key on the inside what can this mean  i dont know sir i left him agroanin only a few minutes ago  it is very strange jasper grinder gazed around the empty storeroom did you hear anything from master tubbs  no sir  the teacher stepped out of the storeroom and made his way to the stone cell  he is gone too he ejaculated  really sir did you say gone cried peleg snuggers in dismay  yes this isahoutrageous snuggers where can they be  im sure i dont know sir master rover got out mighty quick  look for them among the students and if you find them bring them to me at once  i will sir  as soon as peleg snuggers had departed jasper grinder looked around the storeroom and the stone cell to learn if he could find any trace of the boys  this gave tom the chance to slip through the captains private rooms and into the students quarters  well how did you make out was dicks impatient question youve been gone an age  come with me and ill tell you said tom and taking his brother and several chums aside he related what had occurred  keep them there all night and on bread and water cried dick it is awful im sure the captain wont stand for it  to be sure he wont came from fred garrison but what are you going to do next  let them in the dormitory window  tom led the way upstairs and into dormitory no 2 there were four windows in a row and six beds three occupied by the rovers and the others by fred larry and george granbury  going to the corner window tom threw it wide open it was growing dark outside for it was now halfpast six as he stuck his head out of the window there was the rattle of a drum down in the mess hall  supper time cried fred  you go down said tom no use of all of us being late  no you go down answered dick youve run risk enough besides if you are absent from the crowd too long somebody may grow suspicious of you ill help sam and tubbs to a safe hidingplace  find out if they are there firstand lock the door after we are gone  leaning out of the window dick tapped on the next glass at once sam showed himself  its quite a climb but i reckon i can make it said the youngest rover  waiting to hear no more tom hurried below followed by fred and mingled with the crowd of students entering the mess hall  many of the boys were talking about the quarrel between sam and tubbs and all condemned the actions of jasper grinder  he ought to have set them to doing extra lessons that would have been punishment enough said one of the big boys who was captain of company a of the students for that term  this opinion was that held by the majority several of the boys came to tom to learn what he had to say but he merely shrugged his shoulders  wait and well see what we will see he said  rovers got a card up his sleeve thats as sure as youre born said one of the students and winked at tom but tom only looked wise and turned away  when the students sat down to eat it was noticed that dicks chair was vacant  master thomas rover do you know anything of your brother richard asked an underteacher  perhaps he is having a talk with mr grinder said tom  oh then the underteacher noticed that mr grinders chair was also vacant and said no more  while the boys were eating peleg snuggers came to the door and looked carefully about the mess hall  you wont find them here peleg said tom to himself then the man of all work disappeared and the supper continued as if nothing out of the ordinary was happening     chapter v  a scene in the schoolroom   in the meantime what of affairs in the dormitory was all going as quietly as tom had anticipated  as soon as tom went below dick locked the door then turned again to the window sam was trying to climb from one room to the next but could not get a satisfactory hold  here give me your hand cried dick softly and reaching forth he soon helped his brother to a position of safety  say aint it dangerous asked tubbs anxiously as he gazed to the ground twenty feet below  youve got to run some risks tubbs said dick quick or you may be too late  fearful of a fall the rich youth put out one foot and a hand dick tried to reach him but was unable to do so  a little further tubbs he said encouragingly  illustration a perilous climb rover boys in the mountains  iim afraid ill fall was the trembling answer then the rich youth let out a cry of alarm somebody is coming  come cried dick and reached out a trifle further as tubbs gave the eldest rover his fingers dick hauled him from the window and literally swung him into the dormitory then as tubbs landed in a heap on the floor sam closed the window and locked it  now you must clear out to another room cried dick whoever was coming will find that window wide open and guess you have escaped in this direction  but where can we go to asked the rich youth  go to dormitory no 6 only young adler is in there and hemmingway and they are on a vacation until after christmas the closet is a big one and you can both hide on the upper shelf quick ill bring you some supper  all three left the dormitory and sam and tubbs scurried off in the direction indicated as for dick he lost no time in reaching the mess hall  sorry sir he said to the underteacher the bell couldnt have rung very loud  it rang as loud as usual was the answer and no more was said the teachers head being just then full of other matters  glad to get off so easily dick lost no time in eating his supper while making way with the food he stowed a goodly portion in his pockets in a couple of spare napkins and by some silent motions from tom learned that his brother was doing the same  just as the students were finishing the meal jasper grinder came in and walked down the aisles between the tables he looked both angry and perplexed as he came close to tom he paused  excuse me mr grinder but wont you let sam out of the stone cell asked tom to avoid being questioned  you be silent rover muttered the teacher and passed on without saying more  after the supper hour it was usual for the students to have half an hour to themselves during which they might read play games or do as they pleased but now mr grinder called them together in the main classroom  i wish to talk to you young gentlemen said the teacher when all were seated  were going to catch it now whispered tom to dick dont you give the secret away  indeed i wont answered the eldest rover i intend to lay the whole case before captain putnam as soon as he returns  silence thundered jasper grinder i want you boys to stop talking instantly  i didnt say anything murmured several in an undertone  silence i say repeated the master and then all became so quiet that the ticking of the clock could be heard distinctly  the teacher gazed around at the scores of faces and looked more stem than ever  i am going to question all of you separately and i trust each of you will tell the truth the question is do you know what has become of samuel rover and william tubbs or do you know what they have done i shall start with the first boy hickley what have you to say  i dont know anything about them answered the boy named hickley  brainard do you know  no sir  parkham  i know they had a little setto in the gymnasium but thats all the whole thing was a friendly bout i guess  i am the best judge of that it was a disgraceful fight what have you to say griggs  if you say it was disgraceful i suppose it was sir i thought it was only a friendly dispute  stop i want you to answer the original questions yes or no  no  no what  no to both original questions  no sir and jasper grinder stamped his foot  oh all right sir no sir to both questions sir  there was a titter at this which caused jasper grinder to grow red in the face  boys be quiet he shouted if you do not be still i will keep all of you in tomorrow  as this would have spoiled the chances for a good skate and some exciting races the boys immediately subsided then the questioning went on until dick rover was reached  i dont know where sam and tubbs are now said dick perhaps they are frozen stiff  did you aid them in escaping from the stone cell and the storeroom  no sir  have you seen them since i placed them there  yes i have answered dick boldly seeing it was useless to beat about the bush longer  oh then you did aid them to escape  not from the stone cell and the storeroom i met them after they had escaped  where did you see them last  i decline to answer that question  decline thundered jasper grinder  i do sir as soon as captain putnam arrives i shall lay this whole matter before him and learn if you have any authority for placing my brother in a place where he is liable to catch a cold which may give him pneumonia and be the cause of his death as it is my brother suffered a great deal and so did tubbs and if they get sick from it you may be sure that you will be held legally accountable it was an inhuman thing to do  as dick finished there was a murmur and then a number of the students broke out into applause while tom clapped his hands as hard as he could jasper grinder stood at his desk dumbstruck with his face growing paler each instant  silence silence he exclaimed when he could control his voice silence i say or i will cane you all this isis most unseemlyit isermutiny silence  i mean just what i say mr grinder went on dick when he could be heard you are master here and we are bound to obey you in certain things but you shant keep my brother in an icy room all night and on a supper of stale bread and cold water such treatment would almost make a mule sick  rover will you be silent or must i get the cane gasped jasper grinder almost beside himself with rage  if you get your cane sir you wont hit me more than once with it  wont i well see who is master here  my gracious is he really going to try to cane you dick exclaimed tom  i suppose he is was the cool answer he is so angry he doesnt know what he is doing  rushing from the classroom jasper grinder presently reappeared carrying a cane which looked as if it might hurt a good deal if vigorously applied  tom could not help but grin dick was almost as tall as the schoolteacher and probably just as strong and the idea of a caning appeared ridiculous in the extreme  caning was not allowed at putnam hall but evidently jasper grinder meant to take matters in his own hands  richard rover come up here he thundered  what for sir  to receive the punishment you so richly deserve  mr grinder you havent any right to cane me its against captain putnams rules  i dont care for the rulesi mean you have acted in such an outrageous manner that i must do whatever i think necessary to uphold law and order  i am willing to stand whatever punishment captain putnam sees fit to inflict but i shall not take a caning from you  wont you well see  as jasper grinder spoke he leaped from the platform and strode rapidly toward the spot where dick was standing  the eldest rover did not budge but remained where he was eying the enraged schoolteacher determinedly  dont you dare to strike he said warningly as the cane was raised over his head  i will cried jasper grinder and was about to bring the cane down with all force when tom caught it from behind and wrenched it from his grasp     chapter vi  news of an old enemy   dick had not intended that the cane should hit him he was prepared to dodge but he wanted to make certain that jasper grinder would really try to carry out his illadvised threat  hi give me that cane cried the schoolmaster as he whirled around  i shall not answered tom and began to run down one of the aisles to the door  instantly jasper grinder made after him but the boys had gathered in a crowd and it was with difficulty that the man could get through  as tom ran for one door dick ran for another and it was not long before both met in a hallway leading to the mess hall and the dormitories  dick what shall we do next questioned tom we cant stay here thats certain  well get out answered dick i think mrs stanhope will keep us all night  and if she wont i know the lanings will said tom with a grin  we must let sam know went on dick he can go along i shant come back until captain putnam returns  right you are  up the stairs they rushed and into the dormitory where sam and tubbs were in hiding  sam called dick and the youngest rover at once appeared  whats up now what are you in such a hurry for  get your overcoat and hat and come on we are going to the stanhopes for the night here tubbs is some supper and dick passed over what he had in the napkins while tom did the same  thanks said the rich boy butbut must i stay here alone  i dont think we can take you along answered dick but you want to be careful old grinder is as mad as a hornet he was going to cane me for helping you two come sam there is no time to waste tubbs you had better let fred garrison know where you are hes all right  in a moment more dick tom and sam were in their own room and putting on their heavy overcoats and their hats they lost no time and as they heard jasper grinder coming up one flight of stairs they ran down another pair leading into the kitchen  here the servants directed by mrs green were putting away what was left of the students supper  oh dear burst out the matron on catching sight of the boys what do you want here  goodby mrs green said dick tell the captain when he comes that we were driven away from the school by mr grinder and that well return as soon as we learn that he is back and before the housekeeper could answer they opened the kitchen door and ran outside  it was a dark night and the air was filled with snow some of which was already sifting lazily downward but they knew the way well so the want of light did hot bother them they crossed the parade ground on a run and made directly for the road leading to the stanhopes cottage  i reckon it will be quite a surprise for mrs stanhope and dora said tom after they had told sam of what had happened in the schoolroom they wont be looking for us  i know theyll treat us well said dick  to be sure they willespecially after all we did for them on the lakes put in sam but let me tell you i am curious to know how this thing is going to end  i think mr grinder will get the worst of it returned tom confidently he must know he was doing wrong to put you in that icy storeroom and poor tubbs in the stone cell how did you make out with tubbs in the closet  oh he became quite friendly and we decided to let the past drop i promised i wouldnt call him tubby any more  thats fair came from dick he isnt such a bad sort  on and on hurried the boys the road was a somewhat lonely one with several patches of woods to be passed several times they halted endeavoring to ascertain if they were being pursued but all remained silent the snow was now coming down more thickly than ever  what a lot of adventures we have had in these woods observed tom during one of the halts dont you remember the tramp who stole the watch and the rows with josiah crabtree and with arnold baxter and dan  indeed i do said sam mrs stanhope and dora must be glad to be rid of old crabtree and arnold baxter  its a pity dan baxter wasnt locked up with his father said dick dont you remember how he used to bother dora and the laning girls  do you think hed bother them now asked sam if he bothers grace laning he had better look out for me  thats right sam stand up for your own particular girl began tom  i didnt say she was my girl cried sam and he was glad that the darkness hid his redgrowing face im no more sweet on her than you are on her sister nellie  its dick who must lead off with dora stanhope went on tom  oh stow it and come on burst in dick if you keep on talking youll surely be caught grinder may be coming after us in a carriage  if we had our bicycles we could get there in no time said sam  yes and we might break our necks in the dark added dick come we havent more than a mile further to go  on the three trudged through the snow which was coming down faster each instant once they thought they heard carriage wheels behind them but soon the sounds faded away in the distance  at last they came in sight of the stanhope cottage a bright light was streaming from the sittingroom windows and looking in they saw dora sitting at the table reading a book and mrs stanhope resting comfortably in an easychair in front of the brightburning fire  dora herself came to the door in answer to their ring why mamma its the rovers she cried as she shook hands i never expected to see you tonight in such a snowstorm how kind of captain putnam to let you come  the captain had nothing to do with it answered dick as he gave her hand an extra squeeze which he somehow thought she returned we came because we were having a lot of trouble and didnt know what else to do  more trouble came from mrs stanhope as she also greeted them i was hoping all our troubles were a thing of the past  this isnt any trouble for you answered dick excepting that it brings trouble through your giving us shelter for the night  if thats the case then let it bring trouble put in dora promptly but what is it all about  ill tell you presently dora but in the meantime can you give sam some supper he hasnt had a mouthful since dinner time  you poor boy came from mrs stanhope to be sure he shall have his supper ill tell mary to prepare it at once and she bustled from the room to give the servant the necessary directions and returned at once  sitting down in front of the fire the three boys told their tale mrs stanhope and dora listening with keen attention when dick got to the point where jasper grinder had wanted to thrash him dora gave a scream  oh dick the idea why he really must be crazy  i believe his passion got the best of him said the eldest rover  im glad tom took the cane away went on dora  it is really too bad observed mrs stanhope when their story was finished i quite agree with you that captain putnam will not uphold mr grinder in his inhuman course of course you must stay here tonight and as long after that as you please  it was not long before supper was ready for sam and when he entered the dining room mrs stanhope went along to see that he got all he desired  i am awfully glad you came said dora in a low voice when she was alone with dick and tom i have something important to tell you something i didnt wish to mention in front of mamma for it will only worry her without doing any good  and what is it asked tom and dick in a breath  i was down to cedarville yesterday to do some shopping and i am almost certain that i saw dan baxter hanging around the hotel there  dan baxter ejaculated dick  hush dick not so loud yes dan baxter he was on the hotel stoop but the minute he saw me he went inside  perhaps you are mistaken said tom i hardly think hed dare to show himself here  at first i was uncertain about it but when i came back that way i looked again and i caught him peeping out at me from one of the barroom windows as soon as he saw me look he dodged out of sight  if dan baxter is in this neighborhood he is here for no good was dicks blunt comment evidently he has not forgiven us for helping to put his father back in jail  dan baxter is not of a forgiving nature dick you must be careful or he will make trouble for all three of you  we can take care of ourselves dora if only he doesnt annoy you and your mother  i dont think hell do thatnow mr crabtree is out of it answered dora and then as mrs stanhope reentered the room the subject was dropped     chapter vii  something of a surprise   despite the stirring events which had just passed the rovers managed to pass a pleasant evening at the stanhope cottage this was in a large measure due to dora who did all she could to entertain them and make them forget their troubles all played games and dora played the piano and sang for them while dick and tom also took a hand at the singing sam could not sing and declared that he was certainly getting a cold whether from being in the storeroom or not  at ten oclock the boys retired to a large bed chamber containing a double bed and a goodsized cot they were soon undressed and after saying their prayers dropped asleep and slept soundly until seven in the morning  when they arose a surprise awaited them on the ground outside the snow lay to the depth of a foot or more and it was still showing as heavily as ever  hullo we are snowed in exclaimed sam as he gazed out on the whitened landscape  sure enough returned dick and added  this looks as if captain putnam might not come back today  if thats the case i vote we stay here put in tom im sure mrs stanhope will keep us  it was found that sams cold had attacked him in earnest he was very hoarse and complained of a severe pain in the chest  youll have to do something for that cold said dick better stay in bed this morning and let mrs stanhope put a plaster on your chest  going below he told the lady of the cottage of his brothers condition a mustard draught was at once prepared and placed upon sam and he was also given some pine tar cough mixture these things relieved him somewhat but mrs stanhope insisted upon it that he remain in bed and brought him his breakfast with her own hands  of course you must stay here especially since sam is sick said dora while they were eating a breakfast of buckwheat cakes honey chops and coffee he may not get worse but if he does one of you will have to take the horse and go for the doctor  yes well have to watch sam answered dick but dont put yourselves to too much trouble on our account  as if we could take too much trouble for you exclaimed dora and blushed sweetly it was not likely that she would ever forget all the rovers had done for her and her mother  tom was anxious to learn about the lanings and was told that they were all at home and doing finely  nellie and grace are going on a visit to an aunt at timber run after the holidays said dora they wanted me to go along but i didnt care to leave mamma and we didnt wish to lock up the house for fear some tramps might break in and rob us  after breakfast sam said he felt like sitting up but toward noon his chest began to hurt him again and mrs stanhope said it would be best that somebody go for a doctor dick and tom both volunteered but it was finally decided that dick should go alone on horseback  a steed was soon saddled and off dick rode wrapped in his overcoat and with an old fur cap pulled well down over his ears it had now stopped snowing so the weather was not quite as unpleasant as it had been  dick was bound for the house of dr fremley a physician he knew well and thither he made his way as speedily as the horse could plow through the drifts which presented themselves at times when the wind arose it was nipping cold and the youth was glad to get in where it was warm when the physicians office in cedarville was reached  certainly i will come and see your brother said dr fremley ill be ready to go in about half an hour  will you go on horseback  yes  then ill wait in town and go back with you said dick i wish to make a purchase or two  it was agreed that the youth should meet the physician at halfpast twelve and leaving his horse in the latters stable dick walked down the main street of cedarville  he had his christmas money with him and entering a drug store he bought a cup of hot chocolate that warmed him considerably after this he selected a bottle of cologne and a box of chocolates as a christmas gift for dora  opposite to the drug store was a stationery and book store and here dick procured a fancy floral calendar for mrs stanhope and an interesting girls book for dora  from the store dick could obtain a side view of the cedarville hotel which stood on a corner up the street and having paid for his purchases the youth stood near the door and watched the hotel wondering at the same time if he would see anything of dan baxter  presently a number of men came from the barroom of the hotel and moved in various directions with one of these was the youth for whom dick was looking  dan baxter and his companion moved in the direction of the lake shore and dick lost no time in following the pair  the man with baxter was a stranger to dick but he showed by his manner that he was a rough individual and when he talked he did a great deal of swearing which however will not appear in his conversation in these pages  having reached the road running along the lake front baxter and his companion whose name was lemuel husty passed northward past a straggling row of cottages and then on the road leading to the village of neckport  i wish i had timeid follow them said dick to himself and turned back much disappointed over the fact that he had not had a chance to speak to dan baxter  as dick turned in the direction of the doctors office once more he was hailed by a lad of the village named harry sharp  hullo dick rover  how are you harry how do you like the snow  all right enough only it will spoil some of the skating  so ive been thinking answered dick as the two came closer  say dick who do you suppose i met a while ago went on harry sharp  i dont knowdan baxter  thats the chap how did you guess it  i saw him myself  i thought he didnt dare to show himself  well he ought to be arrested harry but perhaps having his father in prison and losing most of his money is punishment enough for him  i met him in the post office he was posting several letters  did you see the handwriting on the letters  no as soon as he saw me he slid out of sight  i guess he doesnt fancy being recognized by the way have you seen captain putnam  saw him about an hour ago i think he was going to the hall  good enough i was waiting for him to get back  a few words more followed and the two boys separated and dick hurried to the doctors office dr fremley was ready to leave and soon the pair were on the way to the stanhope cottage  not wishing to give the hall a bad name dick deemed it advisable to say nothing about the fact that sam had been locked in an icecold room without his overcoat or hat and merely stated that his brother had exposed himself  he has a very heavy cold said the doctor after an examination if let run it would have become serious beyond a doubt but i feel confident i can check it and he left some medicine and some plasters  as soon as the doctor was gone dick announced his intention of returning to putnam academy the captain has got back and i want to lay the whole case before him and do it too while sam is still sick  shall i go along asked tom  no ill go alone they may need you here on sams account  dick was soon on the way riding another horse for the stanhopes now kept two he had had a fine dinner and felt in the best of spirits despite the disagreeable task before him he did not doubt for a moment but that captain putnam would side with him and condemn the actions of jasper grinder  he was still out of sight of the hall when he saw peleg snuggers riding toward him in the captains cutter  is that you master rover sang out the man of all work where are your brothers  safe snuggers has the captain got back  yesgot in a couple of hours ago  has he said anything about our going away  said anything just guess he has why the whole school is so upset nobody knows what he is doing do you know what happened after you and your brothers ran away  of course i dont what did happen  mr grinder had a terrible row with more than a dozen of the boys who sided with what you had done he got awfully mad at them and was going to cane the lot when all of a sudden he fell down in a fit just like he was going to die and we had to work over him most an hour before we could bring him around     chapter viii  jasper grinder is dismissed   dick was greatly surprised over the news which peleg snuggers conveyed to him he knew that jasper grinder was an intensely passionate man when aroused as on the occasion of the attempted caning but he had not imagined that the man would fall into a fit while in such a condition  did he come out of the fit all right he questioned soberly  when he came around he was as weak as a rag and i and one of the big boys had to help him up to his room he stayed there the rest of the evening and the other teachers had to take charge  what do they say about the matter  as soon as the captain got back all of em got in the private office and held a long talk then the captain had a talk with mr grinder and after that the captain sent me off to look for you he said you must be at the lanings or at mrs stanhopes or else somewhere in cedarville  we are stopping with mrs stanhope sam is sick with a heavy cold  its not to be wondered at master tubbs has a cold too and the captain had mrs green give him some medicine for it  has he punished tubbs  no hes awfully upset and i dont think hell do anything right away concluded the general utility man  the cutter was turned around and dick and snuggers hurried toward the hall their coming was noticed by a score of boys who were snowballing each other oh the parade ground and a shout went up  dick rover is coming back snuggers has brought dick rover back  take care of the horse snuggers said dick do the right thing and i wont forget to pay you at christmastime  all right master rover thank you answered the man of all work  dick was at once surrounded but before he could answer any questions he saw captain putnam appear at one of the windows and at once went inside to greet him  well rover what does all this mean demanded the head of the school but there was not much sternness in his tone  it means captain putnam that sam tom and i couldnt stand the treatment we received from mr grinder for a little setto which sam and tubbs had in the gymnasium mr grinder put sam in the icecold storeroom and was going to keep him there all night with nothing but stale bread to eat and cold water to drink if sam had remained in the storeroom he would have died from the effects of it as it is he is now in bed at mrs stanhopes and we had to call in dr fremley to attend him  is he very ill rover tell me the exact truth  i have never told you anything else captain putnam no i dont think he is very ill but hes got a bad cold he is very hoarse and he complained of such a pain in the chest that mrs stanhope put on some plasters and when the doctor came he left some more  humph captain putnam began to walk up and down his private office what did you tell dr fremley  nothing but that sam had exposed himself i didnt want to give the school a black name but one thing is certain we cant remain here if mr grinder is going to stay i shall write to my father and tell him the full particulars  it will not be necessary to do so richard the captain caught dick by the shoulder i have investigated this affair and while i find that sam was to blame and tom and you too yet i am convinced that mr grinder exceeded his authority here he had no business to put sam in the storeroom and master tubbs in the stone cell in this freezing weather more than that something happened after you left that shows plainly mr grinder is not the proper person to be a teacher here and from today i intend to dispense with his services  dick knew what the captain referred to the falling of the teacher into his passionate fit on the floor but he said nothing on that point for in a way he felt sorry for one who could control himself so little  i am glad we wont have to put up with him sir any longer in one way he is worse than mr crabtree was  let us drop the whole subject richard i have not been satisfied with mr grinder for some time past and had in view a teacher to take his place before this happened the new teacher will come after the holidays and i feel certain all the students will like him fully as much as they like mr strong  we wont ask for anybody better than mr strongor yourself answered dick with a smile  a talk lasting quarter of an hour followed and it was decided that dick should return to the stanhope cottage to tell tom and sam what turn affairs had taken then tom was to come to the hall leaving dick to look after sam  it was nightfall before dick got back to the cottage of course his brothers and the others listened to his story with interest both sam and tom felt greatly relieved  if grinder keeps on hell kill himself in one of his fits said sam i hope he leaves before i go back to school  if i was you i wouldnt go back until he does leave said tom im sure mrs stanhope will let you stay here wont you  to be sure tom answered the lady of the cottage but now captain putnam has made up his mind you may be sure mr grinder will not remain at the hall many days  perhaps hell go tonight said dora the captain surely wont wish him at the hall over sunday  tom remained with his brothers until evening then started for the hall on foot not caring to bother with a horse the road was now well broken so he had no trouble in making the journey  when he arrived at the academy he found the boys assembled in the classroom in charge of one of the underteachers  you cannot see captain putnam at present said the teacher you will have to remain here with the other pupils until he is at leisure  something must be wrong murmured tom as he slipped in a seat next to george granbury  i think the captain is getting rid of old grinder was the whispered reply hes afraid wed go out and give him three groans when he left  i see well its best to let him go quietly good riddance to him  thats what all the boys say although some are sorry he had the fit  so am i sorry but he brought it on himself  presently there was loud knocking in the front of the building and the slamming of a door then a trunk was dumped into the captains cutter and the horse started off carrying peleg snuggers and jasper grinder behind him  when the captain came into the classroom he was pale and pulled nervously on his mustache evidently his task of getting rid of the passionate teacher had not been a light one he said but little and shortly after the boys were dismissed and sent to bed  sunday continued bright and clear but it was so bitter cold that but few of the students went to church and sunday school tom was anxious to hear how sam was getting along and in the afternoon captain putnam himself drove him to the stanhope cottage in the cutter  it was found that the youngest rover was feeling much better although his hoarseness had not left him he said he was sure he could go back to school the next day  we had a visit from jasper grinder said dick he insisted on stopping here in spite of all snuggers could do to stop him  and what did he say asked the captain anxiously  oh he was in a terrible rage and threatened to sue my father because as he put it we had driven him from earning a good living i could hardly get him out of the house and when he left he picked up a big chunk of ice and snow and hurled it through the sittingroom window at sam i believe the man isnt quite right in his head  it certainly looks like it was the captains grave response  did snuggers leave him in cedarville  yes but snuggers didnt know where he went after that excepting that he called at the post office for some letters  i hope i never have anything to do with him again said sam with a shiver  i do not believe he will bother you in the future returned the captain when he comes to his sober senses he will realize fully how foolishly he has acted  as sam was so much better and needed no care that mrs stanhope and dora were not willing to give him tom returned to the hall with dick and captain putnam after supper at the widows cottage the sleigh ride to the school was delightful for the road was now in excellent shape while overhead the stars shone down like so many glittering diamonds     chapter ix  a race on the ice and what followed   after the events just narrated several days passed quietly enough at putnam hall in the meantime the weather continued clear and the boys took it upon themselves to clear off a part of the lake for skating then one night came a strong wind and the next morning they found a space of cleared ice nearly half a mile long  now for some fine skating exclaimed tom as he rushed back to the hall after an inspection of the lakes smooth surface we can have all the racing we wish  its a pity sam cant go out yet returned dick sam was back to the school but his cold had not entirely left him  never mind here are several new magazines he can read returned tom who had been to town with snuggers on an errand and had purchased them at the stationery store  i would just as soon read now said sam the magazines look mighty interesting  just then fred garrison came in accompanied by george granbury they had been down to cedarville to purchase some skates and a new pair of shoes for george  hullo what do you think we saw in cedarville cried fred as soon as he caught sight of the rovers  lots of snow suggested tom dryly  yesand more  a mighty dull town suggested sam  we saw dan baxter  what was he doing  he was walking down the street and who do you suppose was with him mr grinder  grinder came simultaneously from tom and dick  yes grinder and they seemed to be on good terms with each other put in george  i could hardly believe my eyes at first went on fred but there they were as plain as day  its very odd mused dick what should bring them together  nobody could answer that question  i dont believe they are up to any good said tom  i hope grinder doesnt join hands with baxter in plotting against us came from dick  the matter was talked over for some time but no satisfactory conclusion could be reached and presently the boys separated some to go skating and others to attend to their studies for the morrow  down at the lake the scene was an animated one boys were flying in every direction and mingled with them were a dozen or more girls and a few grown persons george strong the head teacher was there enjoying himself fully as much as the pupils who loved him  ill race you mr strong sang out one of the older boys tom mardell  done master mardell was the teachers answer to yonder rock and return and in a moment more the pair were off  hurrah a race between mr strong and tom mardell came in a shout from a number of the students and soon there was a general lining up to see how it would terminate  go in tom shouted tom rover dont let him beat you  mr strong is behind came presently tom is going to win out sure  on and on went the skaters until the rock was gained then tom mardell turned so suddenly that he ran full tilt into the teacher with whom he was racing both spun around and came down on the ice with a crash  oh gasped mardell i didnt mean to do that  ii know you didnt panted mr strong you have finished the race in fine shape i must declare and then he arose slowly to his feet and mardell followed but nobody was seriously hurt and in a moment more both skated off hand in hand  dick was looking for dora stanhope and presently she appeared in a pretty fur coat and a jaunty fur cap he put on her skates for her and they skated off with many a side wink from some of the boys  dicks head over heels said one lad to tom  well i guess youd be too urner if you could get such a nice girl to notice you returned tom dryly and then he added you must remember we are all old friends  oh i know that and i was only joking  a grand race open to all comers had been arranged by the students of the hall and of pornell academy a rival institute of learning which has already figured in other volumes of this series the pornell boys were out in force and they were sure that one of their number would win the silver napkin ring which was the first prize and another the story book which constituted the second prize  of this race a gentleman from cedarville named mr richards was to be the starter and judge the course was a short mile down the lake and back again the pornell boys to enter were named gray wardham gussy and de long the contestants from putnam hall were tom rover fred garrison tubbs and a lad named hollbrook  are you ready asked mr richards after lining the boys up and telling them of the conditions of the race  there was a dead silence  go shouted the starter  away went the eight skaters side by side each striking out bravely fred was in the lead with two pornell boys a close second while tom rover was fourth  go in tom you must win sang out dick excitedly  hurrah for tubby came from several others hes crawling up  go in gray came in a shout from some pornell sympathizers gray was one of the pair striving for second place now he shot ahead and in a second more was close upon fred garrisons heels  the pace was truly terrific from the very start and long before the turn was gained de long and hollbrook dropped out satisfied that they could not win  gray the leader of the pornell contingent was a tall lanky and powerful fellow and every stroke he took told well in his favor the turning point was hardly rounded when he began to crawl up to fred and then he gradually passed him  hurrah gray is ahead shouted his friends  here is where pornell wins the race added one enthusiastic sympathizer  freds pace had been too sharp from the very start and now he slowly but surely dropped back to second place and then to third  but then tom rover began to crawl up he had held himself slightly in reserve now he let himself out whiz whiz went the polished pair of steels under him and soon wardham the fellow who had held second place was passed dropping behind fred thus taking fourth place then tom came up on grays heels  hurrah for tom rover  go it tom dont let him beat you  go it gray tom rover is at your heels  gray did not dare to look back but at the latter cry he did his best to increase his speed so did tom and while the finishing line was still a hundred yards distant he came up side by side with gray  its a tie  no gray is a little ahead yet  go in gray dont let him beat you  tom rover to the front go it tom for the glory of old putnam hall  a wild yelling broke out on every side on and on went the two boys with fred garrison not two yards behind them that the finish would be a close one there was no question the line was but a hundred feet away now but seventyfive now but fifty still the leaders kept side by side neither gaining an inch surely it would be a tie the yelling increased until the noise was deafening  and then of a sudden tom rover shot ahead how it was done nobody knew and tom himself couldnt explain it when asked afterward but ahead he went like an arrow shot from a bow and crossed the line six feet in advance of gray  hurrah tom rover has won  told you tom would do it  three cheers for putnam hall  and fred garrison came in only one yard behind gray too and tubby is a pretty good fourth  this is putnam hall day thank you  the cheering increased and tom was immediately surrounded by a host of admirers  gray felt very sore and wanted to leave the pond at once but before he could do so tom skated up to him and held out his hand  you came pretty close to beating me he said i cant really say how i got ahead at the finish  ii guess my skate slipped or something stammered gray and shook hands toms candor took away the keen edge of the defeat  the putnam hall boys were wild with delight and insisted upon carrying tom on their shoulders around the pond a great crowd followed and nobody noticed how this made the ice bend and crack  be careful there shouted mr strong warningly there are too many of you in a bunch but ere he had finished the sentence there came another loud cracking and in a twinkle a section of the ice went down plunging fully a dozen lads into the icy water below     chapter x  the end of the term   the ice has gone down  some of the boys will be drowned  get some boards and a rope quick  these and a score of other cries rang out in the meantime those near to the hole skated with all speed to one place of safety or another  some of the imperiled boys who had not gone down very deeply managed to scramble out with wet feet or wet lower limbs only but when the crowd had drawn back it was seen that three boys were floundering in the chilling water over their heads these boys were george granbury and frank harrington who had been supporting tom on their shoulders and tom himself who had been dropped into the opening head first by the frightened lads  realizing that something must be done at once mr strong ran to the boathouse which was close at hand and soon reappeared carrying a long plank he was followed by a boy with a rope and several boys brought more planks and more ropes  illustration the mishap on the ice rover boys in the mountains  when the first plank was pushed out tom lost no time in grasping hold of it he crawled to a safe place on hands and knees but was so nearly paralyzed he could not stand up  ill carry him up to the hall said peleg snuggers who had chanced upon the scene and without ceremony he picked tom up in his strong arms and made off for the school building on a run  after tom came frank harrington who caught hold of one end of a rope tossed toward the hole as soon as he shouted he had the rope secure a dozen boys pulled upon it and frank was literally dragged from his icy bath once on shore he was started on a run for the hall some boys rushing ahead to obtain dry clothing for both him and the others  poor george granbury was now the only one left in danger and matters appeared to be going hard with him he clutched at one of the planks thrust toward him but his hold slipped and down he went out of sight  hell be drowned hes too cold to save himself was the cry of several who were watching him  be careful boys came warningly from mr strong be careful or somebody else will get in  mr strong if you will hold the plank ill crawl out and get hold of granbury came from dick in a determined voice  rover can you do it  i feel certain i can hold tight please  dick leaped upon the plank and threw himself flat then he crawled out as fast as he could until he was on the end over the open water holding to the plank with one hand he reached out to grasp georges shoulder with the other  sasave me gasped the drowning boy  give me your hand george called dick  granbury tried to do so but the effort was a failure for the cold had so numbed him he could scarcely move reaching as far as he could dick caught a portion of his coat and drew the helpless boy toward him  the ice cracked ominously but did not break mr strong warned the others still further back  slowly but surely dick raised george to a level of the plank then with an extra effort he hauled the halfdrowned boy up  now haul in on the plank he called and mr strong and two boys did so immediately in a moment more danger from drowning was a thing of the past for george granbury  a cheer went up because of dicks heroic action but this was instantly hushed as george was seen to stagger back and fall as if dead instantly mr strong picked the boy up in his arms and ran toward the hall  oh dick how noble of you it was dora stanhope who spoke as she came up and placed a trembling little hand on his arm and how glad i am that you didnt get in while doing it and her eyes filled with tears  iim glad too dora he said brokenly and then added excuse me but i guess id better go up and see how tom is making out  to be sure and let me know if its all right she replied  once inside the hall dick learned that tom had been put into a warm bed he was apparently none the worse for his mishap and likely to be as full of life and fun as ever on the morrow  poor granbury however was not so well off it took some time to restore him to consciousness and while captain putnam and mr strong put him to bed with hotwater bags to warm him up peleg snuggers was sent off posthaste for a doctor as a result of the adventure granbury had to remain in bed for the best part of a week  i shant forget you for what you did he said to dick when able to sit up you saved my life and many agreed that what george granbury said was true as for dora stanhope she looked upon the elder rover as more of a hero than ever  after the mishap at the races on the ice the time flew by swiftly until the christmas holidays before going home for christmas dick called upon the stanhopes and gave them the gifts he had purchased over which they were much pleased for dick dora had worked a pretty scarf of which he was justly proud mrs stanhope had books for all the boys something which was always to their liking the rovers did not forget the lanings nor were they forgotten by these old friends  and now for home hurrah shouted sam on the way to cedarville i must say im just a bit anxious to see the old place once more  yes and see father and uncle randolph and aunt martha put in dick  dont forget alexander pop put in tom referring to the colored man who had once been a waiter at the hall and who was now in the rover employ  and jack ness and the rest put in sam i guess well be glad enough to see everybody  when the boys arrived at ithaca they found there had been a freight smashup on the railroad and that they would have to wait for five or six hours for a train to take them home this would bring them to oak run their railroad station at three oclock in the morning  i move we stay in ithaca over night said tom if we got to oak run at three in the morning what would we do there would be no one there to meet us and its a beastly hour for rousing anybody out  so they decided to put up at a hotel in ithaca and went around to a new place called the students rest the hotel was fairly well filled but they secured a large apartment with two double beds  theres a nice concert on this evening by a college glee club said sam i move we get tickets and go  second the motion said tom promptly  the motion is put and carried put in dick just as promptly i trust though the concert dont make us weep  they wont know were there so perhaps they wont try it on too hard said sam and there the students slang came to an end for the time being  the concert was quite to their taste and they were surprised when it was over to learn that it was after eleven oclock  i hadnt any idea it was so late exclaimed dick wed better be getting back to the hotel or we wont get our moneys worth out of that room  thats right laughed tom although to tell the truth im not very sleepy  several blocks were covered when sam who was looking across the street uttered a cry of astonishment  look he exclaimed  at what asked both tom and dick  over in front of that clothing store there is dan baxter and jasper grinder is with him  sam is right came from dick they must have struck up some sort of a friendship or they wouldnt be here together  lets go over and see what baxter has to say for himself said tom boldly  all right returned dick but we want to keep out of a row remember that  they crossed the street and walked straight up to baxter and jasper grinder who were holding an animated conversation in the doorway of a clothing establishment which was closed for the night  as they came up sam caught the words there is money there sure coming from baxter he paid no attention to the words at the time but remembered them long afterward and with good reason  hullo baxter said dick halting in front of the bully  dan baxter gave a start as if detected in some wrong act then as the light from an electric lamp shone upon dicks face he glared sourly at the oldest rover  where did you come from he asked and then seeing the other rovers added been following me i suppose  no we havent been following you said dick we just came from the college boys concert in the hall down the street  jasper grinder looked as sour as did dan baxter then he shook his finger in dicks face  i havent forgotten you richard rover he said bitterly and i am not likely to forget you  as you please mr grinder was the cool rejoinder  and i shant forget you jasper grinder put in sam you were the means of my going to bed with a heavy cold  bah it was all put on exclaimed jasper grinder had i had my way i would have kept you in the storeroom all night and flogged you beside  captain putnam did a good thing when he dismissed you put in tom its a pity he ever took on such a coldhearted and miserly fellow  you rovers think you are on top said dan baxter savagely but you wont stay on top long ill give you my word on that  what are you going to do about it asked dick not without considerable curiosity  never mind youll learn when the proper time comes  is your dad going to try to break jail again asked sam  its none of your business what he doesor what i do either  well make it our business if you try any of your games on us again said dick weve stood enough from you and your kind and we dont intend to stand any more  are you going back to school after the holidays asked dan baxter after a pause  thats our business answered tom  all right you neednt answer the question if you dont want to  what do you want to know for asked sam  oh nothing in particular i suppose its a good place for you to go to you are all captain putnams pets and he wont make you do a thing you dont like or make you study either if your father shells out to him  we study a great deal more than you ever studied baxter said dick  let them go cried jasper grinder in deep irritation i want nothing to do with them and he turned his back on the rovers  were willing to go said dick but baxter i warn you against doing anything in the future youll only put your foot into it  so speaking dick walked away and tom and sam followed him baxter shook his fist at them and jasper grinder did the same  theyre a bad team said tom as they walked to the hotel if they try perhaps they can give us lots of trouble     chapter xi  home for the holidays   hurrah here we are again how natural oak run looks exclaimed tom on the following day as the long train came to a halt at their station and they piled out on to the narrow platform  there is old nat ricks the station master said sam remember how you nearly scared him to death once by putting a big firecracker in the waste paper he was burning and then telling him a yarn about dynamite being around  well i just guess i do answered tom with a grin hullo mr ricks he called out how are you this fine and frosty morning  putty well tom grumbled the old station master been troubled a lot lately with rheumatism  thats too bad mr ricks caught it hoisting trunks into the cars i suppose  dont know how i caught it  or maybe lifting milk cans  i dont lift no milk cans no more job todder has that work around here  i see well you must have caught it somehow or else it caught you ever tried the old indian remedy for it  indian remedy whats that  gracious mr ricks never heard of the old reliable indian remedy im astonished at you went on tom in mock candor  ive heard tell of indian vegetable pillsbut they aint no good for rheumatism was the slow answer  where is the pain mostly  down this left leg  then the indian remedy will just cure you sure pop mr ricks  well what might it be  it might be coverliver oil but it isnt you get a quart bottlea red quart bottle for a white one wont doand fill it with cold spring water tapped when the moon is full  is that all  oh no no then you take the spring water and boil it over a charcoal fire same as the modoc indians used to do you remember all about that dont you  iipears to me i ought to stammered the old station master  well after the water is boiled went on tom with a side wink at dick and sam who were already on a broad grin you strain it through a piece of red cheeseclothnot white rememberand add one teaspoonful of sugar one of salt one of ginger one of mustard one of hogs lard one of mercury one of arrowroot one of kerosene oil one of lemon juice one of extract of vanilla one of mushamusha  hold on rover i cant remember all that ill have to put it down interrupted nat ricks  no you dont put it down until everything is in and well mixed then you put it down half a pint at a time four times a day its a sure cure and inside of a week after taking seventeen quarts and rubbing the empty bottles on your left shoulder blade youll feel like dancing a jig of joy really you will  oh you go along growled the old station master in sudden wrath youre joking me go oh or ill throw something at you  no bouquets please mr ricks then you wont try the cure all right but dont blame me if your rheumatism gets worse and as i cant do anything for you will you kindly inform me if youve seen anything of jack ness around here with our turnout  if you want your hired man you go find him yourself growled the station master and hobbled into his office  oh tom but that was rich laughed sam softly when you said extract of vanilla and mushamusha i thought id explode and he was listening so earnestly too  heres jack ness cried dick as they turned to the rear of the station hullo jack here we are again  master dick exclaimed the hired man with a grin an tom an sam glad to see you boys back indeed i am here give me them bags ill put em in the back of the sleigh  how is the sleighing asked sam  sleighing is quite fair yet master tom in you go all the folks is dying to see you  they were soon stowed away in the big family sleigh and jack ness touched up the team and away they went through oak run and across the bridge spanning the swift riverthat stream where sam had once had such a thrilling adventure the countryside was covered with snow and with pools of ice  it did not take them long to come in sight of valley brook while still at a distance they saw faithful alexander pop come out on the broad piazza and wave his hand at them  theres aleck cried tom hes been on the watch  there is father came from sam a moment later and aunt martha and uncle randolph  soon they turned into the lane and jack ness brought the sleigh up to the piazza block in fine style tom was the first out and ran to greet his father and then his uncle and his aunt and the others followed  i am glad to see you back boys said mr anderson rover you all look firstrate  were feeling firstrate came from dick  are you sure sam that you are quite over your cold asked aunt martha anxiously  quite sure aunty dear he answered and kissed her very warmly not once but several times  here dont eat aunt martha up cried tom leave some for me  you dear tom murmured the lady of the house as she kissed him and then embraced dick full of fun as ever i suppose  oh no aunty i never do anything wrong now answered tom solemnly i really havent time you know  im afraid tom i cant trust you and mrs randolph rover shook her head sadly but smiled nevertheless she loved the jolly lad with all her heart  there was a warm greeting from randolph rover also and then the boys turned indoors to greet faithful alexander pop and the others who worked about the place  yo is a sight fo soah eyes deed yo is boys said the colored man i cant tell yo how much ise missed yo and his face shone like a piece of polished ebony  its more like home than ever to get where you are aleck said dick youve been through so much with us you are certainly part of the outfit and at this aleck laughed and looked more pleased than ever  it was the day before christmas but in honor of their arrival there was an extrafine dinner awaiting them mrs rover had wanted to keep her turkey meat for christmas so her husband anderson rover and aleck had gone into the woods back of the farm and brought down some rabbits and a number of birds so there was potpie and other good things galore not forgetting some pumpkin pies and homemade doughnuts which aunt martha prepared with her own hands and of which the boys had always been exceedingly fond  ill tell you what remarked tom as he was stowing away his second generous piece of pie the feed at the hall is all right but when it comes to a real downright spread like this the palm goes to aunt martha and dick and sam agreed with him  there was of course much to tell about on both sides and after dinner the family gathered in the big sitting room in front of a cheerful blazing fire mr anderson rover listened with keen interest to what his sons had to say about jasper grinder and dan baxter  i sincerely trust they do not plot against us he said i am getting old and i want no more trouble  i dont believe dan has the backbone his father has answered dick and i believe mr grinder is good deal of a coward  if only young baxter would turn over a new leaf sighed mrs martha rover i declare ill not feel safe on your account until that young man is taken care of  the evening was passed in talking singing and playing games and it was not until late that all retired  the christmas to follow was not one to be easily forgotten there were presents for everybody from mr rover down to sarah the hired girl and everybody was greatly pleased  at the christmas dinner alexander pop insisted upon waiting on the table just as he had so often done at putnam hall he had on his full dress suit and his face wore one perpetual smile the boys had all remembered aleck handsomely and he had not forgotten them  in the afternoon the boys went skating and on the pond met several of the boys of the neighborhood and all had a glorious time until dark then they piled home once more as hungry as wolves to a hot supper and an evening of nutcracking around the fire  tell you what said sam on going to bed that night i almost wish christmas came once a week instead of once a year     chapter xii  the brasslined money casket   it was on the day following christmas that dick brought out the brasslined money casket which he had picked up in the cave on needle point island in lake huron as related in a previous volume of this series  as old readers know this cave was stumbled upon by accident it had once been the hiding place of a band of smugglers who plied their unlawful calling between the united states and canada and the cave was found filled with numerous articles of more or less value the rovers had gone back for these things but had found some money gone also a curiously shaped dagger and a map which had been in the cave on a rude table they were pretty well satisfied in their minds that dan baxter had taken these things but had never been able to prove it  the brasslined money casket was an oddlooking affair which dick found thrust in a big box of fancy articles of various descriptions the box was about a foot long six inches wide and six inches deep it was of rosewood with silver corners and the lining was of polished brass curiously engraved the box had contained a few odd canadian silver coins but that was all  do you know i would like to know the history of this box observed dick as he looked it over as it belonged to one of those smugglers it ought to have quite a story to tell  it will make a nice jewel casket put in tom when you settle down with dora you can give if to her for her dia  oh stow that tom if dora ever does take me for a husband it wont be for some years to come you must know that  let me take a look at the box put in sam i never got the chance to look it over carefully  its odd that they should engrave it inside went on dick especially since the outside silver corners are plain  perhaps there is a secret spring hidden by the engraving suggested tom hunt around it may fly apart and let out a hundred thousand in diamonds  dont be foolish tom said dick it isnt likely there is a spring  but there just is a spring exclaimed sam who was handling the box hark  he ran his finger nail over a spot on one side of the box and there followed a tiny click then he ran his finger nail back and there was another click  hurrah sam has solved the mystery of the sphinx cried tom can you open it i claim a third share of the diamonds  give me the box said dick also a bit excited when he got it in his hands he too ran his finger nail over the engraved brass several tiny clicks followed  there must be some opening beneath the brass lining he said  take it to the window and perhaps youll be able to see something more suggested sam  dick did as advised and with his brothers gathered close beside him worked over the money casket for fully quarter of an hour  it seems to click and thats all he said disappointedly if i could onlyoh  dick stopped short his finger had run across the lining in a certain way there were three clicks in rapid succession and on the instant one of the brass plates of the box flew back revealing a tiny compartment behind it not over a quarter of an inch in depth  no diamonds there said tom his face falling full of emptiness  no here is a sheet of parchment returned dick pulling it forth a map he added as he unfolded it well i never  never what came from tom and sam  unless i am mistaken this is like the map that was on that table in the cave only this is much smaller  thats interesting too said tom  the back of the map is full of writing said sam he looked closer its in french  this box must have belonged to one of those frenchcanadian smugglers said dick well have to get uncle randolph to read the writing and tell us what it says  the three boys had been up to dicks room now they lost no time in going below in all eagerness they burst into the library where anderson rover sat reading a magazine and randolph rover one of his favorite works on scientific farming  dick has got the money casket open cried sam  and he has found a map added tom we want uncle randolph to read the writing its in french  found a map in that old brasslined box eh said anderson rover thats interesting  i am afraid my french is a trifle rusty remarked randolph rover as he put down his book let me see the map  he took it to the window and both he and anderson rover looked it over with keen interest  why this is a map of the locality around timber run said randolph rover thats a great lumbering section in the adirondacks  timber run echoed tom and for the moment said no more but he remembered what dora stanhope had said that after the holidays nellie and grace laning were going on a visit to an aunt who lived at timber run  yes thomas this is a map of timber run this stream is the perch river and this is bear pond the naming is in french but that is the english of it  please read the writing on the back said dick if the map is worth anything i want to know it  without further ado randolph rover began to read the writing it was a hard and tedious task and the translating was to him equally difficult for his knowledge of french was somewhat limited translated the writing ran somewhat after this fashion  to find the box of silver and gold go to where bear pond empties into perch river ten paces to the west is a large pine tree which was once struck by lightning go due southwest from the pine tree sixtytwo paces to the flat rock behind which is a sharppointed rock beneath the sharppointed rock is the chamber with the box stranger beware of gouperts ghost                                        a treasure in the mountains cried sam hurrah lets go and get it  bear pond lies between two high mountains said randolph rover it is in a very wild country and so far but little of the timber has been taken out  never mind well go anyhow put in tom enthusiastically why the box may be worth a fortune  yes let us go by all means put in dick i wouldnt like any better fun than hunting for a treasure box  havent you boys had adventures enough questioned anderson rover youve been to africa and out west and on the ocean and the great lakes  oh this would just be a little winters outing in the mountains said tom we could go hunting and have lots of fun even if we didnt find the treasure box  the treasure box was probably taken away years ago said randolph rover most likely several of the smugglers knew of it  and what of that ghost asked anderson rover with a twinkle in his eyes  pooh were not afraid of ghosts sniffed sam are we tom  if i saw a ghost id be apt to pepper him with shot if i had my gun answered tom no im not afraid of such thingsand neither is dick  it would be a fine thing to find a big boxful of silver said dick seriously i know there was lots in that cave before dan baxter scooped it in and by the way he must have that other map yet  perhaps he went for the treasure box burst out sam  if the box is gone we cant help it said tom but i move we get to timber run and bear pond just as soon as possible  do you want to start in this cold weather asked his father anxiously  pooh it isnt so very cold  its a good deal colder up in the mountains than it is here i can tell you that why you might easily freeze to death if you got lost in the snow  i wonder if we couldnt find some guide who knows that territory thoroughly mused dick  if you could find a good guide i wouldnt mind your going said his parent but i shall object to your going alone  then well hunt for a guide and without delay said dick i would like to go up there before putnam hall opens again  so would i came from his two brothers  i think i know where you can get a guide said tom after a pause the lanings have relatives at timber run lets write to mr laning  this was agreed to and a special trip was made to the village by aleck pop to post the letter in the letter they asked mr laning to telegraph if possible in reply  the telegram came shortly after noon the next day it ran as follows      i feel sure my brotherinlaw john barrow of timber run can     supply a reliable guide will write to him      john laning  that settles it said dick i know the lanings will do what is right by us so we may as well get ready to start at once are you willing father  yes dick was the answer but be sure and keep out of danger and keep tom and sam out too     chapter xiii  the heart of the adirondack   three days later found the rover boys in the heart of the adirondack mountains of new york state they had left home after a hasty but thorough preparation two days before and taken the train from oak run to the mountain village of medwell at medwell they had taken the stage to bartons corners and at this point had hired a private conveyance to carry them and their outfit to timber run  at the time of which i write timber run was nothing more than a collection of a dozen houses strung along a branch of the perch river where that stream turned the southern slope of a high hill known as bald top there was a general store here and also an office belonging to the timber run lumber company but business with the company was slow and the village consequently was almost destitute of life two of the houses being without tenants  well this doesnt look much like a place remarked sam as they got out of the heavy lumber wagon which had brought them and their outfit over  phew but aint it cold exclaimed tom dancing around and slapping his arms over his chest i wonder how nellie and grace laning like this  ill wager youve been thinking of nellie all the way up said dick slyly remembering how his brother had tormented him about dora stanhope  couldnt think of anything but how cold it was growled tom but his face took on a sudden redness where do you go next he demanded to change the subject  lets go over to the store and ask for mr john barrow suggested dick  the store was at a fork in the roads and thither they hurried to get inside for the ride from bartons corners had certainly been a chilling one in the store they found a big pot stove throwing out a generous amount of heat and around this stove were gathered half a dozen men smoking and telling stories  so you are the young men who are looking for john barrow said the storekeeper after listening to what dick had to say he was here waiting for you and hell be back in a bit rather a cold ride eh draw up to the fire and warm up  a place was made for the lads and while they were thawing out as sam put it john barrow came in he proved to be a tall powerful built lumberman with a welltanned face and sharp but kindly eyes  how do you do he said as he shook hands real glad to know you yes i got a letter from john laning my brotherinlaw tellin me all about you he says as how you want a guide fer these parts well i dont want to brag but i reckon i know the lay o the land round here about as good as any o em and a heap sight better nor lots  wed like you firstrate for a guide said tom who was pleased with john barrows looks as were also his brothers but can you spare the time  reckon i can just now you see the lumber company has got in some sort of a tangle with the owner of the timber on this tract and consequently work is at a standstill thats why you see so many men hangin around here  then you work for the company asked dick  i do in the winter time but not in the summer ive got a tidy farm down the river a bit and i let out my hosses to the company to haul timber its cash money you see when the haulin is goin on  i believe the laning girls are stopping with you put in sam  yes nellie and grace came up some time ago you see our girl addie gits tired being on the farm with only her mother so we invited her cousins to come up for a spell theyve had some pretty good times together so far skatin and sleighin and the like they are all anxious to see you  john barrow had brought with him his wagon and into this their outfit was dumped and a minute later they were off down the winding and rough road running along the bank of the river which was now frozen to a thickness of a foot or more and covered with several inches of snow  you say you know this locality observed dick as they bumped along over the frozen ground do you know the spot where bear pond empties into perch river  i know several such spots my lad  several came from all of the rover boys  yes several you see the ground around the pond is marshy and the heavy rains cut all sorts of gullies here and there so the pond empties into the river now at five or six pints  are these points very far apart asked sam in dismay you see im very anxious we should know the exact particulars  indeed john barrow looked at them curiously say i reckon i know what you are after he burst out suddenly  what came from the three  youre on a hunt for old gouperts treasure  why what do you know about that demanded dick he remembered that the writing on the map said beware of gouperts ghost  oh thats an old yarn about here and at different times weve had moren a hundred folks ahunting around for that old frenchmans money box but nobody ever got so much as a smell o it  who was goupert asked tom  goupert was a thoroughly bad man who lived sixty or seventy years ago the story goes that he used to be a smuggler and that he came here when the authorities chased him off the great lakes he had lots o money but he was a miser and a queer stick to boot he built himself a cabin on bear pond and lived there all alone for two years then some lake men came down here and one night there was a big row and the lake men disappeared goupert couldnt be found at first but about a month later some hunters discovered his dead body tied to a tree in the woods not far from the spot you asked about he had been left to starve to death the story was that the lake men had starved him in order to get him to tell where he had hidden his money box and that old goupert was too much o a miser to let the secret out so folks begun to hunt for that money box high an low but never got a smell o it as i said  did you ever hunt for the money questioned dick  no i never had no time to waste so you really came up on that account  we came up on that account and also to have a good time in the mountains said dick before sam or tom could speak but mr barrow i wish you wouldnt mention this to the other folks around here they might laugh at us for coming on what they think is a wildgoose chase  oh i wont say a word on itif you want it that way  did this goupert leave any relatives asked sam  no lad not a soul  then if we should find that treasure it would belong to us put in tom  every penny on it lad but dont raise any high hopes or you may be sorely disappinted  oh i came for a good time replied tom in an offhanded a manner as possible  presently john barrow had to get out of the wagon to fix something on the harness while he was doing this dick leaned over to his two brothers  dont say anything about the map to anybody he whispered well keep that a secret for the present and tom and sam nodded to show that they understood  the ride to john barrows house soon came to an end and as the boys alighted at the horseblock the door opened and nellie and grace laning appeared  how do you do tom cried nellie as she ran and caught him by the hand while grace did the same to sam were awfully glad to see you and to see dick and sam too and a handshaking all around followed then mrs barrow a motherly woman was introduced and also her daughter addie who was nellies age and full of fun  come right in boys said mrs barrow supper is waiting and im sure you must be hungry  hungry doesnt describe it said tom i could eat sole leather phew what an appetite riding in this mountain air does give a fellow  can you ever remember the time when you wasnt without an appetite tom asked nellie laning with a laugh  never go so far into ancient history he returned solemnly and a general laugh followed  soon their outfit was safely housed in the barn and then they entered the house where the long supper table filled with good things awaited them all three of the girls insisted upon waiting on the boys and it proved as jolly a meal as they had ever eaten they lingered for an hour at the table talking and cracking nuts and during that time the rover boys became thoroughly acquainted with the barrow family  oh ive heard lots about you said addie barrow nellie has told me great long stories about toms bravery and grace has told me all about sams doings and both of them have told about you dick  now do be still addie put in nellie laning i declare i never said a word  oh a word why you kept me awake one night for over an hour telling about how tom  lets have a song broke in sam i see an organ in the next room and some music you must play he added to addie  she plays beautifully put in grace thankful for the change of subject addie give them that new song im sorry oh so sorry  all right answered the young lady of the house and sitting down at the organ she ran her hands over the keys and started the song she could sing and play well and all joined in the chorus the music was kept up for over an hour and then the rover boys retired highly pleased over their reception     chapter xiv  the start up the river   if it wasnt for finding that treasure box id just as lief stay here for a few days remarked tom on getting up the following morning  ditto myself came from sam we could have a boss good time eh  how about it if nellie and grace werent here came from dick and then dodged a shoe thrown at him by tom and a pillow sent forth by sam no boys it wont dowe must leave for the hunt today why there may be a million in it  thats right dick when you fly fly high said tom that frenchman never had a million if he had a couple of thousand hed be lucky  and of course a couple of thousand is of no importance to us put in sam grandiloquently  all right ill go on the hunt alone  no dick of course well go said tom hastily when do you want to start  as soon as mr barrow can get off  but in spite of dicks anxiety to get off the start was delayed for a whole day much to tom and sams secret joy john barrow had to go to timber run for things needed in the house by his wife and daughter  when he returned there was a broad grin on his face  ive got news for you he said to dick who had followed him down to the barn theres another party arrived at timber run on the hunt fer that treasure of old gouperts  another party who is it  didnt hear their names there are two men and a young fellow o nineteen or twenty they have hired bill harney fer a guide and are goin to strike out fer the pond tomorrow  two men and a young fellow mused dick id like to know who they are  one o the men looked like a preacher or schoolmaster he called the young feller thacher or something like that  it wasnt baxter queried dick struck by a sudden idea  thats the namenow i remember  and the man did they call him grinderjasper grinder went on dick excitedly  if it wasnt grinder it was something like it the party came east from ithaca  its dan baxter and jasper grinder sure burst out dick well this beats the nation  then you know the crowd  i doto my sorrow mr barrow that dan baxter is the goodfornothing young fellow i told you of this morning and jasper grinder was a teacher at the hall we had a big row with him and he was kicked out in a hurry by captain putnam they are our enemies  humph that promises to make it interesting for you but its queer they should come up at the same time youre here went on the lumberman thoughtfully  i might as well let you into a secret mr barrow will you promise to keep it entirely to yourself  certainly lad if its an honest secret  it is honest answered dick and thereupon told of the adventure on needle point island and of the map on the table and how it had disappeared and of the finding of the second map in the brasslined money casket later on  i am sure dan baxter has that other map he concluded he wants that treasure as badly as we do  then i allow as how it will be a nipantuck race between you returned john barrow the fust to get there will be the best man o course with that map it ought to be plain enough sailin  i thought it would be but it will mix us up now you say that bear pond empties into perch river in several places well have to try one place after another  do your directions start from that pint  yes  then well have to find the right emptyin place thats all my advice is to start fer the spot tomorrow early  so it was arranged and dick called tom and sam down to the barn to talk it over it was late in the afternoon and all worked until after the supper hour in preparing for the start  its a good twenty miles tramp from here said john barrow and well have to climb two pretty steep mountains to get to the spot  why cant we follow the stream up asked tom that would be easier than tramping up the mountains  by the river the way is at least forty miles and there are half a dozen rough spots where youd have to walk a mile or two  we have our skates said sam skating would be easier than walking and pulling the sleds on the ice would be childs play  well i allow as how i wouldnt mind skatin myself said john barrow thoughtfully i never thought of that before if you want to we can try that trail we can take to the mountain any time if we find skating no good  so it was arranged that they should strike out for bear pond by way of the river and the sleds of which there were two were packed accordingly and the boys saw to it that their skates were well sharpened and otherwise in good condition  when youre skating you want to look out for air holes was john barrows caution fer where the river runs between the mountains it is mighty deep in spots i can tell you that  thanks ill be on my guard answered tom with a shiver ive had all i want of icy baths this winter  the girls were sorry to see the boys leave so quickly but were consoled when tom promised to stay longer on the return on the following morning breakfast was had at six oclock and by seven they were off everybody wishing them a good time only mrs barrow knew that the boys were on a treasure and not a bird and wild animal hunt  it was a clear frosty day and everybody was in the best of spirits the boys wore fur caps and warm clothing and each was provided with either a rifle or a shotgun so far they had seen but little game around the farm but john barrow assured them that the timber and mountains were full of game of all sorts  i wonder what route dan baxters party took said dick as they gained the river and stopped to put on their skates  i didnt hear what route they took answered their guide i reckon they went straight over the mountains i dont believe as how bill harney takes to skating  is this bill harney a good sort asked tom if he is i can tell you he has got into bad company  bill isnt so bad when hes sober its when he gits full o rum that he makes things lively hes a great drinker  they were soon on the river which at this point was fifty to sixty feet wide the snow covered a large portion of the surface but the wind had cleared many a long stretch and they skated on these dragging the sleds behind them each sled was packed high with the camping outfit but they ran along readily  i wonder how long well be out said sam as he skated by toms side  i guess that will depend upon what luck we have sam if we strike the right spot first clip we ought to be back inside of five or six days  as the party moved up the river they found the stream wound in and out between the mountains on either side were bare rocky walls or dense patches of timber with here and there a tiny open space now piled deep with snowdrifts  i see some rabbits ahead cried tom presently wonder if i can bring them down he added as he unslung his gun but long before he could take aim the bunnies were out of sight amid the timber  youll have to carry your gun in your hand for a shot at them came from dick but be careful or you may trip up on some frozen twig and shoot somebody  mile after mile was passed but no further game came to view much to toms disgust  not much right around here said john barrow as he saw tom put his gun back over his shoulder the boys from timber run have cleared the ground putty well but youll see something sure a little further onand maybe moren you bargain for  im not afraid of big game mr barrow we faced some pretty bad animals when we were in africa and out west  i allow that must be so tom but you want to be careful even so a big mountain deer or a bear aint to be fooled with i can tell you that  about eleven oclock they came to the first falls above timber run here the water was frozen into solid masses but the way was so uneven they found it profitable to take off their skates and tote the sleds around the spot this necessitated a walk of several hundred feet through the timber skirting the edge of the river the way was uncertain and john barrow went ahead to steer the party clear of any danger  finest timber in the world right here he observed i cant see why the timber company dont get together and put it in the market it would fetch a good price  wait i see something in yonder trees cried dick in a low voice can you make out what they are  wild turkeys answered the guide git down behind these bushes if we can bag a few of them well have rich eatin for a few days     chapter xv  wild turkeys   without delay the rover boys dropped behind the bushes and john barrow did the same all kept as quiet as possible for they knew that on the first alarm the wild turkeys would be off  the game was not over six feet from the ground sitting in three rows on as many branches of a hemlock that overhung the stream there were over a dozen in the flock each as plump as wild turkeys ever get  how shall we fire asked dick there is no call for all of us to shoot at the same bird  ill take one on the left answered john barrow you take one on the right tom can take a middle one sitting high and sam a middle one sitting low all ready  yes came the answer from one after another  then fire when i say three one twothree  bang bang went the firearms and as the reports echoed through the forest two of the wild turkeys were seen to drop dead under the branches upon which they had been sitting one that was badly wounded fluttered down and began to thrash around in the brush the rest of the flock flew away with a rush and were lost to sight between the trees  three that isnt so bad cried dick as they all started on a run forward soon they had the turkey on the ground surrounded and john barrow caught up the game and wrung its neck  i guess i missed my mark came rather sheepishly from tom  you exclaimed sam in surprise i was just going to say i had missed  nobody missed put in the guide  nobody came from the three rovers  somebody must have missed added tom we fired four shots and only got three birds  one of those that flew off was wounded he dropped a lot of feathers and went up in a shaky fashion of course he got away but just the same he was hit  well i thought i missed clean and clear said tom doubtfully  and i thought i missed laughed sam i guess well have to divide that third bird between us tom  weve got all the wildturkey meat well want on this trip came from john barrow before this is gone youll want a change ill warrant you  while the guide was caring for the birds the boys went back for the sleds soon they were again on the way and they did not stop until the vicinity of the falls was left far behind and they had again reached a point where skating would be good for several miles  reckon we can stop here and have dinner observed the guide feelin kind o hungry aint you  just guess i am hungry declared tom but i didnt want to say anything till the rest did  some of the cooking utensils were unpacked and while the boys got wood for the fire john barrow brought out some coffee and other things it was decided that they should not take time to cook a turkey until they went into camp for the night  soon a fire was blazing merrily they built it under the outer end of a long tree limb and from the limb suspended a pot full of water by a long iron chain they had brought along as the ground was covered with snow there was little danger of spreading a conflagration soon the water was boiling and the guide made a steaming pot of coffee which was passed around in tin cups with sugar and a little condensed milk they had brought along bread cheese chipped beef and boiled eggs and also a mince pie which mrs barrow had baked the day before and these made what tom declared was a famous dinner  no sauce like hunger sauce laughed john barrow as he saw the lads stow the food away once i was trampin the mountains all day without a mouthful when i chanced to look in a corner o my game bag and found a slice o bread at least two weeks old i ate that bread up hard as it was and nuthin ever tasted sweeter  youre right returned dick the folks in the city who dont know what to get to tickle their appetite ought to go hungry a few times then im sure theyd appreciate what they got  the midday meal finished they lost no time in repacking the sled load and starting up the river once more the stream was now wider than before and presently spread out into a small lake  this is known as tillards pond said john barrow feller named gus tillard built his cabin over yonder about ten years ago he went out barhuntin one day and mr bar came along and chewed him up  gracious then there must be pretty ugly customers in this vicinity exclaimed sam with a shiver  not so many as there used to be after tillards death the boys over to the run organized a bar hunt and we brought in six o the critters reckon thet scart the othersleaswise no bars showed up fer a long while after  out on tillards pond a stiff breeze was blowing and consequently their progress was not as rapid as it had been nor were any of them as warm as formerly  were going to have a cold first night i can tell you that said dick and his prediction proved true by the time the sun sank to rest behind the mountain in the west it was snapping cold as tom expressed it the wind increased until to go forward was almost impossible  i know a pretty good place to rest in said the guide it isnt over quarter of a mile from here if we can make that well be all right till mornin  john barrow led the way pulling one of the sleds and the boys followed poor sam was getting winded and skated only with the greatest of difficulty  it was dark when they reached the location the guide had in minda rocky wall on one side of the river at one point there was a split in the rocks this was overgrown at the top with cedars and brushwood forming something of a cave ten or twelve feet wide and twice as deep the bottom of which was of rock and fairly smooth  i camped here two winters ago said john barrow as he called a halt i laced up the cedars above and they formed a fustrate roof  i guess they are pretty well laced still observed dick they seem to hold the snow very well but we wont dare to make a fire in there  well build a fire in front in this hollow dick that will throw a good deal of hot air into the place and if we wrap ourselves in our blankets well be warm enough  everyone in the party was anxious to get out of the nipping wind and they lost no time in entering the cave as sam called it the entrance was low and by placing the two sleds in an upright position on either side they left an opening not over a yard wide directly in front of this the boys started a roaring fire cutting down several dwarf cedars for that purpose  i dont much like the looks o the sky tonight observed john barrow after preparing one of the turkeys for cooking  do you think there is a storm coming asked tom  looks to me like snow an plenty of it  i hope it doesnt come until we reach bear pond said dick i dont want dan baxter and his crowd to get ahead of us  they wont have no better time o it than well have was the guides grim comment aint no fun trampin over the mountains with the snow comin down heavily i can tell you that  the wind continued to increase and after the supper was cooked and brought into the shelter the guide took it upon himself to bank the fire with great care that it might not blow into the forest and start a big conflagration  weve had some terrible fires here he said one threatened my barn two years ago and we had to stay out two days an a night afightin it it would be a bad thing a night like this  to keep out the cold dick crawled to the top of the opening and bound in the cedar limbs closer than ever he also got some brushwood and some vines and on these placed a thick layer of snow  thats fine cried sam from below its almost as tight as the roof of a cabin  tightening the roof made a big difference inside and when they had hung up a blanket behind the upright sleds and placed some cedar brush on the floor it was very cozy they had brought along some candles and one of these was lit and placed in a lantern which was in one of the packs it was not a bright light but it was better than sitting in the dark and it seemed to make the shelter warmer than ever     chapter xvi  on the wrong trail   one of the turkeys was finished even to the neck piece and then both tom and sam declared that they were so sleepy they could scarcely keep their eyes open  it must be the mountain air said dick im sleepy too let us turn in  will anybody have to stand watch asked sam  at this john barrow shook his head dont know as its necessary he said reckon were safe enough ill keep my gun handy in case any animal prowls around  the boys laid down and were soon in the land of dreams tom and sam slept near the back wall with dick next and the guide near the opening which however was now completely closed by the blanket the fire was allowed to die down for they did not dare to build it up with such a wind blowing  nothing came to disturb them once during the night dick roused up and heard the distant howling of a wolf but the beast did not venture close to the shelter and while waiting for its appearance the youth dropped asleep again  by midnight the wind fell a little and then it began to snow and it was still snowing when john barrow leaped up pushed the blanket aside and gazed out upon the river  hullo were in for it now he cried and as the boys sat up he added snowinmighty hard too  i should say it was snowing hard cried tom as he too looked out why you cant see the trees on the other side and they arent more than a hundred and fifty feet off  this will make traveling bad said dick soberly it almost looks as if we were going to be snowed in  snowed in echoed sam oh dont say that  the boys were somewhat stiff after their long skate of the day before and it took them some minutes to pull themselves together then the curtain was pushed aside and the fire started up with some dry brushwood from the pile on which they had slept soon breakfast was ready and this warmed them up and put new life in them  no use to linger here announced the guide it wont git no better an it may git a heap sight worse i reckon the wind kept some o the spots on the river clear i know a good camping spot ten miles from here and that will be just the place for us while you are huntin around fer that money  then let us make that camping spot by all means said tom we mustnt let baxter get first whack at the treasure  it was eight oclock when they started once more on their journey the air was dull and heavy and the snow came down in thick flakes which presently shut out the landscape on all sides fortunately the wind had died down entirely so it was not near so cold as it had been  it would be easy enough if we could stick to the river all the way remarked tom to sam as they skated along as best they could  cant we  mr barrow says not about two miles from here are another falls and a set of rocky rapids and well have to walk around for a distance of nearly a mile through the woods  what tom said was true and the falls were reached less than an hour later the river was very narrow at this point and lined on both sides with rough rocks climbing was difficult and after crawling along for a few rods the boys halted in dismay  were up against it now groaned dick  dont be discouraged lads came from the guide it isnt so bad a short distance further on follow me and he started again and there was nothing to do but to fall in behind him  john barrow and dick carried one sled and tom and sam the other in some places the cedars and brush were so thick that those in advance pushed through only with extreme difficulty  well we havent got the task of breaking the way said tom as he and sam stopped to get their wind its no fool job to break through this thicket  we are going up a hill returned sam we must be getting away from the river  the guide and dick had disappeared ahead and fearful of losing them the younger rovers set off once more carrying the heavy sled up the hill was however a great task especially for sam and once at the top they had to rest again  i believe it would have been just as easy to have kept to the river declared tom see there it is to our left  it certainly doesnt look very rough down there was his brothers comment gracious but dick and mr barrow plow along like steam engines he added i cant go so fast  we wont hurry there is no need the trail is plain enough said tom and so they rested fully quarter of an hour then they heard dick calling to them from a long distance ahead  all right were coming tom called back just please dont go so awfully fast  we are going to take the trail to the left dick shouted back but the others did not catch the words  tom and sam advanced now slower than ever and when they reached a spot where there was an opening to the right and another to the left the others were not only out of sight but out of hearing as well it had now begun to snow more thickly than ever  which way did they take questioned sam in perplexity  reckon they went this way sam  it looks to me as if they went the other way here are some footprints  here are some footprints too  they came to a standstill more perplexed than ever sure enough there were two sets of footprints running almost at right angles to each other  i guess weve hit somebody elses trail said sam dick mr barrow where are you he called out  no answer came back and then the two boys shouted in chorus all remained as silent as before  well this is a mess to say the least was toms comment how are we to know which trail to follow  i move we make a sure thing of it and get down to the river again was sams answer then well be certain to be on the right track as soon as they reach the river theyll wait for us  this seemed sensible advice and leaving both trails the boys plunged through the cedar brakes to where they had seen the icy surface of the stream they had to make several turns and once tom lost his footing and rolled over and over in the snow but at last they gained the smooth ice and then each breathed a long sigh of relief  its ten times better than climbing around observed sam the rapids and rocks amount to next to nothing i dont see why mr barrow gave us all that extra climbing  perhaps the river has changed since he was up here last said tom anyway its a good bit narrower here than it was further back  sliding down the hillside had loosened the load on the sled and they had to spend a good five minutes in fastening it and mending a strap that had broken then several minutes more were consumed in putting on their skates  my how it does snow came from tom as they started at last i cant see fifty feet ahead  nor i tom i really wish we were with dick and mr barrow  so do i but i guess its all right  forward they pushed dragging the sled after them it was rough work and the ice was often covered too deep with snow to make skating a pleasure  it seems to me the river is getting narrower than ever said sam its queer too for mr barrow said it was quite broad near the lake  he said one of the branches was broad sam we must be on a different branch  let us call to them again  once more they cried out at the top of their lungs but nothing answered them not even a muffled echo all was swallowed up in the loneliness of the situation and in the fast falling snow which now covered even the load on the sled to the depth of an inch or more  come on said sam half desperately we must catch up to them sooner or later  perhaps we are ahead of them  it isnt likely let us go on anyway  and on they went another quarter of a mile the stream was now broader and this raised their hopes considerably but suddenly tom gave a cry of dismay  look sam we have reached the end of the stream  sam strained his eyes and went on a few feet further then he gave a groan his brother was right the stream had come to an end in a pond probably a hundred feet in diameter they had not been following the perch river at all but merely a brook flowing into that stream     chapter xvii  an unexpected discovery   tom we have missed it  it looks like it sam  what we took for the river wasnt the river at all we must be a mile or two out of the way  there is nothing to do but to go back was the dismal response  dont you think we might strike the river without going back  we might and then again we might not i hardly feel like taking the riskin this blinding snow  with heavy hearts the brothers turned the sled around and proceeded on the back trail if such the way may be called as a matter of fact the snow had covered their footprints completely  the wind was now rising again and it blew directly into their faces alarmed more than ever on this account they pushed on until poor sam was almost winded  ii cant go on so fast no use in trying he panted i feel ready to drop  im fagged out myself responded tom but sam we cant afford to rest here  i know that but ive got to get my wind back somehow the wind seems to be awfully strong  they rested for several minutes and then pushed on again tom dragging the sled alone it was a bitter journey and both would have given a good deal to have been with dick and the guide once more  we missed it when we didnt keep up with them in the first place was toms comment however theres no use in crying over spilt milk as the saying goes we must make the best of it  there isnt any best grumbled sam its all worst and then tom laughed in spite of the seriousness of the situation  at last they gained the spot where they had first struck the brook and here they halted again  the worst of it is there is no telling how far this brook runs before it empties into the perch river observed tom we may have to go two or three miles out of our way  we may as well climb up the hill again tom and try to follow one of those trails  perhaps you are right  they talked the matter over and at last began to climb the hill now more difficult than before since the snow was several inches deeper it took a long while to gain the top and still longer to find the spot where they had left the trail  here we are said tom resting on a fallen tree which marked the locality now the allimportant question is which way next  tom i believe we are getting lost came from sam in a dismal tone  i dont think were getting lost sam we are lost no two ways about it weve got to keep our eyes open and our wits about us or well be getting into a firstclass mess  it must be almost noon went on the youngest rover and pulled out his watch phew halfpast twelve  thought i was hungry is there anything in this load good to eat  i dont know let us look and see we cant go on hungry  they unstrapped the load and examined it there were blankets there and some camp utensils and a box containing crackers cheese and chipped beef  crackers and cheese will do on a pinch said tom come we mustnt lose more time than is necessary  yet eating and resting was very pleasant and they spent the best part of half an hour under the sheltering limbs of a big cedar tree both were dry but eating snow did not seem to quench their thirst the wind increased as they ate but the snow now came down more lightly  they decided to strike out on something of a trail running to the northwest it was hard work hauling and carrying the sled over the rocks and through the bushes and they often had to halt for breath  there goes something cried tom presently sam did you see it  i saw something but it disappeared before i could make out what it was  the object had crossed their path a hundred feet ahead of them now it reappeared somewhat closer and both boys saw that it was a lean and hungrylooking wolf  a wolf cried sam  wonder if i hadnt better shoot him said tom unslinging his gun  better save your powder tom i dont believe hell attack usat least not while it is light  a shot might bring an answering signal from dick went on tom suddenly what fools we have been not to think of that before  the wolf kept hidden and tom did not shoot expecting to see the beast reappear at any instant on they went keeping an eye on the bushes and trees on both sides of them once they heard the patter of the wolfs feet on a stretch of bare rocks but that was all  ill fire a shot anyway said tom at last and aimed in the direction where they had heard the sounds last to his intense surprise a yelp and a snarl followed  great caesar i hit him after all began tom and then leaped back look out sam hes coming for us  tom was right the wolf wounded in the left flank had suddenly appeared his eyes blazed with pain and fury and he made as if to spring upon the boys  tom was in front of the sled and sam behind it with a quick leap tom cleared the load and took up a position beside the youngest rover  the wolf made the leap but stopped short on the top of the load as he prepared to spring again tom swung his gun around by the barrel and hit the wolf a smart rap on the head the animal rolled over on the ground  shoot him sam  i will if i can came from sam who had now unslung his gun taking a quick aim he fired  the shot proved a good one for it took the wolf directly in the neck just as he was scrambling to rise again he gave a yelp and then began to turn over and over in his intense pain of a sudden he leaped up and landed on toms shoulder  for the instant poor tom thought his last moment had come but as the beast landed sam struck it with his gun and down it went once more snarling viciously then it rolled and tossed until some brush was gained when it managed to hide itself and crawl away seriously if not mortally wounded  hes gone came from sam  well dont go after him panted tom let him go and welcome i never want to see him again  nor i  both reloaded with all hastehaving learned years before that it is foolish to remain in the wilds with an empty firearm then they waited to see if the wolf would return  hark cried sam did you hear that shot tom  i did i think it came from that direction and tom pointed with his hand  i think so myself it must be dick or mr barrow firing  more than likely let us follow up the shot  they listened but no more shots followed and then they went on over a stretch which was comparatively smooth and free from brushwood but though they covered a quarter of a mile they saw nothing either of the river or of their lost companions  were getting lost more than ever groaned sam i declare i havent the least idea where we are  im going to fire another shot answered his brother and proceeded to do so  both listened with strained ears and soon an answering shot came back slightly to the left of the path they had been pursuing  thank fortune we are getting closer cried sam come on  as worn out as they were they resumed the dragging of the sled through the snow once sam had suggested they abandon the load but tom would not hear of this for he knew they could not very well do without this portion of the outfit  the wind was blowing heavily and high overhead they heard the treetops creak ominously once in a while a tree branch would unload itself sending down a great mass of snow on their heads but they pushed on determined to rest no more until the others of the party should be sighted  presently they came to a clearing overlooking a small pond and a stream beyond at first tom imagined that this was the pond they had left but a short while before but a second look showed him that the locality was an entirely new one to them  my gracious tom get out of sight came in an excited whisper from sam and he pulled his brother down behind a clump of bushes and then dragged the sled after him  what do you see demanded tom  look across the pond as sure as you are born there are dan baxter and jasper grinder weve been following them instead of dick and mr barrow     chapter xviii  in the camp of the enemy   what sam said was true there gathered around a fire on the opposite side of the pond were dan baxter jasper grinder and a tall powerfully built fellow whom they easily guessed was bill harney the guide they had two sleds with them and one of these had been unloaded and the camping outfit lay scattered around  well this is a surprise and no mistake was toms comment in a low voice if i know anything about it they must have done some quick traveling  i believe they followed the river at least part of the way returned the youngest rover i see a pair of skates lying by one of the sleds  do you suppose dick and mr barrow met them  i dont believe they did see they have some rabbits they are going to cook that accounts for the shots we heard  crouching down behind the bushes the two rovers watched the other party with interest a lively conversation was going oh between dan baxter and the former teacher of putnam hall but they were too far off to catch anything of what was said  what do you propose doing next asked sam after a pause of several minutes its mighty cold here  we may as well retreat sam we dont want to expose ourselves do we  i dont suppose it would do any goodalthough im not afraid of baxter or grinder either  it isnt that if they know we have arrived here they will do all they can to locate that treasure first we want to keep dark and get ahead of them  but how shall we turn  well have to go back to where we found the two trails crossed and then try the other one i dont know of anything else to do  wouldnt dan baxter be surprised if he knew we were so close  well we wont let him know  why not demanded an unexpected voice from the rear  both boys started and turned around to find themselves confronted by lemuel husty the man dick had seen in company with baxter at cedarville  hullo who are you asked tom as quickly as he could recover from his surprise  if you want to know real bad youngster my name is lemuel husty  i dont know you  but i know youleaswise i know of you went on husty with a frown youre down on my friend baxter aint you  if we are we have a good reason to be came from sam  perhaps you have and then again perhaps you havent it aint no nice thing to be cotched spying though  we werent spying we came up quite by accident  you can tell that to the monkeys but you cant tell it to me growled lemuel husty then he raised his voice i say baxter i say you fellows come over here  the three around the campfire looked up in surprise and were even more surprised when husty waved his hand for them to come to him  whats wanted demanded dan baxter  ive found two of your very intimate friends spying on you answered husty  i guess we had better get out whispered sam to tom not liking the turn affairs had taken  im with you returned tom  no you dont cried husty and caught hold of the sled you just stay here until we talk this thing over  toms hands were on his gun and for the moment he felt like pointing the weapon at the man but then he concluded that this would do small good and the weapon remained where it was  in a minute dan baxter came running across the pond with jasper grinder and bill harney at his heels each of the advancing party carried some sort of firearms  tom and sam rover ejaculated baxter and it was easy to see that he was completely surprised how did you get here  walked and skated returned tom as coolly as he could  youve got a nerve to follow me and my party went on baxter with an ugly scowl  as i just said to this man baxter we havent been following you put in sam we struck your trail by accident we thought we were following  never mind about that sam interrupted tom quickly  who did you think you were following demanded dan baxter  its none of your business baxter we have as much right to be here as you have  humph dont you suppose i know why you came  more than likely you do and we know why you came  have you got another map demanded baxter in curiosity  its none of your affair what we have we stumbled upon you by accident and if you havent anything in particular to say to us well be going  you neednt leave so quickly where is dick  he isnt so very far off  you hired john barrow for a guide i heard put in bill harney  if we did we had a right to do it said sam  he dont know these parts as well as he might if you dont look out hell lose you in the mountains and youll never get home alive  let him lose them put in baxter quickly its what they deserve but come its cold over here lets move back to the fire and i want you two to come along he added to the rovers  we dont propose to come along replied tom  and i say you shall come tom rover we are four to two and you had better submit  yes make them come put in jasper grinder i want to have a talk with them and he glared wickedly first at tom and then at sam  it must be confessed that tom and sam felt in anything but an enviable position they knew dan baxter thoroughly and knew he would stop at nothing to accomplish his purpose  the best thing you can do is to leave us alone said tom steadily you have always got the worst of the bargain dan baxter and if you try any game on now youll miss it again  ill risk it tom rover come now and no more fooling if you behave yourself there wont be any trouble  there was then nothing to do but to follow for neither of the rovers wished to lose this portion of the outfit soon the whole party were gathered around the fire which husty heaped high with brushwood back of the fire was a high cliff topped with cedars which kept off the wind and made the situation a fairly comfortable one  now we had better come to an understanding said dan baxter as he warmed his hands we all know what we are out here for so there is no use in mincing matters  i understand all i want to know answered tom briefly  so do i put in sam  baxter shall settle with you and then ill settle growled jasper grinder i have not forgotten how i was treated at putnam hall because of you  it served you right that you were kicked out said sam without stopping to think twice  ha you dare to talk to me in this fashion roared the former teacher ill teach you a lesson just wait till i find a good switch  hold on grinder one at a time put in dan baxter ill settle with them first if you please  they deserve a thorough thrashing grumbled the irate man  now i want you to tell me the truth went on dan baxter addressing tom and sam where did you get a map of that treasure in the cave on that island  we havent said we had a map returned tom  but you must have a mapor something like it  whatever we have its none of your business dan baxter broke in sam  shut up you little imp dont you know you are in my power stormed baxter in a rage i can do as i please out here and these three men will help me  as he finished he caught sam by the collar and began to shake him  let my brother alone ejaculated tom let up i say  i wont tom rover hes got to learn that im the master here howled baxter  if you dont let go ill hit you went on tom and raised his right fist but ere he could deliver the blow bill harney rushed behind him caught him by the waist and threw him flat  thats right shouted dan baxter make them both prisoners ive got a big score to settle with them  and then all four fell upon sam and tom and a fierce struggle ensued the outcome of which was for some time hard to predict     chapter xix  dick and the wildcat   well its mighty funny tom and sam dont come up  it was dick who spoke he stood in the shelter of a number of walnut trees and close at hand was john barrow  the pair had missed the others ten minutes before and were now waiting impatiently for their reappearance  it cant be as how they missed the trail in this snow said john barrow soberly let us shout for em  they set up a shout and waited impatiently for an answer but none came and they called again  we had better go back for them said dick his face full of a troubled look i wouldnt have them get lost in this snowstorm for the world  it was decided to leave the sled where it was and soon they were hurrying along the back trail but the snow and wind were against them and they made slow progress  it will not be necessary to relate all the particulars of the next three hours in vain they looked for tom and sam not a trace of the missing lads could be discovered  this the worst yet groaned dick as he came to a halt all out of breath i thought all along that they were keeping close behind us  i told them to do so returned the guide  they had fired several shots but the reports had failed as we know to reach the ears of the missing rovers they were now at their wits end regarding what to do next  id give a hundred dollars rather than have this happen went on dick why theyll starve to death if they really get lost  oh aint you mistaken there dick they have the other sled remember and each o em has a gun for to bring down any game as is wanted  thats true and its one comfort but there is no telling when they reach civilization again why this forest is about as bad as some places in the far west  i believe you there lad well theyve got to make the best o it i reckon theyll strike out for the river and come up that to bear pond over the rocks an rapids an all  supper time found the pair on the river again four miles below bear pond it was decided that they should camp at that spot for the night  well build a big campfire and keep it agoing said dick perhaps they will see it  thats an idee returned john barrow and before doing anything else the campfire was started in an open spot along the river bank dick saw to it that it blazed up merrily and kept piling on all the dry brushwood he could find until the flames shot up fully twenty feet into the air making the surroundings as bright as day  for supper they cooked another of the wild turkeys but it must be confessed that dick had little appetite for eating john barrow noticed it and he did his best to cheer up the youth  dont worry too much lad he said take my word on it theyll turn up by morning sure youve said yourself theyve been through putty tryin times in africa and out west  on the way to the river john barrow had brought down several rabbits and some birds and these were hung up on the low branches of a nearby tree they proceeded to make themselves comfortable under this tree cutting down some cedar branches for a flooring and banking up some other branches and some snow to keep off the wind  i dont think ill go to sleep said dick im going to keep the fire piled high so that it will light up as its doing now  then ill turn in right away answered the guide its eight oclock you call me at two and that will be givin you a fair nap afore daybreak and so it was agreed  it did not take john barrow long to settle himself and soon he was snoring as peacefully as though lying in his bed at home sitting down close to the fire dick gave himself up to his thoughts  and what numerous thoughts they wereof home and of school of his brothers and of the baxters and their other enemies and of all that had happened since they had first started to go to putnam hall and then he thought of the lanings and of the stanhopes and lingered long over the mental picture of sweet dora and of what she had last said to him  shes just an allright girl he said to himself heaven bless her and keep her from any further trouble  when the fire showed signs of burning low he arose and piled on more brushwood there was hardly enough at hand to suit him and ax in hand he started back from the river to cut more  he was within fifteen feet of some dense bushes when of a sudden he came to a halt as he saw a pair of gleaming eyes glaring at him as soon as he noticed the eyes they disappeared  a wild animal he thought can it be a wolf  retracing his steps to the fire he caught up his gun and waited but the animal did not appear nor did dick hear any sound save the murmur of the wind through the snowclad trees  the youth wondered if he ought to awaken the guide but finally resolved to let john barrow sleep i ought to be able to take care of one wolf he reasoned ive taken care of worse than that in my time  gun in hand he advanced upon the bushes once more he expected to see a wolf slink away at any moment but no beast came to view and after walking completely around the growth he laid down the gun and went to work vigorously with the ax  bush after bush was brought down in rapid succession until in ten minutes dick calculated he had cut sufficient to last the campfire for the rest of the night then he lowered the ax and caught up a large bush to drag it close to the blaze  as he turned around he met a sight that for the instant chilled him to the backbone there between the blaze and the tree under which john barrow was sleeping crouched a wildcat a large fiercelooking creature with fireshot eyes and a stubby tail which was moving noiselessly from side by side as the creature prepared itself to make a leap  gracious hes going to attack mr barrow thought dick but even as this flashed over his mind the wildcat made a leap into the tree close to where hung the game the guide had brought down some hours before  thank goodness hes only after the meat thought dick and the chill he had experienced passed away then struck with a new idea he leaped for his gun  several twigs of the tree were in the way of getting a good aim and he had to circle around to the other side before he could get another good view of the wildcat in the meantime the beast had grabbed up the wild turkey that was left and clutching it tight in its mouth started to drop to the snowcovered ground  bang went the gun and the charge of heavy shot took the wildcat in the left flank making a bad but not a fatal wound the beast dropped the wild turkey and let out a fearful snarl of rage then it saw dick gave another snarl and leaped toward the youth  the gun was doublebarreled and once more dick let drive but he was not overly cool and the charge merely nipped the beast in its left front leg it continued to come on and as it did so dick commenced to retreat  hi whats up came from john barrow and throwing aside his blanket he leaped to his feet  a wildcat ejaculated dick quick shoot him  by gosh muttered the guide and blinking in the bright light of the fire he reached for his rifle which he had brought along in addition to his shotgun  by this time the wildcat was close to dick and now watching its opportunity it leaped upon the youth trying to bury its claws in dicks shoulder  hardly knowing what to do dick brought around the gun barrel and poked it into the open mouth of the wildcat with a gurgle of pain the beast fell back but quickly gathered itself for another leap  back shouted john barrow back and let me git a shot at the critter  dick was perfectly willing to retreat and started to do so but the wildcat was too quick for him and in a twinkle youth and beast were down on the ground together and the wildcat was trying to reach the boys throat with its cruel fangs     chapter xx  bear pond at last   it was indeed a moment of supreme peril and dick felt very much as if his last moment on earth had come he put out his hands mechanically and grabbed the wildcat by the throat but his grip was poor and the beast shook itself clear with ease  it was now that john barrow showed himself to be a master of quick resources to fire his rifle at the wildcat would have meant taking the risk of hitting dick and this the guide thought too perilous leaping to the fire he caught up a long burning brand and rushed at the beast with this  to have a part of the fire thrust directly into its eyes was more than the beast had bargained for and as soon as it felt the flame it gave a cry of alarm and fell back as it did this dick leaped to his feet and sprang several feet away  illustration dick and the wildcat rover boys and the mountains  john barrow was now free to shoot and hurling the firebrand at the wildcat he caught up his rifle and blazed away in short order the wildcat had turned to retreat but the guide was too quick for it and down went the beast with a shot through its head it gave a shudder or two and then stretched out dead  is hehe dead panted dick when he felt able to speak  reckon so responded john barrow but ill make sure and catching up a club he aimed a blow which crushed the animals skull  that was a narrow escape went on dick if you hadnt come to my aid im afraid he would have done me up and he shivered from head to foot  you want to be careful how you attack wildcats around here lad it aint likely theyll tech you if you dont tech them but if you do why look out thats all  do you think he would have sneaked off with the turkey i was thinking first he would attack you  reckon he was after the game and nuthin more dick he must have been powerful hungry or he wouldnt have come so close to us hes a putty big fellow went on the guide as he dragged the carcass closer to the firelight  the fire was burning low and dick lost no time in heaping on some of the newly cut brushwood and then he reloaded and the guide did the same  might have a mate around suggested john barrow we had better keep our eyes peeled or we may be surprised wonder what time it is  by consulting a watch they found it was just midnight after the excitement dick felt quite sleepy and inside of half an hour he followed the guides advice and laid down to restnot under the tree however but as close to the campfire as safety permitted  dick had requested john barrow to call him in three hours so that the guide might get a little more sleep but the youth was allowed to slumber until he aroused of his own accord just as day was breaking  hullo ive slept all night he exclaimed leaping up with something of a hurt look why didnt you call me  i thought as how you needed the rest was the answer from the guide  arent you sleepy  not very a sleep early in the night generally does me more good nor hours o it later on  you havent seen or heard anything of tom or sam  nary sight or sound lad its too bad but dont worry too much  they couldnt have seen the firelight returned dick with a sorry shake of his head it beats all where they went to doesnt it  ive been athinking that maybe they went on ahead dick  ahead that they somehow passed us  yes while we were lookin for em they may be up at bar pond now waitin for us  do you advise going up there  we might as well we can put up a post here with a message for emin case they do come this way  thats an idea and we can put up other posts too then if they strike our trail theyll be sure to go straight in following us and dicks face brightened a bit  john barrow was already preparing breakfast and he agreed with dick to leave some cooked meat in a cloth tied to the top of the pole the youth erected not far from the fire on the cloth they pinned a note telling of the direction to bear pond and asking tom and sam to follow and fire two shots a minute apart as a signal  it was a clear day and the sun shining over the mountain tops made the snow and ice glitter like pearls and diamonds there was no wind so the journey toward bear pond was far from unpleasant they moved slowly dragging the sled behind them and searching to the right and the left for some trace of the missing rovers  i dont believe they came up here said dick after half the distance to the pond had been covered i dont see the least trace of any human being although ive seen the footprints of several wild animals  the wind might have covered the tracks during the night was john barrows hopeful response  id rather lose the treasure even if it is worth thousands than have anything happen to sam and tom  just before noon they came to a point in the river where it divided into several branches  well stop here and put up another sign pole said the guide remember what i said all these streams run into the pond and into perch river now which one you want at tudder end i dont know  which is the largest branch  cant say exactly this one an the one yonder are about the same size and that one aint much smaller  well which do you suppose was the largest years ago  cant say that neither although that one yonder might have been by the looks o the banks  then let us start on that one and if that fails us we can then try the others  they skated to the stream in question and erected a pole in the middle of the ice upon which a second note was posted having gone to the trouble of chopping a hole for the pole john barrow suggested they might try their hand at fishing  might as well stay here a while he said if they are behind us they may catch up  dick was willing and soon a line was baited and let down into the hole it was in the water only a few seconds when the guide felt a bite and drew up a fine fish weighing at least half a pound  dick was anxious to try it and took the line from john barrows hands he was equally successful and in a short while they had seven fish to their credit weighing from a quarter to threequarters of a pound apiece  im going to tie a fish to the top of the pole said dick they may be hungry when they get here especially if they miss the pole at our last camping place  they wont want to eat raw fish lad  no and im going to put a few matches in a paper and tie it to the fish so they can cook it if they wish  dicks idea was followed out and once more they went on up a narrow stream which had many a turn among the cedar brakes and hemlocks which lined either side rocks were likewise numerous and the lad came to the conclusion that locating the treasure was going to be no easy task  its rather desolate he remarked i wonder what ever possessed that old goupert to come here  its not so desolate in the summer time dick but i reckon goupert was a mighty odd stick as it was  at last they rounded a turn in the stream and came in sight of bear pond a long and wide stretch of water located in the very midst of two tall mountains the pond was covered with thick ice and the snow lay upon it in long drifts and ridges the ice was blackish and almost as hard as flint  we may as well go into camp near the mouth of this stream said dick for from this spot well make our first hunt for the treasure  i hope with all my heart that you find it lad but if you dont dont be too disappointed  i want to find sam and tom first i shant hunt for the treasure until i know of them  thats right well go on a hunt this afternoon jest as soon as weve had some of these fish broiled for dinner  if there was one thing which john barrow could do to perfection it was to broil fish and the meal he set before dick half an hour later was so appetizing the lad could not help enjoy it in spite of his anxiety over his brothers prolonged absence the fish was as sweet as a nut and both lingered some time over the meal until all that had been broiled were gone  and now to find tom and sam said dick at last as he leaped up from the log upon which he had been sitting what shall we do with our things  here is a hole in the rocks answered the guide well hide them there and cover them with stones i dont think anything will disturb the things between now and nightfall  the stores were placed in the cache and carefully covered so that the wild animals might not get at them and then they saw to it that their firearms were ready for use a minute later they were off on the hunt for tom and sam     chapter xxi  a pair of prisoners   it is high time that we return to tom and sam and learn how the two rover boys were faring in their unequal contest with dan baxter and his followers  as we know it was baxter himself who attacked sam while big bill harney threw tom to the ground jasper grinder went to baxters assistance while lemuel husty ran to aid harney  let go of him cried sam and managed to hit baxter a glancing blow on the cheek  ill not let go yet answered baxter and bore the youngest rover to the earth over and over they rolled in the snow until grinder caught sam by the legs and held him still  thats right grinder hold him panted dan baxter dont let him get up  but sam was not yet subdued and getting one foot clear at last he kicked jasper grinder in the ear  oh oh my ear screamed the former teacher he has kicked my ear off you scamp take that and letting out with his foot he gave sam a vigorous kick on the side at the same time baxter struck the boy in the head with a stick he had been carrying and then sam suddenly lost consciousness  in the meantime tom was having a similar struggle with harney and husty but the boy though strong was no match for the two men and they soon pinned him to the ground and held him there as in a vise while he was nearly choked by the big guide who had clutched him by the throat  letlet gomythroat tom managed to gasp  will you keep quiet demanded harney  yesyes  all right mind you do and then the guide released his hold but continued to sit as he was astride of poor toms chest  have you got him came from dan baxter  yes returned the big guide  all right then hold him  i will  leaving sam to be watched by jasper grinder baxter ran over to one of the sleds and procured a long rope  now then tom rover get up he said sourly  tom was glad to arise  what are you going to do with me he questioned  youll see fast enough  going to try your old tricks of making me a prisoner i suppose  youre a prisoner already  thank you for nothing returned tom as coolly as he could  dont you get impudent tom rover if you try it on youll get more than you bargain for let me tell you that  you always were a firstclass bully baxter you like to tackle little boys or else somebody who is helpless  shut up i wont listen to you now roared baxter and grabbing toms hands he forced them back and bound them together then the ropes was passed around toms waist so that he could not move his hands to the front  by the time this work was accomplished sam was regaining consciousness he gave a moan of pain and then sat up in bewilderment  whowhats happened he stammered then he looked around oh i remember now  he was very unsteady when he got on his feet and it was tom who made the first move toward him  too bad sam they are a set of brutes  dont call me a brute rover growled jasper grinder neither you nor your brother have all you deserve  sam was bound with a rope and then both prisoners were told to walk over to the fire this they did and were left in charge of husty and jasper grinder while baxter went off a distance in company with big bill harney  well what do you want to do with em demanded harney when he and the bully were out of hearing of the others pears to me youve taken the law in yer own hands  im glad ive caught them returned dan baxter they may help us to find what i am after  think theyve got a better map nor yours  they may have  supposing that brother comes up with john barrow they may make it hot for us  thats what i want to ask you about harney isnt there some place around here where we might hide the prisoners a cave or something like that  the big guide scratched his chin thoughtfully  theres a tolerable place about quarter of a mile from herethe old bars hole we use ter call it  of course we dont want to run up against any bears said baxter with a show of nervousness  at this the big guide let out a rough laugh  aint got no use fer them critters eh  i have not  taint likely there are any bars around me an jim wister cleaned out the hole last springgot three on em no new bars will take that hole yet awhile  then we had better make tracks for it at oncebefore dick rover and the man who is with him get on our trail  they walked back to the campfire and calling jasper grinder and lemuel husty aside baxter explained the situation a talk lasting several minutes followed  now then you come with us said dan baxter to the rovers and see to it that you dont try to get away  where do you want us to go asked tom  we are going to try to find your brother was the bullys smooth reply  humph do you expect us to believe that  you can suit yourself tom rover but just the same youll come along  and if we refuse put in sam  ill hammer you into submission  by jinks but you always were a cheerful brute baxter cried sam  shut up and come along growled the bully  feeling it would be folly to resist the two rovers moved off with the party the big guide led the way and the others followed  you may as well earn your salt observed baxter here take hold and pull one of the sleds  he placed the rope in their hands and compelled them to haul the load which they did unwillingly enough  curious as it may seem none of the baxter party had given a thought to the sled which sam and tom had had with them and this had been left under the bushes at the spot where husty had discovered the rovers  at first tom and sam had thought to speak about the matter but they finally decided it would be better to run the risk of losing that portion of the outfit entirely than to place it in the hands of their enemy  the way was rough and it was only with the greatest of difficulty that they could drag the sleds along but less than half an hour brought them to the spot which bill harney had in minda grand and wild place where the mountain appeared to split in two for a distance of several hundred feet here there was a gorge fifty or sixty feet deep partly choked with small scrub cedars  theres the hole said harney advancing into the gorge and pointing with his hand  better go ahead and see if it is free of bears or other wild animals suggested dan baxter as he came to a halt  rifle in hand the guide went into the opening and made a thorough examination of the surroundings  aint been no bars nor nothin else here he declared you can come right in  the opening on one side of the gully was an irregular one and beyond this was a large cave having several chambers all was pitch dark in the inner chambers and they lit some brushwood to give them light then a regular fire was started which did much toward making the surroundings warmer and more cheerful  dan baxter and his friends were hungry and lost no time in preparing a meal tom and sam were led to one side of an inner chamber and the rope fastened to their hands was bound tightly to the protruding roots of a tree  now dont you attempt to escape said baxter if you dowell youll wish you hadnt thats all  and then he rejoined his companions in the outer chamber leaving poor tom and sam to their misery     chapter xxii  jasper grinder tries to make terms   well tom this looks as if we had put our foot into it was sams comment delivered in a whisper  dont despair sam said his brother cheerfully we have been in worse holes remember and always managed to escape with a whole skin  thats true but i dont see how we are going to get away now i suppose somebody will stand on guard all the time  perhaps dick and mr barrow will come to the rescue  if they can find the way the wind and snow will cover the trail pretty well  theres no use of crying over the affair if we can break away ill be for doing so  so will i  hi you stop your talking in there shouted dan baxter plotting to run away i reckon it wont do you any good if you try it somebody will get a dose of buckshot in the leg  you dont mean to say youre going to stop our talking said tom in indignation  thats just what i do mean to say now stopor go hungry  as the rovers did not wish to starve they relapsed into silence a meal was being prepared by the baxter party and the appetizing odors floated into the inner chamber where tom and sam sniffed them eagerly for the walk and the bracing air had given them an appetite  smells good dont it remarked dan baxter as he came in firebrand in hand and confronted tom  what the cave asked tom carelessly  no the grub  oh you are cooking something arent you  you know well enough that we are  well i cant stop you baxter so cook away  dont you want something to eat  to be sure we do put in sam nobody wants to go hungry  perhaps youll have to go hungry said dan baxter significantly  it would be just like you to starve us baxter burst out tom i know you are as mean as they make them  no compliments please i know my business tom rover and let me say i am in this game to win  i dont see what that has to do with our eating  you will see presently i know all about what brought you here  and we know what brought you here put in sam  i suppose you fellows have a map or something like it went on baxter after a pause during which he gazed curiously first at tom and then at the youngest rover  a map of what demanded tom  a map whereby to find that treasure  if we have a map well take good care to keep it to ourselves came from sam before he had taken time to think twice  ha then you have a map and now dan baxters eyes brightened where is it  i didnt say so  ill search you said the bully and at once proceeded to turn out one pocket after another of course the map being in dicks possession was not found  you got it hidden said baxter sourly tell we where it is or you shall have nothing to eat  will you give us a good meal if we do tell you demanded tom promptly  yes  honor bright  yes  well then dick has the only map we possess and tom grinned while sam had all he could do to keep from laughing outright  instantly dan baxters face grew dark and he drew back his hand as if to strike tom  youre a fresh one he burst out are you telling me the truth  i am he has the map and i reckon hell keep it now if its all the same to you well take that meal eh sam  im hungry enough  i shant give you a mouthful roared baxter you cant play any game on me  that shows what your promise is worth baxter returned tom i didnt expect much else though for i know you thoroughly still we told you nothing but the truth  with a face full of hatred dan baxter turned on his heel and left them presently they heard him sit down with the others and all began to eat the food that had been cooking  i must say we didnt gain much observed tom gloomily i suppose i ought to have humored him in order to get something but i despise him so i cant help pitching into him  i wouldnt humor himid starve first returned sam earnestly i am glad we werent carrying the map  so am i glad rather than give it to him i would have chewed it up and swallowed it  half an hour went by during which both boys said but little each being busy trying to concoct some scheme by which they might escape they heard the others talking in low voices but were unable to catch what was said  presently jasper grinder came in bringing with him a small portion of food and a kettle of water setting the things on a rock he untied one hand of each of the boys that they might eat and drink  this is a fine meal said tom sarcastically  it is more than you deserve replied the former teacher of putnam hall  you always were a hard one grinder  mr grinder if you please said the man pointedly  and if i dont please to call you mister  then you will get nothing more from me  do you know that you are playing a high game here keeping us prisoners asked sam  what we are doing is our business jasper grinder paused for a moment i want you to tell me something of that treasure for which you are seeking he went on  what do you want to know asked tom  what is the treasure worth  we cant tell that until it is found  you are quite sure it has never been removed  how can we be sure when we dont know anything about it  baxter says your brother dick has a map  hasnt baxter a map too questioned sam  something of a map yes but it is not very complete  im glad to hear that said tom quickly  but baxter claims the treasure for himself  really said sam sarcastically well let him claim what he pleases if we find it it will belong to usdont forget that  again there was a pause jasper grinder looked anxiously toward the outer cave to see if baxter or the guide were watching him but the two were talking earnestly between themselves  i have a plan began the former teacher of putnam hall in a low voice a plan to aid you  what plan demanded tom  hush not so loudor they may hear you i presume you know what sort of a fellow baxter is  well rather said sam dryly  he is planning to do you a great deal of harm now i think i can save you  then save us said tom or untie us and we will save ourselves  you cant save yourselves baxter is strong and that guide is a giant in strength  what do you propose  im coming to that but you must make me a promise first  what promise  that half that treasure shall be mine when it is found  half cried tom and sam together  yes  we cant promise that went on tom  you dont want much was sams comment  isnt it worth something to be saved from baxters clutches i overheard him tell the guide what troubles he had had with you in the past and how you had been the means of sending his father to prison and all that why he would put you out of the way forever if he could  and will you stand by jasper grinder and see that done asked tom  no no butbuthe is his own master promise what i wish and i will help you  we cant promise you half the treasure said tom flatly but if you will really help us well promise that you shall lose nothing by the transaction  at this instant dan baxter leaped to his feet and ran for his gun while bill harney and lemuel husty did the same  come out here grinder shouted the bully somebody or some wild animal is around     chapter xxiii  the black bear   somebody is coming ejaculated sam i hope it is dick with mr barrow  so do i returned tom  without saying a word more jasper grinder ran from the inner cave and joined baxter and the guide his face was pale and he was evidently much disturbed  soon baxter and his party were outside and the rover boys heard them moving up and down the gully several minutes passed and then came a gunshot followed by another  i hope they are not firing on dick or mr barrow said sam with something of a shudder  i guess not returned his brother if they were wed probably hear shots in return  an hour went by and then dan baxter and the others came back the guide carrying several rabbits and a large fox the rabbits were skinned and kept for eating and the fox was skinned and the carcass thrown away  tom and sam had expected jasper grinder to return to them but if the former teacher desired to do this he was prevented by dan baxter who kept his companions close by him around the fire  slowly the time went by until darkness was upon them the fire was kept up but baxter screened it as much as possible so that the glare might not penetrate to the forest beyond the gully and prove a beacon to guide dick and john barrow to the spot  the boys were tired out and soon sam sank to sleep with his hands still tied to the tree roots tom tried to keep awake but half an hour later he too was in dreamland  when the rovers awoke it was not yet morning all was dark around them for the fire had burnt low sam roused up first with a severe pain in his wrists and ankles where his bonds were cutting him  oh my wrists he groaned and his voice caused tom to start  is that you sam  yes my wrists are almost cut in two  the same here ive slept like a rock too  is it morning yet  im sure i dont know  whats going on in there came from dan baxter as he leaped to his feet and caught up a gun  we are suffering from cuts of the ropes said tom it was an outrage to compel us to sleep in this fashion tied up like mummies  oh shut up growled baxter and then began to poke the fire soon it was blazing as readily as before and then the light found its way into the inner cave so that sam and tom could see each other once more  breakfast for the two prisoners was a slim affair of crackers rabbits bones and water tom asked for coffee but baxter would not give it to them  youll get no luxuries from me growled the bully be thankful that you arent being starved  while they were eating baxter and his companions held a low but animated conversation well try it anyway tom heard baxter say and that was all the rovers heard as soon as the meal was finished the party took up some of their traps and their firearms  now then we are going out for a while said dan baxter coming up to the prisoners take my advice and dont try to escape in the meantime if you do and we catch you it will go hard with you let me tell you that  are you going to leave us tied up questioned tom dubiously  certainly  some wild animal may come in here and chew us up  well leave the fire burningthat will keep em away returned the bully  he would say no more and in a few minutes he and his companions were gone and the rover boys were left to themselves  now what asked sam after all had been silent for at least ten minutes  dont ask me replied tom disconsolately were in a pickle and no mistake are your hands as tight as ever  yes and my wrists hurt so i feel like screaming with pain  baxter is a brute if ever there was one however i think i can get my left hand free went on tom suddenly  good tom do so by all means  tom worked away with vigor the pain was intense but he bore it manfully at last his hand was free  hurrah so far so good he cried lowly now for the other hand  but this was not so easy for the knots were hard ones and broke his finger nails dreadfully  if only i could get at them with my teeth he observed id soon chew them apart  but he could not bend around and so had to content himself with working away as before soon his fingers grew numb and he had to desist  too bad but i cant make it he groaned  wait a while and give your fingers a rest returned sam  he had begun work on his own fetters but try his best could make no material progress the ropes had cut through the skin in two places and from these spots the blood was flowing freely  two hours went by and to the boys it seemed an age tom had tried his best to free himself and now the cords were gradually loosening up  ive got it at last he cried presently just wait and a little later the bonds dropped to the ground but the work had caused his finger tips to bleed  with his hands free tom set to work free his feet and this was not so difficult although it also took time both boys were now hungry once more and reckoned that it was well past the noon hour  ill set you free and then well look around for something to eat said tom  hadnt we better get out as soon as we can asked his brother remember they may come back at any moment and we are no match for them  it will take but a minute to pick up something if its around sam besides we have got to have something in our stomachs before we set off to hunt up dick and mr barrow  as soon as sam was freed they ran to the outer cave here on some treeroots overhead hung a number of traps including a knapsack containing crackers and cheese and close by it was a portion of rabbit left over from the morning repast  just what we want cried tom now if we only had a gun  he broke off short as a crashing outside greeted their ears the noise continued several seconds then ceased abruptly  what do you suppose that was questioned sam it cant be our enemies returning  no i think it was some wild animalperhaps a wildcat  both looked around for some weapon with which to defend themselves and sam caught sight of a doublebarreled shotgun standing in a corner of the cave he ran for this and as he did so the crashing outside was continued  i see something under the brushwood whispered tom peeping out something big and black  its a bear cried sam a minute later a black bear and he is coming this way  both boys were astonished and bewildered for they had not been looking for such a big beast as this sam clutched the shotgun tightly while tom ran to the fire and picked up the biggest brand he could hold  the bear advanced to the center of the gully and looked up and down suspiciously then he sniffed the air  he smells the carcass of the fox that lies outside whispered tom  well he must smell us too tom its a wonder he doesnt run mr barrow said bears up here were generally shy  i reckon he is pretty hungry here he comes for the fox meat now  tom was right the bear was advancing with great care sniffing the snowcovered ground at every step once or twice he raised his head as if preparing to run at the first sign of alarm  id like to bring him down whispered sam  you cant do it with the shotgun sam be quiet we can be thankful if he takes the fox meat and leaves us alone  at last the bear reached the carcass the two boys expected he would snatch it up instantly and run away but they were mistaken the bear sniffed it from end to end and walked all around it  hes afraid of a trap or something like that whispered tom they are pretty cute  at last the bear seemed satisfied and he took the carcass up in his mouth and started to walk off with it but instead of turning up or down the gully he came closer to the cave  my gracious hes coming this way cried sam look out tom  his voice was so loud that the black bear heard it plainly the beast immediately dropped the fox meat and stood up on his hind legs then he gave a roar of disappointment thinking probably that the boys had set a bait to catch him  he dont like the situation began tom when he gave a yell and clutched his brother by the arm and small wonder for with rapid strides the black bear was making for them as though to chew them both up     chapter xxiv  together again   it must be confessed that both tom and sam were much alarmed by the forward move of the black bear up to this instant they had trusted the beast would depart with the foxs carcass without discovering them now it looked as if they were in for a hot fight and that without delay  get behind the fire cried tom as soon as he could collect his thoughts  sam had the shotgun pointed and as the bear advanced he pulled the trigger the charge of shot entered the bears left shoulder making a number of painful but not dangerous wounds at once the beast let out a snort of commingled pain and rage  youve done it now came from tom and whirled his firebrand to make it blaze up take a stick quick  instead of doing this however sam fired a second time this time hitting the bear in the left hind leg the beast dropped on all fours and came to a halt while yet twenty yards from them  by this time tom had another firebrand and this he compelled his brother to take the shotgun being now empty there was no time to reload the piece and indeed neither of the boys knew where to look for ammunition  more enraged than ever the bear now advanced again until only the fire was between him and his intended victims he had now forgotten about the fox meat and thought only of getting at the human being who had injured him he arose once more and let out a loud roar while his small eyes gleamed maliciously had the fire not been in the way he would have rushed upon sam without further hesitation  the pulling out of the two large firebrands was causing the fire to burn low something which was in the bears favor the boys almost expected to see the beast leap over the spot but bruin knew better than to attempt this he began to circle around the flames and as he did this the boys did likewise  shall we run panted sam he was so agitated he could scarcely speak  nostick to the fire returned tom bears hate that look out  the bear had now started to come around the other way at once the boys shifted again until they occupied the position where they had stood when the beast was first discovered then the bear dropped down once more and eyed them in a meditative way  he is making up his mind about the next move said tom ill try him with something new and at the risk of burning his hand he picked up some small brushwood which was blazing fiercely and threw it at their enemy  the effect was as surprising as it was gratifying the burning brands struck the beast fairly on the nose causing him to leap back in terror then he uttered a grunt of dissatisfaction turned and sped with clumsy swiftness up the gully and into the forest beyond  he is retreating cried sam joyfully  waitdont be too sure returned tom and firebrands still in hand they watched until the bear was out of sight and they could hear nothing more of him  my but aint i glad hes gone said the youngest rover with a sigh of relief  so am i glad sam i was almost afraid both of us were doomed to be chewed up  what shall we do next  i guess we had better get outas soon as youve reloaded the gun wonder where the ammunition is  both instituted a search and soon a box was brought to light containing not only ammunition but also a big hunting knife  ill appropriate the knife said tom its not as good as a gun or pistol but it is better than nothing  thus armed they set forth without further delay fearful that their enemies might return at any moment to recapture them as the bear had gone up the gully they went down and they did not come to a halt until they had placed at least quarter of a mile between themselves and the caves for some distance they kept on a series of bare rocks thus leaving no trail behind  i reckon we are clear of them for the time being observed tom as he came to a halt and that being so the next question is where are dick and mr barrow  the best we can do is to try to find perch river to my way of thinking came from sam if we can find that and we stick to it well be sure to land at bear pond sooner or later  it seems to me bear pond ought to be close at hand said tom weve seen the bear anyway if not the pond and at this both sam and he gave a short laugh  an hour later found them tramping along the edge of a cliff overlooking a broad valley in the center of which was a winding stream almost hidden by the woods on either side  now if we were only sure that was perch river wed be all right said sam but unfortunately all rivers look pretty much alike up here  we might as well go down to it anyway answered his brother its pretty cold up here  finding a break in the cliff they descended and started through the woods for the watercourse it was indeed cold and only their brisk walking kept them warm a stiff wind was rising and overhead the branches swayed mournfully  when they reached the river they came to another halt not knowing which was up and which was down  guess we had better chop a hole in the ice and see how the water is flowing suggested sam  let us walk in this direction said tom i think this is right and anyway we may soon come to an airhole which will save us the trouble of cutting an opening  as they advanced they had kept a sharp lookout for the baxter crowd but so far none of their enemies had put in an appearance  hurrah suddenly shouted tom heres a signal of some sort  he pointed ahead to where dick and john barrow had planted their first signal pole both made a rush forward and soon had the cooked meat which had been tied in a cloth and the note pinned on the outside  a letter from dick said tom and read it aloud we are on the right track sam and if we only continue to steer clear of dan baxter and his gang well be safe  dick asks us to fire two shots a minute apart as a signal came from sam ill do it at once and without delay he discharged the shotgun waited sixty seconds and then discharged it again  both listened intently and from a great distance came back two other shots also a minute apart  they heard the signal ejaculated sam joyfully it came from up the river didnt it  yes come on  without stopping to eat the food which had been left for them the boys hurried forward just as rapidly as their now tired legs would carry them  they had brought their skates along and these were put on after which progress was easier it was now growing dark and they began to wonder if they would be able to rejoin dick and mr barrow before nightfall  i hope we meet them said sam ive no fancy for remaining in this open alone  try another two shots suggested tom after an hour had gone by and sam did so immediately came answering reports directly to their left  hullo yelled tom at the top of his lungs and sam at once took up the cry  hullo came back faintly tom sam is that you  yes we are on the river  all right  the yelling now stopped and tom and sam came to a halt and sat down on a flat rock to wait ten minutes passed when they saw dick rush into a clearing followed by john barrow as soon as the eldest rover saw them he waved his hand enthusiastically  where in the world have you been came from dick as soon as he reached them and saw that neither was injured weve been looking high and low for you  weve been prisoners of the enemy answered tom by the way have you seen anything of dan baxter and his party  no do you mean to say baxter made you prisoners  he and his crowd did  how many are there with him  three men bill harney the guide lemuel husty and jasper grinder  jasper grinder burst out dick impossible  it is true dick i was as much astonished as you  i suppose baxter promised him a share of the treasure if it was found  more than likely but i dont believe theyll find the treasure  tom and sam soon told their story to which dick and john barrow listened with keen interest hardly however was the tale finished than the guide urged them to move on  its quite a few miles to camp he said and unless i am mistaken its getting ready for a big fall o snow  john barrow was right about the snow less than quarter of an hour later the thick flakes began to fall then came a finer snow which the wind blew around them like so much hard salt  we are in for a corker cried the guide the sooner we git back to our supplies the better it will be for us     chapter xxv  snowed in   with the coming of night the downfall of snow increased until it was impossible to see a dozen feet in any direction the wind also increased in fury until it blew a regular gale at first this was in their favor being directly on their backs and sending them over the ice at a furious pace but soon it shifted first to the left and then to in front of them and now further progress appeared out of the question  im afraid we cant make it gasped dick turning to catch his breath im almost winded now  ive got to stop came from sam im ready to drop  i cant see a thing said tom and im in mortal terror of skating into some big airhole  you are right lads well have to give up the idea of reaching camp tonight came from john barrow seriously but where to take you to out of this awful storm i scarcely know  any kind of shelter will do said sam we can rig up a hut under some big cedar tree  in that case let us stick as closely to the river as possible  why  we can get fish then if we need em  no more was said and the guide at once led the way to a thick clump of cedars growing but a rod away from the edge of the river the cedars formed something of a circle about fifteen feet in diameter and by clearing out some brushwood in the center they made quite a cozy resting place on the outside the cedars were laced together and the snow was banked up on all sides leaving but one opening two feet wide and several feet high for the purpose of supplying them with fresh air  by the time the shelter was ready for use all the boys were so fagged out they could scarcely stand dick and the guide had brought blankets with them and one of these was placed over the opening temporarily to keep out a large part of the wind then a candle was lit and john barrow burnt up a little brushwood jest to take the chill outer the place as he explained they did not dare to let the flames grow too high for fear of setting fire to the cedars themselves  as the boys lay on the brushwood resting they heard the wind outside increasing in violence and saw the cedars bend to and fro and listened to them creak dismally  mr barrow how long do you reckon this storm will last questioned tom  there is no tellin lad perhaps through the night an perhaps for a couple o days  if it lasts two days well be snowed in for keeps came from sam  the guide shrugged his shoulders true sam but weve got to take what comes  let us take account of our provisions said dick if there is any prospect of our being snowed in well have to eat sparingly or run the risk of being starved to death  there was not much to count up some meat and crackers dick and the guide had brought along and the meat crackers and the rabbit in tom and sams store in his pockets john barrow also carried some coffee sugar and some salt  not such a very small lot was dicks comment but it might be more  a scanty evening meal was quickly disposed of and then the candle was blown out and all retired to rest the boys were soon sound asleep and presently the guide followed but with his hand on his gun ready for any attack by man or beast should it come  the night passed quietly enough for presently the wind went down the snow grew thicker than ever until it covered the river to a depth of two feet and more around the cedars there was a huge drift burying the shelter completely  it was dick who roused up first to find all pitchdark around him bringing out a match he lit the candle and looked at his watch  seven oclock he murmured guess ill go out and see what the weather is  stretching himself he walked to the blanket which had been placed over the opening and tried to thrust it aside at once a mass of snow came tumbling down and sifted in all directions a good share on toms face  hi whos washing my face with snow cried tom as he opened his eyes and sat up thats a mean trick dick on a fellow who is dead tired out  i didnt mean to do it tom i was going outside to see how the weather is i reckon the snow is pretty deep  the talking aroused the guide and sam and soon all were on their feet the snow in the opening was pushed back and they forced their way outside to find themselves in a drift up to their waists  gosh but we are right in it was toms comment see the river is completely covered that settles skating  and the worst of it is it is still snowing came from dick  with no signs of letting up finished john barrow boys i am afraid we are snowed in or snowed up just as you feel like calling it  do you mean well have to remain here questioned sam quickly  for the present we are a good four miles from the pond and we cant tramp that in this storm  the wind was rising again with a dull moaning through the timber and sending the flakes whirling in all directions and they were glad enough to get back to the shelter of the cedars  well clear a space in the snow and start a fire said the guide a hot cup o coffee will do us all good  and we can cook that other rabbit tom and i brought along put in sam  brushwood was handy and tom helped to cut some of this with the hunting knife he had brought along soon a lively blaze was warming them up and water was boiling for the coffee while the rabbit was cleaned and broiled on a long fork in the guides outfit crackers were running low and they had but two apiece  ill try fishing as soon as im done said john barrow and was as good as his word  it was no easy task to cut a hole through the ice but once this was accomplished the fish were found to be lively enough despite the storm and the cold inside of an hour they had a mess of nine sufficient to last them for several meals and while the others were fishing dick caught sight of a flock of birds and brought down three  there we wont starve yet awhile said dick as he began to clean his game  thats true answered tom although we may get pretty tired of birds and fish before we get out of here and strike something different  i wonder how the baxter crowd is faring said sam unless they got back to the cave they cant be having a very good time of it  they dont deserve a good time of it grumbled tom they deserve to suffer  bill harney is a good enough guide to know what to do put in john barrow he will pull them through somehowthat is if he knows enough to remain sober  they had hoped that the storm would let up by noon but twelve oclock found the snow coming down as fast as ever blotting out the landscape on every hand outside of the moaning of the wind all was as silent as a tomb  there was but a little for the boys to do and after the fishing was over they were glad enough to take it easy in the shelter and listen to several stories john barrow had to tell the guide also related what he knew concerning goupert and the various hunts made for the missing treasure  he must have been a fierce sort of a man in his day observed dick i dont wonder the most of the folks in this region were content to leave him alone  it was almost nightfall when the snow stopped coming down and then it was too dark to attempt the journey to bear pond  well have to make another night of it here said john barrow then if its clear we can start for the pond early in the morning  hark cried tom rousing up did you hear that  hear what came from the others  i thought i heard somebody calling  all listened for a few seconds silence reigned then came an uncertain sound from a considerable distance  there it is  thats somebody calling sure said the guide must be down along the river ill go out an look  can i go along asked dick you may want helpif somebody is in trouble  all right bring your gun with you  in another minute they had started out each with his gun and with his trouser legs tied up with bits of cord to keep the deep snow from reaching up to their boottops their course was directly for the river  it was so dark they could see little or nothing saving the whiteness which spread in all directions  hullo hullo yelled john barrow when the river was gained  help came back faintly help  somebody over thar said the guide and pointed a short distance up the stream guess hes in a peck o trouble too  he started in the direction and dick came close behind the party in distress was a man whose cries for aid were gradually becoming weaker and weaker before they reached the individual his voice ceased entirely  he has fainted from exhaustion said john barrow as he reached the wayfarer  why its jasper grinder our old teacher ejaculated dick  the eldest rover was right the unfortunate man was indeed the former teacher of putnam hall but so pinched and haggard as to be scarcely recognized he had fallen on a bare rock and this had cut open his left cheek from which the blood was flowing     chapter xxvi  an unwelcome comrade   hes in a bad way thats certain was dicks comment as he surveyed the prostrate form even though jasper grinder was an enemy he could not help but feel sorry for the man  we must get him up to our shelter as soon as possible replied john barrow it is easy to see he is half frozenand maybe starved  shall we carry him  well have to there is no other way  slinging their guns across their backs they raised up the form of the unconscious man he was a dead weight and to carry him through that deep snow was no light task less than half the distance to the shelter was covered when dick called a halt  ill have to rest up he gasped he weighs a ton  but in a few minutes he resumed the journey and now they did not stop with their load until the shelter was reached tom and sam were watching for them  jasper grinder by all thats wonderful burst out tom  was he alone questioned sam  he was so far as we could see answered dick i can tell you hes almost a case for an undertaker  this remark made everyone feel sober and while the two younger rovers stirred up the fire dick and the guide did all in their power to bring the unconscious man to his senses some hot coffee was poured down his throat and his hands and back were vigorously rubbed  oh came faintly at last and jasper grinder slowly opened his eyes oh  take it easy mr grinder said dick kindly you are safe now  but the bear where is the bear murmured the dazed man  there is no bear here  he is after me he wants to chew me up  with this jasper grinder relapsed into unconsciousness once more  i reckon a bar chased him and he lost his reckonin was john barrows comment bring him up to the fire he wants warmin  yet with all the care they were able to bestow it was a good hour before jasper grinder was able to sit up and relate what had occurred to him he was very hungry and eagerly disposed of every scrap of food they had to offer him  i have been lost in the timber since yesterday he said oh it was awful the wind and the snow and the intense cold sometimes i could not feel my feet and i knew i was freezing to death and i hadnt a mouthful to eat  but where are the others questioned dick  i dont knowback to that cave i suppose we were out looking for some trace ofahemof tom and sam when i became separated from the others then in trying to find my way back to the cave i fell in with a big black bear the ugly creature came after me and i ran for my life through the brushwood and the snow until i came to a cliff i fell over this landed on an icy slope and rolled and rolled until i struck the river then i got up and tried to get back to the cave but it was out of the question i found an opening in the cliff on going back and remained there until morning when that bear or another like him roused me and caused me another roll down to the river  didnt the bear follow you asked tom  he followed as far as the river but i ran with all my might through the deep snow and presently he gave up the pursuit then i went on and on until i happened to catch a glimpse of your campfire and set up a cry for help i slipped on a rock and hit my cheek and the loss of blood and the shock made me dizzy the next i knew i was here  you may be thankful that we found you and brought you in was the remark made by john barrow if you had remained out there this night youd a been a corpse by mornin sure  i suppose thats true said jasper grinder with a thoughtful look his experience had humbled him greatly he was so exhausted that he soon fell asleep breathing heavily the boys and john barrow gazed at him curiously  his being with us presents a problem said dick what are we to do with him  im sure i dont want him along answered sam promptly he had hot forgotten the treatment received at putnam hall  none of us want him i take it sam but we cant leave him behind to starve and i doubt if he can find his way back to the baxter camp alone  no he cant do that put in the guide it is easy to see he knows nothing of the woods and mountains he was a fool to come here  if we take him along we ought to make him do his share of the work said tom but i dont like it hell be forever spying on us and if we find that treasure hell try to get it away mark my words  the only thing we can do is to watch him and not let him have any gun or pistol said dick he wont dare to leave us unarmed especially if we tell him of all the wild animals that are around  the subject was discussed for fully an hour but no satisfactory conclusion was reached and presently one after another dropped off to sleep the guide being the last to lie down after fixing the campfire for the night so that a share of the warmth might drift into the shelter  on the following day the sun came up bright and clear it was still bitterly cold and they were loath to leave the vicinity of the campfire but john barrow urged that they make good use of the clear weather and so they started up the river as soon as they had disposed of their breakfast of fish and birds  to be sure ill go along if i can walk was what jasper grinder said on being questioned i wouldnt remain behind alone for a fortune and i am sure i cant find the baxter party now please dont cast me off it wouldnt be human  i believe youd cast us off if we were in a similar situation was toms comment the way you treated sam at the hall shows that you dont care how some folks suffer but you can go along for we are not brutes but youve got to be careful how you behave or otherwise out you go to shift for yourself no matter how cold it is or how many wild animals are around  i will do nothing that does not meet with the approval of all of you answered the former teacher humbly and remember thomas i was willing to aid you when you were a prisoner in the cave in the gully  you werefor a big consideration returned tom dryly let me tell you flatly i dont take much stock in your socalled generosity  they were soon on the way straight down to the river and then up that stream john barrow was in the lead with sam following jasper came next and tom and dick brought up the rear as far as possible the guide sought out a trail along the timber where the snow was not so deep here and there were bare spots but at other places were deep drifts where they frequently got in up to their armpits  this is no joke gasped sam after floundering through an extra deep drift i thought i was going out of sight that time  i trust we havent much further to go was jasper grinders comment i would give a hundred dollars to be back at timber run  its your own fault you are here retorted sam  i might say the same of you returned the former teacher sharply  by noon john barrow calculated they had covered half the distance to bear pond a sheltered nook was found between some rocks and trees and here they set fire to a mass of brushwood that they might get warm while they rested and ate the last of the food on hand there was no wind and the sun shining as brightly as ever made the surface of the snow glitter like diamonds  i hope we find our stores at the cache undisturbed said dick while resting i am hungry for a change of diet as soon as we get there im going to make some biscuits and boil some beans  gosh but a plateful of beans would be fine cried tom i can tell you what he added reflectively you want to do without things to learn their real value  on they went once more this time slower than before because both sam and jasper grinder showed great signs of weariness they had to move around a long bend of the stream and for fear of getting into a deep drift the guide did not dare to make a short cut they passed the pole set up by john barrow and dick at the forks of the stream and then headed directly for where the cache was located  when we get settled we can put up a regular hut said john barrow then we can be as comfortable almost as at home  im anxious to locate the treasure said tom we cangracious me look there  they had come in sight of the cache and now beheld two great black bears standing over the loose stones doing their best to scratch them away and get at the partys stores     chapter xxvii  bringing down two bears   bears burst out sam and started back in alarm  bears shrieked jasper grinder and turned as pale as death oh somebody save me he wanted to run but he was in such a tremble he could not and sank on his knees in the snow in terror  crack it was the report of john barrows rifle and one of the bears was hit full in the left eye crack went the piece dick carried and the other bear was hit in the neck then tom fired the shotgun which had been found on jasper grinder and the bear dick had hit was wounded in the side  of course there followed a terrible uproar and in a twinkle both bears left the pile of rocks and came toward those who had wounded them the one that had been wounded in the eye was mortally hit however and staggered in a heap before he had gone ten paces  but the second bear was full of fight and his course was directly for tom before the lad could run the beast was almost on top of him  dodge him called out dick dodge him tom  shoot him somebody yelled back tom shoot him quick  and then he dodged behind some nearby brush but the bear was almost as quick and ran directly into the brushwood to face him on the opposite side  by this time john barrow had the rifle reloaded and now he skirted the brushwood followed by dick crack went the rifle again just as bruin was about to pounce upon tom but the bullet merely clipped the hair on the bears back and in a twinkle the beast was on tom and had the lad down  with his heart in his throat dick made a leap with the shotgun bang went the piece when he was not over three yards from the bear the charge entered the beasts ear and with a snort he rolled over and over in the snow sending it flying in every direction  freed of the bear tom lost no time in scrambling to his feet soon the struggles of the beast ceased and they knew he was either dying or dead to make sure john barrow stepped in hunting knife in hand and plunged the blade into his throat then the other bear was served in the same fashion  the fight had been of short duration yet the peril had been extreme and after it was over poor tom found he could scarcely stand dick led him to a rock and set him down asking him if he was hurt  i got a scratch on the arm but i reckon its not much was the faint answer but it was a close call wasnt it  those bears must have been awfully hungry or they wouldnt have put up such a fight said the guide their being at the cache proves they wanted food  well weve got the food now returned dick grimly well have all the bear steaks and roasts anybody wants  yes and i can tell you a juicy steak will just be boss put in sam enthusiastically  it was seen that tom was hurt more than he cared to admit and the others lost no time in building a big campfire that they might warm themselves while dick took off his brothers coat rolled up his shirtsleeves and bandaged an ugly scratch with a bit of linen  you can help here said john barrow to jasper grinder ill fix it as your duty to keep the fire agoin there is a hatchet and there is the brushwood dont let the fire go down or im afraid there wont be enough heat for cooking your supper and the guide smiled grimly  at this indirect threat jasper grinder scowled but he did not dare to complain and was soon at work cutting brushwood and dragging it to the spot  gosh but hes not used to hard work was sams whispered comment ill wager he doesnt like that for a cent  its time he was set to work doing something answered dick it will keep him from getting into mischief  as late as it was and although all were tired out from their long walk through the deep snow they found it necessary to construct some shelter for the night the guide located a number of cedars growing close together and this spot was cleaned out and made as comfortable as circumstances permitted the fire was shoved over to the new location and then john barrow cut up one of the bears and procured a big juicy steak for supper it is needless to say that all enjoyed the treat set before them even jasper grinder eating his full share  well hang the meat up on a tree said john barrow if we dont some hungry foxes or other wild animals will surely be after it and procuring the necessary ropes he flung them over some limbs and all hauled the carcasses up tom of course being excused from the task because of his wounded arm  the wind had gone down and when all retired within the shelter not a sound but the merry crackling of the fire broke the stillness around them in front of the camp was a long stretch of the pond now thickly covered with snow in the rear a slope of a mountain rockribbed and covered with cedars and hemlock to the left was located one of the branches of the river and a hundred yards distant was a second branch  at first john barrow had thought to set a guard for the night but as the spot seemed free from danger for the time being this was dispensed with and all went to bed to sleep soundly until sunrise  and now for the treasure hunt cried sam who was among the first to awaken its just a perfect day and we ought to accomplish a good deal if we set to work right after breakfast  he talked freely for jasper grinder was still asleepsnoring lustily in a corner of the shelter john barrow was already outside boiling coffee broiling another bear steak and preparing a pot of beans for cooking he had likewise set some bread for raising  goin to give you a breakfast as is a breakfast said the guide with a broad smile reckon all of you are ready for it eh  i am said dick phew but this mountain air does give one a tremendous appetite  while jasper grinder still slept dick brought forth the precious map and studied the description and also the translation of the french text into english which randolph rover had made for them  to find the box of silver and gold go to where bear pond empties into perch river he read well we are at this spot or at least at one of the spots it may mean this branch and it may mean one of several others  we can try one branch after another put in sam go on with the description  ten paces to the west is a large pine tree which was once struck by lightning continued dick he looked around i dont see any tree like that around here  you must remember my lad that that writin was put down years ago said john barrow moren likely if the tree was struck an blasted its fallen long ago and the spring freshets carried it down the river  thats true said sam with a falling look but anyway we ought to be able to locate the stump  yes we ought to be able to do that  im going to locate it now cried sam and stalked off to where the pond emptied into the stream from this spot he stalked ten paces westward and of a sudden disappeared from view  help he cried  hullo sams disappeared cried dick and ran toward the spot  look out sang out john barrow there may be a nasty hole there  nevertheless he too went forward and they soon beheld sam floundering in snow up to his neck he had stepped into a hollow between the rocks and it took him some time to extricate himself from the unpleasant position  oh my what a bath he exclaimed ruefully as he tried to get the snow from out of his collar and his coatsleeves ii didnt think of a pitfall like that  you want to be careful how you journey around here cautioned john barrow if that hollow had been twice as deep the snow might have smothered you to death  i will be careful answered sam i dont want any more snow down my back and up my coatsleeves and he hurried back to the campfire to warm himself  by this time tom was outside and he was followed by jasper grinder and presently all sat down close to the blaze to enjoy the generous breakfast the guide had provided tom said that his arm was a little stiff but that otherwise he felt as well as ever     chapter xxviii  two failures   what to do with jasper grinder was a problem which none of the boys knew how to solve they were exceedingly sorry that he was among them but as it would be impossible to send him off alone in that deep snow they felt that they would have to make the best of the situation  i move we make him stay around the camp suggested tom he can watch our stores keep the fire furnished with wood and do some of the cooking  he may kick at playing servant girl said sam  if he kicks let him clear out  i think tom is right put in dick we dont want him along while we are trying to locate the treasure  he may slip away with our thingsif he finds any trace of baxters party went on sam and we cant afford to lose anything more one sledload is enough well be wanting some of those other things before long  i dont believe that other party is around here said john barrow we had better leave the man at the fire we can keep our eyes open for the enemyas you call em  so it was arranged and dick told the former teacher jasper grinder said but little in return but asked about the possibility of any more wild beasts turning up  i dont want to be left alone to face another couple of bears he said they would do their best to chew me up  we will leave a gun in camp said dick if you see a bear coming you can climb a tree and keep him off with the gun if we hear a shot well come back just as quickly as we can but grinder i want you to understand that you arent to play us false went on the eldest rover if you do well have no mercy on you remember that  half an hour later the boys and their guide set off on their first hunt for the treasure with great care john barrow led the way over the rocks and other rough places he carried a long pole which he plunged in the snow before him whenever he was afraid there was a hollow ahead soon they gained the spot where dick thought the blasted tree might be located  the snow was scraped away first in one direction and then another until a spot several yards in diameter was cleared no treestump was brought to light although they found a slight hollow in which were several big roots  this might have been the tree once said john barrow meditatively years make great changes you know the trees fall rocks and dirt slide down hill and that makes a big difference in the looks o things  all we can do is to follow the directions on the map said dick i think well be bound to strike the right clew sooner or later let us follow this one and see where it leads to  whats the next directions questioned tom  go due southwest from the pine tree sixtytwo paces answered dick reading from the translation given him which is southwest mr barrow  soon tell ye that answered the guide and brought forth his pocket compass that way and he pointed with his arm  with the compass to guide them they set off the guide in the lead once more and dick counting off the sixtytwo paces with great care the way was up a hillside and over half a dozen rough rocks and then into a hollow where the snow was up to their waists  no use of talking this is treasurehunting under difficulties was sams comment perhaps we would have done better had we left the hunt till summer time  and let baxter get ahead of us put in tom not much he turned to dick whats the next directions on the paper  there ought to be a flat rock here backed up by a sharppointed one answered the eldest rover i dont see anything of a sharppointed rock do you the flat rock may be under us  no sharppointed rock within a hundred feet of here answered sam gazing around he began scraping away the snow dirt under us too  that settles it then trial no 1 is a failure mr barrow well have to try the next stream  so it would seem dick well you boys mustnt expect too easy work o it a big treasure aint picked up every day  the trouble of it is we dont know how much of a treasure it is said tom for all we know it may be but a few hundred dollarsnot enough to pay us really for our trouble  well even a few hundred dollars aint to be sneezed at  we did much better out west when we located our mining claim said dick but then we came up here for fun as much as for treasure  the tramp to where the next stream leading from bear pond was located was by no means easy they had to crawl around a tangled mass of brushwood and over more rough rocks until they gained the bosom of the pond itself then they skirted the shore for several hundred yards  hold on cried dick suddenly rabbits and up came his gun and he blazed away sam also fired and between them they brought down four rabbits which had just run out of a hollow log a short distance ahead  good shots cried the guide enthusiastically couldnt have been better i see you are used to hunting many a city chap would have missed em entirely i had one feller up here year before last wanted to bring down big game but when he saw a deer he got the shakes and didnt think of shootin till the game was out o sight  the four rabbits were plump and heavy and the boys shouldered them with much satisfaction then the onward course was resumed until dick again called a halt  here is where well make trial no 2 he said now see if any of you can locate the blasted tree in this neighborhood  all began to search around in various directions and presently sam let out a call  heres a fallen tree  struck by lightning queried dick  i dont know about that perhaps mr barrow can tell us  the others walked over and the guide cleared the snow from the upper end of the fallen timber  not much signs of being struck by anything but the wind he announced still i aint sure  well try from this point anyway said tom no use of missing any chance however small and on this the others agreed  once again they began to pace off the ground as before here the task was as difficult as ever as they had to pass through some timber thickly intergrown with brush  i suppose in gouperts time this timber was small observed the guide  the tramping around was beginning to tire them and soon sam had to stop to rest and get back his wind  i feel like a regular snowplow he gasped tell you what it takes the wind right out of a chap  you rest while we go ahead suggested tom but sam did not wish to do this  not much if the treasure is going to be found i want to be on deck he cried  presently they were at it again dick pacing off the steps as carefully as ever they had still fifteen paces to go when john barrow came to a stop with a sniff of disgust  wrong agin  how so  this is leadin us right out on the pond  i declare so it is murmured dick we started due southwest didnt we  to a hair lad to tell the truth i didnt take much to this trail from the start to my mind this stream is a new one i think the next outlet is one of the oldtimers  once more they held a consultation and tom asked how far it was to the next stream  right over yonder rise o ground answered the guide but hadnt you better wait till after dinner before ye tackle it  dick consulted his watch  i declare quarter to twelve he exclaimed no wonder im feeling hungry  i was getting hungry myself said tom but i wasnt going to be the first to stop what shall we dogo back to camp  yes said dick i dont like the idea of leaving jasper grinder there all day alone  nor i came from the other rovers  john barrow was asked to lead them back by the shortest route and they started quarter of an hour later after all had had a chance to rest and get back their wind  i hope we get a chance at some deer while we are up here remarked dick as they turned back  ill take you to where there are deer after this hunt is over replied john barrow i know a famous spot and its not far either  hark suddenly cried tom what sort of a yelping is that  all listened  wolves answered john barrow there must be quite a pack of em too  i suppose they get pretty hungry when there is such a deep snow said tom  they do moren likely some of em have scented our bar meat and they want some  if they are heading for camp theyll give jasper grinder trouble put in sam  he had scarcely spoken when they heard the report of a gun followed by a louder yelping than ever  theyve attacked him true enough cried john barrow  come on said dick the sooner we get back the better grinder may be having a pile of trouble and the wolves may tear all our things to pieces if they get the chance     chapter xxix  jasper grinder and the wolves   left to himself jasper grinder piled the wood on the campfire and then sat down to meditate on the turn affairs had taken  he was in a thoroughly sour frame of mind to his way of thinking everything had gone wrong and he wondered how matters would terminate  i was a fool to come out here in the first place he told himself i ought to have known that baxter had no sure thing of it if i hadnt fallen in with the rovers i would have frozen and starved to death and they dont want me thats plainly to be seen  had he felt able to do so he would have packed a knapsack with provisions and started oh his way down the river toward timber run but he did not know how far the settlement was away and he was afraid to trust himself alone in such a wilderness as confronted him on every hand he did not possess much money but he would have given every dollar to be safe back in the city again  he wondered if the rovers would gain possession of the treasure before the baxter party came up and also wondered what would happen should the two parties come together he had not been treated very well by dan baxter and so he hardly cared who came out on top in the struggle for the treasure  whoever gets it will try to count me out was the way he reasoned im at the bottom of the heap and likely to stay there for some time to come  the time dragged slowly and to occupy himself he began to cut more wood for the fire the task made him grit his teeth  got to work like a common woodchopper he muttered its a shame  he was just dragging the last of the wood up to the fire when a sudden yelping broke upon his ears looking up he saw a lone wolf standing at the edge of the timber gazing fixedly at him  a wolf he muttered and his face grew pale scat and he waved his hand threateningly  the wolf disappeared behind some brush but did not go far sitting down it let out the most dismal howls imaginable which soon brought a dozen or more other wolves to the scene then all of the pack came into view much to jasper grinders horror  they want to eat me up he groaned and ran for the nearest tree which was close to the shelter oh i must get away somehow  he clutched at the tree and began to climb with all possiblespeed his gun lay close at hand but in his haste he forgot to pick it up once in the tree he sat down on a limb a perfect picture of misery  seeing the man retreat the wolves at once became bolder and keeping a safe distance from the fire they drew up in a circle around the tree upon which jasper grinder rested and from which hung the bear meat at one point under the tree there was a spot covered with bears blood and this blood several of the wolves licked up in a manner to make the former teachers own blood run cold  if they get at me theyll chew me up i know they will he moaned oh why did i ever come out in this savage waste  sitting in a circle the wolves lifted their heads and howled dismally two came to the tree and scratched the bark as if to attempt climbing  go away go away shrieked jasper grinder scat go away  the wolves left the treetrunk but did not go away instead one after another began to leap up trying to reach the meat which hung so temptingly above them one or two prowled among the stores tearing this and that and picking up the scraps of the morning meal  in this fashion half an hour went by and it is safe to state that this was the longest and most trying half hour that jasper grinder experienced in his whole life he shouted at the wolves and threw bits of sticks at them but to this they paid no attention then he cried for help but the rovers and john barrow were too far off to hear him  if i only had the gun i could fire it as a signal he said to himself why did i not bring it up with me  he wondered if he could pull the gun up by means of a string he found in his pocket and resolved to try making a loop in one end of the string he lowered it with care until it rested close to the gun and then he did his best to slide the string along under the barrel this was comparatively easy for the barrel was tilted up against a rock  the wolves watched the maneuvering with interest and no sooner did the gun begin to shift than three leaped forward snarling angrily one snapped at the barrel of the piece one at the butt and a third at the trigger an instant later came the report heard by the rovers and john barrow  the shot was almost a deadly one not alone for two of the wolves but also for jasper grinder who was not expecting the gun to go off the piece was loaded with buckshot which tore through the sides of two of the beasts and then passed upward into the treebranches taking the former schoolteacher in the left shoulder  im shot gasped jasper grinder and almost fell from his perch but he managed to save himself and hung in a crotch weak and almost helpless the blood flowing freely and dripping to the ground where the wolves licked it up eagerly a few had retreated at the report of the gun but now all came back snarling and yelping more wildly than ever  it must be confessed that jasper grinders position was truly unfortunate the loss of blood was fast rendering him unconscious and he was in mortal terror of dropping down and being devoured  help he called feebly help for the love of heaven help me  just as his senses were leaving him he heard a distant cry and looking in that direction saw john barrow and dick approaching followed by tom and sam  the wolves have grinder treed cried the guide ill give em something to remember us by  he had a doublebarreled shotgun and he let drive twice in quick succession firing into two groups of the beasts and killing two and wounding several others then dick fired bringing down another tom and sam also discharged their pieces and added three others to the dead or dying  this slaughter was too much for the remaining wolves hungry as they were and in a twinkle they ran off into the timber howling dismally  they wont come back was john barrows comment they have learned to respect us and he was right the wolves bothered them no more  while the guide was busy finishing the beast which had been too much hurt to retreat the boys turned their attention to jasper grinder they saw he had fainted and noticed the blood dripping from his shoulder his body was slowly leaving the tree crotch where it had rested  hes coming catch him cried sam and as the unconscious man came down they did what they could to break his fall fortunately he landed in the deep snow so the fall proved of small consequence  hes shot thats whats the matter with him said dick after an examination who fired at him im certain none of us did  the question could not be answered bringing out a blanket they placed jasper grinder upon it close to the fire and john barrow made an examination of the wound picking out a couple of the loose buckshot  he was probably shot from his own gun said the guide more than likely he dropped the piece from the tree and it went off when it struck the ground  they bound up the wound carefully and did all they could for the sufferer then while dick watched over jasper grinder the others got rid of the wolves carcasses by dragging them into the timber and then set to work to prepare the midday meal  it was fully an hour before jasper grinder was able to speak and then he could say but little but he explained how it was that he had been shot he wanted to know if the wolves had been driven off and begged that they would not leave him alone again  well stay by you now you are down said dick sympathetically we are not brutes even though we havent any great love for you  thank you ill not forget your kindness returned jasper grinder and for once it must be admitted that he meant what he said  the wounded man could eat no solid food so they prepared for him some broth made from bears meat which was very strengthening after another examination john barrow was of the opinion that the wound was not a dangerous one but that the man would have to keep quiet for several days or a week  well have to take turns at watching him said dick its too bad but i see no other way out of it  they drew lots and it fell to sam to remain with the patient during the afternoon an hour later dick tom and the guide set off to look once more for the treasure  well im tired enough to stay here and rest said sam that walking this morning played me out completely  there was not much to do since jasper grinder had brought in sufficient wood to last for a day or two for an hour sam rested and watched the former teacher who had fallen into a doze then the youngest rover set to work to improve the shelter doing several things which the guide had suggested  the youth was hard at work patching up one side of the improvised hut when he heard a movement in the brushwood not far away fearing some wild animal he ran for his gun but ere he could reach the firearm a voice arrested him  stop sam rover stop  the voice was that of dan baxter and an instant later the bully came into view rifle in hand and followed by bill harney  what do you want here baxter demanded sam as coolly as he could although the situation by no means pleased him  are you alone  no  who is with you  what business is that of yours  im making it my business  i reckon hes alone right enough put in bill harney i dont see anybody else around  the big guide rushed forward and knocking down sams gun placed his foot upon it  give me my gun  not so fast my bantam cried the guide baxter reckon ye had better look into the shack and see whats there  the bully did as requested on seeing jasper grinder he started back  grinder  who calls asked the wounded man and opened his eyes so it is you dan baxter what do you want  what did you desert us for grinder  i didnt desert you i got lost and they found me half starved and frozen now i am wounded are you in possession of this camp where are the rovers  sam is here i dont know anything about the others have they found that treasure yet  no they went off to look for it jasper grinder tried to go on but fell back exhausted and could say no more  heres a queer go muttered the former bully of putnam hall i suppose they shot grinder if they did they ought to suffer for it i guesshullo whats up out there  a scuffle outside of the shelter had reached his ears bill harney had been standing close to some firewood and without warning sam had rushed at the big guide and sent him sprawling backward  hi stop him yelled the guide as he started to struggle to his feet but before he could get up sam had taken time by the forelock and disappeared into the timber skirting the pond     chapter xxx  a successful searchconclusion   when sam escaped from big bill harney he had but one purpose in view and that was to reach dick and the others just as soon as possible and acquaint them with the turn affairs had taken  he had a fairly good idea of the direction the others had taken and knew that their tracks in the snow would be plain to follow the main thing at the start was to keep out of sight of the enemy  in doing this he had not only to avoid harney and baxter but also husty providing that individual was anywhere around which was probable consequently although he traveled as fast as the deep snow permitted he kept a sharp lookout on every side  the youth soon circled the lower shore of bear pond and he found the trail he was seeking it led directly to the westward and he followed it up almost on a run  in the meantime dick tom and john barrow had journeyed to the third outlet of the lake the stream which the guide thought must be the original of perch river here after a good deal of trouble the party located what looked like the stump of a tree once struck by lightning  weve found it at last cried dick i feel it in my bones that we are on the right track  again they measured off the distance with care and now came to a large flat rock behind which was another unusually sharp  the flat rock muttered tom and his heart began to thump wildly dick youre right we are on the right track if the treasure isnt here its been taken away  they had brought along a pick and a crowbar and now all set to work to clear away the snow and then the dirt from around the pointed rock the ground was hard and at first they made but slow progress  perhaps well have to build a fire to thaw out the ground suggested john barrow  oh that will take too long said tom i wonder if we cant turn the rock over  with the crowbar and the pick wedged against the flat rock they pushed upon the pointed rock with all the force at their command several times the tools slipped but at last they held and slowly the pointed rock went up until with a thud it rolled over and several feet away  hurrah a hole full of small stones cried dick and leaped down to pick the stones out tom followed and so did the guide  dick tom hullo hullo came the unexpected cry from a short distance away  who is that calling demanded dick  its sam replied the guide looking up hes coming here as fast as he can track it  then something is wrong said dick and for the moment the treasure was forgotten  it did not take sam long to reach them he was so out of breath that for several minutes he was unable to talk connectedly at last he gasped out  dan baxter and that big guidethey attacked me and i ran away theythey are in possession of our traps  baxter ejaculated dick thats the worst yet theyll steal all our things and leave us to starve  we might as well go right after them put in john barrow  oh say lets unearth this treasure first pleaded tom if we leave that baxter may follow up our tracks as sam did and take it from under our very noses  tom is rightget the treasure first said dick  once more they set to work sam watching them while trying to get back his breath and strength soon the last of the loose stones were removed from the hole and they came upon a thin metallic slab having in the center a small ring they pulled the slab up and disclosed a small square opening in the middle of which rested a metallic box about a foot and a half square and a foot in depth the box was so heavy they could scarcely budge it  the treasure at last came from all of the boys  putty heavy no mistake about that was john barrows comment if its silver its wuth considerable  we must get it out somehow said dick who was as excited as anyone lets get the crowbar under it  this suggestion was carried out and after a good deal of trouble the box was brought up out of the hole beneath it lay an iron key which fitted the rusty lock of the treasure casket soon they had the box open and all gazed intently inside  gold and silver shouted tom see the gold is on top and looks as if it had been put in some time after the silver wonder what the stuff is worth  some thousand dollars thats sure said dick  now that the treasure was found the boys scarcely knew what to do with it then the guide came forward with a suggestion  well hide it in the snow for the present then the baxter crowd wont know where it is the empty hole will throw em off the scent  a nearby place was readily found and into this the box was placed and the snow was thrown loosely over it this accomplished they started back for the camp with all possible speed  it was a long tramp and although he did his best sam lagged behind  you go on dont mind me said the youngest rover only keep them from running off with our goods  it was a good half hour before the camp was reached when they came in sight of the spot it looked deserted  we may as well go slow cautioned john barrow there may be some sort of a trap set for us  they advanced with their guns ready for use but nobody appeared and presently they stood close to the campfire then dick ran into the shelter to find jasper grinder lying as sam had left him  mr grinder where is the baxter crowd he asked  gone half an hour ago replied the wounded man  where did they go to  i dont know they said something about following you up and spying on you to see if you had found the treasure  creation ejaculated dick and ran outside again weve made a mess of it he said they followed us up and more than likely theyve got the treasure box this minute  it was found that but little in the camp had been disturbed excepting that sams gun had been taken off what to do was now the question sam could not walk further  better stay here said dick if the baxter crowd comes back you can hide  then he tom and john barrow set out to return to where the treasure had been left they were still some distance away when they discovered dan baxter bill harney and lemuel husty making their way along the snowcovered trail in a few minutes they came up to the party  baxter where are you bound demanded dick striding up  you know well enough  we are after thet treasure came from harney and it was plain to see that he and husty had been drinking heavily  the treasure is ours baxter and you cant touch it  it will belong to whoever finds it growled the bully  thats right came from husty whoever gits it owns it eh harney  plain truth that is hiccoughed the big guide  in that case it is ours for sure grinned dick we have it already  at this announcement dan baxter staggered back  itit aint true youre joking he faltered  it is true baxter come i will show you where the treasure was hiddenif that will do you any good here is the description and dick brought it forth and let the bully read it  wheres the tree demanded baxter  there is the tree and over yonder is the rock we turned it over and found the treasure just as we anticipated its ours and i am simply telling you this to save you the trouble of looking further for it dan baxter you have played this game to a finish with your companions and you have lost  if ever there was a disappointed and angry individual it was dan baxter he raved and said all sorts of uncomplimentary things and husty and harney joined in until john barrow told all of them to shut up or he would have the law on them  you had no right to make prisoners of tom and sam he said but if youll behave yourselves and not bother us in the future well let that pass  to this husty who was a thorough sneak consented at once and then bill harney did the same baxter remained silent  youve defeated me this time he said at last but remember i am not done with you  a little later baxter moved off and bill harney and lemuel husty went with him it was the last that the rovers saw of their enemies for a long while to come  a few words more and we will bring to a close this story of the rover boys adventures in the mountains  our friends found it no easy matter to get the heavy treasure box safely to camp in order to move it they had to construct a drag of a treelimb and hook a rope to this and then it was all they could do to move it along through the deep snow  when they got the box into camp they lost no time in examining the treasure the gold and silver amounted to twentyfive hundred dollars and there were diamonds and other precious stones worth nearly as much more  about five thousand dollars all told announced dick that is not such a bad haul after all  as there was now nothing more to look for our friends spent ten days in the camp taking it easy most of the time and spending a day in getting back the missing sled they went hunting twice and the second time out dick got a fine shot at a deer and brought down the creature without trouble tom and sam brought down considerable small game and all voted the outing a complete success despite the interference occasioned by their enemies  at the end of the ten days jasper grinder was able to walk around although still weak in the meantime john barrow had constructed a sled for the former schoolteacher to sit upon and on this he rode when they started on the return to timber run  when the settlement was gained the laning girls mrs barrow and addie were glad to see them back and delighted to learn of the treasure and its value they said they had heard of baxter and his followers but that all of the party had left timber run for parts unknown  well we dont want to see them again said dick weve had quite enough of all of them at timber run jasper grinder left them and the rovers saw no more of him for many days  the homecoming of the rover boys was a day long to be remembered there was a regular party given at the country home at which many of their friends were present the laning girls were there and also dora stanhope and larry fred george and a host of others not forgetting captain putnam himself who came upon a special invitation sent by mr anderson rover alexander pop waited upon the table as usual his face beaming with pleasure  jes tell yo yo cant down dem rober boys nohow said the colored man to captain putnam da is jes like apples in a tubyo shoves em under an up da pops bright as eber and the owner of putnam hall laughingly agreed with alexander  i trust that you will never be troubled by dan baxter again said dora stanhope to dick after he had told her the story of the treasure hunt  i trust so myself replied dick but hes like a bad cent sure to turn up when not wanted dick told the truth how dan baxter turned up and what he did to bring the rovers more trouble will be told in another volume to be entitled the rover boys on land and sea or the crusoes of seven islands a tale full of happenings far out of the ordinary  but for the time being troubles were of the past and here let us leave our friends shouting as did the pupils from the hall when the party broke up  three cheers for the rover boys hip hip hurrah                                         the famous rover
