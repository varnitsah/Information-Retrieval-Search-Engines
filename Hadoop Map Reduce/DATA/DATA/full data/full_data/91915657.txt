womanly woman capable of sudden tendernesses flashes of emotion and abrupt actions she is a finished product of high culture and refinement and at the same time possesses robust vitality and instinctive rightpromptings that augur well for the future of the race  howard knox he might have been a poet but was turned politician inflamed with love for humanity thirtyfive years of age he has his vision and must follow it he has suffered ostracism because of it and has followed his vision in spite of abuse and ridicule physically a wellbuilt powerful man strongfeatured rather than handsome very much in earnest and despite his university training a trifle awkward in carriage and demeanor lacking in social ease he has been elected to congress on a reform ticket and is almost alone in

england state himself master of the state political machine also he is nobodys fool he possesses the brain and strength of character to play his part his most distinctive feature is his temperamental opportunism  master thomas chalmers six years of age sturdy and healthy despite his grandmothers belief to the contrary  ellery jackson hubbard thirtyeight to forty years of age smoothshaven a star journalist with a national reputation a large heavyset man with large head large handseverything about him is large a man radiating prosperity optimism and selfishness has no morality whatever is a conscious individualist coldblooded pitiless working only for himself and believing in nothing but himself  anthony starkweather an elderly well preserved gentleman slenderly built showing all the signs of a man who has lived clean and has been almost an ascetic one to whom the joys of the flesh have had little meaning a cold controlled man whose one passion is for power distinctively a man of power an eaglelike man who by keenness of brain and force of character has carved out a fortune of hundreds of millions in short an industrial and financial magnate of the first water and of the finest type to be found in the united states essentially a moral man his rigid new england morality has suffered a sea change and developed into the morality of the masterman of affairs equally rigid equally uncompromising but essentially jesuitical in that he believes in doing wrong that right may come of it he is absolutely certain that civilization and progress rest on his shoulders and upon the shoulders of the small group of men like him  mrs starkweather of the helpless comfortably stout elderly type she has not followed her husband in his moral evolution she is the creature of old customs old prejudices old new england ethics she is rather confused by the modern rush of life  connie starkweather margarets younger sister twenty years old she is nothing that margaret is and everything that margaret is not no essential evil in her but has no mind of her ownhopelessly a creature of convention gay laughing healthy buxoma natural product of her carefree environment  feux

the house of senator chalmers   scene in senator chalmers home it is four oclock in the afternoon in a modern living room with appropriate furnishings in particular in front on left a table prepared for the serving of tea all excepting the tea urn itself at rear right of center is main entrance to the room also doorways at sides on left and right curtain discloses chalmers and hubbard seated loungingly at the right front  hubbard  after an apparent pause for cogitation i cant understand why an old wheelhorse like elsworth should kick over the traces that way  chalmers  disgruntled thinks he didnt get his fair share of plums out of the tariff committee besides its his last term hes announced that hes going to retire  hubbard  snorting contemptuously mimicking an old mans pompous enunciation a resolution to investigate the high cost of livingold senator elsworth introducing a measure like that the old buck how are you going to handle it  chalmers  its already handled  hubbard  yes  chalmers  pulling his mustache turned it over to the committee to audit and control the contingent expenses of the senate  hubbard  grinning his appreciation and youre chairman poor old elsworth this way to the lethal chamber and the bills on its way  chalmers  elsworth will be retired before its ever reported in the meantime say after a decent interval senator hodge will introduce another resolution to investigate the high cost of living it will be like elsworths only it wont  hubbard  nodding his head and anticipating and it will go to the committee on finance and come back for action inside of twentyfour hours  chalmers  by the way i see cartwrights magazine has ceased muckraking  hubbard  cartwrights never did muckrakethat is not the big interestsonly the small independent businesses that didnt advertise  chalmers  yes it deftly concealed its reactionary tendencies  hubbard  and from now on the concealment will be still more deft ive gone into it myself i have a majority of the stock right now  chalmers  i thought i had noticed a subtle change in the last two numbers  hubbard  nodding were still going on muckraking we have a splendid series on aged paupers demanding better treatment and more sanitary conditions also we are going to run barbarous venezuela and show up thoroughly the rotten political management of that benighted country  chalmers  nods approvingly and after a pause and now concerning knox thats what i sent for you about his speech comes off tomorrow per schedule at last weve got him where we want him  hubbard  i have the ins and outs of it pretty well everythings arranged the boys have their cue though they dont know just whats going to be pulled off and this time tomorrow afternoon their dispatches will be singing along the wires  chalmers  firmly and harshly this man knox must be covered with ridicule swamped with ridicule annihilated with ridicule  hubbard  it is to laugh trust the great american people for that well make those little western editors sit up theyve been swearing by knox like a little tin god roars of laughter for them  chalmers  do you do anything yourself  hubbard  trust me i have my own article for cartwrights blocked out theyre holding the presses for it i shall wire it along hotfooted tomorrow evening say  chalmers  after a pause well  hubbard  wasnt it a risky thing to give him his chance with that speech  chalmers  it was the only feasible thing he never has given us an opening our service men have camped on his trail night and day private life as unimpeachable as his public life but now is our chance the gods have given him into our hands that speech will do more to break his influence  hubbard  interrupting than a fairbanks cocktail  both laugh but dont forget that this knox is a live wire somebody might get stung are you sure when he gets up to make that speech that he wont be able to back it up  chalmers  no danger at all  hubbard  but there are hooks and crooks by which facts are sometimes obtained  chalmers  positively knox has nothing to go on but suspicions and hints and unfounded assertions from the yellow press  manservant enters goes to teatable looks it over and makes slight rearrangements lowering his voice he will make himself a laughing stock his charges will turn into boomerangs his speech will be like a sheet from a sunday supplement with not a fact to back it up glances at servant wed better be getting out of here theyre going to have tea  the servant however makes exit come to the library and have a highball they pause as hubbard speaks  hubbard  with quiet glee and tomorrow ali baba gets his  chalmers  ali baba  hubbard  thats what your wife calls himknox  chalmers  oh yes i believe ive heard it before its about time he hanged himself and now weve given him the rope  hubbard  sinking voice and becoming deprecatingly confidential   oh by the way just a little friendly warning senator chalmers not so fast and loose up new york way that certain lady not to be mentionedtheres gossip about it in the new york newspaper offices of course all such stories are killed but be discreet be discreet if gherst gets hold of it hell play it up against the administration in all his papers  chalmers who throughout this speech is showing a growing resentment is about to speak when voices are heard without and he checks himself  enter mrs starkweather rather flustered and imminently in danger of a collapse followed by connie starkweather fresh radiant and joyous  mrs starkweather  with appeal and relief  ohtom  chalmers takes her hand sympathetically and protectingly  connie  who is an exuberant young woman bursts forth oh brotherinlaw such excitement thats whats the matter with mother we ran into a gocart our chauffeur was not to blame it was the womans fault she tried to cross just as we were turning the corner but we hardly grazed it fortunately the baby was not hurtonly spilled it was ridiculous catching sight of hubbard oh there you are mr hubbard how de do  steps half way to meet him and shakes hands with him mrs starkweather looks around helplessly for a chair and chalmers conducts her to one soothingly  mrs starkweather  oh it was terrible the little child might have been killed and such persons love their babies i know  connie  to chalmers has father come we were to pick him up here wheres madge  mrs starkweather  espying hubbard faintly oh there is mr hubbard  hubbard comes to her and shakes hands i simply cant get used to these rapid ways of modern life the motorcar is the invention of the devil everything is too quick when i was a girl we lived sedately decorously there was time for meditation and repose but in this age there is time for nothing how anthony keeps his head is more than i can understand but then anthony is a wonderful man  hubbard  i am sure mr starkweather never lost his head in his life  chalmers  unless when he was courting you mother  mrs starkweather  a trifle grimly im not so sure about that  connie  imitating a grave businesslike enunciation father probably conferred first with his associates then turned the affair over for consideration by his corporation lawyers and when they reported no flaws checked the first spare half hour in his notebook to ask mother if she would have him  they laugh and looked at his watch at least twice while he was proposing  mrs starkweather  anthony was not so busy then as all that  hubbard  he hadnt yet taken up the job of running the united states  mrs starkweather  im sure i dont know what he is running but he is a very busy manbusiness politics and madness madness politics and business  she stops breathlessly and glances at teatable tea i should like a cup of tea connie i shall stay for a cup of tea and then if your father hasnt come well go home to chalmers where is tommy  chalmers  out in the car with madge  glances at teatable and consults watch she should be back now  connie  mother you

funa positive joy hes giving the dinner to the british ambassador  mrs starkweather  starting forward in her chair and listening intently theres tommy now  voices of margaret chalmers and of tommy heard from without hers is laughingly protesting while tommys is gleefully insistent margaret and tommy appear and pause just outside door holding each others hands facing each other too immersed in each other to be aware of the presence of those inside the room margaret and tommy are in street costume  tommy laughing  but mama  margaret  herself laughing but shaking her head no tommy first  margaret  no you must run along to linda now mothers boy and well talk about that some other time  tommy notices for the first time that there are persons in the room he peeps in around the door and espies mrs starkweather at the same moment impulsively he withdraws his hands and runs in to mrs starkweather  tommy  who is evidently fond of his grandmother grandma  they embrace and make much of each other  margaret enters appropriately greeting the othersa kiss maybe to connie and a slightly cold handshake to hubbard  margaret  to chalmers now that youre here tom you mustnt run away  greets mrs starkweather  mrs starkweather  turning tommys face to the light and looking at it anxiously a trifle thin margaret  margaret  on the contrary mother  mrs starkweather  to chalmers dont you think so tom  connie  aside to hubbard mother continually worries about his health  hubbard  a sturdy youngster i should say  tommy  to chalmers im an indian arent i daddy  chalmers  nodding his head emphatically and the stoutesthearted in the tribe  linda appears in doorway evidently looking for tommy and chalmers notices her theres linda looking for you young stout heart  margaret  take tommy linda run along mothers boy  tommy  come along grandma i want to show you something  he catches mrs starkweather by the hand protesting but highly pleased she allows him to lead her to the door where he extends his other hand to linda thus pausing in doorway leading a woman by either hand he looks back at margaret roguishly remember mama were going to scout in a little while  margaret  going to tommy and bending down with her arms around him no tommy mama has to go to that horrid dinner tonight but tomorrow well play  tommy is cast down and looks as if he might pout where is my little indian now  hubbard  be an indian tommy  tommy  brightening up  all right mama tomorrowif you cant find time today  margaret kisses him exit tommy mrs starkweather and linda tommy leading them by a hand in each of theirs  chalmers  nodding to hubbard in low voice to hubbard and starting to make exit to right that highball  hubbard disengages himself from proximity of connie and starts to follow  connie  reproachfully if you run away i wont stop for tea  margaret  do stop tom father will be here in a few minutes  connie  a regular family party  chalmers  all right well be back were just going to have a little talk  chalmers and hubbard make exit to right margaret puts her arm impulsively around conniea sheerly spontaneous act of affectionkisses her and at same time evinces preparation to leave  margaret  ive got to get my things off wont you wait here dear in case anybody comes its nearly time  starts toward exit to rear but is stopped by connie madge  margaret immediately pauses and waits expectantly smiling while connie is hesitant  i want to speak to you about something madge you dont mind  margaret still smiling shakes her head just a warning not that anybody could believe for a moment there is anything wrong but  margaret  dispelling a shadow of irritation that has crossed her face  if it concerns tom dont tell me please you know he does do ridiculous things at times but i dont let him worry me any more so dont worry me about him  connie remains silent and margaret grows curious well  connie  its not about tom  pauses its about you  margaret  oh  connie  i dont know how to begin  margaret  by coming right out with it the worst of it all at once first  connie  it isnt serious at all butwell mother is worrying about it you know how oldfashioned she is and when you consider our positionfathers and toms i meanit doesnt seem just right for you to be seeing so much of such an enemy of theirs he has abused them dreadfully you know and theres that dreadful speech he is going to give tomorrow you havent seen the afternoon papers he has made the most terrible charges against everybodyall of us our friends everybody  margaret  you mean mr knox of course but he wouldnt harm anybody connie dear  connie  bridling oh he wouldnt he as good as publicly called father a thief  margaret  when did that happen i never heard of it  connie  well he said that the money magnates had grown so unprincipled sunk so low that they would steal a mouse from a blind kitten  margaret  i dont see what father has to do with that  connie  he meant him just the same  margaret  you silly goose he couldnt have meant father father why father wouldnt look at anything less than fifty or a hundred millions  connie  and you speak to him and make much of him when you meet him places you talked with him for half an hour at that dugdale reception you have him here in your own housetoms housewhen hes such a bitter enemy of toms during the foregoing speech anthony starkweather makes entrance from rear his face is grave and he is in a brown study as if pondering weighty problems at sight of the two women he pauses and surveys them they are unaware of his presence  margaret  you are wrong connie he is nobodys enemy he is the truest cleanest most rightseeking man i have ever seen  connie  interrupting he is a troublemaker a disturber of the public peace a shallowpated demagogue  margaret  reprovingly  now youre quoting somebody father i suppose to think of him being so abusedpoor dear ali baba  starkweather  clearing his throat in advertisement of his presence ahem  margaret and connie turn around abruptly and discover him  margaret  and connie father  both come forward to greet him margaret leading  starkweather  anticipating showing the deliberate method of the busy man saving time by eliminating the superfluous fine thank you quite well in every particular this ali baba who is ali baba  margaret looks amused reproach at connie  connie  mr howard knox  starkweather  and why is he called ali baba  margaret  that is my nickname for him in the den of thieves you know you remember your arabian nights  starkweather  severely i have been wanting to speak to you for some time margaret about that man you know that i have never interfered with your way of life since your marriage nor with your and toms housekeeping arrangements but this man knox i understand that you have even had him here in your house  margaret  interrupting he is very liable to be here this afternoon any time now  connie displays irritation at margaret  starkweather  continuing imperturbably your houseyou my daughter and the wife of senator chalmers as i said i have not interfered with you since your marriage but this knox affair transcends household arrangements it is of political importance the man is an enemy to our class a firebrand why do you have him here  margaret  because i like him because he is a man i am proud to call friend because i wish there were more men like him many more men like him in the world because i have ever seen in him nothing but the best and highest and besides its such good fun to see how one virtuous man can so disconcert you captains of industry and arbiters of destiny confess that you are very much disconcerted father right now he will be here in a few minutes and you will be more disconcerted why because it is an affair that transcends family arrangements and it is your affair not mine  starkweather  this man knox is a dangerous characterone that i am not pleased to see any of my family take up with he is not a gentleman  margaret  he is a selfmade man if that is what you mean and he certainly hasnt any money  connie  interrupting he says that money is theftat least when it is in the hands of a wealthy person  starkweather  he is uncouthignorant  margaret  i happen to know that he is a graduate of the university of oregon  starkweather  sneeringly a cow college but that is not what i mean he is a demagogue stirring up the wildbeast passions of the people  margaret  surely you would not call his advocacy of that child labor bill and of the conservation of the forest and coal lands stirring up the wildbeast passions of the people  starkweather  wearily you dont understand when i say he is dangerous it is because he threatens all the stabilities because he threatens us who have made this country and upon whom this country and its prosperity rest  connie scenting trouble walks across stage away from them  margaret  the captains of industrythe banking magnates and the mergers  starkweather  call it so call it what you will without us the country falls into the hands of scoundrels like that man knox and smashes to ruin  margaret  reprovingly not a scoundrel father  starkweather  he is a sentimental dreamer a hairbrained enthusiast it is the foolish utterances of men like him that place the bomb and the knife in the hand of the assassin  margaret  he is at least a good man even if he does disagree with you on political and industrial problems and heaven knows that good men are rare enough these days  starkweather  i impugn neither his morality nor his motivesonly his rationality really margaret there is nothing inherently vicious about him i grant that and it is precisely that which makes him such a power for evil  margaret  when i think of all the misery and pain which he is trying to remedyi can see in him only a power for good he is not working for himself but for the many that is why he has no money you have heaven alone knows how many millionsyou dont you have worked for yourself  starkweather  i too work for the many i give work to the many i make life possible for the many i am only too keenly alive to the responsibilities of my stewardship of wealth  margaret  but what of the child laborers working at the machines is that necessary o steward of wealth how my heart has ached for them how i have longed to do something for themto change conditions so that it will no longer be necessary for the children to toil to have the playtime of childhood stolen away from them theftthat is what it is the playtime of the children coined into profits that is why i like howard knox he calls theft theft he is trying to do something for those children what are you trying to do for them  starkweather  sentiment sentiment the question is too vast and complicated and you cannot understand no woman can understand that is why you run to sentiment that is what is the matter with this knoxsentiment you cant run a government of ninety millions of people on sentiment nor on abstract ideas of justice and right  margaret  but if you eliminate justice and right what remains  starkweather  this is a practical world and it must be managed by practical menby thinkers not by nearthinkers whose heads are addled with the halfdigested ideas of the french encyclopedists and revolutionists of a century and a half ago  margaret shows signs of impatienceshe is not particularly perturbed by this passageatarms with her father and is anxious to get off her street things  dont forget my daughter that your father knows the books as well as any cow college graduate from oregon i too in my student days dabbled in theories of universal happiness and righteousness saw my vision and dreamed my dream i did not know then the weakness and frailty and grossness of the human clay but i grew out of that and into a man some men never grow out of that stage that is what is the trouble with knox he is still a dreamer and a dangerous one  he pauses a moment and then his thin lips shut grimly but he has just about shot his bolt  margaret  what do you mean  starkweather  he has let himself in to give a speech tomorrow wherein he will be called upon to deliver the proofs of all the lurid charges he has made against the administrationagainst us the stewards of wealth if you please he will be unable to deliver the proofs and the nation will laugh and that will be the political end of mr ali baba and his dream  margaret  it is a beautiful dream were there more like him the dream would come true after all it is the dreamers that build and that never die perhaps you will find that he is not so easily to be destroyed but i cant stay and argue with you father i simply must go and get my things off  to connie youll have to receive dear ill be right back  julius rutland enters margaret advances to meet him shaking his hand you must forgive me for deserting for a moment  rutland  greeting the others a family council i see  margaret  on way to exit at rear no a discussion on dreams and dreamers i leave you to bear my part  rutland  bowing with pleasure the dreamers are the true architects butawhat is the dream and who is the dreamer  margaret  pausing in the doorway the dream of social justice of fair play and a square deal to everybody the dreamermr knox  rutland is so patently irritated that margaret lingers in the doorway to enjoy  rutland  that man he has insulted and reviled the churchmy calling he  connie  interrupting he said the churchmen stole from god i remember he once said there had been only one true christian and that he died on the cross  margaret  he quoted that from nietzsche  starkweather  to rutland in quiet glee he had you there  rutland  in composed fury nietzsche is a blasphemer sir any man who reads nietzsche or quotes nietzsche is a blasphemer it augurs ill for the future of america when such pernicious literature has the vogue it has  margaret  interrupting laughing i leave the quarrel in your hands sir knight rememberthe dreamer and the dream margaret makes exit  rutland  shaking his head i cannot understand what is coming over the present generation take your daughter for instance ten years ago she was an earnest sincere lieutenant of mine in all our little charities  starkweather  has she given charity up  connie  its settlement work now and kindergartens  rutland  ominously its writers like nietzsche and men who read him like knox who are responsible  senator dowsett and mrs dowsett enter from rear  connie advances to greet them rutland knows mrs dowsett and connie introduces him to senator dowsett  in the meantime not bothering to greet anybody evincing his own will and way starkweather goes across to right front selects one of several chairs seats himself pulls a thin notebook from inside coat pocket and proceeds to immerse himself in contents of same dowsett and rutland pair and stroll to left rear and seat themselves while connie and mrs dowsett seat themselves at teatable to left front connie rings the bell for servant  mrs dowsett  glancing significantly at starkweather and speaking in a low voice thats your father isnt it i have so wanted to meet him  connie softly you know hes peculiar he is liable to ignore everybody here this afternoon and get up and go away abruptly without saying goodbye  mrs dowsett  sympathetically  yes i know a man of such large affairs he must have so much on his mind he is a wonderful manmy husband says the greatest in contemporary historymore powerful than a dozen presidents the king of england and the kaiser all rolled into one  servant enters with tea urn and accessories and connie proceeds to serve tea all accompanied by appropriate pattertwo lumps one please lemon etc  rutland and dowsett come forward to table for their tea where they remain  connie glancing apprehensively across at her father and debating a moment prepares a cup for him and a small plate with crackers and hands them to dowsett who likewise betrays apprehensiveness  connie  take it to father please senator  notethroughout the rest of this act starkweather is like a being apart a king sitting on his throne he divides the tea function with margaret men come up to him and speak with him he sends for men they come and go at his bidding the whole attitude perhaps unconsciously on his part is that wherever he may be he is master this attitude is accepted by all the others forsooth he is indeed a great man and master the only one who is not really afraid of him is margaret yet she gives in to him in so far as she lets him do as he pleases at her afternoon tea dowsett carries the cup of tea and small plate across stage to starkweather starkweather does not notice him at first  connie  who has been watching tea father wont you have a cup of tea  through the following scene between starkweather and dowsett the latter holds cup of tea and crackers helplessly at a disadvantage at the same time rutland is served with tea and remains at the table talking with the two women  starkweather  looking first at connie then peering into cup of tea he grunts refusal and for the first time looks up into the other mans face he immediately closes notebook down on finger to keep the place oh its you dowsett  painfully endeavoring to be at ease a pleasure mr starkweather an entirely unexpected pleasure to meet you here i was not aware you frequented frivolous gatherings of this nature  starkweather  abruptly and peremptorily why didnt you come when you were sent for this morning  dowsett  i was sicki was in bed  starkweather  that is no excuse sir when you are sent for you are to come understand that bill was reported back why was it reported back you told dobleman you would attend to it  dowsett  it was a slip up such things will happen  starkweather  what was the matter with that committee have you no influence with the senate crowd if not say so and ill get some one who has  dowsett  angrily i refuse to be treated in this manner mr starkweather i have some selfrespect  starkweather grunts incredulously some decency  starkweather grunts a position of prominence in my state you forget sir that in our state organization i occupy no mean place  starkweather  cutting him off so sharply that dowsett drops cup and saucer dont you show your teeth to me i can make you or break you that state organization of yours belongs to me  dowsett startshe is learning something new to hide his feelings he stoops to pick up cup and saucer let it alone i am talking to you  dowsett straightens up to attention with alacrity connie who has witnessed rings for servant i bought that state organization and paid for it you are one of the chattels that came along with the machine you were made senator to obey my orders understand do you understand  dowsett  beaten ii understand  starkweather  that bill is to be killed  dowsett  yes sir  starkweather  quietly no headlines about it  dowsett nods now you can go  dowsett proceeds rather limply across to join group at teatable chalmers and hubbard enter from right laughing about something at sight of starkweather they immediately become sober no hands are shaken starkweather barely acknowledges hubbards greeting  starkweather  tom i want to see you  hubbard takes his cue and proceeds across to teatable  enter servant connie directs him to remove broken cup and saucer while this is being done starkweather remains silent he consults notebook and chalmers stands not quite at ease waiting the others will at the same time patter at teatable hubbard greeting others and accepting or declining cup of tea  servant makes exit  starkweather  closing finger on book and looking sharply at chalmers tom this affair of yours in new york must come to an end understand  chalmers  starting hubbard has been talking  starkweather  no it is not hubbard i have the reports from other sources  chalmers  it is a harmless affair  starkweather  i happen to know better i have the whole record if you wish i can give you every detail every meeting i know there is no discussion whatever i want no more of it  chalmers  i never dreamed for a moment that i waserindiscreet  starkweather  never forget that every indiscretion of a man in your position is indiscreet we have a duty a great and solemn duty to perform upon our shoulders rest the destinies of ninety million people if we fail in our duty they go down to destruction ignorant demagogues are working on the beastpassions of the people if they have their way they are lost the country is lost civilization is lost we want no more dark ages  chalmers  really i never thought it was as serious as all that  starkweather  shrugging shoulders and lifting eyebrows after all why should you you are only a cog in the machine i and the several men grouped with me am the machine you are a useful cogtoo useful to lose  chalmers  loseme  starkweather  i have but to raise my hand any timedo you understandany time and you are lost you control your state very well but never forget that tomorrow if i wished i could buy your whole machine out from under you i know you cannot change yourself but for the sake of the big issues at stake you must be careful exceedingly careful we are compelled to work with weak tools you are a good liver a fleshpot man you drink too much your heart is weakoh i have the report of your doctor nevertheless dont make a fool of yourself nor of us besides do not forget that your wife is my daughter she is a strong woman a credit to both of us be careful that you are not a discredit to her  chalmers  all right ill be careful but while we areeron this subject theres something id like to speak to you about  a pause in which starkweather waits noncommittally its this man knox and madge he comes to the house they are as thick as thieves  starkweather  yes  chalmers  hastily oh not a breath of suspicion or anything of that sort i assure you but it doesnt strike me as exactly appropriate that your daughter and my wife should be friendly with this fireeating anarchist who is always attacking us and all that we represent  starkweather  i started to speak with her on that subject but was interrupted  puckers brow and thinks you are her husband why dont you take her in hand yourself  enters mrs starkweather from rear looking about bowing then locating starkweather and proceeding toward him  chalmers  what can i do she has a will of her ownthe same sort of a will that you have besides i think she knows about myabout some of myindiscretions  starkweather  slyly  harmless indiscretions  chalmers is about to reply but observes mrs starkweather approaching  mrs starkweather  speaks in a peevish complaining voice and during her harrangue starkweather immerses himself in notebook oh there you are anthony talking politics i suppose well as soon as i get a cup of tea we must go tommy is not looking as well as i could wish margaret loves him but she does not take the right care of him i dont know what the world is coming to when mothers do not know how to rear their offspring there is margaret with her slum kindergartens taking care of everybody elses children but her own if she only performed her church duties as eagerly mr rutland is displeased with her i shall give her a talking toonly youd better do it anthony somehow i have never counted much with margaret she is as set in doing what she pleases as you are in my time children paid respect to their parents this is what comes of speed there is no time for anything and now i must get my tea and run connie has to dress for that dinner  mrs starkweather crosses to table greets others characteristically and is served with tea by connie  chalmers waits respectfully on starkweather  starkweather  looking up from notebook that will do tom  chalmers is just starting across to join others when voices are heard outside rear entrance and margaret enters with dolores ortega wife of the peruvian minister and matsu sakari secretary of japanese legationboth of whom she has met as they were entering the house  chalmers changes his course and meets the above advancing group he knows dolores ortega whom he greets and is introduced to sakari  margaret passes on among guests greeting them etc then she displaces connie at teatable and proceeds to dispense tea to the newcomers  groups slowly form and seat themselves about stage as follows chalmers and dolores ortega rutland dowsett mrs starkweather connie mr dowsett and hubbard  chalmers carries tea to dolores ortega  sakari has been lingering by table waiting for tea and pattering with margaret chalmers etc  margaret  handing cup to sakari i am very timid in offering you this for i am sure you must be appalled by our barbarous methods of making tea  sakari  bowing it is true your american tea and the tea of the english are quite radically different from the tea in my country but one learns you know i served my apprenticeship to american tea long years ago when i was at yale it was perplexing i assure youat first only at first i really believe that i am beginning to have ahow shall i call ita tolerance for tea in your fashion  margaret  you are very kind in overlooking our shortcomings  sakari  bowing on the contrary i am unaware always unaware of any shortcomings of this marvelous country of yours  margaret  laughing you are incorrigibly gracious mr sakari knox appears at threshold of rear entrance and pauses irresolutely for a moment  sakari  noticing knox and looking about him to select which group he will join if i may be allowed i shall now retire and consume thistea  joins group composed of connie mrs dowsett and hubbard  knox comes forward to margaret betraying a certain awkwardness due to lack of experience in such social functions he greets margaret and those in the group nearest her  knox  to margaret i dont know why i come here i do not belong all the ways are strange  margaret  lightly at the same time preparing his tea the same ali babaonce again in the den of the forty thieves but your watch and pocketbook are safe here really they are  knox makes a gesture of dissent at her facetiousness now dont be serious you should relax sometimes you live too tensely  looking at starkweather theres the archanarch over there the dragon you are trying to slay  knox looks at starkweather and is plainly perplexed the man who handles all the life insurance funds who controls more strings of banks and trust companies than all the rothschilds a hundred times overthe merger of iron and steel and coal and shipping and all the other thingsthe man who blocks your child labor bill and all the rest of the remedial legislation you advocate in short my father  knox  looking intently at starkweather i should have recognized him from his photographs but why do you say such things  margaret  because they are true  he remains silent now arent they she laughs oh you dont need to answer you know the truth the whole bitter truth this is a den of thieves there is mr hubbard over there for instance the trusty journalist lieutenant of the corporations  knox  with an expression of disgust i know him it was he that wrote the standard oil side of the story after having abused standard oil for years in the pseudomuckraking magazines he made them come up to his price that was all hes the star writer on cartwrights now since that magazine changed its policy and became subsidizedly reactionary i know hima thoroughly dishonest man truly am i ali baba and truly i wonder why i am here  margaret  you are here sir because i like you to come  knox  we do have much in common you and i  margaret  the future  knox  gravely looking at her with shining eyes i sometimes fear for more immediate reasons than that  margaret looks at him in alarm and at the same time betrays pleasure in what he has said for you  margaret  hastily dont look at me that way your eyes are flashing some one might see and misunderstand  knox  in confusion awkwardly i was unaware that ithat i was looking at youin any way that  margaret  ill tell you why you are here because i sent for you  knox  with signs of ardor i would come whenever you sent for me and go wherever you might send me  margaret  reprovingly  please please it was about that speech i have been hearing about it from everybodyrumblings and mutterings and dire prophecies i know how busy you are and i ought not to have asked you to come but there was no other way and i was so anxious  knox  pleased it seems so strange that you being what you are affiliated as you are should be interested in the welfare of the common people  margaret  judicially i do seem like a traitor in my own camp but as father said a while ago i too have dreamed my dream i did it as a girlplatos republic moores utopiai was steeped in all the dreams of the social dreamers  during all that follows of her speech knox is keenly interested his eyes glisten and he hangs on her words  and i dreamed that i too might do something to bring on the era of universal justice and fair play in my heart i dedicated myself to the cause of humanity i made lincoln my herohe still is but i was only a girl and where was i to find this causehow to work for it i was shut in by a thousand restrictions hedged in by a thousand conventions everybody laughed at me when i expressed the thoughts that burned in me what could i do i was only a woman i had neither vote nor right of utterance i must remain silent i must do nothing men in their lordly wisdom did all they voted orated governed the place for women was in the home taking care of some lordly man who did all these lordly things  knox  you understand then why i am for equal suffrage  margaret  but i learnedor thought i learned power i discovered early my father had power he was a magnatei believe that is the correct phrase power was what i needed but how i was a woman again i dreamed my dreama modified dream only by marriage could i win to power and there you have the clew to me and what i am and have become i met the man who was to become my husband he was clean and strong and an athlete an outdoor man a wealthy man and a rising politician father told me that if i married him he would make him the power of his state make him governor send him to the united states senate and there you have it all  knox  yes yes  margaret  i married i found that there were greater forces at work than i had ever dreamed of they took my husband away from me and molded him into the political lieutenant of my father and i was without power i could do nothing for the cause i was beaten then it was that i got a new vision the future belonged to the children there i could play my womans part i was a mother very well i could do no better than to bring into the world a healthy son and bring him up to manhood healthy and wholesome clean noble and alive did i do my part well through him the results would be achieved through him would the work of the world be done in making the world healthier and happier for all the human creatures in it i played the mothers part that is why i left the pitiful little charities of the church and devoted myself to settlement work and tenement house reform established my kindergartens and worked for the little men and women who come so blindly and to whom the future belongs to make or mar  knox  you are magnificent i know now why i come when you bid me come  margaret  and then you came you were magnificent you were my knight of the windmills tilting against all power and privilege striving to wrest the future from the future and realize it here in the present now i was sure you would be destroyed yet you are still here and fighting valiantly and that speech of yours tomorrow  chalmers  who has approached bearing dolores ortegas cup yes that speech how do you do mr knox  they shake hands a cup of tea madge for mrs ortega two lumps please  margaret prepares the cup of tea everybody is excited over that speech you are going to give us particular fits tomorrow i understand  knox  smiling really no more than is deserved  chalmers  the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth  knox  precisely  receiving back cup of tea from margaret  chalmers  believe me we are not so black as were painted there are two sides to this question like you we do our best to do what is right and we hope we still hope to win you over to our side  knox shakes his head with a quiet smile  margaret  oh tom be truthful you dont hope anything of the sort you know you are hoping to destroy him  chalmers  smiling grimly that is what usually happens to those who are not won over  preparing to depart with cup of tea speaking to knox you might accomplish much good were you with us against us you accomplish nothing absolutely nothing  returns to dolores ortega  margaret  hurriedly you see that is why i was anxiouswhy i sent for you even tom admits that they who are not won over are destroyed this speech is a crucial event you know how rigidly they rule the house and gag men like you it is they and they alone who have given you opportunity for this speech whywhy  knox  smiling confidently i know their little scheme they have heard my charges they think i am going to make a firebrand speech and they are ready to catch me without the proofs they are ready in every way for me they are going to laugh me down the associated press the washington correspondentsall are ready to manufacture in every newspaper in the land the great laugh that will destroy me but i am fully prepared i have  margaret  the proofs  knox  yes  margaret  now  knox  they will be delivered to me tonightoriginal documents photographs of documents affidavits  margaret  tell me nothing but oh do be careful be careful  mrs dowsett  appealing to margaret do give me some assistance mrs chalmers  indicating sakari mr sakari is trying to make me ridiculous  margaret  impossible  mrs dowsett  but he is he has had the effrontery  chalmers  mimicking mrs dowsett effronteryo sakari  sakari  the dear lady is pleased to be facetious  mrs dowsett  he has had the effrontery to ask me to explain the cause of high prices mr dowsett says the reason is that the people are living so high  sakari  such a marvelous country they are poor because they have so much to spend  chalmers  are not high prices due to the increased output of gold  mrs dowsett  mr sakari suggested that himself and when i agreed with him he proceeded to demolish it he has treated me dreadfully  rutland  clearing his throat and expressing himself with ponderous unction you will find the solution in the drink traffic it is liquor alcohol that is undermining our industry our institutions our faith in godeverything yearly the working people drink greater quantities of alcohol naturally through resulting inefficiency the cost of production is higher and therefore prices are higher  dowsett  partly so partly so and in line with it and in addition to it prices are high because the working class is no longer thrifty if our working class saved as the french peasant does we would sell more in the world market and have better times  sakari bowing as i understand it then the more thrifty you are the more you save and the more you save the more you have to sell the more you sell the better the times  dowsett  exactly so exactly  sakari  the less you sell the harder are the times  dowsett  just so  sakari  then if the people are thrifty and buy less times will be harder  dowsett  perplexed erit would seem so  sakari  then it would seem that the present bad times are due to the fact that the people are thrifty rather than not thrifty  dowsett is nonplussed and mrs dowsett throws up her hands in despair  mrs dowsett  turning to knox perhaps you can explain to us mr knox the reason for this terrible condition of affairs  starkweather closes notebook on finger and listens knox smiles but does not speak  dolores ortega  please do mr knox i am so dreadfully anxious to know why living is so high now only this morning i understand meat went up again  knox hesitates and looks questioningly at margaret  hubbard  i am sure mr knox can shed new light on this perplexing problem  chalmers  surely you the whirlwind of oratorical swords in the house are not timid hereamong friends  knox sparring i had no idea that questions of such nature were topics of conversation at affairs like this  starkweather  abruptly and imperatively what causes the high prices  knox  equally abrupt and just as positive as the other was imperative theft  it is a sort of a bombshell he has exploded but they receive it politely and smilingly even though it has shaken them up  dolores ortega  what a romantic explanation i suppose everybody who has anything has stolen it  knox  not quite but almost quite take motorcars for example this year five hundred million dollars has been spent for motorcars it required men toiling in the mines and foundries women sewing their eyes out in sweatshops shop girls slaving for four and five dollars a week little children working in the factories and cottonmillsall these it required to produce those five hundred millions spent this year in motorcars and all this has been stolen from those who did the work  mrs starkweather  i always knew those motorcars were to blame for terrible things  dolores ortega  but mr knox i have a motorcar  knox  somebodys labor made that car was it yours  dolores ortega  mercy no i bought it and paid for it  knox  then did you labor at producing something else and exchange the fruits of that labor for the motorcar  a pause  you do not answer then i am to understand that you have a motorcar which was made by somebody elses labor and for which you gave no labor of your own this i call theft you call it property yet it is theft  starkweather  interrupting dolores ortega who was just about to speak  but surely you have intelligence to see the question in larger ways than stolen motorcars i am a man of affairs i dont steal motorcars  knox  smiling not concrete little motorcars no you do things on a large scale  starkweather  steal  knox  shrugging his shoulders if you will have it so  starkweather  i am like a certain gentleman from missouri youve got to show me  knox  and im like the man from texas its got to be put in my hand  starkweather  i shift my residence at once to texas put it in my hand that i steal on a large scale  knox  very well you are the great financier merger and magnate do you mind a few statistics  starkweather  go ahead  knox  you exercise a controlling interest in nine billion dollars worth of railways in two billion dollars worth of industrial concerns in one billion dollars worth of life insurance groups in one billion dollars worth of banking groups in two billion dollars worth of trust companies mind you i do not say you own all this but that you exercise a controlling interest that is all that is necessary in short you exercise a controlling interest in such a proportion of the total investments of the united states as to set the pace for all the rest now to my point in the last few years seventy billions of dollars have been artificially added to the capitalization of the nations industries by that i mean waterpure unadulterated water you the merger know what water means i say seventy billions it doesnt matter if we call it forty billions or eighty billions the amount whatever it is is a huge one and what does seventy billions of water mean it means at five per cent that three billions and a half must be paid for things this year and every year more than things are really worth the people who labor have to pay this there is theft for you there is high prices for you who put in the water who gets the theft of the water have i put it in your hand  starkweather  are there no wages for stewardship  knox  call it any name you please  starkweather  do i not make two dollars where one was before do i not make for more happiness than was before i came  knox  is that any more than the duty any man owes to his fellowman  starkweather  oh you unpractical dreamer returns to his notebook  rutland  throwing himself into the breach where do i steal mr knoxi who get a mere salary for preaching the lords word  knox  your salary comes out of that water i mentioned do you want to know who pays your salary not your parishioners but the little children toiling in the mills and all the restall the slaves on the wheel of labor pay you your salary  rutland i earn it  knox  they pay it  mrs dowsett  why i declare mr knox you are worse than mr sakari you are an anarchist  she simulates shivering with fear  chalmers  to knox i suppose thats part of your speech tomorrow  dolores ortega  clapping her hands a rehearsal hes trying it out on us  sakari  how would you remedy thiserthis theft  starkweather again closes notebook on finger and listens as knox begins to speak  knox  very simply by changing the governmental machinery by which this household of ninety millions of people conducts its affairs  sakari  i thoughti was taught so at yalethat your governmental machinery was excellent most excellent  knox  it is antiquated it is ready for the scrapheap instead of being our servant it has mastered us we are its slaves all the political brood of grafters and hypocrites have run away with it and with us as well in short from the municipalities up we are dominated by the grafters it is a reign of theft  hubbard  but any government is representative of its people no people is worthy of a better government than it possesses were it worthier it would possess a better government  starkweather nods his head approvingly  knox  that is a lie and i say to you now that the average morality and desire for right conduct of the people of the united states is far higher than that of the government which misrepresents it the people are essentially worthy of a better government than that which is at present in the hands of the politicians for the benefit of the politicians and of the interests the politicians represent i wonder mr sakari if you have ever heard the story of the four aces  sakari  i cannot say that i have  knox  do you understand the game of poker  sakari  considering yes a marvelous game i have learned itat yale it was very expensive  knox  well that story reminds me of our grafting politicians they have no moral compunctions they look upon theft as righteminently right they see nothing wrong in the arrangement that the man who deals the cards should give himself the best in the deck never mind what he deals himself theyll have the deal next and make up for it  dolores ortega  but the story mr knox i too understand poker  knox  it occurred out in nevada in a mining camp a tenderfoot was watching a game of poker he stood behind the dealer and he saw the dealer deal himself four aces from the bottom of the deck  from now on he tells the story in the slow slightly drawling western fashion the tenderfoot went around to the player on the opposite side of the table  say he says i just seen the dealer give himself four aces off the bottom  the player looked at him a moment and said what of it  oh nothing said the tenderfoot only i thought you might want to know i tell you i seen the dealer give himself four aces off the bottom  look here mister said the player youd better get out of this you dont understand the game its his deal aint it  margaret  arising while they are laughing weve talked politics long enough dolores i want you to tell me about your new car  knox  as if suddenly recollecting himself and i must be going  in a low voice to margaret do i have to shake hands with all these people  margaret  shaking her head speaking low dear delightful ali baba  knox  glumly i suppose ive made a fool of myself  margaret  earnestly on the contrary you were delightful i am proud of you  as knox shakes hands with margaret sakari arises and comes forward  sakari  i too must go i have had a charming half hour mrs chalmers but i shall not attempt to thank you  he shakes hands with margaret  knox and sakari proceed to make exit to rear  just as they go out servant enters carrying cardtray and advances toward starkweather  margaret joins dolores ortega and chalmers seats herself with them and proceeds to talk motorcars  servant has reached starkweather who has taken a telegram from tray opened it and is reading it  starkweather  damnation  servant  i beg your pardon sir  starkweather  send senator chalmers to me and mr hubbard  servant  yes sir  servant crosses to chalmers and hubbard both of whom immediately arise and cross to starkweather  while this is being done margaret reassembles the three broken groups into one seating herself so that she can watch starkweather and his group across the stage  servant lingers to receive a command from margaret  chalmers and hubbard wait a moment standing while starkweather rereads telegram  starkweather  standing up dobleman has just forwarded this telegram its from new yorkfrom martinaw theres been rottenness my papers and letterfiles have been ransacked its the confidential stenographer who has been tampered withyou remember that middleaged youngisholdish woman tom thats the onewheres that servant  servant is just making exit here come here  servant comes over to starkweather go to the telephone and call up dobleman tell him to come here  servant  perplexed i beg pardon sir  starkweather  irritably my secretary at my house dobleman tell him to come at once  servant makes exit  chalmers  but who can be the principal behind this theft  starkweather shrugs his shoulders  hubbard  a blackmailing device most probably they will attempt to bleed you  chalmers  unless  starkweather  impatiently yes  chalmers  unless they are to be used tomorrow in that speech of knox  comprehension dawns on the faces of the other two men  mrs starkweather  who has arisen anthony we must go now are you ready connie has to dress  starkweather  i am not going now you and connie take the car  mrs starkweather  you mustnt forget you are going to that dinner  starkweather  wearily do i ever forget  servant enters and proceeds toward starkweather where he stands waiting while mrs starkweather finishes the next speech starkweather listens to her with a patient stony face  mrs starkweather  oh these everlasting politics that is what it has been all afternoonhigh prices graft and theft theft graft and high prices it is terrible when i was a girl we did not talk of such things well come on connie  mrs dowsett  rising and glancing at dowsett and we must be going too  during the following scene which takes place around starkweather margaret is saying goodbye to her departing guests  mrs starkweather and connie make exit  dowsett and mrs dowsett make exit  the instant mrs dowsetts remark puts a complete end to mrs starkweathers speech starkweather without answer or noticing his wife turns and interrogates servant with a glance  servant  mr dobleman has already left some time to come here sir  starkweather  show him in as soon as he comes  servant  yes sir  servant makes exit  margaret dolores ortega and rutland are left in a group together this time around teatable where margaret serves rutland another cup of tea from time to time margaret glances curiously at the serious group of men across the stage  starkweather is thinking hard with knitted brows hubbard is likewise pondering  chalmers  if i were certain knox had those papers i would take him by the throat and shake them out of him  starkweather  no foolish talk like that tom this is a serious matter  hubbard  but knox has no money a starkweather stenographer comes high  starkweather  there is more than knox behind this enter dobleman walking quickly and in a state of controlled excitement  dobleman  to starkweather you received that telegram sir  starkweather nods i got the new york officemartinawright along afterward by long distance i thought best to follow and tell you  starkweather  what did martinaw say  dobleman  the files seem in perfect order  starkweather  thank god  during the following speech of dobleman rutland says goodbye to margaret and dolores ortega and makes exit  margaret and dolores ortega rise a minute afterward and go toward exit throwing curious glances at the men but not disturbing them  dolores ortega makes exit  margaret pauses in doorway a moment giving a final anxious glance at the men and makes exit  dobleman  but they are not the stenographer miss standish has confessed for a long time she has followed the practice of taking two or three letters and documents at a time away from the office many have been photographed and returned but the more important ones were retained and clever copies returned martinaw says that miss standish herself does not know and cannot tell which of the ones she returned are genuine and which are copies  hubbard  knox never did this  starkweather  did martinaw say whom miss standish was acting for  dobleman  gherst  the alarm on the three mens faces is patent  starkweather  gherst  pauses to think  hubbard  then it is not so grave after all a yellow journal sensation is the best gherst can make of it and documents or not the very medium by which it is made public discredits it  starkweather  trust gherst for more ability than that he will certainly exploit them in his newspapers but not until after knox has used them in his speech oh the cunning dog never could he have chosen a better mode and moment to strike at me at the administration at everything that is gherst all over playing to the gallery inducing knox to make this spectacular exposure on the floor of the house just at the critical time when so many important bills are pending  to dobleman  did martinaw give you any idea of the nature of the stolen documents  dobleman  referring to notes he has brought of course i dont know anything about it but he spoke of the goodyear letters  starkweather betrays by his face the gravity of the information  the caledonian letters all the black rider correspondence he mentioned too referring to notes the astonbury and glutz letters and there were others many others not designated  starkweather  this is terrible  recollecting himself  thank you dobleman will you please return to the house at once get new york again and fullest details ill follow you shortly have you a machine  dobleman  a taxi sir  starkweather  all right and be careful  dobleman makes exit  chalmers  i dont know the import of all these letters but i can guess and it does seem serious  starkweather  furiously serious let me tell you that there has been no exposure like this in the history of the country it means hundreds of millions of dollars it means morethe loss of power and still more it means the mob the great mass of the childminded people rising up and destroying all that i have labored to do for them oh the fools the fools  hubbard  shaking his head ominously there is no telling what may happen if knox makes that speech and delivers the proofs  chalmers  it is unfortunate the people are restless and excited as it is they are being constantly prodded on by the mouthings of the radical press of the muckraking magazines and of the demagogues the people are like powder awaiting the spark  starkweather  this man knox is no fool if he is a dreamer he is a shrewd knave he is a fighter he comes from the westthe old pioneer stock his father drove an oxteam across the plains to oregon he knows how to play his cards and never could circumstances have placed more advantageous cards in his hands  chalmers  and nothing like this has ever touched you before  starkweather  i have always stood above the muck and ruckclear and clean and unassailable but thisthis is too much it is the spark there is no forecasting what it may develop into  chalmers  a political turnover  starkweather  nodding savagely a new party a party of demagogues in power government ownership of the railways and telegraphs a graduated income tax that will mean no less than the confiscation of private capital  chalmers  and all that mass of radical legislationthe child labor bill the new employers liability act the government control of the alaskan coal fields that interference with mexico and that big power corporation you have worked so hard to form  starkweather  it must not be it is an unthinkable calamity it means that the very process of capitalistic development is hindered stopped it means a setback of ten years in the process it means work endless work to overcome the setback it means not alone the passage of all this radical legislation with the consequent disadvantages but it means the fingers of the mob clutching at our grip of control it means anarchy it means ruin and misery for all the blind fools and ledcattle of the mass who will strike at the very sources of their own existence and comfort  tommy enters from left evidently playing a game in the course of which he is running away by his actions he shows that he is pursued he intends to cross stage but is stopped by sight of the men unobserved by them he retraces his steps and crawls under the teatable  chalmers  without doubt knox is in possession of the letters right now  starkweather  there is but one thing to do and that isget them back  he looks questioningly at the two men  margaret enters from left in flushed and happy pursuit of tommyfor it is a game she is playing with him she startles at sight of the three men whom she first sees as she gains the side of the teatable where she pauses abruptly resting one hand on the table  hubbard  ill undertake it  starkweather  there is little time to waste in twenty hours from now he will be on the floor making his speech try mild measures first offer him inducementsany inducement i empower you to act for me you will find he has a price  hubbard  and if not  starkweather  then you must get them at any cost  hubbard  tentatively you mean  starkweather  i mean just that but no matter what happens i must never be brought in do you understand  hubbard  thoroughly  margaret  acting her part and speaking with assumed gayety what are you three conspiring about all three men are startled  chalmers  we are arranging to boost prices a little higher  hubbard  and so be able to accumulate more motorcars  starkweather  taking no notice of margaret and starting toward exit to rear i must be going hubbard you have your work cut out for you tom i want you to come with me  chalmers  as the three men move toward exit home  starkweather  yes we have much to do  chalmers  then ill dress first and follow you  turning to margaret pick me up on the way to that dinner  margaret nods starkweather makes exit without speaking hubbard says goodbye to margaret and makes exit followed by chalmers  margaret remains standing one hand resting on table the other hand to her breast she is thinking establishing in her mind the connection between knox and what she has overheard and in process of reaching the conclusion that knox is in danger  tommy having vainly waited to be discovered crawls out dispiritedly and takes margaret by the hand she scarcely notices him  tommy dolefully dont you want to play any more margaret does not reply i was a good indian  margaret  suddenly becoming aware of herself and breaking down she stoops and clasps tommy in her arms crying out in anxiety and fear and from love of her boy oh tommy tommy  curtain     act ii   scene sitting room of howard knoxdimly lighted time eight oclock in the evening  entrance from hallway at side to right at right rear is locked

fingering them curiously you are sure they are originals gifford nods  i cant take any chances you know if gherst changed his mind after i gave my speech and refused to show the originalssuch things have happened  gifford  thats what i told him he was firm on giving duplicates and for awhile it looked as if my trip to new york was wasted but i stuck to my guns it was originals or nothing with you i said and he finally gave in  knox  holding up documents i cant tell you what they mean to me nor how grateful  gifford  interrupting thats all right dont mention it gherst is wild for the chance it will do organized labor a heap of good and you are able to say your own say at the same time hows that compensation act coming on  knox  wearily the same old story it will never come before the house it is dying in committee what can you expect of the committee of judiciarycomposed as it is of exrailroad judges and exrailroad lawyers  gifford  the railroad brotherhoods are keen on getting that bill through  knox  well they wont and they never will until they learn to vote right when will your labor leaders quit the strike and boycott and lead your men to political action  gifford  holding out hand well so long ive got to trot and i havent time to tell you why i think political action would destroy the trade union movement  knox tosses documents on top of low bookcase between fireplace and bedroom door and starts to shake hands youre damn careless with those papers you wouldnt be if you knew how much gherst paid for them  gifford  you dont appreciate that other crowd it stops at nothing  knox  i wont take my eyes off of them and ill take them to bed with me tonight for safety besides there is no danger nobody but you knows i have them  gifford  proceeding toward door to right id hate to be in starkweathers office when he discovers whats happened therell be some bad half hours for somebody pausing at door give them hell tomorrow good and plenty im going to be in a gallery so long makes exit  knox crosses to windows which he opens returns to desk seats himself in revolving chair and begins opening his correspondence  a knock at door to right  knox  come in  hubbard enters advances to desk but does not shake hands they greet each other and hubbard sits down in chair to left of desk knox still holding an open letter revolves chair so as to face his visitor he waits for hubbabd to speak  hubbard  there is no use beating about the bush with a man like you i know that you are direct and so am i you know my position well enough to be assured that i am empowered to treat with you  knox  oh yes i know  hubbard  what we want is to have you friendly  knox  that is easy enough when the interests become upright and honest  hubbard  save that for your speech we are talking privately we can make it well worth your while  knox angrily if you think you can bribe me  hubbard suavely not at all not the slightest suspicion of it the point is this you are a congressman a congressmans career depends on his membership in good committees at the present you are buried in the dead committee on coinage weights and measures if you say the word you can be appointed to the livest committee  knox  interrupting you have these appointments to give  hubbard  surely else why should i be here it can be managed  knox  meditatively i thought our government was rotten enough but i never dreamed that house appointments were hawked around by the interests in this fashion  hubbard  you have not given your answer  knox  you should have known my answer in advance  hubbard  there is an alternative you are interested in social problems you are a student of sociology those whom i represent are genuinely interested in you we are prepared so that you may pursue your researches more deeplywe are prepared to send you to europe there in that vast sociological laboratory far from the jangling strife of politics you will have every opportunity to study we are prepared to send you for a period of ten years you will receive ten thousand dollars a year and in addition the day your steamer leaves new york you will receive a lump sum of one hundred thousand dollars  knox  and this is the way men are bought  hubbard  it is purely an educational matter  knox  now it is you who are beating about the bush  hubbard  decisively very well then what price do you set on yourself  knox  you want me to quitto leave politics everything you want to buy my soul  hubbard  more than that we want to buy those documents and letters  knox  showing a slight start what documents and letters  hubbard  you are beating around the bush in turn there is no need for an honest man to lie even  knox  interrupting to you  hubbard  smiling even to me i watched you closely when i mentioned the letters you gave yourself away you knew i meant the letters stolen by gherst from starkweathers private filesthe letters you intended using tomorrow  knox  intend using tomorrow  hubbard  precisely it is the same thing what is the price set it  knox  i have nothing to sell i am not on the market  hubbard  one moment dont make up your mind hastily you dont know with whom you have to deal those letters will not appear in your speech tomorrow take that from me it would be far wiser to sell for a fortune than to get nothing for them and at the same time not use them  a knock at door to right startles hubbard  knox  intending to say come in come  hubbard  interrupting hush dont i cannot be seen here  knox  laughing you fear the contamination of my company the knock is repeated  hubbard  in alarm rising as knox purses his lips to bid them enter dont let anybody in i dont want to be seen herewith you besides my presence will not put you in a good light  knox  also rising starting toward door what i do is always open to the world i see no one whom i should not permit the world to know i saw  knox starts toward door to open it hubbabd looking about him in alarm flees across stage and into bedroom closing the door during all the following scene hubbard from time to time opens door and peers out at what is going on  knox  opening door and recoiling margaret mrs chalmers  margaret enters followed by tommy and linda margaret is in evening dress covered by evening cloak  margaret  shaking hands with knox forgive me but i had to see you i could not get you on the telephone i called and called and the best i could do was to get the wrong number  knox  recovering from his astonishment yes i am glad  seeing tommy hello tommy  knox holds out his hand and tommy shakes it gravely linda stays in background her face is troubled  tommy  how do you do  margaret  there was no other way and it was so necessary for me to warn you i brought tommy and linda along to chaperon me  she looks curiously around room specially indicating filing cabinets and the stacks of government reports on table your laboratory  knox  ah if i were only as great a sociological wizard as edison is a wizard in physical sciences  margaret  but you are you labor more mightily than you admitor dare to think oh i know youbetter than you do yourself  tommy  do you read all those books  knox  yes i am still going to school and studying hard what are you going to study to be when you grow up  tommy meditates but does not answer  president of these great united states  tommy  shaking his head father says the president doesnt amount to much  knox  not a lincoln  tommy is in doubt  margaret  but dont you remember what a great good man lincoln was you remember i told you  tommy  shaking his head slowly but i dont want to be killedill tell you what  knox  what  tommy  i want to be a senator like father he makes them dance  margaret is shocked and knoxs eyes twinkle  knox  makes whom dance  tommy puzzled i dont know  with added confidence but he makes them dance just the same  margaret makes a signal to linda to take tommy across the room  linda  starting to cross stage to left come tommy let us look out of the window  tommy  id rather talk with mr knox  margaret  please do tommy mamma wants to talk to mr knox  tommy yields and crosses to right where he joins linda in looking out of the window  margaret  you might ask me to take a seat  knox  oh i beg pardon  he draws up a comfortable chair for her and seats himself in deskchair facing her  margaret  i have only a few minutes tom is at fathers and i am to pick him up there and go on to that dinner after ive taken tommy home  knox  but your maid  margaret  linda wild horses could not drag from her anything that she thought would harm me so intense is her fidelity that it almost shames me i do not deserve it but this is not what i came to you about  she speaks the following hurriedly after you left this afternoon something happened father received a telegram it seemed most important his secretary followed upon the heels of the telegram father called tom and mr hubbard to him and they held a conference i think they have discovered the loss of the documents and that they believe you have them i did not hear them mention your name yet i am absolutely certain that they were talking about you also i could tell from fathers face that something was terribly wrong oh be careful do be careful  knox  there is no danger i assure you  margaret  but you do not know them i tell you you do not know them they will stop at nothingat nothing father believes he is right in all that he does  knox  i know that is what makes him so formidable he has an ethical sanction  margaret  nodding it is his religion  knox  and like any religion with a narrowminded man it runs to mania  margaret  he believes that civilization rests on him and that it is his sacred duty to preserve civilization  knox  i know i know  margaret  but you but you you are in danger  knox  no i shall remain in tonight tomorrow in the broad light of midday i shall proceed to the house and give my speech  margaret  wildly oh if anything should happen to you  knox  looking at her searchingly you do care  margaret nods with eyes suddenly downcast for howard knox the reformer or for me the man  margaret  impulsively oh why must a woman forever remain quiet why should i not tell you what you already knowwhat you must already know i do care for youfor man and reformer bothfor  she is aflame but abruptly ceases and glances across at tommy by the window warned instinctively that she must not give way to love in her childs presence  linda will you take tommy down to the machine  knox  alarmed interrupting in low voice what are you doing  margaret  hushing knox with a gesture ill follow you right down  linda and tommy proceed across stage toward right exit  tommy  pausing before knox and gravely extending his hand good evening mr knox  knox  awkwardly good evening tommy you take my word for it and look up this lincoln question  tommy  i shall ill ask father about it  margaret  significantly you attend to that linda nobody must knowthis  linda nods  linda and tommy make exit to right  margaret seated slips back her cloak revealing herself in evening gown and looks at knox sumptuously lovingly and willingly  knox  inflamed by the sight of her dont dont i cant stand it such sight of you fills me with madness  margaret laughs low and triumphantly i dont want to think of you as a woman i must not allow me  he rises and attempts to draw cloak about her shoulders but she resists him yet does he succeed in partly cloaking her  margaret  i want you to see me as a woman i want you to think of me as a woman i want you mad for me  she holds out her arms the cloak slipping from them  i wantdont you see what i want  knox sinks back in chair attempting to shield his eyes with his hand  slipping cloak fully back from her again  look at me  knox  looking coming to his feet and approaching her with extended arms murmuring softly margaret margaret  margaret rises to meet him and they are clasped in each others arms  hubbard peering forth through door looks at them with an expression of cynical amusement his gaze wanders and he sees the documents within arms reach on top of bookcase he picks up documents holds them to the light of stage to glance at them and with triumphant expression on face disappears and closes door  knox  holding margaret from him and looking at her i love you i do love you but i had resolved never to speak it never to let you know  margaret  silly man i have known long that you loved me you have told me so often and in so many ways you could not look at me without telling me  knox  you saw  margaret  how could i help seeing i was a woman only with your voice you never spoke a word sit down there where i may look at you and let me tell you i shall do the speaking now  she urges him back into the deskchair and reseats herself she makes as if to pull the cloak around her shall i  knox  vehemently no no as you are let me feast my eyes upon you who are mine i must be dreaming  margaret  with a low satisfied laugh of triumph oh you men as of old and as forever you must be wooed through your senses did i display the wisdom of an hypatia the science of a madam curie yet would you keep your iron control throttling the voice of your heart with silence but let me for a moment be lilith for a moment lay aside this garment constructed for the purpose of keeping out the chill of night and on the instant you are fire and aflame all voluble with loves desire  knox  protestingly margaret it is not fair  margaret  i love youandyou  knox  fervently and reverently i love you  margaret  then listen i have told you of my girlhood and my dreams i wanted to do what you are so nobly doing and i did nothing i could do nothing i was not permitted always was i compelled to hold myself in check it was to do what you are doing that i married and that too failed me my husband became a henchman of the interests my own fathers tool for the perpetuation of the evils against which i desired to fight  she pauses it has been a long fight and i have been very tired for always did i confront failure my husbandi did not love him i never loved him i sold myself for the cause and the cause profited nothing pause often i have lost faithfaith in everything in god and man in the hope of any righteousness ever prevailing but again and again by what you are doing have you awakened me i came tonight with no thought of self i came to warn you to help the good work on i remainedthank godi remained to love youand to be loved by you i suddenly found myself looking at you very weary i wanted youyou more than anything in the world  she holds out her arms come to me i want younow  knox in an ecstacy comes to her he seats himself on the broad arm of the chair and is drawn into her arms  knox  but i have been tired at times i was very tired tonightand you came and now i am glad only glad  margaret  i have been wanton tonight i confess it i am proud of it but it was notprofessional it was the first time in my life almost do i regretalmost do i regret that i did not do it soonerit has been crowned with such success you have held me in your armsyour arms oh you will never know what that first embrace meant to me i am not a clod i am not iron nor stone i am a womana warm breathing woman  she rises and draws him to his feet  kiss me my dear lord and lover kiss me they embrace  knox  passionately looking about him wildly as if in search of something what shall we do  suddenly releasing her and sinking back in his own chair almost in collapse no it cannot be it is impossible oh why could we not have met long ago we would have worked together what a comradeship it would have been  margaret  but it is not too late  knox  i have no right to you  margaret  misunderstanding  my husband he has not been my husband for years he has no rights who but you whom i love has any rights  knox  no it is not that  snapping his fingers that for him  breaking down oh if i were only the man and not the reformer if i had no work to do  margaret  coming to the back of his chair and caressing his hair we can work together  knox  shaking his head under her fingers dont dont  she persists and lays her cheek against his you make it so hard you tempt me so  he rises suddenly takes her two hands in his leads her gently to her chair seats her and reseats himself in deskchair listen it is not your husband but i have no right to you nor have you a right to me  margaret  interrupting jealously and who but i has any right to you  knox  smiling sadly no it is not that there is no other woman you are the one woman for me but there are many others who have greater rights in me than you i have been chosen by two hundred thousand citizens to represent them in the congress of the united states and there are many more  he breaks off suddenly and looks at her at her arms and shoulders yes please cover them up help me not to forget  margaret does not obey there are many more who have rights in methe people all the people whose cause i have made mine the childrenthere are two million child laborers in these united states i cannot betray them i cannot steal my happiness from them this afternoon i talked of theft but would not this too be theft  margaret  sharply howard wake up has our happiness turned your head  knox  sadly almostand for a few wild moments quite there are all the children did i ever tell you of the tenement child who when asked how he knew when spring came answered when he saw the saloons put up their swing doors  margaret  irritated but what has all that to do with one man and one woman loving  knox  suppose we lovedyou and i suppose we loosed all the reins of our love what would happen you remember gorki the russian patriot when he came to new york aflame with passion for the russian revolution his purpose in visiting the land of liberty was to raise funds for that revolution and because his marriage to the woman he loved was not of the essentially legal sort worshiped by the shopkeepers and because the newspapers made a sensation of it his whole mission was brought to failure he was laughed and derided out of the esteem of the american people that is what would happen to me i should be slandered and laughed at my power would be gone  margaret  and even if sowhat of it be slandered and laughed at we will have each other other men will rise up to lead the people and leading the people is a thankless task life is so short we must clutch for the morsel of happiness that may be ours  knox  ah if you knew as i look into your eyes how easy it would be to throw everything to the winds but it would be theft  margaret  rebelliously let it be theft life is so short dear we are the biggest facts in the worldto each other  knox  it is not myself alone nor all my people a moment ago you said no one but i had any right to you you were wrong your child  margaret  in sudden pain pleadingly dont  knox  i must i must save myselfand you tommy has rights in you theft again what other name for it if you steal your happiness from him  margaret  bending her head forward on her hand and weeping i have been so lonelyand then youyou came and the world grew bright and warma few short minutes ago you held mein your armsa few short minutes ago and it seemed my dream of happiness had come trueand now you dash it from me  knox  struggling to control himself now that she is no longer looking at him no i ask you to dash it from yourself i am not too strong you must help me you must call your child to your aid in helping me i could go mad for you now  rising impulsively and coming to her with arms outstretched to clasp her right now  margaret  abruptly raising her head and with one outstretched arm preventing the embrace wait  she bows her head on her hand for a moment to think and to win control of herself  lifting her head and looking at him sit downplease  knox reseats himself  a pause during which she looks at him and loves him dear i do so love you  knox loses control and starts to rise no sit there i was weak yet i am not sorry you are right we must forego each other we cannot be thieves even for loves sake yet i am glad that this has happenedthat i have lain in your arms and had your lips on mine the memory of it will be sweet always  she draws her cloak around her and rises  knox rises you are right the future belongs to the children there lies dutyyours and mine in my small way i am going now we must not see each other ever again we must workand forget but remember my heart goes with you into the fight my prayers will accompany every stroke  she hesitates pauses draws her cloak thoroughly around her in evidence of departure dearwill you kiss meonceone last time there is no passion in this kiss which is the kiss of renunciation margaret herself terminates the embrace  knox accompanies her silently to the door and places hand on knob i wish i had something of you to have with me alwaysa photograph that little one you remember which i liked so she nods dont run the risk of sending it by messenger just mail it ordinarily  margaret  i shall mail it tomorrow ill drop it in the box myself  knox  kissing her hand goodbye  margaret  lingeringly but oh my dear i am glad and proud for what has happened i would not erase a single line of it  she indicates for knox to open door which he does but which he immediately closes as she continues speaking there must be immortality there must be a future life where you and i shall meet again goodbye  they press each others hands  exit margaret  knox stands a moment staring at closed door turns and looks about him indecisively sees chair in which margaret sat goes over to it kneels down and buries his face  door to bedroom opens slowly and hubbard peers out cautiously he cannot see knox  hubbard  advancing surprised what the deuce everybody gone  knox  startled to his feet where the devil did you come from  hubbard  indicating bedroom in there i was in there all the time  knox  endeavoring to pass it off oh i had forgotten about you well my callers are gone  hubbard  walking over close to him and laughing at him with affected amusement honest men are such dubs when they do go wrong  knox  the door was closed all the time you would not have dared to spy upon me  hubbard  there was something familiar about the ladys voice  knox  you heardwhat did you hear  hubbard  oh nothing nothinga murmur of voicesand the womansi could swear i have heard her voice before  knox shows his relief well so long  starts to move toward exit to right you wont reconsider your decision  knox  shaking his head  hubbard  pausing open door in hand and laughing cynically and yet it was but a moment ago that it seemed i heard you say there was no one whom you would not permit the world to know you saw  starting what do you mean  hubbard  goodbye  hubbard makes exit and closes door knox wanders aimlessly to his desk glances at the letter he was reading of which had been interrupted by hubbards entry of first act suddenly recollects the package of documents and walks to low bookcase and looks on top  knox  stunned the thief  he looks about him wildly then rushes like a madman in pursuit of hubbard making exit to right and leaving the door hying open empty stage

heartily i can only tell you that what you did was wonderful your telephone last night was a great relief where are they  hubbard  drawing package of documents from inside breast pocket and handing them over there they arethe complete set i was fortunate  starkweather  opening package and glancing at a number of the documents while he talks you are modest mr hubbardit required morethan fortuneit required abilityof no mean orderthe time was shortyou had to thinkand actwith too great immediacy to be merely fortunate  hubbard bows while starkweather rearranges package  there is no need for me to tell you how i appreciate your service i have increased my subscription to cartwrights to fifty thousand and i shall speak to dobleman who will remit to you a more substantial acknowledgment than my mere thanks for the inestimable service you have rendered  hubbard bows  youahyou have read the documents  hubbard  i glanced through them they were indeed serious but we have spiked knoxs guns without them that speech of his this afternoon becomes a farcea howling farce be sure you take good care of them  indicating documents which starkweather still holds gherst has a long arm  starkweather  he cannot reach me here besides i go to new york today and i shall carry them with me mr hubbard you will forgive me  starting to pack dispatch box with papers and letters lying on desk i am very busy  hubbard  taking the hint yes i understand i shall be going now i have to be at the club in five minutes  starkweather  in course of packing dispatch box he sets certain packets of papers and several mediumsized account books to one side in an orderly pile he talks while he packs and hubbard waits i should like to talk with you some morein new york next time you are in town be sure to see me i am thinking of buying the parthenon magazine and of changing its policy i should like to have you negotiate this and there are other important things as well good day mr hubbard i shall see you in new yorksoon  hubbard and starkweather shake hands  hubbard starts to make exit to right rear  margaret enters from right rear  starkweather goes on packing dispatch box through following scene  hubbard  mrs chalmers  holding out hand which margaret takes very coldly scarcely inclining her head and starting to pass on speaking suddenly and savagely you neednt be so high and lofty mrs chalmers  margaret  pausing and looking at him curiously as if to ascertain whether he has been drinking i do not understand  hubbard  you always treated me this way but the time for it is past i wont stand for your superior goodness any more you really impressed me with it for a long time and you made me walk small but i know better now a pretty game youve been playingyou who are like any other woman well you know where you were last night so do i  margaret  you are impudent  hubbard  doggedly i said i knew where you were last night mr knox also knows where you were but ill wager your husband doesnt  margaret  you spy  indicating her father i suppose you have toldhim  hubbard  why should i  margaret  you are his creature  hubbard  if it will ease your suspense let me tell you that i have not told him but i do protest to you that you must treat me with moremore kindness  margaret makes no sign but passes on utterly oblivious of him hubbard stares angrily at her and makes exit starkweather who is finishing packing puts the documents last inside box and closes and locks it to one side is the orderly stack of the several account books and packets of papers  starkweather  good morning margaret i sent for you because we did not finish that talk last night sit down  she gets a chair for herself and sits down  you always were hard to manage margaret you have had too much will for a woman yet i did my best for you your marriage with tom was especially auspiciousa rising man of good family and a gentleman eminently suitable  margaret  interrupting bitterly i dont think you were considering your daughter at all in the matter i know your views on woman and womans place i have never counted for anything with you neither has mother nor connie when business was uppermost and business always is uppermost with you i sometimes wonder if you think a woman has a soul as for my marriageyou saw that tom could be useful to you he had the various distinctive points you have mentioned better than that he was pliable capable of being molded to perform your work to manipulate machine politics and procure for you the legislation you desired you did not consider what kind of a husband he would make for your daughter whom you did not know but you gave your daughter to himsold her to himbecause you needed him  laughs hysterically in your business  starkweather  angrily margaret you must not speak that way relaxing  ah you do not change you were always that way always bent on having your will  margaret  would to god i had been more successful in having it  starkweather  testily this is all beside the question i sent for you to tell you that this must stopthis association with a man of the type and character of knoxa dreamer a charlatan a scoundrel  margaret  it is not necessary to abuse him  starkweather  it must stopthat is all do you understand it must stop  margaret  quietly it has stopped i doubt that i shall ever see him again he will never come to my house again at any rate are you satisfied  starkweather  perfectly of course you know i have never doubted youthatthat way  margaret  quietly how little you know women in your comprehension we are automatons puppets with no hearts nor heats of desire of our own with no springs of conduct save those of the immaculate and puritanical sort that new england crystallized a century or so ago  starkweather  suspiciously you mean that you and this man  margaret  i mean nothing has passed between us i mean that i am toms wife and tommys mother what i did mean you have no more understood than you understand meor any woman  starkweather  relieved it is well  margaret  continuing and it is so easy the concept is simple a woman is human that is all yet i do believe it is news to you  enters dobleman from right carrying a check in his hand starkweather about to speak pauses dobleman hesitates and starkweather nods for him to advance  dobleman  greeting margaret and addressing starkweather this check you said you would sign it yourself  starkweather  yes that is rutlands looks for pen  dobleman offers his fountain pen no my own pen  unlocks dispatch box gets pen and signs check leaves dispatch box open dobleman takes check and makes exit to right  starkweather  picking up documents from top of pile in open box  this man knox i studied him yesterday a man of great energy and ideals unfortunately he is a sentimentalist he means righti grant him that but he does not understand practical conditions he is more dangerous to the welfare of the united states than ten thousand

houran hourany length of time your shameful minds dictate that will do linda you can go  starkweather  no you dont stand over there to one side  to the others the papers are in this room and i shall keep my mind certain on that point  hubbard  i think i have shown the motive  connie  you are a beast  chalmers  you havent told what you saw  hubbard  i saw them in each others armsseveral times then i found the stolen documents where knox had thrown them down so i pocketed them and closed the door  chalmers  how long after that did they remain together  hubbard  quite a time quite a long time  chalmers  and when you last saw them  hubbard  they were in each others armsquite enthusiastically i may say in each others arms chalmers is crushed  margaret  to hubbard you coward  hubbard smiles  to starkweather when are you going to call off this hound of yours  starkweather  when i get the papers you see what youve been made to pay for them already now listen to me closely tom you listen too

believed besides more heinous than your relations with this man is what you have done here in this room stolen from me and practically before my very eyes well you have crossed your will with mine and in affairs beyond your province this is a mans game in which you are attempting to play and you shall take the consequences tom will apply for a divorce  margaret  that threat at least is without power  starkweather  and by that means we can break knox as effectually as by any other that is one thing the good stupid people will not tolerate in a chosen representative we will make such a scandal of it  mrs starkweather  shocked anthony  starkweather  glancing irritably at his wife and continuing another thing being proven an adulterous woman morally unfit for companionship with your child your child will be taken away from you  margaret  no no that cannot be i have done nothing wrong no court no fairminded judge would so decree on the evidence of a creature like that  indicating hubbard  hubbard  my evidence is supported in an adjoining room were two men i happen to know because i placed them there they were your fathers men at that there is such a thing as seeing through a locked door they saw  margaret  and they would swear toto anything  hubbard  i doubt not they will know to what to swear  starkweather  margaret i have told you some merely some of the things i shall do it is not too late return the papers and everything will be forgotten  margaret  you would condone thisthis adultery you who have just said that i was morally unfit to have my own boy will permit me to retain him i had never dreamed father that your own immorality would descend to such vile depths believing this shameful thing of me you will forgive and forget it all for the sake of a few scraps of paper that stand for money that stand for a license to rob and steal from the people is this your moralitymoney  starkweather  i have my morality it is not money i am only a steward but so highly do i conceive the duties of my stewardship  margaret  interrupting bitterly the thefts and lies and all common little sins like adulteries are not to stand in the way of your high dutiesthat the end hallows the means  starkweather  shortly precisely  margaret  to rutland there is jesuitism mr rutland i would suggest that you as my fathers spiritual adviser  starkweather  enough of this foolery give me the papers  margaret  i havent them  starkweather  whats to be done hubbard  hubbard  she has them she has as much as acknowledged that they are not elsewhere in the room she has not

in a proper funk but hubbard betrays no unwillingness  chalmers  no that i shall not permit hubbard shall have nothing to do with this  margaret  it is too late tom you have stood by and allowed me to be stripped of everything else a few clothes do not matter now if i am to be stripped and searched by men mr hubbard will serve as well as any other man perhaps mr rutland would like to lend his assistance  connie  oh madge give them up  margaret shakes her head  to starkweather then let me search her father  starkweather  you are too willing i dont want volunteers i doubt that i can trust you any more than your sister  connie  let mother then  starkweather  sneering margaret could smuggle a steamertrunk of documents past her  connie  but not the men father not the men  starkweather

of her goes to right front  a knock at right rear and dobleman unlocks door confers with maid and closes and locks door  starkweather  to margaret this is no time for trifling nor for mawkish sentimentality return the papers or take the consequences  margaret makes no answer  chalmers  you have taken a hand in a mans game and youve got to play it out or quit give up the papers  margaret remains resolved and impassive  hubbard  suavely allow me to point out my dear mrs chalmers that you are not merely stealing from your father you are playing the traitor to your class  starkweather  and causing irreparable damage  margaret  firing up suddenly and pointing to lincolns portrait i doubt not he caused irreparable damage when he freed the slaves and preserved the union yet he recognized no classes id rather be a traitor to my class than to him  starkweather  demagoguery demagoguery  a knock at right rear dobleman opens door enter mrs middleton who is the housekeeper

ever to forget whence it came mrs middleton go ahead  housekeeper summoning maids with her eyes begins to advance on margaret  connie  in a passion father if you do this i shall never speak to you

middleton proceed  margaret  wildly backing away from housekeeper i will not tamely submit i will resist i promise you  starkweather  use force if necessary  the maids are reluctant but housekeeper commands them with her eyes to close in on margaret and they obey  margaret backs away until she brings up against desk  housekeeper  come mrs chalmers  margaret stands trembling but refuses to notice housekeeper housekeeper places hand on margarets arm  margaret  violently flinging the hand off crying imperiously stand back  housekeeper instinctively shrinks back as do maids but it is only for the moment they close in upon margaret to seise her  crying frantically for help linda linda  linda springs forward to help her mistress but is caught and held struggling by chalmers who twists her arm and finally compels her to become quiet  margaret struggling and resisting is hustled across stage and behind screen the maids warming up to their work one of them emerges from behind screen for the purpose of getting a chair upon which margaret is evidently forced to sit the screen is of such height that occasionally when standing up and struggling margarets bare arms are visible above the top of it muttered exclamations are heard and the voice of housekeeper trying to persuade margaret to submit  margaret  abruptly piteously no no  the struggle becomes more violent and the screen is overturned disclosing margaret seated on chair partly undressed and clutching an envelope in her hand which they are trying to force her to relinquish  mrs starkweather  crying wildly anthony they are taking her clothes off  renewed struggle of linda with chalmers at the sight  starkweather calling rutland to his assistance stands screen up again then as an afterthought pulls screen a little further away from margaret  margaret  no no  housekeeper appears triumphantly with envelope in her hand and hands it to hubbard  hubbard  immediately thats not it  glances at address and starts its addressed to knox  starkweather  tear it open read it  hubbard tears envelope open while this is going on struggle behind screen is suspended  hubbard  withdrawing contents of envelope it is only a photographof mrs chalmers  reading for the futuremargaret  chalmers  thrusting linda back to right front and striding up to hubbard give it to me hubbard passes it to him and he looks at it crumples it in his hand and grinds it under foot  starkweather  that is not what we wanted mrs middleton go on with the search  the search goes on behind the screen without any further struggling a pause during which screen is occasionally agitated by the searchers removing margarets garments  housekeeper  appearing around corner of screen i find nothing else sir  starkweather  is she stripped  housekeeper  yes sir  starkweather  every stitch  housekeeper  disappearing behind screen instead of answering for a pause during which it is patent that the ultimate stitch is being removed then reappearing yes sir  starkweather  nothing  housekeeper  nothing  starkweather  throw out her clotheseverything  a confused mass of feminine apparel is tossed out falling near doblemans feet who in consequence is hugely mortified and embarrassed  chalmers examines garments then steps behind screen a moment and reappears  chalmers  nothing  chalmers starkweather and hubbard gaze at each other dumbfoundedly  the two maids come out from behind screen and stand near door to right rear  starkweather is loath to believe and steps to margarets garments and overhauls them  starkweather  to

what i saw last night at his rooms there is no other explanation  chalmers  angrily and thats the sort he isvaunting his moral superioritymouthing phrases about theftour theftand himself the greatest thief of all stealing the dearest and sacredest things  margaret appears from behind screen pinning on her hat she is dressed but somewhat in disarray and linda follows pulling and touching and arranging margaret pauses near to rutland but does not seem to see him  rutland  lamely it is a sad happeningahema sad happening i am grieved deeply grieved i cannot tell you mrs chalmers how grieved i am to have been compelled to be present at thisahemthis unfortunate  margaret withers him with a look and he awkwardly ceases  margaret  after this father there is one thing i shall do  chalmers  interrupting go to your lover i suppose  margaret coldly have it that way if you choose  chalmers  and take him what you have stolen  starkweather  arousing suddenly from brown study but she hasnt them on her she hasnt been out of the room they are not in the room then where are they  during the following margaret goes to the door which dobleman opens she forces linda to go out and herself pauses in open door to listen  hubbard  uttering an exclamation of enlightenment going rapidly across to window at left and raising it it is not locked it moves noiselessly theres the explanation  to starkweather while you were at the safe with your back turned she lifted the window tossed the papers out to somebody waiting  he sticks head and shoulders out of window peers down then brings head and shoulders backno they are not there somebody was waiting for them  starkweather  but how should she know i had them you had only just recovered them  hubbard  didnt knox know right away last night that i had taken them i took the upelevator instead of the down when i heard him running along the hall trust him to let her know what had happened she was the only one who could recover them for him else why did she come here so immediately this morning to steal the package of course and she had some one waiting outside she tossed them out and closed the window  he closes windowyou notice it makes no soundand sat down againall while your back was turned  starkweather  margaret is this true  margaret  excitedly yes the window why didnt you think of it before of course the window hesomebody was waiting they are gone nowmiles and miles away you will never get them they are in his hands now he will use them in his speech this afternoon laughs wildly  suddenly changing her tone to mock meekness subtle with defiance may i gonow  nobody answers and she makes exit a moments pause during which starkweather chalmers and hubbard look at each other in stupefaction     act iv  scene same as act i it is half past one of same day curtain discloses knox seated at right front and waiting he is dejected in attitude  margaret enters from right rear and advances to him he rises awkwardly and shakes hands she is very calm and selfpossessed  margaret  i knew you would come strange that i had to send for you so soon after last night  with alarm and sudden change of manner what is the matter you are sick your hand is cold  she warms it in both of her hands  knox  it is flame or freeze with me  smiling and id rather flame  margaret  becoming aware that she is warming his hand  sit down and tell me what is the matter  leading him by the hand she seats him at the same time seating herself  knox  abruptly after you left last night hubbard stole those documents back again  margaret  very matteroffact yes he was in your bedroom while i was there  knox  startled how do you know that anyway he did not know who you were  margaret  oh yes he did  knox  angrily and he has dared  margaret  yes not two hours ago he announced the fact before my father my mother connie the servants everybody  knox  rising to his feet and beginning to pace perturbedly up and down the cur  margaret quietly i believe among other things i told him he was that myself  she laughs cynically oh it was a pretty family party i assure you mother said she didnt believe itbut that was only hysteria of course she believes itthe worst so does connieeverybody  knox  stopping abruptly and looking at her horrorstricken you dont mean they charged  margaret  no i dont mean that i mean more they didnt charge they accepted it as a proven fact that i was guilty that you were mylover  knox  on that mans testimony  margaret  he had two witnesses in an adjoining room  knox  relieved all the better they can testify to nothing more than the truth and the truth is not serious in our case it is good for we renounced each other  margaret  you dont know these men it is easy to guess that they have been well trained they would swear to anything  she laughs bitterly they are my fathers men you know his paid sleuthhounds  knox  collapsing in chair holding head in hands and groaning how you must have suffered what a terrible time what a terrible time i can see it allbefore everybodyyour nearest and dearest ah i could not understand after our parting last night why you should have sent for me today but now i know  margaret  no you dont at all  knox  ignoring her and again beginning to pace back and forth thinking on his feet whats the difference i am ruined politically their scheme has worked out only too well gifford warned me you warned me everybody warned me but i was a fool blindwith a fools folly there is nothing left but you now  he pauses and the light of a new thought irradiates his face do you know margaret i thank god it has happened as it has what if my usefulness is destroyed there will be other menother leaders i but make way for another the cause of the people can never be lost and though i am driven from the fight i am driven to you we are driven together it is fate again i thank god for it  he approaches her and tries to clasp her in his arms but she steps back  margaret  smiling sadly ah now you flame the tables are reversed last night it was i we are fortunate that we choose diverse times for our moodselse there would be naught but one sweet melting mad disaster  knox  but it is not as if we had done this thing deliberately and selfishly we have renounced we have struggled against it until we were beaten and now we are driven together not by our doing but fates after this affair this morning there is nothing for you but to come to me and as for me despite my best i am finished i have failed as i told you the papers are stolen there will be no speech this afternoon  margaret  quietly yes there will  knox  impossible i would make a triple fool of myself i would be unable to substantiate my charges  margaret  you will substantiate them what a chain of theft it is my father steals from the people the documents that prove his stealing are stolen by gherst hubbard steals them from you and returns them to my father and i steal them from my father and pass them back to you  knox astounded youyou  margaret  yes this very morning that was the cause of all the trouble if i hadnt stolen them nothing would have happened hubbard had just returned them to my father  knox  profoundly touched and you did this for me  margaret  dear man i didnt do it for you i wasnt brave enough i should have given in i dont mind confessing that i started to do it for you but it soon grew so terrible that i was afraid it grew so terrible that had it been for you alone i should have surrendered but out of the terror of it all i caught a wider vision and all that you said last night rose before me and i knew that you were right i thought of all the people and of the little children i did it for them after all you speak for them i stole the papers so that you could use them in speaking for the people dont you see dear man  changing to angry recollection do you know what they cost me do you know what was done to me today this morning in my fathers house i was shamed humiliated as i would never have dreamed it possible do you know what they did to me the servants were called in and by them i was stripped before everybodymy family hubbard the reverend mr rutland the secretary everybody  knox  stunned strippedyou  margaret  every stitch my father commanded it  knox  suddenly visioning the scene my god  margaret  recovering herself and speaking cynically with a laugh at his shocked face no it was not so bad as that there was a screen  knox appears somewhat relieved but it fell down in the midst of the struggle  knox  but in heavens name why was this done to you  margaret  searching for the lost letters they knew i had taken them  speaking gravely  so you see i have earned those papers and i have earned the right to say what shall be done with them i shall give them to you and you will use them in your speech this afternoon  knox  i dont want them  margaret  going to bell and ringing oh yes you do they are more valuable right now than anything else in the world  knox  shaking his head i wish it hadnt happened  margaret  returning to him pausing by his chair and caressing his hair what  knox  this morningyour recovering the letters i had adjusted myself to their loss and the loss of the fight and the finding ofyou  he reaches up draws down her hand and presses it to his lips sogive them back to your father  margaret draws quickly away from him enter manservant at right rear  margaret  send linda to me  exit manservant  knox  what are you doing  margaret  sitting down i am going to send linda for them they are still in my fathers house hidden of all places behind lincolns portrait he will guard them safely i know  knox  with fervor margaret margaret dont send for them let them go i dont want them  rising and going toward her impulsively margaret rises and retreats holding him off i want youyouyou  he catches her hand and kisses it she tears it away from him but tenderly  margaret  still retreating roguishly and tenderly dear dear man i love to see you so but it cannot be  looking anxiously toward right rear no no please please sit down  enter linda from right rear she is dressed for the street  margaret  surprised where are you going  linda  tommy and the nurse and i were going down town there is some shopping she wants to do  margaret  very good but go first to my fathers house listen closely in the library behind the portrait of lincolnyou know it linda nods  you will find a packet of papers it took me five seconds to put it there it will take you no longer to get it let no one see you let it appear as though you had brought tommy to see his grandmother and cheer her up you know she is not feeling very well just now after you get the papers leave tommy there and bring them immediately back to me step on a chair to the ledge of the bookcase and reach behind the portrait you should be back inside fifteen minutes take the car  linda  tommy and the nurse are already in it waiting for me  margaret  be careful be quick  linda nods to each instruction and makes exit  knox  bursting out passionately this is madness you are sacrificing yourself and me i dont want them i want you i am tired what does anything matter except love i have pursued ideals long enough now i want you  margaret  gravely ah there you have expressed the pith of it you will now forsake ideals for mehe attempts to interrupt no no not that i am less than an ideal i have no silly vanity that way but i want you to remain ideal and you can only by going onnot by being turned back anybody can play the coward and assert they are fatigued i could not love a coward it was your strength that saved us last night i could not have loved you as i do now had you been weak last night you can only keep my love  knox  interrupting bitterly by foregoing itfor an ideal margaret what is the biggest thing in the world love there is the greatest ideal of all  margaret  playfully love of man and woman  knox  what else  margaret  gravely there is one thing greaterlove of man for his fellowman  knox  oh how you turn my preachments back on me it is a lesson nevermore shall i preach henceforth  margaret  yes  chalmers enters unobserved at left pauses and looks on  knox  henceforth i love listen  margaret  you are overwrought it will pass and you will see your path straight before you and know that i am right you cannot run away from the fight  knox  i canand will i want you and you want methe mans and womans need for each other come go with menow let us snatch at happiness while we may  he arises approaches her and gets her hand in his she becomes more complaisant and instead of repulsing him is willing to listen and receive as i have said the fight will go on just the same scores of men better men stronger men than i will rise to take my place why do i talk this way because i love you love you love you nothing else exists in all the world but love of you  margaret  melting and wavering ah you flame you flame  chalmers utters an inarticulate cry of rage and rushes forward at knox  margaret and knox are startled by the cry and discover chalmers presence  margaret  confronting chalmers and thrusting him slightly back from knox and continuing to hold him off from knox no tom no dramatics please this excitement of yours is only automatic and conventional you really dont mean it you dont even feel it you do it because it is expected of you and because it is your training besides it is bad for your heart remember dr wests warning  chalmers making an unusually violent effort to get at knox suddenly staggers weakly back signs of pain on his face holding a hand convulsively clasped over his heart margaret catches him and supports him to a chair into which he collapses  chalmers  muttering weakly my heart my heart  knox  approaching can i do anything  margaret  calmly no it is all right he will be better presently  she is bending over chalmers her hand on his wrist when suddenly as a sign he is recovering he violently flings her hand off and straightens up  knox  undecidedly i shall go now  margaret  no you will wait until linda comes back besides you cant run away from this and leave me alone to face it  knox  hurt showing that he will stay i am not a coward  chalmers  in a stifled voice that grows stronger yes wait i have a word for you  he pauses a moment and when he speaks again his voice is all right  witheringly a nice specimen of a reformer i must say you who babbled yesterday about theft the most high righteous and noble ali baba who has come into the den of thieves and who is also a thief  mimicking margaret ah you flame you flame  in his natural voice i should call you you thief you thief you wifestealer you  margaret  coolly i should scarcely call it theft  chalmers  sneeringly yes i forgot you mean it is not theft for him to take what already belongs to him  margaret  not quite thatbut in taking what has been freely offered to him  chalmers  you mean you have so forgotten your womanhood as to offer  margaret  just that last night and mr knox did himself the honor of refusing me  knox  bursting forth you see nothing else remains margaret  chalmers  twittingly ah margaret  knox  ignoring him the situation is intolerable  chalmers  emphatically it is intolerable dont you think you had better leave this house every moment of your presence dishonors it  margaret  dont talk of honor tom  chalmers  i make no excuses for myself i fancy i never fooled you very much but at any rate i never used my own house for such purposes  knox  springing at him you cur  margaret  interposing no dont his heart  chalmers  mimicking margaret no dramatics please  margaret  plaintively looking from one man to the other men are so strangely and wonderfully made what am i to do with the pair of you why wont you reason together like rational human beings  chalmers  bitterly gay rising to his feet yes let us come and reason together be rational sit down and talk it over like civilized humans this is not the stone age be reassured mr knox i wont brain you margaret  indicating chair sit down mr knox  indicating chair sit down  all three seat themselves in a triangle behold the problemthe ever ancient and ever young triangle of the playwright and the short story writertwo men and a woman  knox  true and yet not true the triangle is incomplete only one of the two men loves the woman  chalmers  yes  knox  and i am that man  chalmers  i fancy youre right  nodding his head but how about the woman  margaret  she loves one of the two men  knox  and what are you going to do about it  chalmers  judicially she has not yet indicated the man  margaret is about to indicate knox be careful madge remember who is tommys father  margaret  tom honestly remembering what the last years have been can you imagine that i love you  chalmers  im afraid ive noternot flamed sufficiently  margaret  you have possibly spoken nearer the truth than you dreamed i married you tom hoping great things of you i hoped you would be a power for good  chalmers  politics again when will women learn they must leave politics alone  margaret  and also i hoped for love i knew you didnt love me when we married but i hoped for it to come  chalmers  andermay i be permitted to ask if you loved me  margaret  no but i hoped that too would come  chalmers  it was then all a mistake  margaret  yes yours and mine and my fathers  knox  we have sat down to reason this out and we get nowhere margaret and i love each other your triangle breaks  chalmers  it isnt a triangle after all you forget tommy  knox petulantly make it foursided then but let us come to some conclusion  chalmers reflecting ah it is more than that there is a fifth side there are the stolen letters which madge has just this morning restolen from her father whatever settlement takes place they must enter into it  changing his tone look here madge i am a fool let us talk sensibly you and knox and i knox you want my wife you can have heron one consideration madge you want knox you can have him on one consideration the same consideration give up the letters and well forget everything  margaret  everything  chalmers  everything forgive and forget you know  margaret  you will forgive myithisthis adultery  chalmers  doggedly ill forgive anything for the letters ive played fast and loose with you madge and i fancy your playing fast and loose only evens things up return the letters and you can go with knox quietly ill see to that there wont be a breath of scandal ill give you a divorce or you can stay on with me if you want to i dont care what i want is the letters is it agreed  margaret seems to hesitate  knox  pleadingly margaret  margaret  chalmers testily am i not giving you each other what more do you want tommy stays with me if you want tommy then stay with me but you must give up the letters  margaret  i shall not go with mr knox i shall not give up the letters i shall remain with tommy  chalmers  so far as i am concerned knox doesnt count in this i want the letters and i want tommy if you dont give them up ill divorce you on statutory grounds and no woman so divorced can keep her child in any event i shall keep tommy  margaret  speaking steadily and positively listen tom and you too howard i have never for a moment entertained the thought of giving up the letters i may have led you to think so but i wanted to see just how low you tom could sink i saw how low youall of youthis morning sank i have learnedmuch where is this fine honor tom which put you on a mankilling rage a moment ago youll barter it all for a few scraps of paper and forgive and forget adultery which does not exist  chalmers laughs skepticallythough i know when i say it you will not believe me at any rate i shall not give up the letters not if you do take tommy away from me not even for tommy will i sacrifice all the people as i told you this morning there are two million tommys childlaborers all who cannot be sacrificed for tommys sake or anybodys sake  chalmers shrugs his shoulders and smiles in ridicule  knox  surely margaret there is a way out for us give up the letters what are theyonly scraps of paper why match them against happinessour happiness  margaret  but as you told me yourself those scraps of paper represent the happiness of millions of lives it is not our happiness that is matched against some scraps of paper it is our happiness against millions of liveslike ours all these millions have hearts and loves and desires just like ours  knox  but it is a great social and cosmic process it does not depend on one man kill off at this instant every leader of the people and the process will go on just the same the people will come into their own theft will be unseated it is destiny it is the process nothing can stop it  margaret  but it can be retarded  knox  you and i are no more than straws in relation to it we cannot stop it any more than straws can stop an ocean tide we mean nothingexcept to each other and to each other we mean all the world  margaret  sadly and tenderly all the world and immortality thrown in  chalmers  breaking in nice situation sitting here and listening to a strange man woo my wife in terms of sociology and scientific slang  both margaret and knox ignore him  knox  dear i want you so  margaret  despairingly oh it is so hard to do right  knox  eagerly he wants the letters very badly give them up for tommy he will give tommy for them  chalmers  no emphatically no if she wants tommy she can stay on but she must give up the letters if she wants you she may go but she must give up the letters  knox  pleading for a decision margaret  margaret  howard dont tempt me and press me it is hard enough as it is  chalmers  standing up ive had enough of this the thing must be settled and i leave it to you knox go on with your lovemaking but i wont be a witness to it perhaps ierretard theerthe flame process you two must make up your minds and you can do it better without me i am going to get a drink and settle my nerves ill be back in a minute  he moves toward exit to right she will yield knox be warm be warm  pausing in doorway ah you flame flame to some purpose exit chalmers  knox rests his head despairingly on his hand and margaret pausing and looking at him sadly for a moment crosses to him stands beside him and caresses his hair  margaret  it is hard i know dear and it is hard for me as well  knox  it is so unnecessary  margaret  no it is necessary what you said last night when i was weak was wise we cannot steal from my child  knox  but if he gives you tommy margaret  shaking her head nor can we steal from any other womans childfrom all the children of all the women and other things i heard you say and you were right we cannot live by ourselves alone we are social animals our good and our illall is tied up with all humanity  knox  catching her hand and caressing it i do not follow you i hear your voice but i do not know a word you say because i am loving your voiceand you i am so filled with love that there is no room for anything else and you who yesterday were so remote and unattainable are so near and possible so immediately possible all you have to do is to say the word one little word say itsay it  he carries her hand to his lips and holds it there  margaret  wistfully i should like to i should like to but i cant  knox  you must  margaret  there are other and greater things that say must to me oh my dear have you forgotten them things you yourself have spoken to methe great stinging things of the spirit that are greater than you and i greater even than our love  knox  i exhaust my argumentsbut still i love you  margaret  and i love you for it  chalmers enters from right and sees margaret still caressing knoxs hair  chalmers  with mild elation touched with sarcasm ah i see you have taken my advice and reached a decision  they do not answer margaret moves slowly away and seats herself knox remains with head bowed on hand no  margaret shakes her head well ive thought it over and ive changed my terms madge go with knox take tommy with you  margaret wavers but knox head bowed on hand does not see her there will be no scandal ill give you a proper divorce and you can have tommy  knox  suddenly raising his head joyfully pleadingly margaret  margaret is swayed but does not speak  chalmers  you and i never hit it off together any too extraordinarily well madge but im not altogether a bad sort i am easygoing i always have been easygoing ill make everything easy for you now but you see the fix i am in you love another man and i simply must regain those letters it is more important than you realize  margaret  incisively you make me realize how important those letters are  knox  give him the letters margaret  chalmers  so she hasnt turned them over to you yet  margaret  no i still have them  knox  give them to him  chalmers  selling out for a petticoat a pretty reformer  knox proudly  a better lover  margaret  to chalmers  he is weak today what of it he was strong last night he will win back his strength again it is human to be weak and in his very weakness now i have my pride for it is the weakness of love god knows i have been weak and i am not ashamed of it it was the weakness of love it is hard to stifle ones womanhood always with morality quickly  but do not mistake tom this of mine is no conventional morality i do not care about nasty gossipy tongues and sensationmongering sheets nor do i care what any persons of all the persons i know would say if i went away with mr knox this instant i would go and go gladly and proudly with him divorce or no divorce scandal or scandal triplefoldifif no one else were hurt by what i did to knox  howard i tell you that i would go with you now in all willingness and joy with maytime and the songs of all singing birds in my heartwere it not for the others but there is a higher morality we must not hurt those others we dare not steal our happiness from them the future belongs to them and we must not dare not sacrifice that future nor give it in pledge for our own happiness last night i came to you i was weakyes more than thati was ignorant i did not know even as late as last night the monstrous vileness the consummate wickedness of presentday conditions i learned that today this morning and now i learned that the morality of the church was a pretense far deeper than it and vastly more powerful was the morality of the dollar my father my family my husband were willing to condone what they believed was my adultery and for what for a few scraps of paper that to them represented only the privilege to plunder the privilege to steal from the people  to chalmers here are you tom not only willing and eager to give me into the arms of the man you believe my lover but you throw in your boyyour child and mineto make it good measure and acceptable and for what love of some womanany woman no love of humanity no love of god no then for what for the privilege of perpetuating your stealing from the peoplemoney bread and butter hats shoes and stockingsfor stealing all these things from the people  to knox now and at last do i realize how stern and awful is the fight that must be wagedthe fight in which you and i howard must play our parts and play them bravely and uncomplaininglyyou as well as i but i even more than you this is the den of thieves i am a child of thieves all my family is composed of thieves i have been fed and reared on the fruits of thievery i have been a party to it all my life somebody must cease from this theft and it is i and you must help me howard  chalmers  emitting a low long whistle strange that you never went into the suffragette business with such speechmaking ability you would have been a shining light  knox  sadly the worst of it is margaret you are right but it is hard that we cannot be happy save by stealing from the happiness of others yet it hurts deep down and terribly to forego you margaret thanks him with her eyes  chalmers  sarcastically oh believe me i am not too anxious to give up my wife look at her shes a pretty good woman for any man to possess  margaret  tom ill accept a quiet divorce marry mr knox and take tommy with meon one consideration  chalmers  and what is that  margaret  that i retain the letters they are to be used in his speech this afternoon  chalmers  no theyre not  margaret  whatever happens do whatever worst you can possibly do that speech will be given this afternoon your worst to me will be none too great a price for me to pay  chalmers  no letters no divorce no tommy nothing  margaret  then will you compel me to remain here i have done nothing wrong and i dont imagine you will make a scandal  enter linda at right rear pausing and looking inquiringly there they are now  to linda yes give them to me  linda advancing draws package of documents from her breast as she is handing them to margaret chalmers attempts to seise them  knox  springing forward and thrusting chalmers back that you shall not  chalmers is afflicted with heartseizure and staggers  margaret  maternally solicitously tom dont your heart be careful  chalmers starts to stagger toward bell howard stop him dont let him ring or the servants will get the letters away from us knox starts to interpose but chalmers growing weaker sinks into a chair head thrown back and legs out straight before him linda a glass of water  linda gives documents to margaret and makes running exit to right rear margaret bends anxiously over chalmers a pause  knox  touching her hand give them to me  margaret gives him the documents which he holds in his hand at the same time she thanks him with her eyes enter linda with glass of water which she hands to margaret margaret tries to place the glass to chalmers lips  chalmers  dashing the glass violently from her hand to the floor and speaking in smothered voice bring me a whiskey and soda  linda looks at margaret interrogatively margaret is undecided what to say shrugs her shoulders in helplessness and nods her head  linda makes hurried exit to right  margaret  to knox you will go now and you will give the speech  knox  placing documents in inside coat pocket i will give the speech  margaret  and all the forces making for the good time coming will be quickened by your words let the voices of the millions be in it  chalmers legs still stretched out laughs cynically  you know where my heart lies some day in all pride and honor stealing from no one hurting no one we shall come togetherto be together always  knox  drearily and in the meantime  margaret  we must wait  knox  decidedly we will wait  chalmers  straightening up for me to die eh  during the following speech linda enters from right with whiskey and soda and gives it to chalmers who thirstily drinks half of it margaret dismisses linda with her eyes and linda makes exit to right rear  knox  i hadnt that in mind but now that you mention it it seems to the point that heart of yours isnt going to carry you much farther you have played fast and loose with it as with everything else you are like the carter who steals hay from his horse that he may gamble you have stolen from your heart some day soon like the horse it will quit we can afford to wait it wont be long  chalmers  after laughing incredulously and sipping his whiskey well knox neither of us wins you dont get the woman neither do i she remains under my roof and i fancy that is about all i wont divorce her whats the good but ive got her tied hard and fast by tommy you wont get her  knox ignoring hint goes to right rear and pauses in doorway  margaret  work bravely work you are my knight go  knox makes exit  margaret stands quietly face averted from audience and turned toward where knox was last to be seen  chalmers  madge  margaret neither moves nor answers i say madge  he stands up and moves toward her holding whiskey glass in one hand that speech is going to make a devil of a row but i dont think it will be so bad as your father says it looks pretty dark but such things blow over they always do blow over and so with you and me maybe we can manage to forget all this and patch it up somehow  she gives no sign that she is aware of his existence why dont you speak pause  he touches her arm madge  margaret  turning upon him in a blase of wrath and with unutterable loathing  dont touch me  chalmers recoils   curtain
