6703586	a diversity of creatures  by  rudyard kipling  1917        preface   with two exceptions the dates at the head of these stories show when they were published in magazine form the village that voted the earth was flat and my sons wife carry the dates when they were written  rudyard kipling     contents   as easy as abc   macdonoughs song  friendly brook   the land  in the same boat   helen all alone  the honours of war   the children  the dog hervey   the comforters  the village that voted the earth was flat   the press  in the presence   jobsons amen  regulus   a translation  the edge

    a diversity of creatures     as easy as abc  1912  the abc that semielected seminominated body of a few score persons controls the planet transportation is civilisation our motto runs theoretically we do what we please so long as we do not interfere with the traffic and all it implies practically the abc confirms or annuls all international arrangements and to judge from its last report finds our tolerant humorous lazy little planet only too ready to shift the whole burden of public administration on its shoulders  with the night mail1  footnote 1 actions and reactions  isnt it almost time that our planet took some interest in the proceedings of the aÃ«rial board of control one knows that easy communications nowadays and lack of privacy in the past have killed all curiosity among mankind but as the boards official reporter i am bound to tell my tale  at 930 am august 26 ad 2065 the board sitting in london was informed by de forest that the district of northern illinois had riotously cut itself out of all systems and would remain disconnected till the board should take over and administer it direct  every northern illinois freight and passenger tower was he reported out of action all district main local and guiding lights had been extinguished all general communications were dumb and through traffic had been diverted no reason had been given but he gathered unofficially from the mayor of chicago that the district complained of crowdmaking and invasion of privacy  as a matter of fact it is of no importance whether northern illinois stay in or out of planetary circuit as a matter of policy any complaint of invasion of privacy needs immediate investigation lest worse follow  by 945 am de forest dragomiroff russia takahira japan and pirolo italy were empowered to visit illinois and to take such steps as might be necessary for the resumption of traffic and all that that implies by 10 am the hall was empty and the four members and i were aboard what pirolo insisted on calling my leetle godchildthat is to say the new victor pirolo our planet prefers to know victor pirolo as a gentle greyhaired enthusiast who spends his time near foggia inventing or creating new breeds of spanishitalian olivetrees but there is another side to his naturethe manufacture of quaint inventions of which the victor pirolo is perhaps not the least surprising she and a few score sistercraft of the same type embody his latest ideas but she is not comfortable an abc boat does not take the air with the levelkeeled lift of a liner but shoots up rocketfashion like the aeroplane of our ancestors and makes her height at topspeed from the first that is why i found myself sitting suddenly on the large lap of eustace arnott who commands the abc fleet one knows vaguely that there is such a thing as a fleet somewhere on the planet and that theoretically it exists for the purposes of what used to be known as war only a week before while visiting a glacier sanatorium behind gothaven i had seen some squadrons making false auroras far to the north while they manoeuvred round the pole but naturally it had never occurred to me that the things could be used in earnest  said arnott to de forest as i staggered to a seat on the chartroom divan were tremendously grateful to em in illinois weve never had a chance of exercising all the fleet together ive turned in a general call and i expect well have at least two hundred keels aloft this evening  well aloft de forest asked  of course sir out of sight till theyre called for  arnott laughed as he lolled over the transparent charttable where the map of the summerblue atlantic slid along degree by degree in exact answer to our progress our dial already showed 320 mph and we were two thousand feet above the uppermost traffic lines  now where is this illinois district of yours said dragomiroff one travels so much one sees so little oh i remember it is in north america  de forest whose business it is to know the out districts told us that it lay at the foot of lake michigan on a road to nowhere in particular was about half an hours run from end to end and except in one corner as flat as the sea like most flat countries nowadays it was heavily guarded against invasion of privacy by forced timberfiftyfoot spruce and tamarack grown in five years the population was close on two millions largely migratory between florida and california with a backbone of small farms they call a thousand acres a farm in illinois whose owners come into chicago for amusements and society during the winter they were he said noticeably kind quiet folk but a little exacting as all flat countries must be in their notions of privacy there had for instance been no printed newssheet in illinois for twentyseven years chicago argued that engines for printed news sooner or later developed into engines for invasion of privacy which in turn might bring the old terror of crowds and blackmail back to the planet so newssheets were not  and thats illinois de forest concluded you see in the old days she was in the forefront of what they used to call progress and chicago  chicago said takahira thats the little place where there is salatis statue of the nigger in flames a fine bit of old work  when did you see it asked de forest quickly they only unveil it once a year  i know at thanksgiving it was then said takahira with a shudder and they sang macdonoughs song too  whew de forest whistled i did not know that i wish youd told me before macdonoughs song may have had its uses when it was composed but it was an infernal legacy for any man to leave behind  its protective instinct my dear fellows said pirolo rolling a cigarette the planet she has had her dose of popular government she suffers from inherited agoraphobia she has noahuse for crowds  dragomiroff leaned forward to give him a light certainly said the whitebearded russian the planet has taken all precautions against crowds for the past hundred years what is our total population today six hundred million we hope five hundred we think butbut if next years census shows more than four hundred and fifty i myself will eat all the extra little babies we have cut the birthrate outright out for a long time we have said to almighty god thank you sir but we do not much like your game of life so we will not play  anyhow said arnott defiantly men live a century apiece on the average now  oh that is quite well i am richyou are richwe are all rich and happy because we are so few and we live so long only i think almighty god he will remember what the planet was like in the time of crowds and the plague perhaps he will send us nerves eh pirolo  the italian blinked into space perhaps he said he has sent them already anyhow you cannot argue with the planet she does not forget the old days andwhat can you do  for sure we cant remake the world de forest glanced at the map flowing smoothly across the table from west to east we ought to be over our ground by nine tonight there wont be much sleep afterwards  on which hint we dispersed and i slept till takahira waked me for dinner our ancestors thought nine hours sleep ample for their little lives we living thirty years longer feel ourselves defrauded with less than eleven out of the twentyfour  by ten oclock we were over lake michigan the west shore was lightless except for a dull groundglare at chicago and a single trafficdirecting lightits leading beam pointing northat waukegan on our starboard bow none of the lake villages gave any sign of life and inland westward so far as we could see blackness lay unbroken on the level earth we swooped down and skimmed low across the dark throwing calls county by county now and again we picked up the faint glimmer of a houselight or heard the rasp and rend of a cultivator being played across the fields but northern illinois as a whole was one inky apparently uninhabited waste of high forced woods only our illuminated map with its little pointer switching from county to county as we wheeled and twisted gave us any idea of our position our calls urgent pleading coaxing or commanding through the general communicator brought no answer illinois strictly maintained her own privacy in the timber which she grew for that purpose  oh this is absurd said de forest were like an owl trying to work a wheatfield is this bureau creek lets land arnott and get hold of some one  we brushed over a belt of forced woodlandfifteenyearold maple sixty feet highgrounded on a private meadowdock none too big where we moored to our own grapnels and hurried out through the warm dark night towards a light in a verandah as we neared the garden gate i could have sworn we had stepped kneedeep in quicksand for we could scarcely drag our feet against the prickling currents that clogged them after five paces we stopped wiping our foreheads as hopelessly stuck on dry smooth turf as so many cows in a bog  pest cried pirolo angrily we are groundcircuited and it is my own system of groundcircuits too i know the pull  good evening said a girls voice from the verandah oh im sorry weve locked up wait a minute  we heard the click of a switch and almost fell forward as the currents round our knees were withdrawn  the girl laughed and laid aside her knitting an oldfashioned controller stood at her elbow which she reversed from time to time and we could hear the snort and clank of the obedient cultivator half a mile away behind the guardian woods  come in and sit down she said im only playing a plough dads gone to chicago toah then it was your call i heard just now  she had caught sight of arnotts board uniform leaped to the switch and turned it full on  we were checked gasping waistdeep in current this time three yards from the verandah  we only want to know whats the matter with illinois said de forest placidly  then hadnt you better go to chicago and find out she answered theres nothing wrong here we own ourselves  how can we go anywhere if you wont loose us de forest went on while arnott scowled admirals of fleets are still quite human when their dignity is touched  stop a minuteyou dont know how funny you look she put her hands on her hips and laughed mercilessly  dont worry about that said arnott and whistled a voice answered from the victor pirolo in the meadow  only a singlefuse groundcircuit arnott called sort it out gently please  we heard the ping of a breaking lamp a fuse blew out somewhere in the verandah roof frightening a nestful of birds the groundcircuit was open we stooped and rubbed our tingling ankles  how rudehow very rude of you the maiden cried  sorry but we havent time to look funny said arnott weve got to go to chicago and if i were you young lady id go into the cellars for the next two hours and take mother with me  off he strode with us at his heels muttering indignantly till the humour of the thing struck and doubled him up with laughter at the foot of the gangway ladder  the board hasnt shown what you might call a fat spark on this occasion said de forest wiping his eyes i hope i didnt look as big a fool as you did arnott hullo what on earth is that dad coming home from chicago  there was a rattle and a rush and a fiveplough cultivator blades in air like so many teeth trundled itself at us round the edge of the timber fuming and sparking furiously  jump said arnott as we bundled ourselves through the nonetoowide door never mind about shutting it up  the victor pirolo lifted like a bubble and the vicious machine shot just underneath us clawing high as it passed  theres a nice little spitkitten for you said arnott dusting his knees we ask her a civil question first she circuits us and then she plays a cultivator at us  and then we fly said dragomiroff if i were forty years more young i would go back and kiss her ho ho  i said pirolo would smack her my pet ship has been chased by a dirty plough ahow do you sayagricultural implement  oh that is illinois all over said de forest they dont content themselves with talking about privacy they arrange to have it and now wheres your alleged fleet arnott we must assert ourselves against this wench  arnott pointed to the black heavens  waiting onup there said he shall i give them the whole installation sir  oh i dont think the young lady is quite worth that said de forest get over chicago and perhaps well see something  in a few minutes we were hanging at two thousand feet over an oblong block of incandescence in the centre of the little town  that looks like the old city hall yes theres salatis statue in front of it said takahira but what on earth are they doing to the place i thought they used it for a market nowadays drop a little please  we could hear the sputter and crackle of roadsurfacing machinesthe cheap western type which fuse stone and rubbish into lavalike ribbed glass for their rough country roads three or four surfacers worked on each side of a square of ruins the brick and stone wreckage crumbled slid forward and presently spread out into whitehot pools of sticky slag which the levellingrods smoothed more or less flat already a third of the big block had been so treated and was cooling to dull red before our astonished eyes  it is the old market said de forest well theres nothing to prevent illinois from making a road through a market it doesnt interfere with traffic that i can see  hsh said arnott gripping me by the shoulder listen theyre singing why on the earth are they singing  we dropped again till we could see the black fringe of people at the edge of that glowing square  at first they only roared against the roar of the surfacers and levellers then the words came up clearlythe words of the forbidden song that all men knew and none let pass their lipspoor pat macdonoughs song made in the days of the crowds and the plagueevery silly word of it loaded to sparkingpoint with the planets inherited memories of horror panic fear and cruelty and chicagoinnocent contented little chicagowas singing it aloud to the infernal tune that carried riot pestilence and lunacy round our planet a few generations ago       once there was the peopleterror gave it birth      once there was the people and it made a hell of earth  then the stamp and pause       earth arose and crushed it listen oh ye slain      once there was the peopleit shall never be again  the levellers thrust in savagely against the ruins as the song renewed itself again again and again louder than the crash of the melting walls  de forest frowned  i dont like that he said theyve broken back to the old days theyll be killing somebody soon i think wed better divert em arnott  ay ay sir arnotts hand went to his cap and we heard the hull of the victor pirolo ring to the command lamps both watches stand by lamps lamps lamps  keep still takahira whispered to me blinkers please quartermaster  its all rightall right said pirolo from behind and to my horror slipped over my head some sort of rubber helmet that locked with a snap i could feel thick colloid bosses before my eyes but i stood in absolute darkness  to save the sight he explained and pushed me on to the chartroom divan you will see in a minute  as he spoke i became aware of a thin thread of almost intolerable light let down from heaven at an immense distanceone vertical hairsbreadth of frozen lightning  those are our flanking ships said arnott at my elbow that one is over galena look souththat other ones over keithburg vincennes is behind us and north yonder is winthrop woods the fleets in position sirthis to de forest as soon as you give the word  ah no no cried dragomiroff at my side i could feel the old man tremble i do not know all that you can do but be kind i ask you to be a little kind to them below this is horriblehorrible       when a woman kills a chicken      dynasties and empires sicken  takahira quoted it is too late to be gentle now  then take off my helmet take off my helmet dragomiroff began hysterically  pirolo must have put his arm round him  hush he said i am here it is all right ivan my dear fellow  ill just send our little girl in bureau county a warning said arnott she dont deserve it but well allow her a minute or two to take mamma to the cellar  in the utter hush that followed the growling spark after arnott had linked up his service communicator with the invisible fleet we heard macdonoughs song from the city beneath us grow fainter as we rose to position then i clapped my hand before my mask lenses for it was as though the floor of heaven had been riddled and all the inconceivable blaze of suns in the making was poured through the manholes  you neednt count said arnott i had had no thought of such a thing there are two hundred and fifty keels up there five miles apart full power please for another twelve seconds  the firmament as far as eye could reach stood on pillars of white fire one fell on the glowing square at chicago and turned it black  oh oh oh can men be allowed to do such things dragomiroff cried and fell across our knees  glass of water please said takahira to a helmeted shape that leaped forward he is a little faint  the lights switched off and the darkness stunned like an avalanche we could hear dragomiroffs teeth on the glass edge  pirolo was comforting him  all right all raight he repeated come and lie down come below and take off your mask i give you my word old friend it is all right they are my siegelights little victor pirolos leetle lights you know me i do not hurt people  pardon dragomiroff moaned i have never seen death i have never seen the board take action shall we go down and burn them alive or is that already done  oh hush said pirolo and i think he rocked him in his arms  do we repeat sir arnott asked de forest  give em a minutes break de forest replied they may need it  we waited a minute and then macdonoughs song broken but defiant rose from undefeated chicago  they seem fond of that tune said de forest i should let em have it arnott  very good sir said arnott and felt his way to the communicator keys  no lights broke forth but the hollow of the skies made herself the mouth for one note that touched the raw fibre of the brain men hear such sounds in delirium advancing like tides from horizons beyond the ruled foreshores of space  thats our pitchpipe said arnott we may be a bit ragged ive never conducted two hundred and fifty performers before he pulled out the couplers and struck a full chord on the service communicators  the beams of light leaped down again and danced solemnly and awfully a stiltdance sweeping thirty or forty miles left and right at each stifflegged kick while the darkness delivered itselfthere is no scale to measure against that utteranceof the tune to which they kept time certain notesone learnt to expect them with terrorcut through ones marrow but after three minutes thought and emotion passed in indescribable agony  we saw we heard but i think we were in some sort swooning the two hundred and fifty beams shifted reformed straddled and split narrowed widened rippled in ribbons broke into a thousand whitehot parallel lines melted and revolved in interwoven rings like oldfashioned engineturning flung up to the zenith made as if to descend and renew the torment halted at the last instant twizzled insanely round the horizon and vanished to bring back for the hundredth time darkness more shattering than their instantly renewed light over all illinois then the tune and lights ceased together and we heard one single devastating wail that shook all the horizon as a rubbed wet finger shakes the rim of a bowl  ah that is my new siren said pirolo you can break an iceberg in half if you find the proper pitch they will whistle by squadrons now it is the wind through pierced shutters in the bows  i had collapsed beside dragomiroff broken and snivelling feebly because i had been delivered before my time to all the terrors of judgment day and the archangels of the resurrection were hailing me naked across the universe to the sound of the music of the spheres  then i saw de forest smacking arnotts helmet with his open hand the wailing died down in a long shriek as a black shadow swooped past us and returned to her place above the lower clouds  i hate to interrupt a specialist when hes enjoying himself said de forest but as a matter of fact all illinois has been asking us to stop for these last fifteen seconds  what a pity arnott slipped off his mask i wanted you to hear us really hum our lower c can lift streetpaving  it is hellhell cried dragomiroff and sobbed aloud  arnott looked away as he answered  its a few thousand volts ahead of the old shootemandsinkem game but i should scarcely call it that what shall i tell the fleet sir  tell em were very pleased and impressed i dont think they need wait on any longer there isnt a spark left down there de forest pointed theyll be deaf and blind  oh i think not sir the demonstration lasted less than ten minutes  marvellous takahira sighed i should have said it was half a night now shall we go down and pick up the pieces  but first a small drink said pirolo the board must not arrive weeping at its own works  i am an old foolan old fool dragomiroff began piteously i did not know what would happen it is all new to me we reason with them in little russia  chicago north landingtower was unlighted and arnott worked his ship into the clips by her own lights as soon as these broke out we heard groanings of horror and appeal from many people below  all right shouted arnott into the darkness we arent beginning again we descended by the stairs to find ourselves kneedeep in a grovelling crowd some crying that they were blind others beseeching us not to make any more noises but the greater part writhing face downward their hands or their caps before their eyes  it was pirolo who came to our rescue he climbed the side of a surfacingmachine and there gesticulating as though they could see made oration to those afflicted people of illinois  you stchewpids he began there is nothing to fuss for of course your eyes will smart and be red tomorrow you will look as if you and your wives had drunk too much but in a little while you will see again as well as before i tell you this and ii am pirolo victor pirolo  the crowd with one accord shuddered for many legends attach to victor pirolo of foggia deep in the secrets of god  pirolo an unsteady voice lifted itself then tell us was there anything except light in those lights of yours just now  the question was repeated from every corner of the darkness  pirolo laughed  no he thundered why have small men such large voices i give you my word and the boards word that there was nothing except lightjust light you stchewpids your birthrate is too low already as it is some day i must invent something to send it up but send it downnever  is that truewe thoughtsomebody said  one could feel the tension relax all round  you too big fools pirolo cried you could have sent us a call and we would have told you  send you a call a deep voice shouted i wish you had been at our end of the wire  im glad i wasnt said de forest it was bad enough from behind the lamps never mind its over now is there any one here i can talk business with im de forestfor the board  you might begin with me for oneim mayor the bass voice replied  a big man rose unsteadily from the street and staggered towards us where we sat on the broad turfedging in front of the garden fences  i ought to be the first on my feet am i said he  yes said de forest and steadied him as he dropped down beside us  hello andy is that you a voice called  excuse me said the mayor that sounds like my chief of police bluthner  bluthner it is and heres mulligan and keefeon their feet  bring em up please blut were supposed to be the four in charge of this hamlet what we says goes and de forest what do you say  nothingyet de forest answered as we made room for the panting reeling men youve cut out of system well  tell the steward to send down drinks please arnott whispered to an orderly at his side  good said the mayor smacking his dry lips now i suppose we can take it de forest that henceforward the board will administer us direct  not if the board can avoid it de forest laughed the abc is responsible for the planetary traffic only  and all that that implies the big four who ran chicago chanted their magna charta like children at school  well get on said de forest wearily what is your silly trouble anyway  too much dam democracy said the mayor laying his hand on de forests knee  so i thought illinois had had her dose of that  she has thats why blut what did you do with our prisoners last night  locked em in the watertower to prevent the women killing em the chief of police replied im too blind to move just yet but  arnott send some of your people please and fetch em along said de forest  theyre triplecircuited the mayor called youll have to blow out three fuses he turned to de forest his large outline just visible in the paling darkness i hate to throw any more work on the board im an administrator myself but weve had a little fuss with our serviles what in a big city theres bound to be a few men and women who cant live without listening to themselves and who prefer drinking out of pipes they dont own both ends of they inhabit flats and hotels all the year round they say it saves em trouble anyway it gives em more time to make trouble for their neighbours we call em serviles locally and they are apt to be tuberculous  just so said the man called mulligan transportation is civilisation democracy is disease ive proved it by the bloodtest every time  mulligans our health officer and a oneidea man said the mayor laughing but its true that most serviles havent much control they will talk and when people take to talking as a business anything may arrivemaynt it de forest  anythingexcept the facts of the case said de forest laughing  ill give you those in a minute said the mayor our serviles got to talkingfirst in their houses and then on the streets telling men and women how to manage their own affairs you cant teach a servile not to finger his neighbours soul thats invasion of privacy of course but in chicago well suffer anything sooner than make crowds nobody took much notice and so i let em alone my fault i was warned there would be trouble but there hasnt been a crowd or murder in illinois for nineteen years  twentytwo said his chief of police  likely anyway wed forgot such things so from talking in the houses and on the streets our serviles go to calling a meeting at the old market yonder he nodded across the square where the wrecked buildings heaved up grey in the dawnglimmer behind the squarecased statue of the negro in flames theres nothing to prevent any one calling meetings except that its against human nature to stand in a crowd besides being bad for the health i ought to have known by the way our men and women attended that first meeting that trouble was brewing there were as many as a thousand in the marketplace touching each other touching then the serviles turned in all tongueswitches and talked and we  what did they talk about said takahira  first how badly things were managed in the city that pleased us fourwe were on the platformbecause we hoped to catch one or two good men for city work you know how rare executive capacity is even if we didnt itsits refreshing to find any one interested enough in our job to damn our eyes you dont know what it means to work year in year out without a spark of difference with a living soul  oh dont we said de forest there are times on the board when wed give our positions if any one would kick us out and take hold of things themselves  but they wont said the mayor ruefully i assure you sir we four have done things in chicago in the hope of rousing people that would have discredited nero but what do they say very good andy have it your own way anythings better than a crowd ill go back to my land you cant do anything with folk who can go where they please and dont want anything on gods earth except their own way there isnt a kick or a kicker left on the planet  then i suppose that little shed yonder fell down by itself said de forest we could see the bare and still smoking ruins and hear the slagpools crackle as they hardened and set  oh thats only amusement tell you later as i was saying our serviles held the meeting and pretty soon we had to groundcircuit the platform to save em from being killed and that didnt make our people any more pacific  how dyou mean i ventured to ask  if youve ever been groundcircuited said the mayor youll know it dont improve any mans temper to be held up straining against nothing no sir eight or nine hundred folk kept pawing and buzzing like flies in treacle for two hours while a pack of perfectly safe serviles invades their mental and spiritual privacy may be amusing to watch but they are not pleasant to handle afterwards  pirolo chuckled  our folk own themselves they were of opinion things were going too far and too fiery i warned the serviles but theyre born housedwellers unless a fact hits em on the head they cannot see it would you believe me they went on to talk of what they called popular government they did they wanted us to go back to the old voodoobusiness of voting with papers and wooden boxes and worddrunk people and printed formulas and newssheets they said they practised it among themselves about what theyd have to eat in their flats and hotels yes sir they stood up behind bluthners doubled groundcircuits and they said that in this present year of grace to selfowning men and women on that very spot then they finishedhe lowered his voice cautiouslyby talking about the people and then bluthner he had to sit up all night in charge of the circuits because he couldnt trust his men to keep em shut  it was trying em too high the chief of police broke in but we couldnt hold the crowd groundcircuited for ever i gathered in all the serviles on charge of crowdmaking and put em in the watertower and then i let things cut loose i had to the district lit like a sparked gastank  the news was out over seven degrees of country the mayor continued and when once its a question of invasion of privacy goodbye to right and reason in illinois they began turning out trafficlights and locking up landingtowers on thursday night friday they stopped all traffic and asked for the board to take over then they wanted to clean chicago off the side of the lake and rebuild elsewherejust for a souvenir of the people that the serviles talked about i suggested that they should slag the old market where the meeting was held while i turned in a call to you all on the board that kept em quiet till you came along andand now you can take hold of the situation  any chance of their quieting down de forest asked  you can try said the mayor  de forest raised his voice in the face of the reviving crowd that had edged in towards us day was come  dont you think this business can be arranged he began but there was a roar of angry voices  weve finished with crowds we arent going back to the old days take us over take the serviles away administer direct or well kill em down with the people  an attempt was made to begin macdonoughs song it got no further than the first line for the victor pirolo sent down a warning drone on one stopped horn a wrecked sidewall of the old market tottered and fell inwards on the slagpools none spoke or moved till the last of the dust had settled down again turning the steel case of salads statue ashy grey  you see youll just have to take us over the mayor whispered  de forest shrugged his shoulders  you talk as if executive capacity could be snatched out of the air like so much horsepower cant you manage yourselves on any terms he said  we can if you say so it will only cost those few lives to begin with  the mayor pointed across the square where arnotts men guided a stumbling group of ten or twelve men and women to the lake front and halted them under the statue  now i think said takahira under his breath there will be trouble  the mass in front of us growled like beasts  at that moment the sun rose clear and revealed the blinking assembly to itself as soon as it realized that it was a crowd we saw the shiver of horror and mutual repulsion shoot across it precisely as the steely flaws shot across the lake outside nothing was said and being half blind of course it moved slowly yet in less than fifteen minutes most of that vast multitudethree thousand at the lowest countmelted away like frost on south eaves the remnant stretched themselves on the grass where a crowd feels and looks less like a crowd  these mean business the mayor whispered to takahira there are a goodish few women there whove borne children i dont like it  the morning draught off the lake stirred the trees round us with promise of a hot day the sun reflected itself dazzlingly on the canistershaped covering of salatis statue cocks crew in the gardens and we could hear gatelatches clicking in the distance as people stumblingly resought their homes  im afraid there wont be any morning deliveries said de forest we rather upset things in the country last night  that makes no odds the mayor returned were all provisioned for six months we take no chances  nor when you come to think of it does any one else it must be threequarters of a generation since any house or city faced a food shortage yet is there house or city on the planet today that has not half a years provisions laid in we are like the shipwrecked seamen in the old books who having once nearly starved to death ever afterwards hide away bits of food and biscuit truly we trust no crowds nor system based on crowds  de forest waited till the last footstep had died away meantime the prisoners at the base of the statue shuffled posed and fidgeted with the shamelessness of quite little children none of them were more than six feet high and many of them were as greyhaired as the ravaged harassed heads of old pictures they huddled together in actual touch while the crowd spaced at large intervals looked at them with congested eyes  suddenly a man among them began to talk the mayor had not in the least exaggerated it appeared that our planet lay sunk in slavery beneath the heel of the aÃ«rial board of control the orator urged us to arise in our might burst our prison doors and break our fetters all his metaphors by the way were of the most mediÃ¦val next he demanded that every matter of daily life including most of the physical functions should be submitted for decision at any time of the week month or year to i gathered anybody who happened to be passing by or residing within a certain radius and that everybody should forthwith abandon his concerns to settle the matter first by crowdmaking next by talking to the crowds made and lastly by describing crosses on pieces of paper which rubbish should later be counted with certain mystic ceremonies and oaths out of this amazing play he assured us would automatically arise a higher nobler and kinder world basedhe demonstrated this with the awful lucidity of the insanebased on the sanctity of the crowd and the villainy of the single person in conclusion he called loudly upon god to testify to his personal merits and integrity when the flow ceased i turned bewildered to takahira who was nodding solemnly  quite correct said he it is all in the old books he has left nothing out not even the wartalk  but i dont see how this stuff can upset a child much less a district i replied  ah you are too young said dragomiroff for another thing you are not a mamma please look at the mammas  ten or fifteen women who remained had separated themselves from the silent men and were drawing in towards the prisoners it reminded one of the stealthy encircling before the rush in at the quarry of wolves round muskoxen in the north the prisoners saw and drew together more closely the mayor covered his face with his hands for an instant de forest bareheaded stepped forward between the prisoners and the slowly stiffly moving line  thats all very interesting he said to the drylipped orator but the point seems that youve been making crowds and invading privacy  a woman stepped forward and would have spoken but there was a quick assenting murmur from the men who realised that de forest was trying to pull the situation down to groundline  yes yes they cried we cut out because they made crowds and invaded privacy stick to that keep on that switch lift the serviles out of this the boards in charge hsh  yes the boards in charge said de forest ill take formal evidence of crowdmaking if you like but the members of the board can testify to it will that do  the women had closed in another pace with hands that clenched and unclenched at their sides  good good enough the men cried were content only take them away quickly  come along up said de forest to the captives breakfast is quite ready  it appeared however that they did not wish to go they intended to remain in chicago and make crowds they pointed out that de forests proposal was gross invasion of privacy  my dear fellow said pirolo to the most voluble of the leaders you hurry or your crowd that cant be wrong will kill you  but that would be murder answered the believer in crowds and there was a roar of laughter from all sides that seemed to show the crisis had broken  a woman stepped forward from the line of women laughing i protest as merrily as any of the company one hand of course shaded her eyes the other was at her throat  oh they neednt be afraid of being killed she called  not in the least said de forest but dont you think that now the boards in charge you might go home while we get these people away  i shall be home long before that itit has been rather a trying day  she stood up to her full height dwarfing even de forests sixfooteight and smiled with eyes closed against the fierce light  yes rather said de forest im afraid you feel the glare a little well have the ship down  he motioned to the pirolo to drop between us and the sun and at the same time to loopcircuit the prisoners who were a trifle unsteady we saw them stiffen to the current where they stood the womans voice went on sweet and deep and unshaken  i dont suppose you men realise how much thisthis sort of thing means to a woman ive borne three we women dont want our children given to crowds it must be an inherited instinct crowds make trouble they bring back the old days hate fear blackmail publicity the peoplethat that that she pointed to the statue and the crowd growled once more  yes if they are allowed to go on said de forest but this little affair  it means so much to us women that thisthis little affair should never happen again of course nevers a big word but one feels so strongly that it is important to stop crowds at the very beginning those creaturesshe pointed with her left hand at the prisoners swaying like seaweed in a tideway as the circuit pulled themthose people have friends and wives and children in the city and elsewhere one doesnt want anything done to them you know its terrible to force a human being out of fifty or sixty years of good life im only forty myself i know but at the same time one feels that an example should be made because no price is too heavy to pay ifif these people and all that they imply can be put an end to do you quite understand or would you be kind enough to tell your men to take the casing off the statue its worth looking at  i understand perfectly but i dont think anybody here wants to see the statue on an empty stomach excuse me one moment de forest called up to the ship a flying loop ready on the port side if you please then to the woman he said with some crispness you might leave us a little discretion in the matter  oh of course thank you for being so patient i know my arguments are silly but she half turned away and went on in a changed voice perhaps this will help you to decide  she threw out her right arm with a knife in it before the blade could be returned to her throat or her bosom it was twitched from her grip sparked as it flew out of the shadow of the ship above and fell flashing in the sunshine at the foot of the statue fifty yards away the outflung arm was arrested rigid as a bar for an instant till the releasing circuit permitted her to bring it slowly to her side the other women shrank back silent among the men  pirolo rubbed his hands and takahira nodded  that was clever of you de forest said he  what a glorious pose dragomiroff murmured for the frightened woman was on the edge of tears  why did you stop me i would have done it she cried  i have no doubt you would said de forest but we cant waste a life like yours on these people i hope the arrest didnt sprain your wrist its so hard to regulate a flying loop but i think you are quite right about those persons women and children well take them all away with us if you promise not to do anything stupid to yourself  i promisei promise she controlled herself with an effort but it is so important to us women we know what it means and i thought if you saw i was in earnest  i saw you were and youve gained your point i shall take all your serviles away with me at once the mayor will make lists of their friends and families in the city and the district and hell ship them after us this afternoon  sure said the mayor rising to his feet keefe if you can see hadnt you better finish levelling off the old market it dont look sightly the way it is now and we shant use it for crowds any more  i think you had better wipe out that statue as well mr mayor said de forest i dont question its merits as a work of art but i believe its a shade morbid  certainly sir oh keefe slag the nigger before you go on to fuse the market ill get to the communicators and tell the district that the board is in charge are you making any special appointments sir  none we havent men to waste on these backwoods carry on as before but under the board arnott run your serviles aboard please ground ship and pass them through the bilgedoors well wait till weve finished with this work of art  the prisoners trailed past him talking fluently but unable to gesticulate in the drag of the current then the surfacers rolled up two on each side of the statue with one accord the spectators looked elsewhere but there was no need keefe turned on full power and the thing simply melted within its case all i saw was a surge of whitehot metal pouring over the plinth a glimpse of salads inscription to the eternal memory of the justice of the people ere the stone base itself cracked and powdered into finest lime the crowd cheered  thank you said de forest but we want our breakfasts and i expect you do too goodbye mr mayor delighted to see you at any time but i hope i shant have to officially for the next thirty years goodbye madam yes were all given to nerves nowadays i suffer from them myself goodbye gentlemen all youre under the tyrannous heel of the board from this moment but if ever you feel like breaking your fetters youve only to let us know this is no treat to us good luck  we embarked amid shouts and did not check our lift till they had dwindled into whispers then de forest flung himself on the chartroom divan and mopped his forehead  i dont mind men he panted but women are the devil  still the devil said pirolo cheerfully that one would have suicided  i know it that was why i signalled for the flying loop to be clapped on her i owe you an apology for that arnott i hadnt time to catch your eye and you were busy with our caitiffs by the way who actually answered my signal it was a smart piece of work  ilroy said arnott but he overloaded the wave it may be pretty gallerywork to knock a knife out of a ladys hand but didnt you notice how she rubbed em he scorched her fingers slovenly i call it  far be it from me to interfere with fleet discipline but dont be too hard on the boy if that woman had killed herself they would have killed every servile and everything related to a servile throughout the district by nightfall  that was what she was playing for takahira said and with our fleet gone we could have done nothing to hold them  i may be ass enough to walk into a groundcircuit said arnott but i dont dismiss my fleet till im reasonably sure that trouble is over theyre in position still and i intend to keep em there till the serviles are shipped out of the district that last little crowd meant murder my friends  nerves all nerves said pirolo you cannot argue with agoraphobia  and it is not as if they had seen much deador is it said takahira  in all my ninety years i have never seen death dragomiroff spoke as one who would excuse himself perhaps that was whylast night  then it came out as we sat over breakfast that with the exception of arnott and pirolo none of us had ever seen a corpse or knew in what manner the spirit passes  were a nice lot to flap about governing the planet de forest laughed i confess now its all over that my main fear was i mightnt be able to pull it off without losing a life  i thought of that too said arnott but theres no death reported and ive inquired everywhere what are we supposed to do with our passengers ive fed em  were between two switches de forest drawled if we drop them in any place that isnt under the board the natives will make their presence an excuse for cutting out same as illinois did and forcing the board to take over if we drop them in any place under the boards control theyll be killed as soon as our backs are turned  if you say so said pirolo thoughtfully i can guarantee that they will become extinct in process of time quite happily what is their birthrate now  go down and ask em said de forest  i think they might become nervous and tear me to bits the philosopher of foggia replied  not really well  open the bilgedoors said takahira with a downward jerk of the thumb  scarcelyafter all the trouble weve taken to save em said de forest  try london arnott suggested you could turn satan himself loose there and theyd only ask him to dinner  good man youve given me an idea vincent oh vincent he threw the general communicator open so that we could all hear and in a few minutes the chartroom filled with the rich fruity voice of leopold vincent who has purveyed all london her choicest amusements for the last thirty years we answered with expectant grins as though we were actually in the stalls of say the combination on a first night  weve picked up something in your line de forest began  thats good dear man if its old enough theres nothing to beat the old things for business purposes have you seen london chatham and dover at earls court no i thought i missed you there immense ive had the real steam locomotive engines built from the old designs and the iron rails cast specially by hand cloth cushions in the carriages too immense and paper railway tickets and polly milton  polly milton back again said arnott rapturously book me two stalls for tomorrow night whats she singing now bless her  the old songs nothing comes up to the old touch listen to this dear men vincent carolled with flourishes       oh cruel lamps of london      if tears your light could drown      your victims eyes would weep them      oh lights of london town  then they weep  you see pirolo waved his hands at us the old world always weeped when it saw crowds together it did not know why but it weeped we know why but we do not weep except when we pay to be made to by fat wicked old vincent  old yourself vincent laughed im a public benefactor i keep the world soft and united  and im de forest of the board said de forest acidly trying to get a little business done as i was saying ive picked up a few people in chicago  i cut out chicago is  do listen theyre perfectly unique  do they build houses of baked mudblocks while you waiteh thats an old contact  theyre an untouched primitive community with all the old ideas  sewingmachines and maypoledances cooking on coalgas stoves lighting pipes with matches and driving horses gerolstein tried that last year an absolute blowout  de forest plugged him wrathfully and poured out the story of our doings for the last twentyfour hours on the topnote  and they do it all in public he concluded you cant stop em the more public the better they are pleased theyll talk for hourslike you now you can come in again  do you really mean they know how to vote said vincent can they act it  act its their life to em and you never saw such faces scarred like volcanoes envy hatred and malice in plain sight wonderfully flexible voices they weep too  aloud in public  i guarantee not a spark of shame or reticence in the entire installation its the chance of your career  dyou say youve brought their voting props alongthose papers and ballotbox things  no confound you im not a luggagelifter apply direct to the mayor of chicago hell forward you everything well  wait a minute did chicago want to kill em that ud look well on the communicators  yes they were only rescued with difficulty from a howling mobif you know what that is  but i dont answered the great vincent simply  well then theyll tell you themselves they can make speeches hours long  how many are there  by the time we ship em all over theyll be perhaps a hundred counting children an old world in miniature cant you see it  myes but ive got to pay for it if its a blowout dear man  they can sing the old war songs in the streets they can get worddrunk and make crowds and invade privacy in the genuine oldfashioned way and theyll do the voting trick as often as you ask em a question  too good said vincent  you unbelieving jew ive got a dozen head aboard here ill put you through direct sample em yourself  he lifted the switch and we listened our passengers on the lower deck at once but not less than five at a time explained themselves to vincent they had been taken from the bosom of their families stripped of their possessions given food without fingerbowls and cast into captivity in a noisome dungeon  but look here said arnott aghast theyre saying what isnt true my lower deck isnt noisome and i saw to the fingerbowls myself  my people talk like that sometimes in little russia said dragomiroff we reason with them we never kill no  but its not true arnott insisted what can you do with people who dont tell facts theyre mad  hsh said pirolo his hand to his ear it is such a little time since all the planet told lies  we heard vincent silkily sympathetic would they he asked repeat their assertions in publicbefore a vast public only let vincent give them a chance and the planet they vowed should ring with their wrongs their aim in lifetwo women and a man explained it togetherwas to reform the world oddly enough this also had been vincents lifedream he offered them an arena in which to explain and by their living example to raise the planet to loftier levels he was eloquent on the moral uplift of a simple oldworld life presented in its entirety to a deboshed civilisation  could theywould theyfor three months certain devote themselves under his auspices as missionaries to the elevation of mankind at a place called earls court which he said with some truth was one of the intellectual centres of the planet they thanked him and demanded we could hear his chuckle of delight time to discuss and to vote on the matter the vote solemnly managed by counting headsone head one votewas favourable his offer therefore was accepted and they moved a vote of thanks to him in two speechesone by what they called the proposer and the other by the seconder  vincent threw over to us his voice shaking with gratitude  ive got em did you hear those speeches thats nature dear men art cant teach that and they voted as easily as lying ive never had a troupe of natural liars before bless you dear men remember youre on my free lists for ever anywhereall of you oh gerolstein will be sicksick  then you think theyll do said de forest  do the little villagell go crazy ill knock up a series of oldworld plays for em their voices will make you laugh and cry my god dear men where do you suppose they picked up all their misery from on this sweet earth ill have a pageant of the worlds beginnings and mosenthal shall do the music ill  go and knock up a village for em by tonight well meet you at no 15 west landing tower said de forest remember the rest will be coming along tomorrow  let em all come said vincent you dont know how hard it is nowadays even for me to find something that really gets under the publics damned iridiumplated hide but ive got it at last goodbye  well said de forest when we had finished laughing if any one understood corruption in london i might have played off vincent against gerolstein and sold my captives at enormous prices as it is i shall have to be their legal adviser tonight when the contracts are signed and they wont exactly press any commission on me either  meantime said takahira we cannot of course confine members of leopold vincents lastengaged company chairs for the ladies please arnott  then i go to bed said de forest i cant face any more women and he vanished  when our passengers were released and given another meal fingerbowls came first this time they told us what they thought of us and the board and like vincent we all marvelled how they had contrived to extract and secrete so much bitter poison and unrest out of the good life god gives us they raged they stormed they palpitated flushed and exhausted their poor torn nerves panted themselves into silence and renewed the senseless shameless attacks  but cant you understand said pirolo pathetically to a shrieking woman that if wed left you in chicago youd have been killed  no we shouldnt you were bound to save us from being murdered  then we should have had to kill a lot of other people  that doesnt matter we were preaching the truth you cant stop us we shall go on preaching in london and then youll see  you can see now said pirolo and opened a lower shutter  we were closing on the little village with her three million people spread out at ease inside her ring of girdling maintraffic lightsthose eight fixed beams at chatham tonbridge redhill dorking woking st albans chipping ongar and southend  leopold vincents new company looked with small pale faces at the silence the size and the separated houses  then some began to weep aloud shamelesslyalways without shame         macdonoughs song       whether the state can loose and bind        in heaven as well as on earth      if it be wiser to kill mankind        before or after the birth      these are matters of high concern        where statekept schoolmen are      but holy state we have lived to learn        endeth in holy war       whether the people be led by the lord        or lured by the loudest throat      if it be quicker to die by the sword        or cheaper to die by vote      these are the things we have dealt with once        and they will not rise from their grave      for holy people however it runs        endeth in wholly slave

arose and crushed it listen o ye slain      once there was the peopleit shall never be again     friendly brook  march 1914   the valley was so choked with fog that one could scarcely see a cows length across a field every blade twig brackenfrond and hoofprint carried water and the air was filled with the noise of rushing ditches and fielddrains all delivering to the brook below a weeks november rain on waterlogged land had gorged her to full flood and she proclaimed it aloud  two men in sackcloth aprons were considering an untrimmed hedge that ran down the hillside and disappeared into mist beside those roarings they stood back and took stock of the neglected growth tapped an elbow of hedgeoak here a mossed beechstub there swayed a stooled ash back and forth and looked at each other  i reckon shes about two rod thick said jabez the younger an she hasnt felt iron sincewhen has she jesse  call it twentyfive year jabez an you wont be far out  umm jabez rubbed his wet handbill on his wetter coatsleeve she aint a hedge shes all manner o trees well just about have to he paused as professional etiquette required  just about have to side her up an see what shell bear but hadnt we best jesse paused in his turn both men being artists and equals  get some kind o line to go by jabez ranged up and down till he found a thinner place and with clean snicks of the handbill revealed the original face of the fence jesse took over the dripping stuff as it fell forward and with a grasp and a kick made it to lie orderly on the bank till it should be faggoted  by noon a length of unclean jungle had turned itself into a cattleproof barrier tufted here and there with little plumes of the sacred holly which no woodman touches without orders  now weve a witnessboard to go by said jesse at last  she wont be as easy as this all along jabez answered shell need plenty stakes and binders when we come to the brook  well aint we plenty jesse pointed to the ragged perspective ahead of them that plunged downhill into the fog i lay theres a cord an a half o firewood let alone faggots fore we get anywheres anigh the brook  the brooks got up a piece since morning said jabez sounds likes if she was over wickendens doorstones  jesse listened too there was a growl in the brooks roar as though she worried something hard  yes shes over wickendens doorstones he replied now shell flood acrost alder bay an thatll ease her  she wont ease jim wickendens hay none if she do jabez grunted i told jim hed set that liddle haystack o his too low down in the medder i told him so when he was drawin the bottom for it  i told him so too said jesse i told him fore ever you did i told him when the county council tarred the roads up along he pointed uphill where unseen automobiles and roadengines droned past continually a tarred road she shoots every drop o water into a valley sames a slate roof tisnt as twas in the old days when the waters soaked in and soaked out in the way o nature it rooshes off they tarred roads all of a lump and naturally every drop is bound to descend into the valley and theres tar roads both two sides this valley for ten mile thats what i told jim wickenden when they tarred the roads last year but hes a valleyman he dont hardly ever journey uphill  what did he say when you told him that jabez demanded with a little change of voice  why what did he say to you when you told him was the answer  what he said to you i reckon jesse  then you dont need me to say it over again jabez  well let be how twill what was he gettin after when he said what he said to me jabez insisted  i dunno unless you tell me what manner o words he said to you  jabez drew back from the hedgeall hedges are nests of treachery and eavesdroppingand moved to an open cattlelodge in the centre of the field  no need to go ferretin around said jesse none cant see us here fore we see them  what was jim wickenden gettin at when i said hed set his stack too near anigh the brook jabez dropped his voice he was in his mind  he aint never been out of it yet to my knowledge jesse drawled and uncorked his teabottle  but then jim says i aint goin to shift my stack a yard he says the brooks been good friends to me and if she be minded he says to take a snatch at my hay i aint settin out to withstand her thats what jim wickenden says to me lastlast juneend twas said jabez  nor he hasnt shifted his stack neither jesse replied an if theres more rain the brook shell shift it for him  no need tell me but i want to know what jim was gettin at  jabez opened his claspknife very deliberately jesse as carefully opened his they unfolded the newspapers that wrapped their dinners coiled away and pocketed the string that bound the packages and sat down on the edge of the lodge manger the rain began to fall again through the fog and the brooks voice rose                                       but i always allowed mary was his lawful child like said jabez after jesse had spoken for a while  taint so jim wickendens woman she never made nothing she come out o lewes with her stockins round her heels an she never made nor mended aught till she died he had to light fire an get breakfast every mornin except sundays while she sowed it abed then she took an died sixteen seventeen year back but she never had no childern  they was valleyfolk said jabez apologetically id no call to go in among em but i always allowed mary  no mary come out o one o those lunnon childern societies after his woman died jim got his mother back from his sister over to peasmarsh which shed gone to house with when jim married his mother kept house for jim after his woman died they do say twas his mother led him on toward adoptin of maryto furnish out the house with a child like and to keep him off of gettin a noo woman he mostly done what his mother contrived cardenly twixt em they asked for a child from one o those lunnon societiessame as it might ha been these barnardo childrenan mary was sent down to em in a candlebox ive heard  then mary is chanceborn i never knowed that said jabez yet i must ha heard it some time or other   no she aint twould ha been better for some folk if she had been she come to jim in a candlebox with all the proper paperslawful child o some couple in lunnon somewheresmother dead father drinkin and there was that lunnon societys five shillins a week for her jims mother she wouldnt despise weekend money but i never heard jim was much of a muckgrubber let be how twill they two mothered up mary no bounds till it looked at last like theyd forgot she wasnt their own flesh an blood yes i reckon they forgot mary wasnt theirn by rights  thats no new thing said jabez theres moren one or two in this parish wouldnt surrender back their bernarders you ask mark copley an his woman an that bernarder cripplebabe o theirs  maybe they need the five shillin jesse suggested  its handy said jabez but the childs more dada he says an mumma he says with his great rollin headpiece all hurdled up in that iron collar he wont live longhis backbones rotten like but they copleys do just about set store by himfive bob or no five bob  same way with jim an his mother jesse went on there was talk betwixt em after a few years o not takin any more weekend money for mary but let alone she never passed a farden in the mire thout longins jim didnt care like to push himself forward into the societys remembrance so naun came of it the weekend money would ha made no odds to jimnot after his uncle willed him they four cottages at eastbourne an money in the bank  that was true too then i heard something in a scadderin wordomouth way said jabez  ill answer for the house property because jim he requested my signed name at the foot o some papers concernin it regardin the money in the bank he natureally wouldnt like such things talked about all round the parish so he took strangers for witnesses  then twill make mary worth seekin after  shell need it her maker aint done much for her outside nor yet in  that aint no odds jabez shook his head till the water showered off his hatbrim if mary has money shell be wed before any likely pore maid shes cause to be grateful to jim  she hides it middlin close then said jesse it dont sometimes look to me as if mary has her natural rightful feelins she dont put on an apron o mondays thout being druv to itin the kitchen or the henhouse shes studyin to be a schoolteacher shell make a beauty i never knowed her show any sort o kindness to nobodynot even when jims mother was took dumb no twadnt no stroke it stifled the old lady in the throat here first she couldnt shape her words no shape then she clucked like an lastly she couldnt more than suck down spoonmeat an hold her peace jim took her to doctor harding an harding he bundled her off to brighton hospital on a ticket but they couldnt make no stay to her afflictions there and she was bundled off to lunnon an they lit a great old lamp inside her and jim told me they couldnt make out nothing in no sort there and along o one thing an another an all their spyins and pryins she come back a hem sight worse than when she started jim said hed have no more hospitalizin so he give her a slate which she tied to her waiststring and what she was minded to say she writ on it  now i never knowed that but theyre valleyfolk jabez repeated  twadnt particular noticeable for she wasnt a talkin woman any time o her days mary had all threes tongue well then two years this summer come what im tellin you marys lunnon father which theyd put clean out o their minds arrived down from lunnon with the law on his side sayin hed take his daughter back to lunnon after all i was working for mus dockett at pounds farm that summer but i was obligin jim that evenin muckin out his pigpen i seed a stranger come traipsin over the bridge agin wickendens doorstones twadnt the new county council bridge with the handrail they hadnt given it in for a public right o way then twas just a bit o lathy old plank which jim had throwed acrost the brook for his own conveniences the man wasnt drunkonly a little concerned in liquor likean his back was a mask where hed slipped in the muck comin along he went up the bricks past jims mother which was feedin the ducks an set himself down at the table insidejim was just changin his socksan the man let jim know all his rights and aims regardin mary then there just about was a hurlybulloo jims fust mind was to pitch him forth but hed done that once in his young days and got six months up to lewes jail along o the man fallin on his head so he swallowed his spittle an let him talk the law about mary was on the mans side from fust to last for he showed us all the papers then mary come downstairsshed been studyin for an examinationan the man tells her who he was an she says he had ought to have took proper care of his own flesh and blood while he had it by him an not to think he could reeclaim it when it suited he says somethin or other but she looks him up an down front an backwent an she just tongues him scadderin out o doors and he went away stuffin all the papers back into his hat talkin most abusefully then she come back an freed her mind against jim an his mother for not havin warned her of her upbringins which it come out she hadnt ever been told they didnt say naun to her they never did id ha packed her off with any man that would ha took heran gods pity on him  umm said jabez and sucked his pipe  so then that was the beginnin the man come back again next week or so an he catched jim alone thout his mother this time an he fair beazled him with his papers an his talkfor the law was on his sidetill jim went down into his moneypurse an give him ten shillings hushmoneyhe told meto withdraw away for a bit an leave mary with em  but thats no way to get rid o man or woman jabez said  no more tis i told jim so what can i do jim says the laws with the man i walk about daytimes thinkin o it till i sweats my underclothes wringin an i lie abed nights thinkin o it till i sweats my sheets all of a sop tisnt as if i was a young man he says nor yet as if

fifteen shillins an next time twas just fifteen shillins  an was the man her father asked jabez  he had the proofs an the papers jim showed me what that lunnon childerns society had answered when mary writ up to em an taxed em with it i lay she hadnt been proper polite in her letters to em for they answered middlin short they said the matter was out o their hands butlets see if i rememberoh yesthey reegretted there had been an oversight i reckon they had sent mary out in the candlebox as a orphan instead o havin a father terrible awkward then when hed drinked up the money the man come againin his usualsan he kept hammerin on and hammerin on about his duty to his pore dear wife an what hed do for his dear daughter in lunnon till the tears runned down his two dirty cheeks an he come away with more money jim used to slip it into his hand behind the door but his mother she heard the chink she didnt hold with hushmoney shed write out all her feelins on the slate an jim ud be settin up half the night answerin back an showing that the man had the law with him  hadnt that man no trade nor business then  he told me he was a printer i reckon though he lived on the rates like the rest of em up there in lunnon  an how did mary take it  she said shed sooner go into service than go with the man i reckon a mistress ud be middlin put to it for a maid fore she put mary into cap an gown she

fars i know she were more worritted that night on account of twothree her chickens bein drowned for the flood had skewed their old henhouse round on her postes i cobbled her up next mornin when the brook shrinked  an where did you find the bridge some fur downstream didnt ye  just where she allus was she hadnt shifted but very little the brook had gulled out the bank a piece under one eend o the plank sos she was liable to tilt ye sideways if you wasnt careful but i pooked threefour bricks under her an she was all plumb again  well i dunno how it looks like but let be how twill said jabez he

a snatch at my hay i aint settin out to withstand her  i reckon shes about shifted it too by now jesse chuckled hark that aint any slip off the bank which shes got hold of  the brook had changed her note again it sounded as though she were mumbling something soft          the land       when julius fabricius subprefect of the weald      in the days of diocletian owned our lower riverfield      he called to him hobdeniusa briton of the clay      saying what about that riverpiece for layin in to hay       and the aged hobden answered i remember as a lad      my father told your father that she wanted dreenin bad      an the more that you neeglect her the less youll get her clean      have it jest as youve a mind to but if i was you id dreen       so they drained it long and crossways in the lavish roman style      still we find among the riverdrift their flakes of ancient tile      and in drouthy middle august when the bones of meadows show      we can trace the lines they followed sixteen hundred years ago       then julius fabricius died as even prefects do      and after certain centuries imperial rome died too      then did robbers enter britain from across the northern main      and our lower riverfield was won by ogier the dane       well could ogier work his warboatwell could ogier wield           his brand      much he knew of foaming watersnot so much of farming land      so he called to him a hobden of the old unaltered blood      saying what about that riverbit she doesnt look no good       and that aged hobden answered taint for me to interfere      but ive known that bit o meadow now for five and fifty year      have it jest as youve a mind to but ive proved it time           on time      if you want to change her nature you have got to give her lime       ogier sent his wains to lewes twenty hours solemn walk      and drew back great abundance of the cool grey healing chalk      and old hobden spread it broadcast never heeding what was int      which is why in cleaning ditches now and then we find a flint       ogier died his sons grew english anglosaxon was their name      till out of blossomed normandy another pirate came      for duke william conquered england and divided with his men      and our lower riverfield he gave to william of warenne       but the brook you know her habit rose one rainy autumn night      and tore down sodden flitches of the bank to left and right      so said william to his bailiff as they rode their dripping rounds      hob what about that riverbitthe brooks got up no bounds       and that aged hobden answered taint my business to advise      but ye might ha known twould happen from the way the valley lies      when ye cant hold back the water you must try and save the sile      hev it jest as youve a mind to but if i was you id spile       they spiled along the watercourse with trunks of willowtrees      and planks of elms behind em and immortal oaken knees      and when the spates of autumn whirl the gravelbeds away      you can see their faithful fragments ironhard in iron clay                                            georgii quinti anno sexto i who own the riverfield      am fortified with titledeeds attested signed and sealed      guaranteeing me my assigns my executors and heirs      all sorts of powers and profits whichare neither mine nor theirs       i have rights of chase and warren as my dignity requires      i can fishbut hobden tickles i can shootbut hobden wires      i repair but he reopens certain gaps which men allege      have been used by every hobden since a hobden swapped a hedge       shall i dog his morning progress oer the trackbetraying dew      demand his dinnerbasket into which my pheasant flew      confiscate his evening faggot into which the conies ran      and summons him to judgment i would sooner summons pan       his dead are in the churchyardthirty generations laid      their names went down in domesday book when domesday book was made      and the passion and the piety and prowess of his line      have seeded rooted fruited in some land the law calls mine       not for any beast that burrows not for any bird that flies      would i lose his large sound council miss his keen amending eyes      he is bailiff woodman wheelwright fieldsurveyor engineer      and if flagrantly a poachertaint for me to interfere       hob what about that riverbit i turn to him again      with fabricius and ogier and william of warenne      hev it jest as youve a mind to butand so he takes command      for whoever pays the taxes old mus hobden owns the land    in the same boat  1911  a throbbing vein said dr gilbert soothingly is the mother of delusion  then how do you account for my knowing when the thing is due conroys voice rose almost to a break  of course but you should have consulted a doctor before usingpalliatives  it was driving me mad and now i cant give them up  not so bad as that one doesnt form fatal habits at twentyfive think again were you ever frightened as a child  i dont remember it began when i was a boy  with or without the spasm by the way do you mind describing the spasm again  well said conroy twisting in the chair im no musician but suppose you were a violinstringvibratingand some one put his finger on you as if a finger were put on the naked soul awful  sos indigestionsos nightmarewhile it lasts  but the horror afterwards knocks me out for days and the waiting for it  and then this drug habit it cant go on he shook as he spoke and the chair creaked  my dear fellow said the doctor when youre older youll know what burdens the best of us carry a fox to every spartan  that doesnt help me i cant i cant cried conroy and burst into tears  dont apologise said gilbert when the paroxysm ended im used to people coming a littleunstuck in this room  its those tabloids conroy stamped his foot feebly as he blew his nose theyve knocked me out i used to be fit once oh ive tried exercise and everything butif one sits down for a minute when its dueeven at four in the morningit runs up behind one  yees many things come in the quiet of the morning you always know when the visitation is due  what would i give not to be sure he sobbed  well put that aside for the moment im thinking of a case where what well call anÃ¦mia of the brain was masked i dont say cured by vibration he couldnt sleep or thought he couldnt but a steamer voyage and the thump of the screw  a steamer after what ive told you conroy almost shrieked id sooner   of course not a steamer in your case but a long railway journey the next time you think it will trouble you it sounds absurd but  id try anything i nearly have conroy sighed  nonsense ive given you a tonic that will clear that notion from your head give the train a chance and dont begin the journey by bucking yourself up with tabloids take them along but hold them in reservein reserve  dyou think ive selfcontrol enough after what youve heard said conroy  dr gilbert smiled yes after what ive seen he glanced round the room i have no hesitation in saying you have quite as much selfcontrol as many other people ill write you later about your journey meantime the tonic and he gave some general directions before conroy left  an hour later dr gilbert hurried to the links where the others of his regular weekend game awaited him it was a rigid round played as usual at the trot for the tension of the week lay as heavy on the two kings counsels and sir john chartres as on gilbert the lawyers were old enemies of the admiralty court and sir john of the frosty eyebrows and abernethy manner was bracketed with but before rutherford gilbert among nervespecialists  at the clubhouse afterwards the lawyers renewed their squabble over a tangled collision case and the doctors as naturally compared professional matters  liesall lies said sir john when gilbert had told him conroys trouble post hoc propter hoc the man or woman who drugs is ipso facto a liar youve no imagination  pity you havent a littleoccasionally  i have believed a certain type of patient in my time its always the same for reasons not given in the consultingroom they take to the drug certain symptoms follow they will swear to you and believe it that they took the drug to mask the symptoms what does your man use najdolene i thought so i had practically the duplicate of your case last thursday same old najdolenesame old lie  tell me the symptoms and ill draw my own inferences johnnie  symptoms the girl was rank poisoned with najdolene ramping stamping possession gad i thought shed have the chandelier down  mine came unstuck too and he has the physique of a bull said gilbert what delusions had yours  facesfaces with mildew on them in any other walk of life wed call it the horrors she told me of course she took the drugs to mask the faces post hoc propter hoc again all liars  whats that said the senior kc quickly sounds professional  go away not for you sandy sir john turned a shoulder against him and walked with gilbert in the chill evening  to conroy in his chambers came one week later this letter       dear mr conroyif your plan of a nights trip on the 17th      still holds good and you have no particular destination in      view you could do me a kindness a miss henschil in whom i      am interested goes down to the west by the 108 from      waterloo number 3 platform on that night she is not      exactly an invalid but like so many of us a little shaken      in her nerves her maid of course accompanies her but if i      knew you were in the same train it would be an additional      source of strength will you please write and let me know      whether the 108 from waterloo number 3 platform on the      17th suits you and i will meet you there dont forget my      caution and keep up the tonicyours sincerely       l rutherford gilbert  he knows im scarcely fit to look after myself was conroys thought and he wants me to look after a woman  yet at the end of half an hours irresolution he accepted  now conroys trouble which had lasted for years was this  on a certain night while he lay between sleep and wake he would be overtaken by a long shuddering sigh which he learned to know was the sign that his brain had once more conceived its horror and in timein due timewould bring it forth  drugs could so well veil that horror that it shuffled along no worse than as a freezing dream in a procession of disorderly dreams but over the return of the event drugs had no control once that sigh had passed his lips the thing was inevitable and through the days granted before its rebirth he walked in torment for the first two years he had striven to fend it off by distractions but neither exercise nor drink availed then he had come to the tabloids of the excellent m najdol these guarantee on the label refreshing and absolutely natural sleep to the soulweary they are carried in a case with a spring which presses one scented tabloid to the end of the tube whence it can be lipped off in stroking the moustache or adjusting the veil  three years of m najdols preparations do not fit a man for many careers his friends who knew he did not drink assumed that conroy had strained his heart through valiant outdoor exercises and conroy had with some care invented an imaginary doctor symptoms and regimen which he discussed with them and with his mother in hereford she maintained that he would grow out of it and recommended nux vomica  when at last conroy faced a real doctor it was he hoped to be saved from suicide by a straitwaistcoat yet dr gilbert had but given him more drugsa tonic for instance that would couple railway carnagesand had advised a night in the train not alone the horrors of a railway journey for which a man who dare keep no servant must een pack label and address his own bag but the necessity for holding himself in hand before a stranger a little shaken in her nerves  he spent a long forenoon packing because when he assembled and counted things his mind slid off to the hours that remained of the day before his night and he found himself counting minutes aloud at such times the injustice of his fate would drive him to revolts which no servant should witness but on this evening dr gilberts tonic held him fairly calm while he put up his patent razors  waterloo station shook him into real life the change for his ticket needed concentration if only to prevent shillings and pence turning into minutes at the bookingoffice and he spoke quickly to a porter about the disposition of his bag the old 108 from waterloo to the west was an allnight caravan that halted in the interests of the milk traffic at almost every station  dr gilbert stood by the door of the one composite corridorcoach an older and stouter man behind him so glad youre here he cried let me get your ticket  certainly not conroy answered i got it myselflong ago my bags in too he added proudly  i beg your pardon miss henschils here ill introduce you  butbut he stammeredthink of the state im in if anything happens i shall collapse  not you youd rise to the occasion like a bird and as for the selfcontrol you were talking of the other daygilbert swung him roundlook  a young man in an ulster over a silkfaced frockcoat stood by the carriage window weeping shamelessly  oh but thats only drink conroy said i havent had one of mymy things since lunch  excellent said gilbert i knew i could depend on you come along wait for a minute chartres  a tall woman veiled sat by the far window she bowed her head as the doctor murmured conroy knew not what then he disappeared and the inspector came for tickets  my maidnext compartment she said slowly  conroy showed his ticket but in returning it to the sleevepocket of his ulster the little silver najdolene case slipped from his glove and fell to the floor he snatched it up as the moving train flung him into his seat  how nice said the woman she leisurely lifted her veil unbottoned the first button of her left glove and pressed out from its palm a najdolenecase  dont said conroy not realising he had spoken  i beg your pardon the deep voice was measured even and low conroy knew what made it so  i said dont he wouldnt like you to do it  no he would not she held the tube with its everpresented tabloid between finger and thumb but arent you one of theahsoulweary too  thats why oh please dont not at first ii havent had one since morning youyoull set me off  you are you so far gone as that  he nodded pressing his palms together the train jolted through vauxhall points and was welcomed with the clang of empty milkcans for the west  after long silence she lifted her great eyes and with an innocence that would have deceived any sound man asked conroy to call her maid to bring her a forgotten book  conroy shook his head no our sort cant read dont  were you sent to watch me the voice never changed  me i need a keeper myself much morethis night of all  this night have you a night then they disbelieved me when i told them of mine she leaned back and laughed always slowly arent doctors stuupid they dont know  she leaned her elbow on her knee lifted her veil that had fallen and chin in hand stared at him he looked at hertill his eyes were blurred with tears  have i been there think you she said  surelysurely conroy answered for he had well seen the fear and the horror that lived behind the heavylidded eyes the fine tracing on the broad forehead and the guard set about the desirable mouth  thensuppose we have onejust one apiece ive gone without since this afternoon  he put up his hand and would have shouted but his voice broke  dont cant you see that it helps me to help you to keep it off dont lets both go down together  but i want one its a poor heart that never rejoices just one its my night  its minetoo my sixtyfourth fifth sixth seventh he shut his lips firmly against the tide of visualised numbers that threatened to carry him along  ah its only my thirtyninth she paused as he had done i wonder if i shall last into the sixties talk to me or i shall go crazy youre a man youre the stronger vessel tell me when you went to pieces  one two three four five six seveneighti beg your pardon  not in the least i always pretend ive dropped a stitch of my knitting i count the days till the last day then the hours then the minutes do you  i dont think ive done very much else for the last said conroy shivering for the night was cold with a chill he recognised  oh how comforting to find some one who can talk sense its not always the same date is it  what difference would that make he unbuttoned his ulster with a jerk youre a sane woman cant you see the wickedwickedwicked dust flew from the padded armrest as he struck it unfairness of it what have i done  she laid her large hand on his shoulder very firmly  if you begin to think over that she said youll go to pieces and be ashamed tell me yours and ill tell you mine only be quietbe quiet lad or youll set me off she made shift to soothe him though her chin trembled  well said he at last picking at the armrest between them mines nothing much of course  dont be a fool thats for doctorsand mothers  its hell conroy muttered it begins on a steameron a stifling hot night i come out of my cabin i pass through the saloon where the stewards have rolled up the carpets and the boards are bare and hot and soapy  ive travelled too she said  ah i come on deck i walk down a covered alleyway butchers meat bananas oil that sort of smell  again she nodded  its a leadcoloured steamer and the seas leadcoloured perfectly smooth seaperfectly still ship except for the engines running and her waves going off in lines and lines and linesdull grey all this time i know somethings going to happen  i know something going to happen she whispered  then i hear a thud in the engineroom then the noise of machinery falling downlike fireironsand then two most awful yells theyre more like hoots and i knowi know while i listenthat it means that two men have died as they hooted it was their last breath hooting out of themin most awful pain do you understand  i ought to go on  thats the first part then i hear bare feet running along the alleyway one of the scalded men comes up behind me and says quite distinctly my friend all is lost then he taps me on the shoulder and i hear him drop down dead he panted and wiped his forehead  so that is your night she said  that is my night it comes every few weeksso many days after i get what i call sentence then i begin to count  get sentence dyou mean this she half closed her eyes drew a deep breath and shuddered notice i call it sir john thought it was all lies  she had unpinned her hat and thrown it on the seat opposite showing the immense mass of her black hair rolled low in the nape of the columnar neck and looped over the left ear but conroy had no eyes except for her grave eyes  listen now said she i walk down a road a white sandy road near the sea there are broken fences on either side and men come and look at me over them  just men do they speak  they try to their faces are all mildewyeaten away and she hid her face for an instant with her left hand its the facesthe faces  yes like my two hoots i know  ah but the place itselfthe barenessand the glitter and the salt smells and the wind blowing the sand the men run after me and i run i know whats coming too one of them touches me  yes what comes then weve both shirked that  one awful shocknot palpitation but shock shock shock  as though your soul were being stoppedas youd stop a fingerbowl humming he said  just that she answered ones very soulthe soul that one lives bystopped so  she drove her thumb deep into the armrest and now she whined to him now that weve stirred each other up this way mightnt we have just one  no said conroy shaking lets hold on were pasthe peered out of the black windowswoking theres the necropolis how long till dawn  oh cruel long yet if one dozes for a minute it catches one  and how dyou find that thishe tapped the palm of his glovehelps you  it covers up the thing from being too realif one takes enoughyou know onlyonlyone loses everything else ive been no more than a bogiegirl for two years what would you give to be real again this lyings such a nuisance  one must protect oneselfand theres ones mother to think of he answered  true i hope allowances are made for us somewhere our burdencan you hearour burden is heavy enough  she rose towering into the roof of the carriage conroys ungentle grip pulled her back  now you are foolish sit down said he  but the cruelty of it cant you see it dont you feel it lets take one nowbefore i  sit down cried conroy and the sweat stood again on his forehead he had fought through a few nights and had been defeated on more and he knew the rebellion that flares beyond control to exhaustion  she smoothed her hair and dropped back but for a while her head and throat moved with the sickening motion of a captured wryneck  once she said spreading out her hands i ripped my counterpane from end to end that takes strength i had it then ive little now all dorn as my little niece says and you lad  all dorn let me keep your case for you till the morning  but the cold feeling is beginning  lend it me then  and the drag down my right side i shant be able to move in a minute  i can scarcely lift my arm myself said conroy were in for it  then why are you so foolish you know itll be easier if we have only oneonly one apiece  she was lifting the case to her mouth with tremendous effort conroy caught it the two moved like jointed dolls and when their hands met it was as wood on wood  you mustnot said conroy his jaws stiffened and the cold climbed from his feet up  whymustinot she repeated the words idiotically  conroy could only shake his head while he bore down on the hand and the case in it  her speech went from her altogether the wonderful lips rested half over the even teeth the breath was in the nostrils only the eyes dulled the face set grey and through the glove the hand struck like ice  presently her soul came back and stood behind her eyesonly thing that had life in all that placestood and looked for conroys soul he too was fettered in every limb but somewhere at an immense distance he heard his heart going about its work as the engineroom carries on through and beneath the all but overwhelming wave his one hope he knew was not to lose the eyes that clung to his because there was an evil abroad which would possess him if he looked aside by a hairbreadth  the rest was darkness through which some distant planet spun while cymbals clashed beyond farnborough the 108 rolls out many empty milkcans at every halt then a body came to life with intolerable pricklings limb by limb after agonies of terror that body returned to him steeped in most perfect physical weariness such as follows a long days rowing he saw the heavy lids droop over her eyesthe watcher behind them departedand his soul sinking into assured peace conroy slept  light on his eyes and a salt breath roused him without shock her hand still held his she slept forehead down upon it but the movement of his waking waked her too and she sneezed like a child  ii think its morning said conroy  and nothing has happened did you see your men i didnt see my faces does it mean weve escaped diddid you take any after i went to sleep ill swear i didnt she stammered  no there wasnt any need weve slept through it  no need thank god there was no need oh look  the train was running under red cliffs along a seawall washed by waves that were colourless in the early light southward the sun rose mistily upon the channel  she leaned out of the window and breathed to the bottom of her lungs while the wind wrenched down her dishevelled hair and blew it below her waist  well she said with splendid eyes arent you still waiting for something to happen  no not till next time weve been let off conroy answered breathing as deeply as she  then we ought to say our prayers  what nonsense some one will see us  we neednt kneel stand up and say our father we must  it was the first time since childhood that conroy had prayed they laughed hysterically when a curve threw them against an armrest  now for breakfast she cried my maidnurse blaberhas the basket and things itll be ready in twenty minutes oh look at my hair and she went out laughing  conroys first discovery made without fumbling or counting letters on taps was that the london and south westerns allowance of washingwater is inadequate he used every drop rioting in the cold tingle on neck and arms to shave in a moving train balked him but the next halt gave him a chance which to his own surprise he took as he stared at himself in the mirror he smiled and nodded there were points about this person with the clear if sunken eye and the almost uncompressed mouth but when he bore his bag back to his compartment the weight of it on a limp arm humbled that new pride  my friend he said half aloud you go into training youre putty  she met him in the spare compartment where her maid had laid breakfast  by jove he said halting at the doorway i hadnt realised how beautiful you were  the same to you lad sit down i could eat a horse  i shouldnt said the maid quietly the less you eat the better she was a small freckled woman with light fluffy hair and paleblue eyes that looked through all veils  this is miss blaber said miss henschil hes one of the soulweary too nursey  i know it but when one has just given it up a full meal doesnt agree thats why ive only brought you bread and butter  she went out quietly and conroy reddened  were still children you see said miss henschil but im well enough to feel some shame of it dyou take sugar  they starved together heroically and nurse blaber was good enough to signify approval when she came to clear away  nursey miss henschil insinuated and flushed  do you smoke said the nurse coolly to conroy  i havent in years now you mention it i think id like a cigaretteor something  i used to dyou think it would keep me quiet miss henschil said  perhaps try these the nurse handed them her cigarettecase  dont take anything else she commanded and went away with the teabasket  good grunted conroy between mouthfuls of tobacco  better than nothing said miss henschil but for a while they felt ashamed yet with the comfort of children punished together  now she whispered who were you when you were a man  conroy told her and in return she gave him her history it delighted them both to deal once more in worldly concernsfamilies names places and dateswith a person of understanding  she came she said of lancashire folkwealthy cottonspinners who still kept the broadened a and slurred aspirate of the old stock she lived with an old masterful mother in an opulent world north of lancaster gate where people in society gave parties at a mecca called the langham hotel  she herself had been launched into society there and the flowers at the ball had cost eightyseven pounds but being reckoned peculiar she had made few friends among her own sex she had attracted many men for she was a beautythe beauty in fact of society she said  she spoke utterly without shame or reticence as a lifeprisoner tells his past to a fellowprisoner and conroy nodded across the smokerings  do you remember when you got into the carriage she asked oh i wish i had some knitting did you notice aught lad  conroy thought back it was ages since wasnt there some one outside the doorcrying he asked  heshes the little man i was engaged to she said but i made him break it off i told him twas no good but he wont yo see  that fellow why he doesnt come up to your shoulder  thats naught to do with it i think all the world of him im a foolish wenchher speech wandered as she settled herself cosily one elbow on the armrest wed been engagedi

drawled theyre methodythe skinners you see their grandfather that started the patton mills he died o the driink  i see said conroy the grave face before him under the lifted veil was troubled  george skinner she breathed it softly id make him a good wife by gods graaceif i could but its no use im not responsible but hell not take no for an answer i used to call him toots hes of no consequence yo see  thats in dickens said conroy quite quickly i havent thought of toots for years he was at doctor blimbers  and sothats my trouble she concluded ever so slightly wringing her hands but idont you thinktheres hope now  eh said conroy oh yes this is the first time ive turned my corner without help with your help i should say  itll come back though  then shall we meet it in the same way heres my card write me your train and well go together  yes we must do that but between timeswhen we want she looked at her palm the four fingers working on it its hard to give em up  but think what we have gained already and let me have the case to keep  she shook her head and threw her cigarette out of the window not yet  then lets lend our cases to nurse and well get through today on cigarettes ill call her while we feel strong  she hesitated but yielded at last and nurse accepted the offerings with a smile  youll be all right she said to miss henschil but if i were youto conroyid take strong exercise  when they reached their destination conroy set himself to obey nurse blaber he had no remembrance of that day except one streak of blue sea to his left gorsebushes to his right and before him a coastguards track marked with whitewashed stones that he counted up to the far thousands as he returned to the little town he saw miss henschil on the beach below the cliffs she kneeled at nurse blabers feet weeping and pleading                                       twentyfive days later a telegram came to conroys rooms notice given waterloo again twentyfourth that same evening he was wakened by the shudder and the sigh that told him his sentence had gone forth yet he reflected on his pillow that he had in spite of lapses snatched something like three weeks of life which included several rides on a horse before breakfastthe hour one most craves najdolene five consecutive evenings on the river at hammersmith in a tub where he had well stretched the white arms that passing crews mocked at a game of rackets at his club three dinners one small dance and one human flirtation with a human woman more notable still he had settled his months accounts only once confusing petty cash with the days of grace allowed him next morning he rode his hired beast in the park victoriously he saw miss henschil on horseback near lancaster gate talking to a young man at the railings  she wheeled and cantered toward him  by jove how well you look he cried without salutation i didnt know you rode  i used to once she replied im all soft now  they swept off together down the ride  your beast pulls he said  waant him to gigives me something to think of howve you been she panted i wish chemists shops hadnt red lights  have you slipped out and bought some then  you dont know nursey eh but its good to be on a horse again this chap cost me two hundred  then youve been swindled said conroy  i know it but its no odds i must go back to toots and send him away hes neglecting his work for me  she swung her heavytopped animal on his none too sound hocks sentence come lad  yes but im not minding it so much this time  waterloo thenand god help us she thundered back to the little frockcoated figure that waited faithfully near the gate  conroy felt the spring sun on his shoulders and trotted home that evening he went out with a man in a pair oar and was rowed to a standstill but the other man owned he could not have kept the pace five minutes longer                                       he carried his bag all down number 3 platform at waterloo and hove it with one hand into the rack  well done said nurse blaber in the corridor weve improved too  dr gilbert and an older man came out of the next compartment  hallo said gilbert why havent you been to see me mr conroy come under the lamp take off your hat nono sit you young giant very good look here a minute johnnie  a little roundbellied hawkfaced person glared at him  gilbert was right about the beauty of the beast he muttered dyou keep it in your glove now he went on and punched conroy in the short ribs  no said conroy meekly but without coughing nowhereon my honour ive chucked it for good  wait till you are a sound man before you say that mr conroy sir john chartres stumped out saying to gilbert in the corridor its all very fine but the question is shall i or we sir pandarus of troy become eh were bound to think of the children  have you been vetted said miss henschil a few minutes after the train started may i sit with you ii dont trust myself yet i cant give up as easily as you can seemingly  cant you i never saw any one so improved in a month  look here she reached across to the rack singlehanded lifted conroys bag and held it at arms length i counted ten slowly and i didnt think of hours or minutes she boasted  dont remind me he cried  ah now ive reminded myself i wish i hadnt do you think itll be easier for us tonight  oh dont the smell of the carriage had brought back all his last trip to him and conroy moved uneasily  im sorry ive brought some games she went on draughts and cardsbut they all mean counting i wish id brought chess but i cant play chess what can we do talk about something  well hows toots to begin with said conroy  why did you see him on the platform  no was he there i didnt notice  oh yes he doesnt understand hes desperately jealous i told him it doesnt matter will you please let me hold your hand i believe im beginning to get the chill  toots ought to envy me said conroy  he does he paid you a high compliment the other night hes taken to calling againin spite of all they say  conroy inclined his head he felt cold and knew surely he would be colder  he said she yawned beg your pardon he said he couldnt see how i could help falling in love with a man like you and he called himself a damned little rat and he beat his head on the piano last night  the piano you play then  only to him he thinks the world of my accomplishments then i told him i wouldnt have you if you were the last man on earth instead of only the bestlookingnot with a million in each stocking  no not with a million in each stocking said conroy vehemently isnt that odd  i suppose soto any one who doesnt know well where was i oh george as good as told me i was deceiving him and he wanted to go away without saying goodnight he hates standing atiptoe but he must if i wont sit down  conroy would have smiled but the chill that foreran the coming of the lierinwait was upon him and his hand closed warningly on hers  andand so she was trying to say when her hour also overtook her leaving alive only the feardilated eyes that turned to conroy hand froze on hand and the body with it as they waited for the horror in the blackness that heralded it yet through the worst conroy saw at an uncountable distance one minute glint of light in his night thither would he go and escape his fear and behold that light was the light in the watchtower of her eyes where her locked soul signalled to his soul look at me  in time from him and from her the thing sheered aside that each soul might step down and resume its own concerns he thought confusedly of people on the skirts of a thunderstorm withdrawing from windows where the torn night is to their known and furnished beds then he dozed till in some drowsy turn his hand fell from her warmed hand  thats all the faces havent come he heard her say allthank god i dont feel even i need what nursey promised me do you  no he rubbed his eyes but dont make too sure  certainly not we shall have to try again next month im afraid it will be an awful nuisance for you  not to me i assure you said conroy and they leaned back and laughed at the flatness of the words after the hells through which they had just risen  and now she said strict eyes on conroy why wouldnt you take menot with a million in each stocking  i dont know thats what ive been puzzling over  so have i were as handsome a couple as ive ever seen are you well off lad  they call me so said conroy smiling  thats north country she laughed again setting aside my good looks and yours ive four thousand a year of my own and the rents should make it six thats a match some old cats would lap tea all night to fettle up  it is lucky toots said conroy  ay she answered hell be the luckiest lad in london if i win through whos yours  nono one dear ive been in hell for years i only want to get out and be alive andso on isnt that reason enough  maybe for a man but i never minded things much till george came i was all stuupid like  so was i but now i think i can live it ought to be less next month oughtnt it he said  i hope so yees theres nothing much for a maid except to be married and i ask no more whoever yours is when youve found her she shall have a wedding present from mrs george skinner that  but she wouldnt understand it any more than toots  he doesnt matterexcept to me i cant keep my eyes open thank god goodnight lad  conroy followed her with his eyes beauty there was grace there was strength and enough of the rest to drive better men than george skinner to beat their heads on pianotopsbut for the newfound life of him conroy could not feel one flutter of instinct or emotion that turned to herward he put up his feet and fell asleep dreaming of a joyous normal world recoveredwith interest on arrears there were many things in it but no one face of any one woman                                       thrice afterward they took the same train and each time their trouble shrank and weakened miss henschil talked of toots his multiplied calls the things he had said to his sisters the much worse things his sisters had replied of the late he seemed very dead to them m najdols gifts for the soulweary of shopping of house rents and the cost of really artistic furniture and linen  conroy explained the exercises in which he delightedmighty labours of play undertaken against other mighty men till he sweated and having bathed slept he had visited his mother too in hereford and he talked something of her and of the homelife which his body cut out of all clean life for five years innocently and deeply enjoyed nurse blaber was a little interested in conroys mother but as a rule she smoked her cigarette and read her paperbacked novels in her own compartment  on their last trip she volunteered to sit with them and buried herself in the cloister and the hearth while they whispered together on that occasion it was near salisbury at two in the morning when the lierinwait brushed them with his wing it meant no more than that they should cease talk for the instant and for the instant hold hands as even utter strangers on the deep may do when their ship rolls underfoot  but still said nurse blaber not looking up i think your mr skinner might feel jealous of all this  it would be difficult to explain said conroy  then youd better not be at my wedding miss henschil laughed  after all weve gone through too but i suppose you ought to leave me out is the day fixed he cried  twentysecond of septemberin spite of both his sisters i can risk it now her face was glorious as she flushed  my dear chap he shook hands unreservedly and she gave back his grip without flinching i cant tell you how pleased i am  gracious heavens said nurse blaber in a new voice oh i beg your pardon i forgot i wasnt paid to be surprised  what at oh i see miss henschil explained to conroy she expected you were going to kiss me or i was going to kiss you or something  after all youve gone through as mr conroy said  but i couldnt could you said miss henschil with a disgust as frank as that on conroys face it would be horriblehorrible and yet of course youre wonderfully handsome how dyou account for it nursey  nurse blaber shook her head i was hired to cure you of a habit dear when youre cured i shall go on to the next casethat seniledecay one at bournemouth i told you about  and i shall be left alone with george but suppose it isnt cured said miss henschil of a sudden suppose it comes back again what can i do i cant send for him in this way when im a married woman she pointed like an infant  id come of course conroy answered but seriously that is a consideration  they looked at each other alarmed and anxious and then toward nurse blaber who closed her book marked the place and turned to face them  have you ever talked to your mother as you have to me she said  no i might have spoken to dadbut mothers different what dyou mean  and youve never talked to your mother either mr conroy  not till i took najdolene then i told her it was my heart theres no need to say anything now that im practically over it is there  not if it doesnt come back but she beckoned with a stumpy triumphant linger that drew their heads close together you know i always go in and read a chapter to mother at tea child  i know you do youre an angel miss henschil patted the blue shoulder next her mothers church of england now she explained but shell have her bible with her pikelets at tea every night like the skinners  it was naaman and gehazi last tuesday that gave me a clue i said id never seen a case of leprosy and your mother said shed seen too many  where she never told me miss henschil began  a few months before you were bornon her trip to australiaat mola or molo something or other it took me three evenings to get it all out  aymothers suspicious of questions said miss henschil to conroy shell lock the door of every room shes in if its but for five minutes she was a tackberry from jarrow way yo see  she described your men to the lifemen with faces all eaten away staring at her over the fence of a lepers hospital in this molo island they begged from her and she ran she told me all down the street back to the pier one touched her and she nearly fainted shes ashamed of that still  my men the sand and the fences miss henschil muttered  yes you know how tidy she is and how she hates wind she remembered that the fences were brokenshe remembered the wind blowing sandsunsalt windfencesfacesi got it all out of her bit by bit you dont know what i know and it all happened three or four months before you were born there nurse blaber slapped her knee with her little hand triumphantly  would that account for it miss henschil shook from head to foot  absolutely i dont care who you ask you never imagined the thing it was laid on you it happened on earth to you quick mr conroy shes too heavy for me ill get the flask  miss henschil leaned forward and collapsed as conroy told her afterwards like a factory chimney she came out of her swoon with teeth that chattered on the cup  nono she said gulping its not hysterics yo see ive no call to hev em any more no callno reason whatever god be praised cant yo feel im a right woman now  stop hugging me said nurse blaber you dont know your strength finish the brandy and water its perfectly reasonable and ill lay long odds mr conroys case is something of the same ive been thinking  i wonder said conroy and pushed the girl back as she swayed again  nurse blaber smoothed her pale hair yes your trouble or something like it happened somewhere on earth or sea to the mother who bore you ask her child ask her and be done with it once for all  i will said conroy there ought to be he opened his bag and hunted breathlessly  bless you oh god bless you nursey miss henschil was sobbing you dont know what this means to me it takes it all offfrom the beginning  but doesnt it make any difference to you now the nurse asked curiously now that youre rightfully a woman  conroy busy with his bag had not heard miss henschil stared across and her beauty freed from the shadow of any fear blazed up within her i see what you mean she said but it hasnt changed anything i want toots he has never been out of his mind in his lifeexcept over silly me  its all right said conroy stooping under the lamp bradshaw in hand if i change at templecombefor bristol bristolherefordyesi can be with mother for breakfast in her room and find out  quick then said nurse blaber weve passed gillingham quite a while youd better take some of our sandwiches she went out to get them conroy and miss henschil would have danced but there is no room for giants in a southwestern compartment  goodbye good luck lad eh but youve changed alreadylike me send a wire to our hotel as soon as youre sure said miss henschil what should i have done without you  or i said conroy but its nurse thats saving us really  then thank her said miss henschil looking straight at him yes i would shed like it  when nurse blaber came back after the parting at templecombe her nose and her eyelids were red but for all that her face reflected a great light even while she sniffed over the cloister and the hearth  miss henschil deep in a house furnishers catalogue did not speak for twenty minutes then she said between adding totals of best guest and servants sheets but why should our times have been the same nursey  because a child is born somewhere every second of the clock nurse blaber answered and besides that you probably set each other off by talking and thinking about it you shouldnt you know  ay but youve never been in hell said miss henschil  the telegram handed in at hereford at 1246 and delivered to miss henschil on the beach of a certain village at 27 ran thus  absolutely confirmed she says she remembers hearing noise of accident in engineroom returning from india eightyfive  he means the year not the thermometer said nurse blaber throwing pebbles at the cold sea  and two men scalded thus explaining my hoots the idea of telling me that subsequently silly clergyman passenger ran up behind her calling for joke friend all is lost thus accounting very words  nurse blaber purred audibly  she says only remembers being upset minute or two unspeakable relief best love nursey who is jewel get out of her what she would like best oh i oughtnt to have read that said miss henschil  it doesnt matter i dont want anything said nurse blaber and if i did i shouldnt get it          helen all alone       there was darkness under heaven        for an hours space      darkness that we knew was given        us for special grace      sun and moon and stars were hid        god had left his throne      when helen came to me she did        helen all alone       side by side because our fate        damned us ere our birth      we stole out of limbo gate        looking for the earth      hand in pulling hand amid        fear no dreams have known      helen ran with me she did        helen all alone       when the horror passing speech        hunted us along      each laid hold on each and each        found the other strong      in the teeth of things forbid        and reason overthrown      helen stood by me she did        helen all alone       when at last we heard the fires        dull and die away      when at last our linked desires        dragged us up to day      when at last our souls were rid        of what that night had shown      helen passed from me she did        helen all alone       let her go and find a mate        as i will find a bride      knowing naught of limbo gate        or who are penned inside      there is knowledge god forbid        more than one should own      so helen went from me she did      oh my soul be glad she did        helen all alone    the honours of war  1911  a hooded motor had followed mine from the guildford road up the drive to the infants ancestral hall and had turned off to the stables  were having a quiet evening together stalkys upstairs changing dinners at 715 sharp because were hungry his rooms next to yours said the infant nursing a cobwebbed bottle of burgundy  then i found lieutenantcolonel al corkran ia who borrowed a collarstud and told me about the east and his sikh regiment  and are your subalterns as good as ever i asked  amazinsimply amazin all ive got to do is to find em jobs they keep touchin their caps to me and askin for more work come at me with their tongues hangin out i used to run the other way at their age  and when they err said i i suppose they do sometimes  then they run to me again to weep with remorse over their virgin peccadilloes i never cuddled my colonel when i was in trouble lambspositive lambs  and what do you say to em  talk to em like a papa tell em how i cant understand it an how shocked i am and how grieved their parentsll be and throw in a little about the army regulations and the ten commandments makes one feel rather a sweep when one thinks of what one used to do at their age dyou remember  we remembered together till close on seven oclock as we went out into the gallery that runs round the big hall we saw the infant below talking to two deferential wellsetup lads whom i had known on and off in the holidays any time for the last ten years one of them had a bruised cheek and the other a weeping left eye  yes thats the style said stalky below his breath theyre brought up on lemonsquash and mobilisation textbooks i say the girls we knew must have been much better than they pretended they were for ill swear it isnt the fathers  but why on earth did you do it the infant was shouting you know what it means nowadays  well sir said bobby trivett the taller of the two wontner talks too much for one thing he didnt join till he was twentythree and besides that he used to lecture on tactics in the anteroom he said clausewitz was the only tactician and he illustrated his theories with cigarends he was that sort of chap sir  and he didnt much care whose cigarends they were said eames who was shorter and pinker  and then he would talk about the varsity said bobby he got a degree there and he told us we werent intellectual he told the adjutant so sir he was just that kind of chap sir if you understand  stalky and i backed behind a tall japanese jar of chrysanthemums and listened more intently  was all the mess in it or only you two the infant demanded chewing his moustache  the adjutant went to bed of course sir and the senior subaltern said he wasnt going to risk his commissiontheyre awfully down on ragging nowadays in the servicebut the rest of userattended to him said bobby  much the infant asked the boys smiled deprecatingly  not in the anteroom sir said eames then he called us silly children and went to bed and we sat up discussin and i suppose we got a bit above ourselves and weer  went to his quarters and drew him the infant suggested  well we only asked him to get out of bed and we put his helmet and swordbelt on for him and we sung him bits out of the blue fairy bookthe crambook on army organisation oh yes and then we asked him to drink old clausewitzs health as a brothertactician in milkpunch and worcester sauce and so on we had to help him a little there he bites there wasnt much else that time but you know the war office is severe on ragging these days bobby stopped with a lopsided smile  and then eames went on then wontner said wed done several pounds worth of damage to his furniture  oh said the infant hes that kind of man is he does he brush his teeth  oh yes hes quite clean all over said trivett but his fathers a wealthy barrister  solicitor eames corrected and so this mister wontner is out for our blood hes going to make a firstclass row about itappeal to the war officecourt of inquiryspicy bits in the papers and songs in the musichalls he told us so  thats the sort of chap he is said trivett and that means old dhurrahbags our colonel ll be put on halfpay same as that case in the scarifungers mess and our adjutantll have to exchange like it was with that fellow in the 73rd dragoons and therell be misery all round he means making it too hot for us and his papall back him  yes thats all very fine said the infant but i left the service about the time you were born bobby whats it got to do with me  father told me i was always to go to you when i was in trouble and youve been awfully good to me since he   better stay to dinner the infant mopped his forehead  thank you very much but the fact is trivett halted  this afternoon about four to be exact eames broke in  we went over to wontners quarters to talk things over the row only happened last night and we found him writing letters as hard as he could to his fathergetting up his case for the war office you know he read us some of em but im not a good judge of style we tried to ride him off quietlyapologies and so forthbut it was the milkpunch and mayonnaise that defeated us  yes he wasnt taking anything except pure revenge said eames  he said hed make an example of the regiment and he was particularly glad that hed landed our colonel he told us so old dhurrahbags dont sympathise with wontners tactical lectures he says wontner ought to learn manners first but we thought trivett turned to eames who was less a son of the house than himself eamess father being still alive  then eames went on he became rather noisome and we thought we might as well impound the correspondencehe wrinkled his swelled left eyeand after that we got him to take a seat in my car  he was in a sack you know trivett explained he wouldnt go any other way but we didnt hurt him  oh no his heads sticking out quite clear andeames rushed the fenceweve put him in your garageer pendente lite  my garage infants voice nearly broke with horror  well father always told me if i was in trouble uncle george  bobbys sentence died away as the infant collapsed on a divan and said no more than your commissions there was a long long silence  what price your latterday limejuice subaltern i whispered to stalky behind my hand his nostrils expanded and he drummed on the edge of the japanese jar with his knuckles  confound your father bobby the infant groaned raggins a criminal offence these days it isnt as if  come on said stalky that was my old line battalion in egypt they nearly slung old dhurrahbags and me out of the service in 85 for ragging he descended the stairs and the infant rolled appealing eyes at him  i heard what you youngsters have confessed he began and in his orderlyroom voice which is almost as musical as his singing one he tonguelashed those lads in such sort as was a privilege and a revelation to listen to till then they had known him almost as a relativewe were all brevet deputy or acting uncles to the infants friends brooda sympathetic elder brother sound on finance they had never met colonel al corkran in the chair of justice and while he flayed and rent and blistered and wiped the floor with them and while they looked for hidingplaces and found none on that floor i remembered 1 the upending of dolly macshane at dalhousie which came perilously near a courtmartial on secondlieutenant corkran 2 the burning of captain parmilees mosquitocurtains on a hot indian dawn when the captain slept in his garden and lieutenant corkran smoking rode by after a successful whist night at the club 3 the introduction of an ekka pony with ekka attached into a brother captains tent on a frosty night in peshawur and the removal of tent pole cot and captain all wrapped in chilly canvas 4 the bath that was given to elliothacker on his own verandahhis ladylove saw it and broke off the engagement which was what the mess intended she being an eurasianand the powdering all over of elliothacker with flour and turmeric from the bazaar  when he took breath i realised how only satan can rebuke sin the good dont know enough  now said stalky get out no not out of the house go to your rooms  ill send your dinner bobby said the infant ipps  nothing had ever been known to astonish ipps the butler he entered and withdrew with his charges after all he had suffered from bobby since bobbys twelfth year  theyve done everything they could short of murder said the infant you know what thisll mean for the regiment it isnt as if we were dealing with sahibs nowadays  quite so stalky turned on me go and release the bagman he said  tisnt my garage i pleaded im company besides hell probably slay me hes been in the sack for hours  look here stalky thunderedthe years had fallen from us bothis youram i commandin or are you weve got to pull this thing off somehow or other cut over to the garage make much of him and bring him over hes dining with us be quick you dithering ass  i was quick enough but as i ran through the shrubbery i wondered how one extricates the subaltern of the present day from a sack without hurting his feelings anciently one slit the end open taking off his boots first and then fled  imagine a sumptuouslyequipped garage halffilled by the infants cobaltblue greycorded silk limousine and a mudsplashed cheap hooded fourseater in the back seat of this last conceive a fiery chestnut head emerging from a long oatsack an implacable white face with blazing eyes and jaws that worked ceaselessly at the loop of the string that was drawn round its neck the effect under the electrics was that of a demon caterpillar wrathfully spinning its own cocoon  good evening i said genially let me help you out of that the head glared weve got em i went on they came to quite the wrong shop for this sort of gamequite the wrong shop  game said the head well see about that let me out  it was not a promising voice for one so young and as usual i had no knife  youve chewed the string so i cant find the knot i said as i worked with trembling fingers at the caterpillars throat something untied itself and mr wontner wriggled out collarless tieless his coat split half down his back his waistcoat unbuttoned his watchchain snapped his trousers rucked well above the knees  where he said grimly as he pulled them down are master trivett and master eames  both arrested of course i replied sir georgei gave the infants full title as a baronetis a justice of the peace hed be very pleased if you dined with us theres a room ready for you i picked up the sack  dyou know said mr wontner through his teethbut the cars bonnet was between us that this looks to me likei wont say conspiracy yet but uncommonly like a confederacy  when injured souls begin to distinguish and qualify danger is over so i grew bold  sorry you take it that way i said you come here in trouble  my good fool he interrupted with a halfhysterical snort let me assure you that the trouble will recoil on the other men  as you please i went on anyhow the chaps who got you into trouble are arrested and the magistrate who arrested em asks you to dinner shall i tell him youre walking back to aldershot  he picked some fluff off his waistcoat  im in no position to dictate terms yet he said that will come later i must probe into this a little further in the meantime i accept your invitation without prejudiceif you understand what that means  i understood and began to be happy again subalterns without prejudices were quite new to me all right i replied if youll go up to the house ill turn out the lights  he walked off stiffly while i searched the sack and the car for the impounded correspondence that bobby had talked of i found nothing except as the police reports say the trace of a struggle he had kicked half the varnish off the back of the front seat and had bitten the leather padding where he could reach it evidently a purposeful and hardmouthed young gentleman  well done said stalky at the door so he didnt slay you stop laughing hes talking to the infant now about depositions look here youre nearest his size cut up to your rooms and give ipps your dinner things and a clean shirt for him  but i havent got another suit i said  you im not thinking of you weve got to conciliate him hes in filthy rags and a filthy temper and he wont feel decent till hes dressed youre the sacrifice be quick and clean socks remember  once more i trotted up to my room changed into unseasonable unbrushed grey tweeds put studs into a clean shirt dug out fresh socks handed the whole garniture over to ipps and returned to the hall just in time to hear stalky say im a stockbroker but i have the honour to hold his majestys commission in a territorial battalion then i felt as though i might be beginning to be repaid  i have a very high opinion of the territorials myself said mr wontner above a glass of sherry infant never lets us put bitters into anything above twenty years old but if you had any experience of the service you would find that the average army man  here the infant suggested changing and ipps before whom no human passion can assert itself led mr wontner away  why the devil did you tell him i was on the bench said infant wrathfully to me you know i aint now why didnt he stay in his fathers office hes a raging blight  not a bit of it said stalky cheerfully hes a little shaken and excited probably beetle annoyed him in the garage but we must overlook that weve contained him so far and im going to nibble round his outposts at dinner all youve got to do infant is to remember youre a gentleman in your own house dont hop youll find it pretty difficult before dinners over i dont want to hear anything at all from you beetle  but im just beginning to like him i said do let me play  not till i ask you youll overdo it poor old dhurrahbags a scandal ud break him up  but as long as a regiment has no say as to who joins it its bound to rag infant began whywhy they varnished me when i joined he squirmed at the thought of it  dont be owls we aint discussing principles weve got to save the court of inquiry if we can said stalky  five minutes laterat 745 to be precisewe four sat down to such a dinner as i hold only the infants cook can produce with wines worthy of pontifical banquets a man in the extremity of rage and injured dignity is precisely like a typhoid patient he asks no questions accepts what is put before him and babbles in one keyvery often of trifles but food and drink are the very best of drugs i think it was heidsieck dry monopole 92stalky as usual stuck to burgundythat began to unlock mr wontners heart behind my shirtfront me he snubbed throughout after the oxford manner because i had seen him in the sack and he did not intend me to presume but to stalky and the infant while i admired the set of my dinnerjacket across his shoulders he made his plans of revenge very clear indeed he had even sketched out some of the paragraphs that were to appear in the papers and if stalky had allowed me to speak i would have told him that they were rather neatly phrased  you ought to be able to get whackin damages out of em into the bargain said stalky after mr wontner had outlined his position legally  my deah sir mr wontner applied himself to his glass it isnt a matter that gentlemen usually discuss but i assure you we wontnershe waved a wellkept handdo not stand in any need of filthy lucre in the next three minutes we learned exactly what his father was worth which as he pointed out was a trifle no man of the world dwelt on stalky envied aloud and i delivered my first kick at the infants ankle thence we drifted to education and the average army man and the desolating vacuityi remember these wordsof army society notably among its womenkind it appeared there was some sort of narrow convention in the army against mentioning a womans name at mess we were much surprised at thisstalky would not let me express my surprisebut we took it from mr wontner who said we might that it was so next he touched on colonels of the old school and their cognisance of tactics not that he himself pretended to any skill in tactics but after three years at the varsitynone of us had had a varsity educationa man insensibly contracted the habit of clear thinking at least he could automatically coordinate his ideas and the jealousy of these muddleheaded colonels was inconceivable we would understand that it was his duty to force on the retirement of his colonel who had been in the conspiracy against him to make his adjutant resign or exchange and to give the halfdozen childish subalterns who had vexed his dignity a chance to retrieve themselves in other corpswest african ones he hoped for himself after the case was decided he proposed to go on living in the regiment just to provefor he bore no malicethat times had changed nosque mutamur in illisif we knew what that meant infant had curled his legs out of reach so i was quite free to return thanks yet once more to allah for the diversity of his creatures in his adorable world  and so by way of an eightyyearold liqueur brandy to tactics and the great general clausewitz unknown to the average army man here the infant at a whisper from ippswhose face had darkened like a mulberry while he waitedexcused himself and went away but stalky colonel of territorials wanted some tips on tactics he got them unbrokenly for ten minuteswontner and clausewitz mixed but wontner in a film of priceless cognac distinctly on top when the infant came back he renewed his clearspoken demand that infant should take his depositions i supposed this to be a family trait of the wontners whom i had been visualising for some time past even to the third generation  but hang it all theyre both asleep said infant scowling at me ipps let em have the 81 port  asleep said stalky rising at once i dont see that makes any difference as a matter of form youd better identify them ill show you the way  we followed up the white stone sidestaircase that leads to the bachelors wing mr wontner seemed surprised that the boys were not in the coalcellar  oh a chaps assumed to be innocent until hes proved guilty said stalky mounting step by step how did they get you into the sack mr wontner  jumped on me from behindtwo to one said mr wontner briefly i think i handed each of them something first but they roped my arms and legs  and did they photograph you in the sack  good heavens no mr wontner shuddered  thats lucky awful thing to live downa photograph isnt it said stalky to me as we reached the landing im thinking of the newspapers of course  oh but you can easily have sketches in the illustrated papers from accounts supplied by eyewitnesses i said  mr wontner turned him round it was the first time he had honoured me by his notice since our talk in the garage  ah said he do you pretend to any special knowledge in these matters  im a journalist by profession i answered simply but nobly as soon as youre at liberty id like to have your account of the affair  now i thought he would have loved me for this but he only replied in an uncomfortable uncomingon voice oh you would would you  not if its any trouble of course i said i can always get their version from the defendants do either of em draw or sketch at all mr wontner or perhaps your father might  then he said quite hotly i wish you to understand very clearly my good man that a gentlemans name cant be dragged through the gutter to bolster up the circulation of your wretched sheet whatever it may be  it is  i named a journal of enormous sales which specialises in scholastic military and other scandals i dont know yet what it cant do mr wontner  i didnt know that i was dealing with a reporter said mr wontner  we were all halted outside a shut door ipps had followed us  but surely you want it in the papers dont you i urged with a scandal like this one couldnt in justice to the democracy be exclusive wed syndicate it here and in the united states i helped you out of the sack if you remember  i wish to goodness youd stop talking he snapped and sat down on a chair stalkys hand on my shoulder quietly signalled me out of action but i felt that my fire had not been misdirected  ill answer for him said stalky to wontner in an undertone that dropped to a whisper i caughtnot without my leavedependent on me for markettips and other gratifying tributes to my integrity  still mr wontner sat in his chair and still we waited on him the infants face showed worry and heavy grief stalkys a bright and birdlike interest mine was hidden behind his shoulders but on the face of ipps were written emotions that no butler should cherish towards any guest contempt and wrath were the least of them and mr wontner was looking full at ipps as ipps was looking at him mr wontners father i understood kept a butler and two footmen  dyou suppose theyre shamming in order to get off he said at last ipps shook his head and noiselessly threw the door open the boys had finished their dinner and were fast asleepone on a sofa one in a long chairtheir faces fallen back to the lines of their childhood they had had a wildish night a hard day that ended with a tellingoff from an artist and the assurance they had wrecked their prospects for life what else should youth do then but eat and drink 81 port and remember their sorrows no more  mr wontner looked at them severely ipps within easy reach his hands quite ready childish said mr wontner at last childish but necessary erhave you such a thing as a rope on the premises and a sacktwo sacks and two ropes im afraid i cant resist the temptation that man understands doesnt he that this is a private matter  that man who was me was off to the basement like one of infants own fallowdeer the stables gave me what i wanted and coming back with it through a dark passage i ran squarely into ipps go on he grunted the minute he lays hands on master bobby master bobbys saved but that person ought to be told how near he came to being assaulted it was touchandgo with me all the time from the soup down i assure you  i arrived breathless with the sacks and the ropes they were two to one with me said mr wontner as he took them if they wake  well stand by stalky replied two to one is quite fair  but the boys hardly grunted as mr wontner roped first one and then the other even when they were slid into the sacks they only mumbled with rolling heads through sticky lips and snored on  port said mr wontner virtuously  nervous exhaustion they arent much more than kids after all whats next said stalky  i want to take em away with me please  stalky looked at him with respect  ill have my car round in five minutes said the infant ippsll help carry em downstairs and he shook mr wontner by the hand  we were all perfectly serious till the two bundles were dumped on a divan in the hall and the boys waked and began to realise what had happened  yah said mr wontner with the simplicity of twelve years old whos scored now and he sat upon them the tension broke in a storm of laughter led i think by ipps  asinineabsolutely asinine said mr wontner with folded arms from his lively chair but he drank in the flattery and the fellowship of it all with quite a brainless grin as we rolled and stamped round him and wiped the tears from our cheeks  hang it said bobby trivett were defeated  by tactics too said eames i didnt think you knew em clausewitz its a fair score what are you going to do with us  take you back to mess said mr wontner  not like this  oh no worsemuch worse i havent begun with you yet and you thought youd scored yah  they had scored beyond their wildest dream the man in whose hands it lay to shame them their colonel their adjutant their regiment and their service had cast away all shadow of his legal rights for the sake of a common or beargarden ragsuch a rag as if it came to the ears of the authorities would cost him his commission they were saved and their saviour was their equal and their brother so they chaffed and reviled him as such till he again squashed the breath out of them and we others laughed louder than they  fall in said stalky when the limousine came round this is the score of the century i wouldnt miss it for a brigade we shant be long infant  i hurried into a coat  is there any necessity for that reporterchap to come too said mr wontner in an unguarded whisper he isnt dressed for one thing  bobby and eames wriggled round to look at the reporter began a joyous bellow and suddenly stopped  whats the matter said wontner with suspicion  nothing said bobby i die happy clausewitz take me up tenderly  we packed into the car bearing our sheaves with us and for half an hour as the cool nightair fanned his thoughtful brow mr wontner was quite abreast of himself though he said nothing unworthy he triumphed and trumpeted a little loudly over the sacks i sat between them on the back seat and applauded him servilely till he reminded me that what i had seen and what he had said was not for publication i hinted while the boys plunged with joy inside their trappings that this might be a matter for arrangement then a sovereign shant part us said mr wontner cheerily and both boys fell into lively hysterics i dont see where the joke comes in for you said mr wontner i thought it was my little jokelet tonight  no clausewitz gasped bobby some is but not all ill be good now ill give you my parole till we get to mess i wouldnt be out of this for a fiver  nor me said eames and he gave his parole to attempt no escape or evasion  now i suppose said mr wontner largely to stalky as we neared the suburbs of ash you have a good deal of practical joking on the stock exchange havent you  and when were you on the stock exchange uncle leonard piped bobby while eames laid his sobbing head on my shoulder  im sorry said stalky but the fact is i command a regiment myself when im at home your colonel knows me i think he gave his name mr wontner seemed to have heard of it we had to pick eames off the floor where he had cast himself from excess of delight  oh heavens said mr wontner after a long pause what have i done what havent i done we felt the temperature in the car rise as he blushed  you didnt talk tactics clausewitz said bobby oh say it wasnt tactics darling  it was said wontner  eames was all among our feet again crying if you dont let me get my arms up ill be sick lets hear what you said tell us  but mr wontner turned to stalky its no good my begging your pardon sir i suppose he said  dont you notice em said stalky it was a fair rag all round and anyhow you two youngsters havent any right to talk tactics youve been rolled up horse foot and guns  ill make a treaty if youll let us go and change presently said bobby ill promise we wont tell about you clausewitz you talked tactics to uncle len old dhurrahbags will like that he dont love you claus  if ive made one ass of myself i shall take extra care to make asses of you said wontner i want to stop please at the next milliners shop on the right it ought to be close here  he evidently knew the country even in the dark for the car stopped at a brilliantlylighted millinery establishment whereit was saturday eveninga young lady was clearing up the counter i followed him as a good reporter should  have you got he began ah thosell do he pointed to two hairy plush beehive bonnets one magenta the other a conscientious electric blue how much please ill take them both and that bunch of peacock feathers and that red feather thing it was a brilliant crimsondyed pigeons wing  now i want some yards of muslin with a nice fierce pattern please he got ityellow with black tulipsand returned heavily laden  sorry to have kept you said he now well go to my quarters to change and beautify  we came to themopposite a dun waste of paradeground that might have been mian mirand bugles as they blew and drums as they rolled set heartstrings echoing  we hoisted the boys out and arranged them on chairs while wontner changed into uniform but stopped when he saw me taking off my jacket  what on earths that for said he  because youve been wearing my evening things i said i want to get into em again if you dont mind  then you arent a reporter he said  no i said but that shant part us  oh hurry cried eames in desperate convulsions we cant stand this much longer tisnt fair on the young  ill attend to you in good time said wontner and when he had made careful toilet he unwrapped the bonnets put the peacocks feather into the magenta one pinned the crimson wing on the blue one set them daintily on the boys heads and bade them admire the effect in his shavingglass while he ripped the muslin into lengths bound it first and draped it artistically afterwards a little below their knees he finished off with a gigantic sashbow obi fashion hobble skirts he explained to stalky who nodded approval  next he split open the bottom of each sack so that they could walk but with very short steps i ought to have got you white satin slippers he murmured and im sorry theres no rouge  dont worry on our account old manyoure doing us proud said bobby from under his hat this beats milkpunch and mayonnaise  oh why didnt we think of these things when we had him at our mercy eames wailed never mindwell try it on the next chap youve a mind claus  now well call on em at mess said wontner as they minced towards the door  i think ill call on your colonel said stalky he oughtnt to miss this your first attempt i assure you i couldnt have done it better myself thank you he held out his hand  thank you sir said wontner shaking it im more grateful to you than i can say andand id like you to believe some time that im not quite as big a  not in the least stalky interrupted if i were writing a confidential report on you i should put you down as rather adequate look after your geishas or theyll fall  we watched the three cross the road and disappear into the shadow of the mess verandah there was a noise then telephone bells rang a sergeant and a mess waiter charged out and the noise grew till at last the mess was a little noisy  we came back ten minutes later with colonel dalziell who had been taking his sorrows to bed with him the anteroom was quite full and visitors were still arriving but it was possible to hear oneself speak occasionally trivett and eames in sack and sash sat side by side on a table their hats at a ravishing angle coquettishly twiddling their tied feet in the intervals of singing put me among the girls they sipped whiskyandsoda held to their lips by i regret to say a major public opinion seemed to be against allowing them to change their costume till they should have danced in it wontner lying more or less gracefully at the level of the chandelier in the arms of six subalterns was lecturing on tactics and imploring to be let down which he was with a run when they realised that the colonel was there then he picked himself up from the sofa and said i want to apologise sir to you and the mess for having been such an ass ever since i joined  this was when the noise began  seeing the night promised to be wet stalky and i went home again in the infants car it was some time since we had tasted the hot air that lies between the cornice and the ceiling of crowded rooms  after half an hours silence stalky said to me i dont know what youve been doing but i believe ive been weepin would you put that down to burgundy or senile decay     the children       these were our children who died for our lands they          were dear in our sight        we have only the memory left of their hometreasured          sayings and laughter        the price of our loss shall be paid to our hands not          anothers hereafter      neither the alien nor priest shall decide on it that is our right            but who shall return us the children       at the hour the barbarian chose to disclose his pretences        and raged against man they engaged on the breasts          that they bared for us        the first felonstroke of the sword he had longtime          prepared for us      their bodies were all our defence while we wrought our defences       they bought us anew with their blood forbearing to blame us      those hours which we had not made good when the judgment           oercame us      they believed us and perished for it our statecraft our learning       delivered them bound to the pit and alive to the burning      whither they mirthfully hastened as jostling for honour      not since her birth has our earth seen such worth loosed upon her       nor was their agony brief or once only imposed on them        the wounded the warspent the sick received no exemption        being cured they returned and endured and achieved our redemption      hopeless themselves of relief till death marvelling closed           on them       that flesh we had nursed from the first in all cleanness was given      to corruption unveiled and assailed by the malice of heaven      by the heartshaking jests of decay where it lolled on the wires      to be blanched or gaypainted by fumesto be cindered by fires      to be senselessly tossed and retossed in stale mutilation      from crater to crater for this we shall take expiation          but who shall return us our children    the dog hervey  april 1914  my friend attley who would give away his own head if you told him you had lost yours was giving away a sixmonthsold litter of bettinas pups and halfadozen women were in raptures at the show on mittleham lawn  we picked by lot mrs godfrey drew first choice her married daughter second i was third but waived my right because i was already owned by malachi bettinas full brother whom i had brought over in the car to visit his nephews and nieces and he would have slain them all if i had taken home one milly mrs godfreys younger daughter pounced on my rejection with squeals of delight and attley turned to a dark sallowskinned slackmouthed girl who had come over for tennis and invited her to pick she put on a pincenez that made her look like a camel knelt clumsily for she was long from the hip to the knee breathed hard and considered the last couple  i think id like that sandypied one she said  oh not him miss sichliffe attley cried he was overlaid or had sunstroke or something they call him the looney in the kennels besides he squints  i think thats rather fetching she answered neither malachi nor i had ever seen a squinting dog before  thats choreast vituss dance mrs godfrey put in he ought to have been drowned  but i like his cast of countenance the girl persisted  he doesnt look a good life i said but perhaps he can be patched up miss sichliffe turned crimson i saw mrs godfrey exchange a glance with her married daughter and knew i had said something which would have to be lived down  yes miss sichliffe went on her voice shaking he isnt a good life but perhaps i canpatch him up come here sir the misshapen beast lurched toward her squinting down his own nose till he fell over his own toes then luckily bettina ran across the lawn and reminded malachi of their puppyhood all that family are as queer as dicks hatband and fight like man and wife i had to separate them and mrs godfrey helped me till they retired under the rhododendrons and had it out in silence  dyou know what that girls father was mrs godfrey asked  no i replied i loathe her for her own sake she breathes through her mouth  he was a retired doctor she explained he used to pick up stormy young men in the repentant stage take them home and patch them up till they were sound enough to be insured then he insured them heavily and let them out into the world againwith an appetite of course no one knew him while he was alive but he left pots of money to his daughter  strictly legitimatehighly respectable i said but what a life for the daughter  mustnt it have been now dyou realise what you said just now  perfectly and now youve made me quite happy shall we go back to the house  when we reached it they were all inside sitting in committee on names  what shall you call yours i heard milly ask miss sichliffe  harvey she repliedharveys sauce you know hes going to be quite saucy when iveshe saw mrs godfrey and me coming through the french windowwhen hes stronger  attley the wellmeaning man to make me feel at ease asked what i thought of the name  oh splendid i said at random h with an a a with an r r with a  but thats little bingo some one said and they all laughed  miss sichliffe her hands joined across her long knees drawled you ought always to verify your quotations  it was not a kindly thrust but something in the word quotation set the automatic side of my brain at work on some shadow of a word or phrase that kept itself out of memorys reach as a cat sits just beyond a dogs jump when i was going home miss sichliffe came up to me in the twilight the pup on a leash swinging her big shoes at the end of her tennisracket  sorry she said in her thick schoolboylike voice im sorry for what i said to you about verifying quotations i didnt know you well enough andanyhow i oughtnt to have  but you were quite right about little bingo i answered the spelling ought to have reminded me  yes of course its the spelling she said and slouched off with the pup sliding after her once again my brain began to worry after something that would have meant something if it had been properly spelled i confided my trouble to malachi on the way home but bettina had bitten him in four places and he was busy  weeks later attley came over to see me and before his car stopped malachi let me know that bettina was sitting beside the chauffeur he greeted her by the scruff of the neck as she hopped down and i greeted mrs godfrey attley and a big basket  youve got to help me said attley tiredly we took the basket into the garden and there staggered out the angular shadow of a sandypied brokenhaired terrier with one imbecile and one delirious ear and two most hideous squints bettina and malachi already at grips on the lawn saw him let go and fled in opposite directions  why have you brought that fetid hound here i demanded  harvey for you to take care of said attley hes had distemper but im going abroad  take him with you i wont have him hes mentally afflicted  look here attley almost shouted do i strike you as a fool  always said i  well then if you say so and ella says so that proves i ought to go abroad  wills wrong quite wrong mrs godfrey interrupted but you must take the pup  my dear boy my dear boy dont you ever give anything to a woman attley snorted  bit by bit i got the story out of them in the quiet garden never a sign from bettina and malachi while harvey stared me out of countenance first with one cuttlefish eye and then with the other  it appeared that a month after miss sichliffe took him the dog harvey developed distemper miss sichliffe had nursed him herself for some time then she carried him in her arms the two miles to mittleham and weptactually weptat attleys feet saying that harvey was all she had or expected to have in this world and attley must cure him attley being by wealth position and temperament guardian to all lame dogs had put everything aside for this unsavoury job and he asserted miss sichliffe had virtually lived with him ever since  she went home at night of course he exploded but the rest of the time she simply infested the premises goodness knows im not particular but it was a scandal even the servants three and four times a day and notes in between to know how the beast was hang it all dont laugh and wanting to send me flowers and goldfish do i look as if i wanted goldfish cant you two stop for a minute mrs godfrey and i were clinging to each other for support and it isnt as if i waswas so alluring a personality is it  attley commands more trust goodwill and affection than most men for he is that rare angel an absolutely unselfish bachelor content to be run by contending syndicates of zealous friends his situation seemed desperate and i told him so  instant flight is your only remedy was my verdict ill take care of both your cars while youre away and you can send me over all the greenhouse fruit  but why should i be chased out of my house by a shedromedary he wailed  oh stop stop mrs godfrey sobbed youre both wrong i admit youre right but i know youre wrong  three and four times a day said attley with an awful countenance im not a vain man butlook here ella im not sensitive i hope but if you persist in making a joke of it  oh be quiet she almost shrieked dyou imagine for one instant that your friends would ever let mittleham pass out of their hands i quite agree it is unseemly for a grown girl to come to mittleham at all hours of the day and night  i told you she went home o nights attley growled  specially if she goes home o nights oh but think of the life she must have led will  im not interfering with it only she must leave me alone  she may want to patch you up and insure you i suggested  dyou know what you are mrs godfrey turned on me with the smile i have feared for the last quarter of a century youre the nice kind wise doggy friend you dont know how wise and nice you are supposed to be will has sent harvey to you to complete the poor angels convalescence you know all about dogs or will wouldnt have done it hes written her that youre too far off for her to make daily calls on you praps shell drop in two or three times a week and write on other days but it doesnt matter what she does because you dont own mittleham dont you see  i told her i saw most clearly  oh youll get over that in a few days mrs godfrey countered youre the sporting responsible doggy friend who  he used to look at me like that at first said attley with a visible shudder but he gave it up after a bit its only because youre new to him  but confound you hes a ghoul i began  and when he gets quite well youll send him back to her direct with your love and shell give you some pretty fourtailed goldfish said mrs godfrey rising thats all settled car please were going to brighton to lunch together  they ran before i could get into my stride so i told the dog harvey what i thought of them and his mistress he never shifted his position but stared at me an intense lopsided stare eye after eye malachi came along when he had seen his sister off and from a distance counselled me to drown the brute and consort with gentlemen again but the dog harvey never even cocked his cockable ear  and so it continued as long as he was with me where i sat he sat and stared where i walked he walked beside head stiffly slewed over one shoulder in singlebarrelled contemplation of me he never gave tongue never closed in for a caress seldom let me stir a step alone and to my amazement malachi who suffered no stranger to live within our gates saw this gaunt growing greeneyed devil wipe him out of my service and company without a whimper indeed one would have said the situation interested him for he would meet us returning from grim walks together and look alternately at harvey and at me with the same quivering interest that he showed at the mouth of a rathole outside these inspections malachi withdrew himself as only a dog or a woman can  miss sichliffe came over after a few days luckily i was out with some elaborate story of paying calls in the neighbourhood she sent me a note of thanks next day i was reading it when harvey and malachi entered and disposed themselves as usual harvey close up to stare at me malachi half under the sofa watching us both out of curiosity i returned harveys stare then pulled his lopsided head on to my knee and took his eye for several minutes now in malachis eye i can see at any hour all that there is of the normal decent dog flecked here and there with that strained halfsoul which mans love and association have added to his nature but with harvey the eye was perplexed as a tortured mans only by looking far into its deeps could one make out the spirit of the proper animal beclouded and cowering beneath some unfair burden  leggatt my chauffeur came in for orders  how dyou think harveys coming on i said as i rubbed the brutes gulping neck the vet had warned me of the possibilities of spinal trouble following distemper  he aint my fancy was the reply but i dont question his comings and goings so long as i avent to sit alone in a room with him  why hes as meek as moses i said  he fair gives me the creeps praps hell go out in fits  but harvey as i wrote his mistress from time to time throve and when he grew better would play by himself grisly games of spying walking up hailing and chasing another dog from these he would break off of a sudden and return to his normal stiff gait with the air of one who had forgotten some matter of life and death which could be reached only by staring at me i left him one evening posturing with the unseen on the lawn and went inside to finish some letters for the post i must have been at work nearly an hour for i was going to turn on the lights when i felt there was somebody in the room whom the short hairs at the back of my neck warned me i was not in the least anxious to face there was a mirror on the wall as i lifted my eyes to it i saw the dog harvey reflected near the shadow by the closed door he had reared himself fulllength on his hind legs his head a little one side to clear a sofa between us and he was looking at me the face with its knitted brows and drawn lips was the face of a dog but the look for the fraction of time that i caught it was humanwholly and horribly human when the blood in my body went forward again he had dropped to the floor and was merely studying me in his usual oneeyed fashion next day i returned him to miss sichliffe i would not have kept him another day for the wealth of asia or even ella godfreys approval  miss sichliffes house i discovered to be a midvictorian mansion of peculiar villainy even for its period surrounded by gardens of conflicting colours all dazzling with glass and fresh paint on ironwork striped blinds for it was a blazing autumn morning covered most of the windows and a voice sang to the piano an almost forgotten song of jean ingelows       methought that the stars were blinking bright        and the old brigs sails unfurled  down came the loud pedal and the unrestrained cry swelled out across a bed of tritomas consuming in their own fires       when i said i will sail to my love this night        on the other side of the world  i have no music but the voice drew i waited till the end       oh maid most dear i am not here        i have no place apart      no dwelling more on sea or shore        but only in thy heart  it seemed to me a poor life that had no more than that to do at eleven oclock of a tuesday forenoon then miss sichliffe suddenly lumbered through a french window in clumsy haste her brows contracted against the light  well she said delivering the word like a spearthrust with the full weight of a body behind it  ive brought harvey back at last i replied here he is  but it was at me she looked not at the dog who had cast himself at her feetlooked as though she would have fished my soul out of my breast on the instant  whawhat did you think of him what did you make of him she panted i was too taken aback for the moment to reply her voice broke as she stooped to the dog at her knees o harvey harvey you utterly worthless old devil she cried and the dog cringed and abased himself in servility that one could scarcely bear to look upon i made to go  oh but please you mustnt she tugged at the cars side wouldnt you like some flowers or some orchids weve really splendid orchids andshe clasped her handsthere are japanese goldfishreal japanese goldfish with four tails if you dont care for em perhaps your friends or somebodyoh please  harvey had recovered himself and i realised that this woman beyond the decencies was fawning on me as the dog had fawned on her  certainly i said ashamed to meet her eye im lunching at mittleham but  theres plenty of time she entreated what do you think of harvey  hes a queer beast i said getting out he does nothing but stare at me  does he stare at you all the time hes with you  always hes doing it now look  we had halted harvey had sat down and was staring from one to the other with a weaving motion of the head  hell do that all day i said what is it harvey  yes what is it harvey she echoed the dogs throat twitched his body stiffened and shook as though he were going to have a fit then he came back with a visible wrench to his unwinking watch  always so she whispered  always i replied and told her something of his life with me she nodded once or twice and in the end led me into the house  there were unaging pitchpine doors of gothic design in it there were inlaid marble mantelpieces and cutsteel fenders there were stupendous wallpapers and octagonal medallioned wedgwood whatnots and blackandgilt austrian images holding candelabra with every other refinement that art had achieved or wealth had bought between 1851 and 1878 and everything reeked of varnish  now she opened a baize door and pointed down a long corridor flanked with more gothic doors this was where we used toto patch em up youve heard of us mrs godfrey told you in the garden the day i got harvey given me ishe drew in her breathi live here by myself and i have a very large income come back harvey  he had tiptoed down the corridor as rigid as ever and was sitting outside one of the shut doors look here she said and planted herself squarely in front of me i tell you this because youyouve patched up harvey too now i want you to remember that my name is moira mother calls me marjorie because its more refined but my real name is moira and i am in my thirtyfourth year  very good i said ill remember all that  thank you then with a sudden swoop into the humility of an abashed boysorry if i havent said the proper things you seetheres harvey looking at us again oh i want to sayif ever you want anything in the way of orchids or goldfish oror anything else that would be useful to you youve only to come to me for it under the will im perfectly independent and were a longlived family worse luck she looked at me and her face worked like glass behind driven flame i may reasonably expect to live another fifty years she said  thank you miss sichliffe i replied if i want anything you may be sure ill come to you for it she nodded now i must get over to mittleham i said  mr attley will ask you all about this for the first time she laughed aloud im afraid i frightened him nearly out of the county i didnt think of course but i dare say he knows by this time he was wrong say goodbye to harvey  goodbye old man i said give me a farewell stare so we shall know each other when we meet again  the dog looked up then moved slowly toward me and stood head bowed to the floor shaking in every muscle as i patted him and when i turned i saw him crawl back to her feet  that was not a good preparation for the rampant boyandgirldominated lunch at mittleham which as usual i found in possession of everybody except the owner  but what did the dromedary say when you brought her beast back attley demanded  the usual polite things i replied im posing as the nice doggy friend nowadays  i dont envy you shes never darkened my doors thank goodness since i left harvey at your place i suppose shell run about the county now swearing you cured him thats a womans idea of gratitude attley seemed rather hurt and mrs godfrey laughed  that proves you were right about miss sichliffe ella i said she had no designs on anybody  im always right in these matters but didnt she even offer you a goldfish  not a thing said i you know what an old maids like where her precious dogs concerned and though i have tried vainly to lie to ella godfrey for many years i believe that in this case i succeeded  when i turned into our drive that evening leggatt observed half aloud  im glad zvengalis back where he belongs its time our mike had a look in  sure enough there was malachi back again in spirit as well as flesh but still with that odd air of expectation he had picked up from harvey                                       it was in january that attley wrote me that mrs godfrey wintering in madeira with milly her unmarried daughter had been attacked with something like enteric that the hotel anxious for its good name had thrust them both out into a cottage annexe that he was off with a nurse and that i was not to leave england till i heard from him again in a week he wired that milly was down as well and that i must bring out two more nurses with suitable delicacies  within seventeen hours i had got them all aboard the cape boat and had seen the women safely collapsed into seasickness the next few weeks were for me as for the invalids a low delirium clouded with fantastic memories of portuguese officials trying to tax calvesfoot jelly voluble doctors insisting that true typhoid was unknown in the island nurses who had to be exercised taken out of themselves and returned on the tick of change of guard night slides down glassy cobbled streets smelling of sewage and flowers between walls whose every stone and patch attley and i knew vigils in stucco verandahs watching the curve and descent of great stars or drawing auguries from the break of dawn insane interludes of gambling at the local casino where we won heaps of unconsoling silver blasts of steamers arriving and departing in the roads help offered by total strangers grabbed at or thrust aside the long nightmare crumbling back into sanity one forenoon under a vinecovered trellis where attley sat hugging a nurse while the others danced a noiseless neatfooted breakdown never learned at the middlesex hospital at last as the tension came out all over us in aches and tingles that we put down to the country wine a vision of mrs godfrey her grey hair turned to spunglass but her eyes triumphant over the shadow of retreating death beneath them with milly enormously grown and clutching life back to her young breast both stretched out on cane chairs clamouring for food  in this ungirt hour there imported himself into our life a youngishlooking middleaged man of the name of shend with a blurred face and deprecating eyes he said he had gambled with me at the casino which was no recommendation and i remember that he twice gave me a basket of champagne and liqueur brandy for the invalids which a sailor in a redtasselled cap carried up to the cottage for me at 3 am he turned out to be the son of some merchant prince in the oil and colour line and the owner of a fourhundredton steam yacht into which at his gentle insistence we later shifted our camp staff and equipage milly weeping with delight to escape from the horrible cottage there we lay off funchal for weeks while shend did miracles of luxury and attendance through deputies and never once asked how his guests were enjoying themselves indeed for several days at a time we would see nothing of him he was he said subject to malaria giving as they do with both hands i knew that attley and mrs godfrey could take nobly but i never met a man who so nobly gave and so nobly received thanks as shend did  tell us why you have been so unbelievably kind to us gipsies mrs godfrey said to him one day on deck  he looked up from a diagram of some thamesmouth shoals which he was explaining to me and answered with his gentle smile  i will its because it makes me happyit makes me more than happyto be with you it makes me comfortable you know how selfish men are if a man feels comfortable all over with certain people hell bore them to death just like a dog you always make me feel as if pleasant things were going to happen to me  havent any ever happened before milly asked  this is the most pleasant thing that has happened to me in ever so many years he replied i feel like the man in the bible its good for me to be here generally i dont feel that its good for me to be anywhere in particular then as one begging a favour youll let me come home with youin the same boat i mean id take you back in this thing of mine and that would save you packing your trunks but shes too lively for spring work across the bay  we booked our berths and when the time came he wafted us and ours aboard the southampton mailboat with the pomp of plenipotentiaries and the precision of the navy then he dismissed his yacht and became an inconspicuous passenger in a cabin opposite to mine on the port side  we ran at once into early british spring weather followed by souwest gales mrs godfrey milly and the nurses disappeared attley stood it out visibly yellowing till the next meal and followed suit and shend and i had the little table all to ourselves i found him even more attractive when the women were away the natural sweetness of the man his voice and bearing all fascinated me and his knowledge of practical seamanship he held an extra masters certificate was a real joy we sat long in the empty saloon and longer in the smokingroom making dashes downstairs over slippery decks at the eleventh hour  it was on friday night just as i was going to bed that he came into my cabin after cleaning his teeth which he did half a dozen times a day  i say he began hurriedly do you mind if i come in here for a little im a bit edgy i must have shown surprise im ever so much better about liquor than i used to be butits the whisky in the suitcase that throws me for gods sake old man dont go back on me tonight look at my hands  they were fairly jumping at the wrists he sat down on a trunk that had slid out with the roll we had reduced speed and were surging in confused seas that pounded on the black portglasses the night promised to be a pleasant one  you understand of course dont you he chattered  oh yes i said cheerily but how about  no no on no account the doctor tell a doctor tell the whole ship besides ive only got a touch of em youd never have guessed it would you the toothwash does the trick ill give you the prescription  ill send a note to the doctor for a prescription shall i i suggested  right i put myself unreservedly in your hands fact is i always did i said to myselfsure i dont bore youthe minute i saw you i said thou art the man he repeated the phrase as he picked at his knees all the same you can take it from me that the ewelamb business is a rotten bad one i dont care how unfaithful the shepherd may be drunk or sober tisnt cricket  a surge of the trunk threw him across the cabin as the steward answered my bell i wrote my requisition to the doctor while shend was struggling to his feet  whats wrong he began oh i know were slowing for soundings off ushant its about time too youd better ship the deadlights when you come back matchem itll save you waking us later this seas going to get up when the tide turns thatll show you he said as the man left that i am to be trusted youyoull stop me if i say anything i shouldnt wont you  talk away i replied if it makes you feel better  thats it youve hit it exactly you always make me feel better i can rely on you its awkward soundings but youll see me through it well defeat him yet i may be an utterly worthless devil but im not a brawler i told him so at breakfast i said doctor i detest brawling but if ever you allow that girl to be insulted again as clements insulted her i will break your neck with my own hands you think i was right  absolutely i agreed  then we neednt discuss the matter any further that man was a murderer in intentionoutside the law you understand as it was then theyve changed it sincebut he never deceived me i told him so i said to him at the time i dont know what price youre going to put on my head but if ever you allow clements to insult her again youll never live to claim it  and what did he do i asked to carry on the conversation for matchem entered with the bromide  oh crumpled up at once lead still going matchem  i avent eard said that faithful servant of the unioncastle company  quite right never alarm the passengers ship the deadlight will you matchem shipped it for we were rolling very heavily there were tramplings and gulllike cries from on deck shend looked at me with a mariners eye  thats nothing he said protectingly  oh its all right for you i said jumping at the idea i havent an extra masters certificate im only a passenger i confess it funks me  instantly his whole bearing changed to answer the appeal  my dear fellow its as simple as houses were hunting for sixtyfive fathom water anything short of sixty with a souwest wind meansbut ill get my channel pilot out of my cabin and give you the general idea im only too grateful to do anything to put your mind at ease  and so perhaps for another hourhe declined the drinkchannel pilot in hand he navigated us round ushant and at my request upchannel to southampton light by light with explanations and reminiscences i professed myself soothed at last and suggested bed  in a second said he now you wouldnt think would youhe glanced off the book toward my wildly swaying dressinggown on the doorthat ive been seeing things for the last halfhour fact is im just on the edge of em skating on thin ice round the cornernoreast as near as nothingwhere that dogs looking at me  whats the dog like i asked  ah that is comforting of you most men walk through em to show me they arent real as if i didnt know but youre different anybody could see that with half an eye he stiffened and pointed damn it all the dog sees it too with half anwhy he knows you knows you perfectly dyou know him  how can i tell if he isnt real i insisted  but you can youre all right i saw that from the first dont go back on me now or i shall go to pieces like the drummond castle i beg your pardon old man but you see you do know the dog ill prove it whats that dog doing come on you know a tremor shook him and he put his hand on my knee and whispered with great meaning ill letter or halve it with you there you begin  s said i to humour him for a dog would most likely be standing or sitting or may be scratching or sniffling or staring  q he went on and i could feel the heat of his shaking hand  u said i there was no other letter possible but i was shaking too  i  n  ting he ran out there that proves it i knew you knew him you dont know what a relief that is between ourselves old man hehes been turning up lately aa damn sight more often than i cared for and a squinting doga dog that squints i mean thats a bit too much eh what he gulped and half rose and i thought that the full tide of delirium would be on him in another sentence  not a bit of it i said as a last chance with my hand over the bellpush why youve just proved that i know him so there are two of us in the game anyhow  by jove that is an idea of course there are i knew youd see me through well defeat them yet hi pup hes gone absolutely disappeared he sighed with relief and i caught the lucky moment  good business i expect he only came to have a look at me i said now get this drink down and turn in to the lower bunk  he obeyed protesting that he could not inconvenience me and in the midst of apologies sank into a dead sleep i expected a wakeful night having a certain amount to think over but no sooner had i scrambled into the top bunk than sleep came on me like a wave from the other side of the world  in the morning there were apologies which we got over at breakfast before our party were about  i supposeafter thiswell i dont blame you im rather a lonely chap though his eyes lifted doglike across the table  shend i replied im not running a sunday school youre coming home with me in my car as soon as we land  that is kind of youkinder than you think  thats because youre a little jumpy still now i dont want to mix up in your private affairs  but id like you to he interrupted  then would you mind telling me the christian name of a girl who was insulted by a man called clements  moira he whispered and just then mrs godfrey and milly came to table with their shoregoing hats on  we did not tie up till noon but the faithful leggatt had intrigued his way down to the dockedge and beside him sat malachi wearing his collar of gold or leggatt makes it look so as eloquent as demosthenes shend flinched a little when he saw him we packed mrs godfrey and milly into attleys carthey were going with him to mittleham of courseand drew clear across the railway lines to find england all lit and perfumed for spring shend sighed with happiness  dyou know he said ifif youd chucked mei should have gone down to my cabin after breakfast and cut my throat and nowits like a dreama good dream you know  we lunched with the other three at romsey then i sat in front for a little while to talk to my malachi when i looked back shend was solidly asleep and stayed so for the next two hours while leggatt chased attleys fat daimler along the greenspeckled hedges he woke up when we said goodbye at mittleham with promises to meet again very soon  and i hope said mrs godfrey that everything pleasant will happen to you  heaps and heapsall at once cried long weak milly waving her wet handkerchief  ive just got to look in at a house near here for a minute to inquire about a dog i said and then we will go home  i used to know this part of the world he replied and said no more till leggatt shot past the lodge at the sichliffess gate then i heard him gasp  miss sichliffe in a green waterproof an orange jersey and a pinkish leather hat was working on a bulbborder she straightened herself as the car stopped and breathed hard shend got out and walked towards her they shook hands turned round together and went into the house then the dog harvey pranced out corkily from under the lee of a bench malachi with one joyous swoop fell on him as an enemy and an equal harvey for his part freed from all burden whatsoever except the obvious duty of a mandog on his own ground met malachi without reserve or remorse and with six months additional growth to come and go on  dont check em cried leggatt dancing round the flurry theyve both been saving up for each other all this time itll do em worlds of good  leggatt i said will you take mr shends bag and suitcase up to the house and put them down just inside the door then we will go on  so i enjoyed the finish alone it was a dead heat and they licked each others jaws in amity till harvey one imploring eye on me leaped into the front seat and malachi backed his appeal it was theft but i took him and we talked all the way home of rrats and rrabbits and bones and baths and the other basic facts of life that evening after dinner they slept before the fire with their warm chins across the hollows of my anklesto each chin an ankletill i kicked them upstairs to bed                                       i was not at mittleham when she came over to announce her engagement but i heard of it when mrs godfrey and attley came forty miles an hour over to me and mrs godfrey called me names of the worst for suppression of information  as long as it wasnt me i dont care said attley  i believe you knew it all along mrs godfrey repeated else what made you drive that man literally into her arms  to ask after the dog harvey i replied  then whats the beast doing here attley demanded for malachi and the dog harvey were deep in a council of the family with bettina who was being outargued  oh harvey seemed to think himself de trop where he was i said and she hasnt sent after him youd better save bettina before they kill her  theres been enough lying about that dog said mrs godfrey to me if he wasnt born in lies he was baptized in em dyou know why she called him harvey it only occurred to me in those dreadful days when i was ill and one cant keep from thinking and thinks everything dyou know your boswell what did johnson say about herveywith an e  oh thats it is it i cried incautiously that was why i ought to have verified my quotations the spelling defeated me wait a moment and it will come back johnson said he was a vicious man i began  but very kind to me mrs godfrey prompted then both together if you call a dog hervey i shall love him  so you were mixed up in it at any rate you had your suspicions from the first tell me she said  ella i said i dont know anything rational or reasonable about any of it it was allall womanwork and it scared me horribly  why she asked  that was six years ago i have written this tale to let her knowwherever she may be    the comforters        until thy feet have trod the road        advise not wayside folk      nor till thy back has borne the load        break in upon the broke       chase not with undesired largesse        of sympathy the heart      which knowing her own bitterness

village that voted the earth was flat  1913   our drive till then had been quite a success the other men in the car were my friend woodhouse young ollyett a distant connection of his and pallant the mp woodhouses business was the treatment and cure of sick journals he knew by instinct the precise moment in a newspapers life when the impetus of past good management is exhausted and it fetches up on the deadcentre between slow and expensive collapse and the new start which can be given by gold injectionsand genius he was wisely ignorant of journalism but when he stooped on a carcase there was sure to be meat he had that week added a halfdead halfpenny evening paper to his collection which consisted of a prosperous london daily one provincial ditto and a limpbodied weekly of commercial leanings he had also that very hour planted me with a large block of the evening papers common shares and was explaining the whole art of editorship to ollyett a young man three years from oxford with coirmattingcoloured hair and a face harshly modelled by harsh experiences who i understood was assisting in the new venture pallant the long wrinkled mp whose voice is more like a cranes than a peacocks took no shares but gave us all advice  youll find it rather a knackers yard woodhouse was saying yes i know they call me the knacker but it will pay inside a year all my papers do ive only one motto back your luck and back your staff itll come out all right  then the car stopped and a policeman asked our names and addresses for exceeding the speedlimit we pointed out that the road ran absolutely straight for half a mile ahead without even a sidelane thats just what we depend on said the policeman unpleasantly  the usual swindle said woodhouse under his breath whats the name of this place  huckley said the policeman huckley and wrote something in his notebook at which young ollyett protested a large red man on a grey horse who had been watching us from the other side of the hedge shouted an order we could not catch the policeman laid his hand on the rim of the right drivingdoor woodhouse carries his spare tyres aft and it closed on the button of the electric horn the grey horse at once bolted and we could hear the rider swearing all across the landscape  damn it man youve got your silly fist on it take it off woodhouse shouted  ho said the constable looking carefully at his fingers as though we had trapped them that wont do you any good either and he wrote once more in his notebook before he allowed us to go  this was woodhouses first brush with motor law and since i expected no ill consequences to myself i pointed out that it was very serious i took the same view myself when in due time i found that i too was summonsed on charges ranging from the use of obscene language to endangering traffic  judgment was done in a little paleyellow markettown with a small jubilee clocktower and a large cornexchange woodhouse drove us there in his car pallant who had not been included in the summons came with us as moral support while we waited outside the fat man on the grey horse rode up and entered into loud talk with his brother magistrates he said to one of themfor i took the trouble to note it downit falls away from my lodgegates dead straight threequarters of a mile id defy any one to resist it we rooked seventy pounds out of em last month no car can resist the temptation you ought to have one your side the county mike they simply cant resist it  whew said woodhouse were in for trouble dont you say a wordor ollyett either ill pay the fines and well get it over as soon as possible wheres pallant  at the back of the court somewhere said ollyett i saw him slip in just now  the fat man then took his seat on the bench of which he was chairman and i gathered from a bystander that his name was sir thomas ingell bart mp of ingell park huckley he began with an allocution pitched in a tone that would have justified revolt throughout empires evidence when the crowded little court did not drown it with applause was given in the pauses of the address they were all very proud of their sir thomas and looked from him to us wondering why we did not applaud too  taking its time from the chairman the bench rollicked with us for seventeen minutes sir thomas explained that he was sick and tired of processions of cads of our type who would be better employed breaking stones on the road than in frightening horses worth more than themselves or their ancestors this was after it had been proved that woodhouses man had turned on the horn purposely to annoy sir thomas who happened to be riding by there were other remarks tooprimitive enoughbut it was the unspeakable brutality of the tone even more than the quality of the justice or the laughter of the audience that stung our souls out of all reason when we were dismissedto the tune of twentythree pounds twelve shillings and sixpencewe waited for pallant to join us while we listened to the next caseone of driving without a licence ollyett with an eye to his evening paper had already taken very full notes of our own but we did not wish to seem prejudiced  its all right said the reporter of the local paper soothingly we never report sir thomas in extenso only the fines and charges  oh thank you ollyett replied and i heard him ask who every one in court might be the local reporter was very communicative  the new victim a large flaxenhaired man in somewhat striking clothes to which sir thomas now thoroughly warmed drew public attention said that he had left his licence at home sir thomas asked him if he expected the police to go to his home address at jerusalem to find it for him and the court roared nor did sir thomas approve of the mans name but insisted on calling him mr masquerader and every time he did so all his people shouted evidently this was their established autodafÃ©  he didnt summons mebecause im in the house i suppose i think i shall have to ask a question said pallant reappearing at the close of the case  i think i shall have to give it a little publicity too said woodhouse we cant have this kind of thing going on you know his face was set and quite white pallants on the other hand was black and i know that my very stomach had turned with rage ollyett was dum  well lets have lunch woodhouse said at last then we can get away before the show breaks up  we drew ollyett from the arms of the local reporter crossed the market square to the red lion and found sir thomass mr masquerader just sitting down to beer beef and pickles  ah said he in a large voice companions in misfortune wont you gentlemen join me  delighted said woodhouse what did you get  i havent decided it might make a good turn butthe public arent educated up to it yet its beyond em if it wasnt that red dub on the bench would be worth fifty a week  where said woodhouse the man looked at him with unaffected surprise  at any one of my places he replied but perhaps you live here  good heavens cried young ollyett suddenly you are masquerier then i thought you were  bat masquerier he let the words fall with the weight of an international ultimatum yes thats all i am but you have the advantage of me gentlemen  for the moment while we were introducing ourselves i was puzzled then i recalled prismatic musichall postersof enormous acreagethat had been the unnoticed background of my visits to london for years past posters of men and women singers jongleurs impersonators and audacities of every draped and undraped brand all moved on and off in london and the provinces by bat masquerierwith the long wedgetailed flourish following the final r  i knew you at once said pallant the trained mp and i promptly backed the lie woodhouse mumbled excuses bat masquerier was not moved for or against us any more than the frontage of one of his own palaces  i always tell my people theres a limit to the size of the lettering he said overdo that and the retna doesnt take it in advertisin is the most delicate of all the sciences  theres one man in the world who is going to get a little of it if i live for the next twentyfour hours said woodhouse and explained how this would come about  masquerier stared at him lengthily with gunmetalblue eyes  you mean it he drawled the voice was as magnetic as the look  i do said ollyett that business of the horn alone ought to have him off the bench in three months masquerier looked at him even longer than he had looked at woodhouse  he told me he said suddenly that my homeaddress was jerusalem you heard that  but it was the tonethe tone ollyett cried  you noticed that too did you said masquerier thats the artistic temperament you can do a lot with it and im bat masquerier he went on he dropped his chin in his fists and scowled straight in front of him i made the silhouettesi made the trefoil and the jocunda i made dal benzaguen here ollyett sat straight up for in common with the youth of that year he worshipped miss vidal benzaguen of the trefoil immensely and unreservedly is that a dressinggown or an ulster youre supposed to be wearing you heard that and i suppose you hadnt time to brush your hair either you heard that now you hear me his voice filled the coffeeroom then dropped to a whisper as dreadful as a surgeons before an operation he spoke for several minutes pallant muttered hear hear i saw ollyetts eye flashit was to ollyett that masquerier addressed himself chieflyand woodhouse leaned forward with joined hands  are you with me he went on gathering us all up in one sweep of the arm when i begin a thing i see it through gentlemen what bat cant break breaks him but i havent struck that thing yet this is no oneturn turnitdown show this is business to the dead finish are you with me gentlemen good now well pool our assets one london morning and one provincial daily didnt you say one weekly commercial ditto and one mp  not much use im afraid pallant smirked  but privileged but privileged he returned and we have also my little teamlondon blackburn liverpool leedsill tell you about manchester laterand me bat masquerier he breathed the name reverently into his tankard gentlemen when our combination has finished with sir thomas ingell bart mp and everything else that is his sodom and gomorrah will be a winsome bit of merrie england beside em i must go back to town now but i trust you gentlemen will give me the pleasure of your company at dinner tonight at the chop sueythe red amber roomand well block out the scenario he laid his hand on young ollyetts shoulder and added its your brains i want then he left in a good deal of astrachan collar and nickelplated limousine and the place felt less crowded  we ordered our car a few minutes later as woodhouse ollyett and i were getting in sir thomas ingell bart mp came out of the hall of justice across the square and mounted his horse i have sometimes thought that if he had gone in silence he might even then have been saved but as he settled himself in the saddle he caught sight of us and must needs shout not off yet youd better get away and youd better be careful at that moment pallant who had been buying picturepostcards came out of the inn took sir thomass eye and very leisurely entered the car it seemed to me that for one instant there was a shade of uneasiness on the baronets greywhiskered face  i hope said woodhouse after several miles i hope hes a widower  yes said pallant for his poor dear wifes sake i hope that very much indeed i suppose he didnt see me in court oh heres the parish history of huckley written by the rector and heres your share of the picturepostcards are we all dining with this mr masquerier tonight  yes said we all                                       if woodhouse knew nothing of journalism young ollyett who had graduated in a hard school knew a good deal our halfpenny evening paper which we will call the bun to distinguish her from her prosperous morning sister the cake was not only diseased but corrupt we found this out when a man brought us the prospectus of a new oilfield and demanded subleaders on its prosperity ollyett talked pure brasenose to him for three minutes otherwise he spoke and wrote tradeenglisha toothsome amalgam of americanisms and epigrams but though the slang changes the game never alters and ollyett and i and in the end some others enjoyed it immensely it was weeks ere we could see the wood for the trees but so soon as the staff realised that they had proprietors who backed them right or wrong and specially when they were wrong which is the sole secret of journalism and that their fate did not hang on any passing owners passing mood they did miracles  but we did not neglect huckley as ollyett said our first care was to create an arresting atmosphere round it he used to visit the village of weekends on a motorbicycle with a sidecar for which reason i left the actual place alone and dealt with it in the abstract yet it was i who drew first blood two inhabitants of huckley wrote to contradict a small quite solid paragraph in the bun that a hoopoe had been seen at huckley and had of course been shot by the local sportsmen there was some heat in their letters both of which we published our version of how the hoopoe got his crest from king solomon was i grieve to say so inaccurate that the rector himselfno sportsman as he pointed out but a lover of accuracywrote to us to correct it we gave his letter good space and thanked him  this priest is going to be useful said ollyett he has the impartial mind i shall vitalise him  forthwith he created ml sigden a recluse of refined tastes who in the bun demanded to know whether this huckleyofthehoopoe was the hugly of his boyhood and whether by any chance the fell change of name had been wrought by collusion between a local magnate and the railway in the mistaken interests of spurious refinement for i knew it and loved it with the maidens of my dayeheu ab anguloas hugly wrote ml sigden from oxf  though other papers scoffed the bun was gravely sympathetic several people wrote to deny that huckley had been changed at birth only the rectorno philosopher as he pointed out but a lover of accuracyhad his doubts which he laid publicly before mr ml sigden who suggested through the bun that the little place might have begun life in anglosaxon days as hogslea or among the normans as argilÃ© on account of its much clay the rector had his own ideas too he said it was mostly gravel and ml sigden had a fund of reminiscences oddly enoughwhich is seldom the case with free readingmatterour subscribers rather relished the correspondence and contemporaries quoted freely  the secret of power said ollyett is not the big stick its the liftable stick this means the arresting quotation of six or seven lines did you see the spec had a middle on rural tenacities last week that was all huckley im doing a mobiquity on huckley next week  our mobiquities were friday evening accounts of easy motorbikecumsidecar trips round london illustrated we could never get that machine to work properly by smudgy maps ollyett wrote the stuff with a fervour and a delicacy which i always ascribed to the sidecar his account of epping forest for instance was simply young love with its soul at its lips but his huckley mobiquity would have sickened a soapboiler it chemically combined loathsome familiarity leering suggestion slimy piety and rancid social service in one fuming compost that fairly lifted me off my feet  yes said he after compliments its the most vital arresting and dynamic bit of tump ive done up to date non nobis gloria i met sir thomas ingell in his own park he talked to me again he inspired most of it  which the glutinous native drawl or the neglected adenoids of the village children i demanded  oh no thats only to bring in the panel doctor its the last flight weim proudest of  this dealt with the crepuscular penumbra spreading her dim limbs over the boskage with jolly rabbits with a herd of gravid polled angus and with the arresting gipsylike face of their swart scholarly owneras well known at the royal agricultural shows as that of our late kingemperor  swart is good and sos gravid said i but the panel doctor will be annoyed about the adenoids  not half as much as sir thomas will about his face said ollyett and if you only knew what ive left out  he was right the panel doctor spent his weekend this is the advantage of friday articles in overwhelming us with a professional counterblast of no interest whatever to our subscribers we told him so and he then and there battered his way with it into the lancet where they are keen on glands and forgot us altogether but sir thomas ingell was of sterner stuff he must have spent a happy weekend too the letter which we received from him on monday proved him to be a kinless loon of upright life for no woman however remotely interested in a man would have let it pass the home wastepaperbasket he objected to our references to his own herd to his own labours in his own village which he said was a model village and to our infernal insolence but he objected most to our invoice of his features we wrote him courtously to ask whether the letter was meant for publication he remembering i presume the duke of wellington wrote back publish and be damned  oh this is too easy ollyett said as he began heading the letter  stop a minute i said the game is getting a little beyond us tonights the bat dinner i may have forgotten to tell you that our dinner with bat masquerier in the red amber room of the chop suey had come to be a weekly affair hold it over till theyve all seen it  perhaps youre right he said you might waste it  at dinner then sir thomass letter was handed round bat seemed to be thinking of other matters but pallant was very interested  ive got an idea he said presently could you put something into the bun tomorrow about footandmouth disease in that fellows herd  oh plague if you like ollyett replied theyre only five measly shorthorns i saw one lying down in the park shell serve as a substratum of fact  then do that and hold the letter over meanwhile i think i come in here said pallant  why said i  because theres something coming up in the house about footandmouth and because he wrote me a letter after that little affair when he fined you took ten days to think it over here you are said pallant house of commons paper you see  we read       dear pallantalthough in the past our paths have not lain      much together i am sure you will agree with me that on the      floor of the house all members are on a footing of equality      i make bold therefore to approach you in a matter which i      think capable of a very different interpretation from that      which perhaps was put upon it by your friends will you let      them know that that was the case and that i was in no way      swayed by animus in the exercise of my magisterial duties      which as you as a brother magistrate can imagine are      frequently very distasteful toyours very sincerely       t ingell       psi have seen to it that the motor vigilance to which      your friends took exception has been considerably relaxed in      my district  what did you answer said ollyett when all our opinions had been expressed  i told him i couldnt do anything in the matter and i couldntthen but youll remember to put in that footandmouth paragraph i want something to work upon  it seems to me the bun has done all the work up to date i suggested when does the cake come in  the cake said woodhouse and i remembered afterwards that he spoke like a cabinet minister on the eve of a budget reserves to itself the fullest right to deal with situations as they arise  yeeh bat masquerier shook himself out of his thoughts situations as they arise i aint idle either but theres no use fishing till the swims baited youhe turned to ollyettmanufacture very good groundbait i always tell my peoplewhat the deuce is that  there was a burst of song from another private diningroom across the landing it ees some ladies from the trefoil the waiter began  oh i know that what are they singing though  he rose and went out to be greeted by shouts of applause from that merry company then there was silence such as one hears in the formroom after a masters entry then a voice that we loved began again here we go gathering nuts in maynuts in maynuts in may  its only daland some nuts he explained when he returned she says shes coming in to dessert he sat down humming the old tune to himself and till miss vidal benzaguen entered he held us speechless with tales of the artistic temperament  we obeyed pallant to the extent of slipping into the bun a wary paragraph about cows lying down and dripping at the mouth which might be read either as an unkind libel or in the hands of a capable lawyer as a piece of faithful naturestudy  and besides said ollyett we allude to gravid polled angus i am advised that no action can lie in respect of virgin shorthorns pallant wants us to come to the house tonight hes got us places for the strangers gallery im beginning to like pallant  masquerier seems to like you i said  yes but im afraid of him ollyett answered with perfect sincerity i am hes the absolutely amoral soul ive never met one yet  we went to the house together it happened to be an irish afternoon and as soon as i had got the cries and the faces a little sorted out i gathered there were grievances in the air but how many of them was beyond me  its all right said ollyett of the trained ear theyve shut their ports againstoh yesexport of irish cattle footandmouth disease at ballyhellion i see pallants idea  the house was certainly all mouth for the moment but as i could feel quite in earnest a minister with a piece of typewritten paper seemed to be fending off volleys of insults he reminded me somehow of a nervous huntsman breaking up a fox in the face of rabid hounds  its questiontime theyre asking questions said ollyett look pallants up  there was no mistaking it his voice which his enemies said was his one parliamentary asset silenced the hubbub as toothache silences mere singing in the ears he said  arising out of that may i ask if any special consideration has recently been shown in regard to any suspected outbreak of this disease on this side of the channel  he raised his hand it held a noon edition of the bun we had thought it best to drop the paragraph out of the later ones he would have continued but something in a grey frockcoat roared and bounded on a bench opposite and waved another bun it was sir thomas ingell  as the owner of the herd so dastardly implicated his voice was drowned in shouts of orderthe irish leading  whats wrong i asked ollyett hes got his hat on his head hasnt he  yes but his wrath should have been put as a question  arising out of that mr speaker sirrr sir thomas bellowed through a lull are you aware thatthat all this is a conspiracypart of a dastardly conspiracy to make huckley ridiculousto make us ridiculous part of a deeplaid plot to make me ridiculous mr speaker sir  the mans face showed almost black against his white whiskers and he struck out swimmingly with his arms his vehemence puzzled and held the house for an instant and the speaker took advantage of it to lift his pack from ireland to a new scent he addressed sir thomas ingell in tones of measured rebuke meant also i imagine for the whole house which lowered its hackles at the word then pallant shocked and pained i can only express my profound surprise that in response to my simple question the honourable member should have thought fit to indulge in a personal attack if i have in any way offended  again the speaker intervened for it appeared that he regulated these matters  he too expressed surprise and sir thomas sat back in a hush of reprobation that seemed to have the chill of the centuries behind it the empires work was resumed  beautiful said i and i felt hot and cold up my back  and now well publish his letter said ollyett  we didon the heels of his carefully reported outburst we made no comment with that rare instinct for grasping the heart of a situation which is the mark of the anglosaxon all our contemporaries and i should say twothirds of our correspondents demanded how such a person could be made more ridiculous than he had already proved himself to be but beyond spelling his name injle we alone refused to hit a man when he was down  theres no need said ollyett the whole press is on the buckle from end to end  even woodhouse was a little astonished at the ease with which it had come about and said as much  rot said ollyett we havent really begun huckley isnt news yet  what do you mean said woodhouse who had grown to have great respect for his young but by no means distant connection  mean by the grace of god master ridley i mean to have it so that when huckley turns over in its sleep reuters and the press association jump out of bed to cable then he went off at score about certain restorations in huckley church which he saidand he seemed to spend his every weekend therehad been perpetrated by the rectors predecessor who had abolished a leperwindow or a squinchhole whatever these may be to institute a lavatory in the vestry it did not strike me as stuff for which reuters or the press association would lose much sleep and i left him declaiming to woodhouse about a fourteenthcentury font which he said he had unearthed in the sextons toolshed  my methods were more on the lines of peaceful penetration an odd copy in the buns ragandbone library of hones everyday book had revealed to me the existence of a village dance founded like all village dances on druidical mysteries connected with the solar solstice which is always unchallengeable and midsummer morning which is dewy and refreshing to the london eye for this i take no credithone being a mine any one can workbut that i rechristened that dance after i had revised it the gubby is my title to immortal fame it was still to be witnessed i wrote in all its poignant purity at huckley that last home of significant mediÃ¦val survivals and i fell so in love with my creation that i kept it back for days enamelling and burnishing  yous better put it in said ollyett at last its time we asserted ourselves again the other fellows are beginning to poach you saw that thing in the pinnacle about sir thomass model village he must have got one of their chaps down to do it  nothing like the wounds of a friend i said that account of the nonalcoholic pub alone was  i liked the bit best about the whitetiled laundry and the fallen virgins who wash sir thomass dress shirts our side couldnt come within a mile of that you know we havent the proper flair for sexual slobber  thats what im always saying i retorted leave em alone the other fellows are doing our work for us now besides i want to touch up my gubby dance a little more  no youll spoil it lets shove it in today for one thing its literature i dont go in for compliments as you know but etc etc  i had a healthy suspicion of young ollyett in every aspect but though i knew that i should have to pay for it i fell to his flattery and my priceless article on the gubby dance appeared next saturday he asked me to bring out the bun in his absence which i naturally assumed would be connected with the little maroon sidecar i was wrong  on the following monday i glanced at the cake at breakfasttime to make sure as usual of her inferiority to my beloved but unremunerative bun i opened on a heading the village that voted the earth was flat i read  i read that the geoplanarian societya society devoted to the proposition that the earth is flathad held its annual banquet and exercises at huckley on saturday when after convincing addresses amid scenes of the greatest enthusiasm huckley village had decided by an unanimous vote of 438 that the earth was flat i do not remember that i breathed again till i had finished the two columns of description that followed only one man could have written them they were flawlesscrisp nervous austere yet human poignant vital arrestingmost distinctly arrestingdynamic enough to shift a cityand quotable by whole sticks at a time and there was a leader a grave and poised leader which tore me in two with mirth until i remembered that i had been left outinfamously and unjustifiably dropped i went to ollyetts rooms he was breakfasting and to do him justice looked consciencestricken  it wasnt my fault he began it was bat masquerier i swear i would have asked you to come if  never mind that i said its the best bit of work youve ever done or will do did any of it happen  happen heavens dyou think even i could have invented it  is it exclusive to the cake i cried  it cost bat masquerier two thousand ollyett replied dyou think hed let any one else in on that but i give you my sacred word i knew nothing about it till he asked me to come down and cover it he had huckley posted in three colours the geoplanarians annual banquet and exercises yes he invented geoplanarians he wanted huckley to think it meant aeroplanes yes i know that there is a real society that thinks the worlds flatthey ought to be grateful for the liftbut bat made his own he did he created the whole show i tell you he swept out half his halls for the job think of thaton a saturday theywe went down in motor charÃ bancsthree of emone pink one primrose and one forgetmenot bluetwenty people in each one and the earth is flat on each side and across the back i went with teddy rickets and lafone from the trefoil and both the silhouette sisters andwait a minutethe crossleigh trio you know the everyday dramas trio at the jocundaada crossleigh bunt crossleigh and little victorine them and there was hoke ramsden the lightningchange chap in morgiana and drexeland there was billy turpeen yes you know him the north london star im the referee that got himself disliked at blackheath that chap and there was mackayethat oneeyed scotch fellow that all glasgow is crazy about talk of subordinating yourself for arts sake mackaye was the earnest inquirer who got converted at the end of the meeting and there was quite a lot of girls i didnt know andoh yesthere was dal dal benzaguen herself we sat together going and coming shes all the darling there ever was she sent you her love and she told me to tell you that she wont forget about nellie farren she says youve given her an ideal to work for she oh she was the lady secretary to the geoplanarians of course i forget who were in the other brakesprovincial stars mostlybut they played up gorgeously the art of the musichalls changed since your day they didnt overdo it a bit you see people who believe the earth is flat dont dress quite like other people you may have noticed that i hinted at that in my account its a rather flatfronted ionic styleneovictorian except for the bustles dal told mebut dal looked heavenly in it so did little victorine and there was a girl in the blue brakeshes a provincialbut shes coming to town this winter and shell knock emwinnie deans remember that she told huckley how she had suffered for the cause as a governess in a rich family where they believed that the world is round and how she threw up her job sooner than teach immoral geography that was at the overflow meeting outside the baptist chapel she knocked em to sawdust we must look out for winnie but lafone lafone was beyond everything impact personalityconvictionthe whole bag o tricks he sweated conviction gad he convinced me while he was speaking him he was president of the geoplanarians of course havent you read my account it is an infernally plausible theory after all no one has actually proved the earth is round have they  never mind the earth what about huckley  oh huckley got tight thats the worst of these model villages if you let em smell firewater theres one alcoholic pub in the place that sir thomas cant get rid of bat made it his base he sent down the banquet in two motor lorriesdinner for five hundred and drinks for ten thousand huckley voted all right dont you make any mistake about that no vote no dinner a unanimous voteexactly as ive said at least the rector and the doctor were the only dissentients we didnt count them oh yes sir thomas was there he came and grinned at us through his park gates hell grin worse today theres an aniline dye that you rub through a stencilplate that eats about a foot into any stone and wears good to the last bat had both the lodgegates stencilled the earth is flat and all the barns and walls they could get at oh lord but huckley was drunk we had to fill em up to make em forgive us for not being aeroplanes unthankful yokels dyou realise that emperors couldnt have commanded the talent bat decanted on em why dal alone was and by eight oclock not even a bit of paper left the whole show packed up and gone and huckley hooraying for the earth being flat  very good i began i am as you know a onethird proprietor of the bun  i didnt forget that ollyett interrupted that was uppermost in my mind all the time ive got a special account for the bun todayits an idylland just to show how i thought of you i told dal coming home about your gubby dance and she told winnie winnie came back in our charÃ banc after a bit we had to get out and dance it in a field its quite a dance the way we did itand lafone invented a sort of gorilla lockstep procession at the end bat had sent down a filmchap on the chance of getting something he was the son of a clergymana most dynamic personality he said there isnt anything for the cinema in meetings qua meetingsthey lack action films are a branch of art by themselves but he went wild over the gubby he said it was like peters vision at joppa he took about a million feet of it then i photoed it exclusive for the bun ive sent em in already only remember we must eliminate winnies left leg in the first figure its too arresting and there you are but i tell you im afraid of bat that mans the personal devil he did it all he didnt even come down himself he said hed distract his people  why didnt he ask me to come i persisted  because he said youd distract me he said he wanted my brains on ice he got em i believe its the best thing ive ever done he reached for the cake and reread it luxuriously yes out and away the bestsupremely quotable he concluded andafter another surveyby god what a genius i was yesterday  i would have been angry but i had not the time that morning press agencies grovelled to me in the bun office for leave to use certain photos which they understood i controlled of a certain village dance when i had sent the fifth man away on the edge of tears my selfrespect came back a little then there was the buns poster to get out art being elimination i fined it down to two words one too many as it provedthe gubby in red at which our manager protested but by five oclock he told me that i was the napoleon of fleet street ollyetts account in the bun of the geoplanarians exercises and love feast lacked the supreme shock of his version in the cake but it bruised more while the photos of the gubby which with winnies left leg was why i had set the doubtful press to work so early were beyond praise and next day beyond price but even then i did not understand  a week later i think it was bat masquerier telephoned to me to come to the trefoil  its your turn now he said im not asking ollyett come to the stagebox  i went and as bats guest was received as royalty is not we sat well back and looked out on the packed thousands it was morgiana and drexel that fluid and electric review which batthough he gave lafone the creditreally created  yees said bat dreamily after morgiana had given the nasty jar to the forty thieves in their forty oil combinations as you say ive got em and i can hold em what a man does doesnt matter much and how he does it dont matter either its the whenthe psychological moment press cant make up for it money cant brains cant a lots luck but all the rest is genius im not speaking about my people now im talking of myself  then dalshe was the only one who daredknocked at the door and stood behind us all alive and panting as morgiana lafone was carrying the policecourt scene and the house was ripped up crossways with laughter  ah tell a fellow now she asked me for the twentieth time did you love nellie farren when you were young  did we love her i answered if the earth and the sky and the seathere were three million of us dal and we worshipped her  how did she get it across dal went on  she was nellie the houses used to coo over her when she came on  ive had a good deal but ive never been cooed over yet said dal wistfully  it isnt the how its the when bat repeated ah  he leaned forward as the house began to rock and peal fullthroatedly dal fled a sinuous and silent procession was filing into the policecourt to a scarcely audible accompaniment it was dressedbut the world and all its picturepalaces know how it was dressed it danced and it danced and it danced the dance which bit all humanity in the leg for half a year and it wound up with the lockstep finale that mowed the house down in swathes sobbing and aching somebody in the gallery moaned oh gord the gubby and we heard the word run like a shudder for they had not a full breath left among them then dal came on an electric star in her dark hair the diamonds flashing in her threeinch heelsa vision that made no sign for thirty counted seconds while the policecourt scene dissolved behind her into morgianas manicure palace and they recovered themselves the star on her forehead went out and a soft light bathed her as she tookslowly slowly to the croon of adoring stringsthe eighteen paces forward we saw her first as a queen alone next as a queen for the first time conscious of her subjects and at the end when her hands fluttered as a woman delighted awed not a little but transfigured and illuminated with sheer compelling affection and goodwill i caught the broken mutter of welcomethe coo which is more than tornadoes of applause it died and rose and died again lovingly  shes got it across bat whispered ive never seen her like this i told her to light up the star but i was wrong and she knew it shes an artist  dal you darling some one spoke not loudly but it carried through the house  thank you dal answered and in that broken tone one heard the last fetter riveted good evening boys ive just come fromnowwhere the dooce was it i have come from she turned to the impassive files of the gubby dancers and went on ah so good of you to remind me you dear bunfaced things ive just come from the villagethe village that voted the earth was flat  she swept into that song with the full orchestra it devastated the habitable earth for the next six months imagine then what its rage and pulse must have been at the incandescent hour of its birth she only gave the chorus once at the end of the second verse are you with me boys she cried and the house tore it clean away from herearth was flatearth was flat flat as my hatflatter than thatdrowning all but the bassoons and doublebasses that marked the word  wonderful i said to bat and its only nuts in may with variations  yesbut i did the variations he replied  at the last verse she gestured to carlini the conductor who threw her up his baton she caught it with a boys ease are you with me she cried once more andthe maddened house behind herabolished all the instruments except the guttural belch of the doublebasses on earththe village that voted the earth was flatearth was flat it was delirium then she picked up the gubby dancers and led them in a clattering improvised lockstep thrice round the stage till her last kick sent her diamondhiked shoe catherinewheeling to the electrolier  i saw the forest of hands raised to catch it heard the roaring and stamping pass through hurricanes to full typhoon heard the song pinned down by the faithful doublebasses as the bulldog pins down the bellowing bull overbear even those till at last the curtain fell and bat took me round to her dressingroom where she lay spent after her seventh call still the song through all those whitewashed walls shook the reinforced concrete of the trefoil as steam piledrivers shake the flanks of a dock  im all outfirst time in my life ah tell a fellow now did i get it across she whispered huskily  you know you did i replied as she dipped her nose deep in a beaker of barleywater they cooed over you  bat nodded and poor nellies deadin africa aint it  i hope ill die before they stop cooing said dal  earth was flatearth was flat now it was more like minepumps in flood  theyll have the house down if you dont take another some one called  bless em said dal and went out for her eighth when in the face of that cataract she said yawning i dont know how you feel children but im dead you be quiet  hold a minute said bat to me ive got to hear how it went in the provinces winnie deans had it in manchester and ramsden at glasgowand there are all the films too i had rather a heavy weekend  the telephones presently reassured him  itll do said he and he said my home address was jerusalem he left me humming the refrain of the holy city like ollyett i found myself afraid of that man  when i got out into the street and met the disgorging picturepalaces capering on the pavements and humming it for he had put the gramophones on with the films and when i saw far to the south the red electrics flash gubby across the thames i feared more than ever                                       a few days passed which were like nothing except perhaps a suspense of fever in which the sick man perceives the searchlights of the worlds assembled navies in act to converge on one minute fragment of wreckageone only in all the black and agonystrewn sea then those beams focussed themselves earth as we knew itthe full circuit of our orblaid the weight of its impersonal and searing curiosity on this huckley which had voted that it was flat it asked for news about huckleywhere and what it might be and how it talkedit knew how it dancedand how it thought in its wonderful soul and then in all the zealous merciless press huckley was laid out for it to look at as a drop of pond water is exposed on the sheet of a magiclantern show but huckleys sheet was only coterminous with the use of type among mankind for the precise moment that was necessary fate ruled it that there should be nothing of first importance in the worlds idle eye one atrocious murder a political crisis an incautious or heady continental statesman the mere catarrh of a king would have wiped out the significance of our message as a passing cloud annuls the urgent helio but it was halcyon weather in every respect ollyett and i did not need to lift our little fingers any more than the alpine climber whose last sentence has unkeyed the arch of the avalanche the thing roared and pulverised and swept beyond eyesight all by itselfall by itself and once well away the fall of kingdoms could not have diverted it  ours is after all a kindly earth while the song ran and raped it with the cataleptic kick of tararaboomdeay multiplied by the west african significance of everybodys doing it plus twice the infernal elementality of a certain tune in dona et gamma when for all practical purposes literary dramatic artistic social municipal political commercial and administrative the earth was flat the rector of huckley wrote to usagain as a lover of accuracyto point out that the huckley vote on the alleged flatness of this scene of our labours here below was not unanimous he and the doctor having voted against it and the great baron reuter himself i am sure it could have been none other flashed that letter in full to the front back and both wings of this scene of our labours for huckley was news the bun also contributed a photograph which cost me some trouble to fake  we are a vital nation said ollyett while we were discussing affairs at a bat dinner only an englishman could have written that letter at this present juncture  it reminded me of a tourist in the cave of the winds under niagara just one figure in a mackintosh but perhaps you saw our photo i said proudly  yes bat replied ive been to niagara too and hows huckley taking it  they dont quite understand of course said ollyett but its bringing pots of money into the place ever since the motorbus excursions were started  i didnt know they had been said pallant  oh yes motor charÃ bancsuniformed guides and keybugles included theyre getting a bit fed up with the tune there nowadays ollyett added  they play it under his windows dont they bat asked he cant stop the right of way across his park  he cannot ollyett answered by the way woodhouse ive bought that font for you from the sexton i paid fifteen pounds for it  what am i supposed to do with it asked woodhouse  you give it to the victoria and albert museum it is fourteenthcentury work all right you can trust me  is it worth itnow said pallant not that im weakening but merely as a matter of tactics  but this is true said ollyett besides it is my hobby i always wanted to be an architect ill attend to it myself its too serious for the bun and miles too good for the cake  he broke ground in a ponderous architectural weekly which had never heard of huckley there was no passion in his statement but mere fact backed by a wide range of authorities he established beyond doubt that the old font at huckley had been thrown out on sir thomass instigation twenty years ago to make room for a new one of bath stone adorned with limoges enamels and that it had lain ever since in a corner of the sextons shed he proved with learned men to support him that there was only one other font in all england to compare with it so woodhouse bought it and presented it to a grateful south kensington which said it would see the earth still flatter before it returned the treasure to purblind huckley bishops by the benchful and most of the royal academy not to mention margaritas ante porcos wrote fervently to the papers punch based a political cartoon on it the times a third leader the lust of newness and the spectator a scholarly and delightful middle village hausmania the vast amused outside world said in all its tongues and types of course this is just what huckley would do and neither sir thomas nor the rector nor the sexton nor any one else wrote to deny it  you see said ollyett this is much more of a blow to huckley than it looksbecause every word of its true your gubby dance was inspiration i admit but it hadnt its roots in  two hemispheres and four continents so far i pointed out  its roots in the hearts of huckley was what i was going to say why dont you ever come down and look at the place youve never seen it since we were stopped there  ive only my weekends free i said and you seem to spend yours there pretty regularlywith the sidecar i was afraid  oh thats all right he said cheerily were quite an old engaged couple now as a matter of fact it happened after the gravid polled angus business come along this saturday woodhouse says hell run us down after lunch he wants to see huckley too  pallant could not accompany us but bat took his place  its odd said bat that none of us except ollyett has ever set eyes on huckley since that time thats what i always tell my people local colour is all right after youve got your idea before that its a mere nuisance he regaled us on the way down with panoramic views of the successgeographical and financialof the gubby and the song  by the way said he ive assigned dal all the gramophone rights of the earth shes a born artist hadnt sense enough to hit me for tripledubs the morning after shed have taken it out in coos  bless her and whatll she make out of the gramophone rights i asked  lord knows he replied ive made fiftyfour thousand my little end of the business and its only just beginning hear that  a shellpink motorbrake roared up behind us to the music on a keybugle of the village that voted the earth was flat in a few minutes we overtook another in natural wood whose occupants were singing it through their noses  i dont know that agency it must be cooks said ollyett they do suffer we were never out of earshot of the tune the rest of the way to huckley  though i knew it would be so i was disappointed with the actual aspect of the spot we hadit is not too much to saycreated in the face of the nations the alcoholic pub the village green the baptist chapel the church the sextons shed the rectory whence the sowonderful letters had come sir thomass park gatepillars still violently declaring the earth is flat were as mean as average as ordinary as the photograph of a room where a murder has been committed ollyett who of course knew the place specially well made the most of it to us bat who had employed it as a backcloth to one of his own dramas dismissed it as a thing used and emptied but woodhouse expressed my feelings when he said is that allafter all weve done  i know said ollyett soothingly like that strange song i heard apollo sing when ilion like a mist rose into towers ive felt the same sometimes though it has been paradise for me but they do suffer  the fourth brake in thirty minutes had just turned into sir thomass park to tell the hall that the earth was flat a knot of obviously american tourists were kodaking his lodgegates while the teashop opposite the lychgate was full of people buying postcards of the old font as it had lain twenty years in the sextons shed we went to the alcoholic pub and congratulated the proprietor  its bringin money to the place said he but in a sense you can buy money too dear it isnt doin us any good people are laughin at us thats what theyre doin now with regard to that vote of ours you may have heard talk about  for gorze sake chuck that votin business cried an elderly man at the door moneygettin or no moneygettin were fed up with it  well i do think said the publican shifting his ground i do think sir thomas might ha managed better in some things  he tole methe elderly man shouldered his way to the barhe tole me twenty years ago to take an lay that font in my toolshed he tole me so himself an now after twenty years me own wife makin me out little better than the common angman  thats the sexton the publican explained his good lady sells the postcardsif you avent got some but we feel sir thomas might ha done better  whats he got to do with it said woodhouse  theres nothin we can trace ome to im in so many words but we think he might ave saved us the font business now in regard to that votin business  chuck it oh chuck it the sexton roared or youll ave me cuttin my throat at cockcrow eres another parcel of funmakers  a motorbrake had pulled up at the door and a multitude of men and women immediately descended we went out to look they bore rolled banners a readingdesk in three pieces and i specially noticed a collapsible harmonium such as is used on ships at sea  salvation army i said though i saw no uniforms  two of them unfurled a banner between poles which bore the legend the earth is flat woodhouse and i turned to bat he shook his head no no not me if i had only seen their costumes in advance  good lord said ollyett its the genuine society  the company advanced on the green with the precision of people well broke to these movements sceneshifters could not have been quicker with the threepiece rostrum nor stewards with the harmonium almost before its crosslegs had been kicked into their catches certainly before the tourists by the lodgegates had begun to move over a woman sat down to it and struck up a hymn       hear ther truth our tongues are telling        spread ther light from shore to shore      god hath given man a dwelling        flat and flat for evermore       when ther primal dark retreated        when ther deeps were undesigned      he with rule and level meted        habitation for mankind  i saw sick envy on bats face curse nature he muttered she gets ahead of you every time to think i forgot hymns and a harmonium  then came the chorus       hear ther truth our tongues are telling        spread ther light from shore to shore      oh be faithful oh be truthful        earth is flat for evermore  they sang several verses with the fervour of christians awaiting their lions then there were growlings in the air the sexton embraced by the landlord twostepped out of the pubdoor each was trying to outroar the other apologising in advarnce for what he says the landlord shouted youd better go away here the sexton began to speak words this isnt the time nor yet the place forfor any more o this chat  the crowd thickened i saw the village policesergeant come out of his cottage buckling his belt  but surely said the woman at the harmonium there must be some mistake we are not suffragettes  damn it theyd be a change cried the sexton you get out of this dont talk i cant stand it for one get right out or well font you  the crowd which was being recruited from every house in sight echoed the invitation the sergeant pushed forward a man beside the readingdesk said but surely we are among dear friends and sympathisers listen to me for a moment  it was the moment that a passing charÃ banc chose to strike into the song the effect was instantaneous bat ollyett and i who by divers roads have learned the psychology of crowds retreated towards the tavern door woodhouse the newspaper proprietor anxious i presume to keep touch with the public dived into the thick of it every one else told the society to go away at once when the lady at the harmonium i began to understand why it is sometimes necessary to kill women pointed at the stencilled park pillars and called them the cromlechs of our common faith there was a snarl and a rush the policesergeant checked it but advised the society to keep on going the society withdrew into the brake fighting as it were a rearguard action of oratory up each step the collapsed harmonium was hauled in last and with the perfect unreason of crowds they cheered it loudly till the chauffeur slipped in his clutch and sped away then the crowd broke up congratulating all concerned except the sexton who was held to have disgraced his office by having sworn at ladies we strolled across the green towards woodhouse who was talking to the policesergeant near the parkgates we were not twenty yards from him when we saw sir thomas ingell emerge from the lodge and rush furiously at woodhouse with an uplifted stick at the same time shrieking ill teach you to laugh you but ollyett has the record of the language by the time we reached them sir thomas was on the ground woodhouse very white held the walkingstick and was saying to the sergeant  i give this person in charge for assault  but good lord said the sergeant whiter than woodhouse its sir thomas  whoever it is it isnt fit to be at large said woodhouse the crowd suspecting something wrong began to reassemble and all the english horror of a row in public moved us headed by the sergeant inside the lodge we shut both parkgates and lodgedoor  you saw the assault sergeant woodhouse went on you can testify i used no more force than was necessary to protect myself you can testify that i have not even damaged this persons property here take your stick you you heard the filthy language he used  ii cant say i did the sergeant stammered  oh but we did said ollyett and repeated it to the apronveiled horror of the lodgekeepers wife  sir thomas on a hard kitchen chair began to talk he said he had stood enough of being photographed like a wild beast and expressed loud regret that he had not killed that man who was conspiring with the sergeant to laugh at him  ad you ever seen im before sir thomas the sergeant asked  no but its time an example was made here ive never seen the sweep in my life  i think it was bat masqueriers magnetic eye that recalled the past to him for his face changed and his jaw dropped but i have he groaned i remember now  here a writhing man entered by the back door he was he said the village solicitor i do not assert that he licked woodhouses boots but we should have respected him more if he had and been done with it his notion was that the matter could be accommodated arranged and compromised for gold and yet more gold the sergeant thought so too woodhouse undeceived them both to the sergeant he said will you or will you not enter the charge to the village solicitor he gave the name of his lawyers at which the man wrung his hands and cried oh sir t sir t in a miserable falsetto for it was a bat masquerier of a firm they conferred together in tragic whispers  i dont dive after dickens said ollyett to bat and me by the window but every time i get into a row i notice the policecourt always fills up with his characters  ive noticed that too said bat but the odd thing is you mustnt give the public straight dickensnot in my business i wonder why that is  then sir thomas got his second wind and cursed the day that he or it may have been we were born i feared that though he was a radical he might apologise and since he was an mp might lie his way out of the difficulty but he was utterly and truthfully beside himself he asked foolish questionssuch as what we were doing in the village at all and how much blackmail woodhouse expected to make out of him but neither woodhouse nor the sergeant nor the writhing solicitor listened the upshot of their talk in the chimneycorner was that sir thomas stood engaged to appear next monday before his brother magistrates on charges of assault disorderly conduct and language calculated etc ollyett was specially careful about the language  then we left the village looked very pretty in the late lightpretty and tuneful as a nest of nightingales  youll turn up on monday i hope said woodhouse when we reached town that was his only allusion to the affair  so we turned upthrough a world still singing that the earth was flatat the little claycoloured markettown with the large corn exchange and the small jubilee memorial we had some difficulty in getting seats in the court woodhouses imported london lawyer was a man of commanding personality with a voice trained to convey blasting imputations by tone when the case was called he rose and stated his clients intention not to proceed with the charge his client he went on to say had not entertained and of course in the circumstances could not have entertained any suggestion of accepting on behalf of public charities any moneys that might have been offered to him on the part of sir thomass estate at the same time no one acknowledged more sincerely than his client the spirit in which those offers had been made by those entitled to make them but as a matter of facthere he became the man of the world colloguing with his equalscertainerdetails had come to his clients knowledge since the lamentable outburst which  he shrugged his shoulders nothing was served by going into them but he ventured to say that had those painful circumstances only been known earlier his client wouldagain of coursenever have dreameda gesture concluded the sentence and the ensnared bench looked at sir thomas with new and withdrawing eyes frankly as they could see it would be nothing less than cruelty to proceed further with thiserunfortunate affair he asked leave therefore to withdraw the charge in toto and at the same time to express his clients deepest sympathy with all who had been in any way distressed as his client had been by the fact and the publicity of proceedings which he could of course again assure them that his client would never have dreamed of instituting if as he hoped he had made plain certain facts had been before his client at the time when but he had said enough for his fee it seemed to me that he had  heaven inspired sir thomass lawyerall of a sweat lest his clients language should come outto rise up and thank him then sir thomasnot yet aware what leprosy had been laid upon him but grateful to escape on any termsfollowed suit he was heard in interested silence and people drew back a pace as gehazi passed forth  you hit hard said bat to woodhouse afterwards his own people think hes mad  you dont say so ill show you some of his letters tonight at dinner he replied  he brought them to the red amber room of the chop suey we forgot to be amazed as till then we had been amazed over the song or the gubby or the full tide of fate that seemed to run only for our sakes it did not even interest ollyett that the verb to huckle had passed into the english leaderwriters language we were studying the interior of a soul flashlighted to its grimiest corners by the dread of losing its position  and then it thanked you didnt it for dropping the case said pallant  yes and it sent me a telegram to confirm woodhouse turned to bat now dyou think i hit too hard he asked  noo said bat after allim talking of every ones business nowone cant ever do anything in art that comes up to nature in any game in life just think how this thing has  just let me run through that little case of yours again said pallant and picked up the bun which had it set out in full  any chance of dal looking in on us tonight ollyett began  shes occupied with her art too bat answered bitterly whats the use of art tell me some one a barrelorgan outside promptly pointed out that the earth was flat the gramophones killing street organs but i let loose a hundredandseventyfour of those hurdygurdys twelve hours after the song said bat not counting the provinces his face brightened a little  look here said pallant over the paper i dont suppose you or those asinine jps knew itbut your lawyer ought to have known that youve all put your foot in it most confoundedly over this assault case  whats the matter said woodhouse  its ludicrous its insane there isnt two pennorth of legality in the whole thing of course you could have withdrawn the charge but the way you went about it is childishbesides being illegal what on earth was the chief constable thinking of  oh he was a friend of sir thomass they all were for that matter i replied  he ought to be hanged so ought the chairman of the bench im talking as a lawyer now  why what have we been guilty of misprision of treason or compounding a felonyor what said ollyett  ill tell you later pallant went back to the paper with knitted brows smiling unpleasantly from time to time at last he laughed  thank you he said to woodhouse it ought to be pretty usefulfor us  what dyou mean said ollyett  for our side they are all rads who are mixed up in thisfrom the chief constable down there must be a question there must be a question  yes but i wanted the charge withdrawn in my own way woodhouse insisted  thats nothing to do with the case its the legality of your silly methods you wouldnt understand if i talked till morning he began to pace the room his hands behind him i wonder if i can get it through our whips thick head that its a chance that comes of stuffing the bench with radical tinkers he muttered  oh sit down said woodhouse  wheres your lawyer to be found now he jerked out  at the trefoil said bat promptly i gave him the stagebox for tonight hes an artist too  then im going to see him said pallant properly handled this ought to be a godsend for our side he withdrew without apology  certainly this thing keeps on opening up and up i remarked inanely  its beyond me said bat i dont think if id known id have ever  yes i would though he said my home address was  it was his tonehis tone ollyett almost shouted woodhouse said nothing but his face whitened as he brooded  well any way bat went on im glad i always believed in god and providence and all those things else i should lose my nerve weve put it over the whole worldthe full extent of the geographical globe we couldnt stop it if we wanted to now its got to burn itself out im not in charge any more what dyou expectll happen next angels  i expected nothing nothing that i expected approached what i got politics are not my concern but for the moment since it seemed that they were going to huckle with the rest i took an interest in them they impressed me as a dogs life without a dogs decencies and i was confirmed in this when an unshaven and unwashen pallant called on me at ten oclock one morning begging for a bath and a couch  bail too i asked he was in evening dress and his eyes were sunk feet in his head  no he said hoarsely all night sitting fifteen divisions nother tonight your place was nearer than mine so he began to undress in the hall  when he awoke at one oclock he gave me lurid accounts of what he said was history but which was obviously collective hysteria there had been a political crisis he and his fellow mps had done thingsi never quite got at the thingsfor eighteen hours on end and the pitiless whips were even then at the telephones to herd em up to another dogfight so he snorted and grew hot all over again while he might have been resting  im going to pitch in my question about that miscarriage of justice at huckley this afternoon if you care to listen to it he said itll be absolutely thrown awayin our present state i told em so but its my only chance for weeks praps woodhouse would like to come  im sure he would anything to do with huckley interests us i said  itll miss fire im afraid both sides are absolutely cooked the present situation has been working up for some time you see the row was bound to come etc etc and he flew off the handle once more  i telephoned to woodhouse and we went to the house together it was a dull sticky afternoon with thunder in the air for some reason or other each side was determined to prove its virtue and endurance to the utmost i heard men snarling about it all round me if they wont spare us well show em no mercy break the brutes up from the start they cant stand late hours come on no shirking i know youve had a turkish bath were some of the sentences i caught on our way the house was packed already and one could feel the negative electricity of a jaded crowd wrenching at ones own nerves and depressing the afternoon soul  this is bad woodhouse whispered therell be a row before theyve finished look at the front benches and he pointed out little personal signs by which i was to know that each man was on edge he might have spared himself the house was ready to snap before a bone had been thrown a sullen minister rose to reply to a staccato question his supporters cheered defiantly none o that none o that came from the back benches i saw the speakers face stiffen like the face of a helmsman as he humours a hardmouthed yacht after a sudden following sea the trouble was barely met in time there came a fresh apparently causeless gust a few minutes latersavage threatening but futile it died outone could hear the sighin sudden wrathful realisation of the dreary hours ahead and the ship of state drifted on  then pallantand the raw house winced at the torture of his voicerose it was a twentyline question studded with legal technicalities the gist of it was that he wished to know whether the appropriate minister was aware that there had been a grave miscarriage of justice on such and such a date at such and such a place before such and such justices of the peace in regard to a case which arose  i heard one desperate weary damn float up from the pit of that torment pallant sawed onout of certain events which occurred at the village of huckley  the house came to attention with a parting of the lips like a hiccough and it flashed through my mind pallant repeated huckley the village  that voted the earth was flat a single voice from a back bench sang it once like a lone frog in a far pool  earth was flat croaked another voice opposite  earth was flat there were several then several more  it was you understand the collective overstrained nerve of the house snapping strand by strand to various notes as the hawser parts from its moorings  the village that voted the earth was flat the tune was beginning to shape itself more voices were raised and feet began to beat time even so it did not occur to me that the thing would  the village that voted the earth was flat it was easier now to see who were not singing there were still a few of a sudden and this proves the fundamental instability of the crossbench mind a crossbencher leaped on his seat and there played an imaginary doublebass with tremendous maestrolike wagglings of the elbow  the last strand parted the ship of state drifted out helpless on the rocking tide of melody       the village that voted the earth was flat       the village that voted the earth was flat  the irish first conceived the idea of using their orderpapers as funnels wherewith to reach the correct vroomvroom on earth labour always conservative and respectable at a crisis stood out longer than any other section but when it came in it was howling syndicalism then without distinction of party fear of constituents desire for office or hope of emolument the house sang at the tops and at the bottoms of their voices swaying their stale bodies and epileptically beating with their swelled feet they sang the village that voted the earth was flat first because they wanted to and secondlywhich is the terror of that songbecause they could not stop for no consideration could they stop  pallant was still standing up some one pointed at him and they laughed others began to point lunging as it were in time with the tune at this moment two persons came in practically abreast from behind the speakers chair and halted appalled one happened to be the prime minister and the other a messenger the house with tears running down their cheeks transferred their attention to the paralysed couple they pointed six hundred forefingers at them they rocked they waved and they rolled while they pointed but still they sang when they weakened for an instant ireland would yell are ye with me bhoys and they all renewed their strength like antaeus no man could say afterwards what happened in the press or the strangers gallery it was the house the hysterical and abandoned house of commons that held all eyes as it deafened all ears i saw both front benches bend forward some with their foreheads on their despatchboxes the rest with their faces in their hands and their moving shoulders jolted the house out of its last rag of decency only the speaker remained unmoved the entire press of great britain bore witness next day that he had not even bowed his head the angel of the constitution for vain was the help of man foretold him the exact moment at which the house would have broken into the gubby he is reported to have said i heard the irish beginning to shuffle it so i adjourned pallants version is that he added and i was never so grateful to a private member in all my life as i was to mr pallant  he made no explanation he did not refer to orders or disorders he simply adjourned the house till six that evening and the house adjournedsome of it nearly on all fours  i was not correct when i said that the speaker was the only man who did not laugh woodhouse was beside me all the time his face was set and quite whiteas white they told me as sir thomas ingells when he went by request to a private interview with his chief whip     the press       the soldier may forget his sword        the sailorman the sea      the mason may forget the word        and the priest his litany      the maid may forget both jewel and gem        and the bride her weddingdress      but the jew shall forget jerusalem        ere we forget the press       who once hath stood through the loaded hour        ere roaring like the gale      the harrild and the hoe devour        their leaguelong paper bale      and has lit his pipe in the morning calm        that follows the midnight stress      he hath sold his heart to the old black art        we call the daily press       who once hath dealt in the widest game        that all of a man can play      no later love no larger fame        will lure him long away      as the warhorse smelleth the battle afar        the entered soul no less      he saith ha ha where the trumpets are        and the thunders of the press       canst thou number the days that we fulfil        or the times that we bring forth      canst thou send the lightnings to do thy will        and cause them reign on earth      hast thou given a peacock goodly wings        to please his foolishness      sit down at the heart of men and things        companion of the press       the pope may launch his interdict        the union its decree      but the bubble is blown and the bubble is pricked        by us and such as we      remember the battle and stand aside        while thrones and powers confess      that king over all the children of pride        is the pressthe pressthe press    in the presence  1912  so the matter the regimental chaplain concluded was correct in every way correct i am well pleased with rutton singh and attar singh they have gathered the fruit of their lives  he folded his arms and sat down on the verandah the hot day had ended and there was a pleasant smell of cooking along the regimental lines where halfclad men went back and forth with leaf platters and watergoglets the subadarmajor in extreme undress sat on a chair as befitted his rank the havildarmajor his nephew leaning respectfully against the wall the regiment was at home and at ease in its own quarters in its own district which takes its name from the great muhammadan saint mian mir revered by jehangir and beloved by guru har gobind sixth of the great sikh gurus  quite correct the regimental chaplain repeated  no sikh contradicts his regimental chaplain who expounds to him the holy book of the grunth sahib and who knows the lives and legends of all the gurus  the subadarmajor bowed his grey head the havildarmajor coughed respectfully to attract attention and to ask leave to speak though he was the subadarmajors nephew and though his father held twice as much land as his uncle he knew his place in the scheme of things the subadarmajor shifted one hand with an iron bracelet on the wrist  was there by any chance any woman at the back of it the havildarmajor murmured i was not here when the thing happened  yes yes yes we all know that thou wast in england eating and drinking with the sahibs we are all surprised that thou canst still speak punjabi the subadarmajors carefullytended beard bristled  there was no woman the regimental chaplain growled it was land hear you rutton singh and attar singh were the elder of four brothers these four held land inwhat was the villages nameoh pishapur near thori in the banalu tehsil of patiala state where men can still recognise right behaviour when they see it the two younger brothers tilled the land while rutton singh and attar singh took service with the regiment according to the custom of the family  true true said the havildarmajor there is the same arrangement in all good families  then listen again the regimental chaplain went on their kin on their mothers side put great oppression and injustice upon the two younger brothers who stayed with the land in patiala state their mothers kin loosened beasts into the four brothers crops when the crops were green they cut the corn by force when it was ripe they broke down the watercourses they defiled the wells and they brought false charges in the lawcourts against all four brothers they did not spare even the cottonseed as the saying is  their mothers kin trusted that the young men would thus be forced by weight of trouble and further trouble and perpetual trouble to quit their lands in pishapur village in banalu tehsil in patiala state if the young men ran away the land would come whole to their mothers kin i am not a regimental schoolmaster but is it understood child  understood said the havildarmajor grimly pishapur is not the only place where the fence eats the field instead of protecting it but perhaps there was a woman among their mothers kin  god knows said the regimental chaplain woman or man or lawcourts the young men would not be driven off the land which was their own by inheritance they made appeal to rutton singh and attar singh their brethren who had taken service with us in the regiment and so knew the world to help them in their long war against their mothers kin in pishapur for that reason because their own land and the honour of their house was dear to them rutton singh and attar singh needs must very often ask for leave to go to patiala and attend to the lawsuits and cattlepoundings there  it was not look you as though they went back to their own village and sat garlanded with jasmine in honour upon chairs before the elders under the trees they went back always to perpetual trouble either of lawsuits or theft or strayed cattle and they sat on thorns  i knew it said the subadarmajor life was bitter for them both but they were wellconducted men it was not hard to get them their leave from the colonel sahib  they spoke to me also said the chaplain let him who desires the four great gifts apply himself to the words of holy men that is written often they showed me the papers of the false lawsuits brought against them often they wept on account of the persecution put upon them by their mothers kin men thought it was drugs when their eyes showed red  they wept in my presence too said the subadarmajor wellconducted men of nine years service apiece rutton singh was drillnaik too  they did all things correctly as sikhs should said the regimental chaplain when the persecution had endured seven years attar singh took leave to pishapur once again that was the fourth time in that year only and he called his persecutors together before the village elders and he cast his turban at their feet and besought them by his mothers blood to cease from their persecutions for he told them earnestly that he had marched to the boundaries of his patience and that there could be but one end to the matter  they gave him abuse they mocked him and his tears which was the same as though they had mocked the regiment then attar singh returned to the regiment and laid this last trouble before rutton singh the eldest brother but rutton singh could not get leave all at once  because he was drillnaik and the recruits were to be drilled i myself told him so said the subadarmajor he was a wellconducted man he said he could wait  but when permission was granted those two took four days leave the chaplain went on  i do not think attar singh should have taken baynes sahibs revolver he was baynes sahibs orderly and all that sahibs things were open to him it was therefore as i count it shame to attar singh said the subadarmajor  all the words had been said there was need of arms and how could soldiers use government rifles upon mere cultivators in the fields the regimental chaplain replied moreover the revolver was sent back together with a moneyorder for the cartridges expended borrow not but if thou borrowest pay back soon that is written in the hymns rutton singh took a sword and he and attar singh went to pishapur and after word given the four brethren fell upon their persecutors in pishapur village and slew seventeen wounding ten a revolver is better than a lawsuit i say that these four brethren the two with us and the two mere cultivators slew and wounded twentysevenall their mothers kin male and female  then the four mounted to their housetop and attar singh who was always one of the impetuous said my work is done and he made shinan purification in all mens sight and he lent rutton singh baynes sahibs revolver and rutton singh shot him in the head  so attar singh abandoned his body as an insect abandons a blade of grass but rutton singh having more work to do went down from the housetop and sought an enemy whom he had forgottena patiala man of this regiment who had sided with the persecutors when he overtook the man rutton singh hit him twice with bullets and once with the sword  but the man escaped and is now in the hospital here said the subadarmajor the doctor says he will live in spite of all  not rutton singhs fault rutton singh left him for dead then rutton singh returned to the housetop and the three brothers together attar singh being dead sent word by a lad to the police station for an army to be dispatched against them that they might die with honours but none came and yet patiala state is not under english law and they should know virtue there when they see it  so on the third day rutton singh also made shinan and the youngest of the brethren shot him also in the head and he abandoned his body  thus was all correct there was neither heat nor haste nor abuse in the matter from end to end there remained alive not one man or woman of their mothers kin which had oppressed them of the other villagers of pishapur who had taken no part in the persecutions not one was slain indeed the villagers sent them food on the housetop for those three days while they waited for the police who would not dispatch that army  listen again i know that attar singh and rutton singh omitted no ceremony of the purifications and when all was done baynes sahibs revolver was thrown down from the housetop together with three rupees twelve annas and order was given for its return by post  and what befell the two younger brethren who were not in the service the havildarmajor asked  doubtless they too are dead but since they were not in the regiment their honour concerns themselves only so far as we were touched see how correctly we came out of the matter i think the king should be told for where could you match such a tale except among us sikhs sri wah guru ji ki khalsa sri wah guru ji ki futteh said the regimental chaplain  would three rupees twelve annas pay for the used cartridges said the havildarmajor  attar singh knew the just price all baynes sahibs gear was in his charge they expended one tin box of fifty cartouches lacking two which were returned as i saidas i saythe arrangement was made not with heat nor blasphemies as a mussulman would have made it not with cries nor caperings as an idolater would have made it but conformably to the ritual and doctrine of the sikhs hear you though hundreds of amusements are offered to a child it cannot live without milk if a man be divorced from his soul and his souls desire he certainly will not stop to play upon the road but he will make haste with his pilgrimage that is written i rejoice in my disciples  true true correct correct said the subadarmajor there was a long easy silence one heard a waterwheel creaking somewhere and the nearer sound of meal being ground in a quern  but he the chaplain pointed a scornful chin at the havildarmajorhe has been so long in england that  let the lad alone said his uncle he was but two months there and he was chosen for good cause  theoretically all sikhs are equal practically there are differences as none know better than wellborn landowning folk or longdescended chaplains from amritsar  hast thou heard anything in england to match my tale the chaplain sneered  i saw more than i could understand so i have locked up my stories in my own mouth the havildarmajor replied meekly  stories what stories i know all the stories about england said the chaplain i know that terains run underneath their bazaars there and as for their streets stinking with mota kahars only this morning i was nearly killed by duggan sahibs motakahar that young man is a devil  i expect grunthijee said the subadarmajor you and i grow too old to care for the kaharkinautchthe bearers dance he named one of the sauciest of the oldtime nautches and smiled at his own pun then he turned to his nephew when i was a lad and came back to my village on leave i waited the convenient hour and the elders giving permission i spoke of what i had seen elsewhere  ay my father said the havildarmajor softly and affectionately he sat himself down with respect as behoved a mere lad of thirty with a bare halfdozen campaigns to his credit  there were four men in this affair also he began and it was an affair that touched the honour not of one regiment nor two but of all the army in hind some part of it i saw some i heard but all the tale is true my fathers brother knows and my priest knows that i was in england on business with my colonel when the kingthe great queens soncompleted his life  first there was a rumour that sickness was upon him next we knew that he lay sick in the palace a very great multitude stood outside the palace by night and by day in the rain as well as the sun waiting for news  then came out one with a written paper and set it upon a gatesidethe word of the kings deathand they read and groaned this i saw with my own eyes because the office where my colonel sahib went daily to talk with colonel forsyth sahib was at the east end of the very gardens where the palace stood they are larger gardens than shalimar herehe pointed with his chin up the linesor shahdera across the river  next day there was a darkness in the streets because all the citys multitude were clad in black garments and they spoke as a man speaks in the presence of his deadall those multitudes in the eyes in the air and in the heart there was blackness i saw it but that is not my tale  after ceremonies had been accomplished and word had gone out to the kings of the earth that they should come and mourn the new kingthe dead kings songave commandment that his fathers body should be laid coffined in a certain temple which is near the river there are no idols in that temple neither any carvings nor paintings nor gildings it is all grey stone of one colour as though it were cut out of the live rock it is larger thanyes than the durbar sahib at amritsar even though the akal bunga and the babaatal were added how old it may be god knows it is the sahibs most sacred temple  in that place by the new kings commandment they made as it were a shrine for a saint with lighted candles at the head and the feet of the dead and duly appointed watchers for every hour of the day and the night until the dead king should be taken to the place of his fathers which is at wanidza  when all was in order the new king said give entrance to all people and the doors were opened and o my uncle o my teacher all the world entered walking through that temple to take farewell of the dead there was neither distinction nor price nor ranking in the host except an order that they should walk by fours  as they gathered in the streets withoutvery very far offso they entered the temple walking by fours the child the old man mother virgin harlot trader priest of all colours and faiths and customs under the firmament of god from dawn till late at night i saw it my colonel gave me leave to go i stood in the line many hours one koss two koss distant from the temple  then why did the multitude not sit down under the trees asked the priest  because we were still between houses the city is many koss wide the havildarmajor resumed i submitted myself to that slowmoving river and thusthusa pace at a timei made pilgrimage there were in my rank a woman a cripple and a lascar from the ships  when we entered the temple the coffin itself was as a shoal in the ravi river splitting the stream into two branches one on either side of the dead and the watchers of the dead who were soldiers stood about it moving no more than the still flame of the candles their heads were bowed their hands were clasped their eyes were cast upon the groundthus they were not men but images and the multitude went past them in fours by day and except for a little while by night also  no there was no order that the people should come to pay respect it was a freewill pilgrimage eight kings had been commanded to comewho obeyedbut upon his own sahibs the new king laid no commandment of themselves they came  i made pilgrimage twice once for my salts sake and once again for wonder and terror and worship but my mouth cannot declare one thing of a hundred thousand things in this matter there were lakhs of lakhs crores of crores of people i saw them  more than at our great pilgrimages the regimental chaplain demanded  yes those are only cities and districts coming out to pray this was the world walking in grief and now hear you it is the kings custom that four swords of our armies in hind should stand always before the presence in case of need  the kings custom our right said the subadarmajor curtly  also our right these honoured ones are changed after certain months or years that the honour may be fairly spread now it chanced that when the old kingthe queens soncompleted his days the four that stood in the presence were goorkhas neither sikhs alas nor pathans rajputs nor jats goorkhas my father  idolaters said the chaplain  but soldiers for i remember in the tirah the havildarmajor began  but soldiers for i remember fifteen campaigns go on said the subadarmajor  and it was their honour and right to furnish one who should stand in the presence by day and by night till it went out to burial there were no more than four all toldfour old men to furnish that guard  old old what talk is this of old men said the subadarmajor  nay my fault your pardon the havildarmajor spread a deprecating hand they were strong hot valiant men and the youngest was a lad of fortyfive  that is better the subadarmajor laughed  but for all their strength and heat they could not eat strange food from the sahibs hands there was no cooking place in the temple but a certain colonel forsyth sahib who had understanding made arrangement whereby they should receive at least a little casteclean parched grain also cold rice maybe and water which was pure yet at best this was no more than a hens mouthful snatched as each came off his guard they lived on grain and were thankful as the saying is  one hours guard in every four was each mans burden for as i have shown they were but four all told and the honour of our armies in hind was on their heads the sahibs could draw upon all the armies in england for the other watchersthousands upon thousands of fresh menif they needed but these four were but four  the sahibs drew upon the granadeers for the other watchers granadeers be very tall men under very tall bearskins such as fusilier regiments wear in cold weather thus when a granadeer bowed his head but a very little over his stock the bearskin sloped and showed as though he grieved exceedingly now the goorkhas wear flat green caps  i see i see said the subadarmajor impatiently  they are bullnecked too and their stocks are hard and when they bend deeplydeeplyto match the granadeersthey come nigh to choking themselves that was a handicap against them when it came to the observance of ritual  yet even with their tall griefdeclaring bearskins the granadeers could not endure the full hours guard in the presence there was good cause as i will show why no man could endure that terrible hour so for them the hours guard was cut to onehalf what did it matter to the sahibs they could draw on ten thousand granadeers forsyth sahib who had comprehension put this choice also before the four and they said no ours is the honour of the armies of hind whatever the sahibs do we will suffer the full hour  forsyth sahib seeing that they wereknowing that they could neither sleep long nor eat much said is it great suffering they said it is great honour we will endure  forsyth sahib who loves us said then to the eldest ho father tell me truly what manner of burden it is for the full hours watch breaks up our men like water  the eldest answered sahib the burden is the feet of the multitude that pass us on either side our eyes being lowered and fixed we see those feet only from the knee downa river of feet sahib that nevernevernever stops it is not the standing without any motion it is not hunger nor is it the dead part before the dawn when maybe a single one comes here to weep it is the burden of the unendurable procession of feet from the knee down that nevernevernever stops  forsyth sahib said by god i had not considered that now i know why our men come trembling and twitching off that guard but at least my father ease the stock a little beneath the bent chin for that one hour  the eldest said we are in the presence moreover he knew every button and braid and hook of every uniform in all his armies  then forsyth sahib said no more except to speak about their parched grain but indeed they could not eat much after their hour nor could they sleep much because of eyetwitchings and the renewed procession of the feet before the eyes yet they endured each his full hournot half an hourhis one full hour in each four hours  correct correct said the subadarmajor and the chaplain together we come well out of this affair  but seeing that they were old men said the subadarmajor reflectively very old men worn out by lack of food and sleep could not arrangements have been made or influence have been secured or a petition presented whereby a wellborn sikh might have eased them of some portion of their great burden even though his substantive rank  then they would most certainly have slain me said the havildarmajor with a smile  and they would have done correctly said the chaplain what befell the honourable ones later  this the kings of the earth and all the armies sent flowers and suchlike to the dead kings palace at wanidza where the funeral offerings were accepted there was no order given but all the world made oblation so the four took counselthree at a timeand either they asked forsyth sahib to choose flowers or themselves they went forth and bought flowersi do not know but however it was arranged the flowers were bought and made in the shape of a great drumlike circle weighing half a maund  forsyth sahib had said let the flowers be sent to wanidza with the other flowers which all the world is sending but they said among themselves it is not fit that these flowers which are the offerings of his armies in hind should come to the palace of the presence by the hands of hirelings or messengers or of any man not in his service  hearing this forsyth sahib though he was much occupied with officework said give me the flowers and i will steal a time and myself take them to wanidza  the eldest said since when has forsyth sahib worn sword  forsyth sahib said but always and i wear it in the presence when i put on uniform i am a colonel in the armies of hind the eldest said of what regiment and forsyth sahib looked on the carpet and pulled the hair of his lip he saw the trap  forsyth sahibs regiment was once the old fortysixth pathans which was called the subadarmajor gave the almost forgotten title adding that he had met them in such and such campaigns when forsyth sahib was a young captain  the havildarmajor took up the tale saying the eldest knew that also my father he laughed and presently forsyth sahib laughed  it is true said forsyth sahib i have no regiment for twenty years i have been a clerk tied to a thick pen therefore i am the more fit to be your orderly and messenger in this business  the eldest then said if it were a matter of my life or the honour of any of my household it would be easy and forsyth sahib joined his hands together half laughing though he was ready to weep and he said enough i ask pardon which one of you goes with the offering  the eldest said feigning not to have heard nor must they be delivered by a single swordas though we were pressed for men in his service and they saluted and went out  were these things seen or were they told thee said the subadarmajor  i both saw and heard in the office full of books and papers where my colonel sahib consulted forsyth sahib upon the business that had brought my colonel sahib to england  and what was that business the regimental chaplain asked of a sudden looking full at the havildarmajor who returned the look without a quiver  that was not revealed to me said the havildarmajor  i heard it might have been some matter touching the integrity of certain regiments the chaplain insisted  the matter was not in any way open to my ears said the havildarmajor  humph the chaplain drew his hard roadworn feet under his robe let us hear the tale that it is permitted thee to tell he said and the havildarmajor went on  so then the three having returned to the temple called the fourth who had only fortyfive years when he came off guard and said we go to the palace at wanidza with the offerings remain thou in the presence and take all our guards one after the other till we return  within that next hour they hired a large and strong motakahar for the journey from the temple to wanidza which is twenty koss or more and they promised expedition but he who took their guards said it is not seemly that we should for any cause appear to be in haste there are eighteen medals with eleven clasps and three orders to consider go at leisure i can endure  so the three with the offerings were absent three hours and a half and having delivered the offering at wanidza in the correct manner they returned and found the lad on guard and they did not break his guard till his full hour was ended so he endured four hours in the presence not stirring one hair his eyes abased and the river of feet from the knee down passing continually before his eyes when he was relieved it was seen that his eyeballs worked like weavers shuttles  and so it was donenot in hot blood not for a little while nor yet with the smell of slaughter and the noise of shouting to sustain but in silence for a very long time rooted to one place before the presence among the most terrible feet of the multitude  correct the chaplain chuckled  but the goorkhas had the honour said the subadarmajor sadly  theirs was the honour of his armies in hind and that was our honour the nephew replied  yet i would one sikh had been concerned in iteven one lowcaste sikh and after  they endured the burden until the enduntil it went out of the temple to be laid among the older kings at wanidza when all was accomplished and it was withdrawn under the earth forsyth sahib said to the four the king gives command that you be fed here on meat cooked by your own cooks eat and take ease my fathers  so they loosed their belts and ate they had not eaten food except by snatches for some long time and when the meat had given them strength they slept for very many hours and it was told me that the procession of the unendurable feet ceased to pass before their eyes any more  he threw out one hand palm upward to show that the tale was ended  we came well and cleanly out of it said the subadarmajor  correct correct correct said the regimental chaplain in an evil age it is good to hear such things and there is certainly no doubt that this is a very evil age     jobsons amen       blessed be the english and all their ways and works      cursed be the infidels hereticks and turks      amen quo jobson but where i used to

 andthe feet of my beloved hurrying back through time    regulus  1917  regulus a roman general defeated the carthaginians 256 bc but was next year defeated and taken prisoner by the carthaginians who sent him to rome with an embassy to ask for peace or an exchange of prisoners regulus strongly advised the roman senate to make no terms with the enemy he then returned to carthage and was put to death  the fifth form had been dragged several times in its collective life from one end of the school horace to the other those were the years when army examiners gave thousands of marks for latin and it was mr kings hated business to defeat them  hear him then on a raw november morning at second lesson  aha he began rubbing his hands cras ingens iterabimus aequor our portion today is the fifth

the soldier of crassusvixit livedturpis maritus a disgraceful husband  you slurred the quantity of the word after turpis said king lets hear it  beetle guessed again and for a wonder hit the correct

and all his works  we envy you sit down  beetle sat down relieved well knowing that a reef of uncharted genitives stretched ahead of him on which in spite of mturks sailingdirections he would infallibly have been wrecked  rattray who took up the task steered neatly through them and came unscathed to port  here we require drama said king regulus himself is speaking now who shall represent the providentminded regulus winton will you kindly oblige  winton of kings house a long heavy towheaded second fifteen forward overdue for his first fifteen colours and in aspect like an earnest elderly horse rose up and announced among other things that he had seen signs affixed to punic deluges half the form shouted for joy and the other half for joy that there was something to shout about  mr king opened and shut his eyes with great swiftness signa adfixa delubris he gasped so delubris is deluges is it winton in all our dealings have i ever suspected you of a jest  no sir said the rigid and angular winton while the form rocked about him  and yet you assert delubris means deluges whether i am a fit subject for such a jape is of course a matter of opinion but winton you are normally conscientious may we assume you looked out delubris  no sir winton was privileged to speak that truth dangerous to all who stand before kings  made a shot at it then  every line of wintons body showed he had done nothing of the sort indeed the very idea that pater winton and a boy is not called pater by companions for his frivolity would make a shot at anything was beyond belief but he replied yes and all the while worked with his right heel as though he were heeling a ball at puntabout  though none dared to boast of being a favourite with king the taciturn threecornered winton stood high in his housemasters opinion it seemed to save him neither rebuke nor punishment but the two were in some fashion sympathetic  hm said king drily i was going to sayflagito additis damnum but i thinki think i see the process beetle the translation of delubris please  beetle raised his head from his shaking arm long enough to answer ruins sir  there was an impressive pause while king checked off crimes on his fingers then to beetle the muchenduring man addressed winged words  guessing said he guessing beetle as usual from the look of delubris that it bore some relation to diluvium or deluge you imparted the result of your halfbaked lucubrations to winton who seems to have been lost enough to have accepted it observing next your companions fall from the presumed security of your undistinguished position in the rearguard you took another potshot the turbid chaos of your mind threw up some memory of the word dilapidations which you have pitifully attempted to disguise under the synonym of ruins  as this was precisely what beetle had done he looked hurt but forgiving we will attend to this later said king go on winton and retrieve yourself  delubris happened to be the one word which winton had not looked out and had asked beetle for when they were settling into their places he forged ahead with no further trouble only when he rendered scilicet as forsooth king erupted  regulus he said was not a leaderwriter for the penny press nor for that matter was horace regulus says the soldier ransomed by gold will come keener for the fightwill he byby gum thats the meaning of scilicet it indicates contemptbitter contempt forsooth forsooth youll be talking about speckled beauties and eventually transpire next howell what do you make of that doubled vidi egoego vidi it wasnt put in to fill up the metre you know  isnt it intensive sir said howell afflicted by a genuine interest in what he read regulus was a bit in earnest about rome making no terms with carthageand he wanted to let the romans understand it didnt he sir  less than your usual grace but the fact regulus was in earnest he was also engaged at the same time in cutting his own throat with every word he uttered he knew carthage which your examiners wont ask you this so you neednt take notes was a sort of godforsaken nigger manchester regulus was not thinking about his own life he was telling rome the truth he was playing for his side those lines from the eighteenth to the fortieth ought to be written in blood yet there are things in human garments which will tell you that horace was a flÃ¢neura man about town avoid such beings horace knew a very great deal he knew erit ille fortiswill he be brave who once to faithless foes has knelt and again stop pawing with your hooves thornton hic unde vitam sumeret inscius that means roughlybut i perceive i am ahead of my translators begin at hic unde vernon and let us see if you have the spirit of regulus  now no one expected fireworks from gentle paddy vernon subprefect of hartopps house but as must often be the case with growing boys his mind was in abeyance for the time being and he said all in a rush on behalf of regulus o magna carthago probrosis altior italiae ruinis o carthage thou wilt stand forth higher than the ruins of italy  even beetle most lenient of critics was interested at this point though he did not join the halfgroan of reprobation from the wiser heads of the form  please dont mind me said king and vernon very kindly did not he ploughed on thus he regulus is related to have removed from himself the kiss of the shameful wife and of his small children as less by the head and being stern to have placed his virile visage on the ground  since king loved virile about as much as he did spouse or forsooth the form looked up hopefully but jove thundered not  until vernon continued he should have confirmed the sliding fathers as being the author of counsel never given under an alias  he stopped conscious of stillness round him like the dread calm of the typhoons centre kings opening voice was sweeter than honey  i am painfully aware by bitter experience that i cannot give you any idea of the passion the power thethe essential guts of the lines which you have so foully outraged in our presence but the note changed so far as in me lies i will strive to bring home to you vernon the fact that there exist in latin a few pitiful rules of grammar of syntax nay even of declension which were not created for your incult sportyour boeotian diversion you will therefore vernon write out and bring to me tomorrow a wordforword englishlatin translation of the ode together with a full list of all adjectivesan adjective is not a verb vernon as the lower third will tell youall adjectives their number case and gender even now i havent begun to deal with you faithfully  iim very sorry sir vernon stammered  you mistake the symptoms vernon you are possibly discomfited by the imposition but sorrow postulates some sort of mind intellect nous your rendering of probrosis alone stamps you as lower than the beasts of the field will some one take the taste out of our mouths andtalking of tastes he coughed there was a distinct flavour of chlorine gas in the air up went an eyebrow though king knew perfectly well what it meant  mr hartopps stscience class next door said malpass  oh yes i had forgotten our newly established modern side of course perowne open the windows and winton go on once more from interque maerentes  and hastened away said winton surrounded by his mourning friends intointo illustrious banishment but i got that out of conington sir he added in one conscientious breath  i am aware the master generally knows his asss crib though i acquit you of any intention that way can you suggest anything for egregius exul only egregious exile i fear egregious is a good word ruined no you cant in this case improve on conington now then for atqui sciebat quae sibi barbarus tortor pararet the whole force of it lies in the atqui  although he knew winton suggested  stronger than that i think  he who knew well malpass interpolated  yees well though he knew i dont like coningtons wellwitting its wardour street  well though he knew what the savage torturer waswas getting ready for him said winton  yees had in store for him  yet he brushed aside his kinsmen and the people delaying his return  yees but then how do you render obstantes  if its a free translation mightnt obstantes and morantem come to about the same thing sir  nothing comes to about the same thing with horace winton as i have said horace was not a journalist no i take it that his kinsmen bodily withstood his departure whereas the crowdpopulumquethe democracy stood about futilely pitying him and getting in the way now for that noblest of endingsquam si clientum and king ran off into the quotation       as though some tedious business oer      of clients court his journey lay      towards venafrums grassy floor      or spartabuilt tarentums bay  all right winton beetle when youve quite finished dodging the fresh air yonder give me the meaning of tendensand turn down your collar  me sir tendens sir oh stretching away in the direction of sir  idiot regulus was not a feature of the landscape he was a man selfdoomed to death by torture atqui sciebatknowing ithaving achieved it for his countrys sakecant you hear that atqui cut like a knifehe moved off with some dignity that is why horace out of the whole golden latin tongue chose the one word tendenswhich is utterly untranslatable  the gross injustice of being asked to translate it converted beetle into a young christian martyr till king buried his nose in his handkerchief again  i think theyve broken another gasbottle next door sir said howell theyre always doing it the form coughed as more chlorine came in  well i suppose we must be patient with the modern side said king but it is almost insupportable for this side vernon what are you grinning at  vernons mind had returned to him glowing and inspired he chuckled as he underlined his horace  it appears to amuse you said king let us participate what is it  the last two lines of the tenth ode in this book sir was vernons amazing reply  what oh i see non hoc semper erit liminis aut aquae caelestis patiens latus2 kings mouth twitched to hide a grin was that done with intention  footnote 2 this side will not always be patient of rain and waiting on the threshold  ii thought it fitted sir  it does its distinctly happy what put it into your thick head paddy  i dont know sir except we did the ode last term  and you remembered the same head that minted probrosis as a verb vernon you are an enigma no this side will not always be patient of unheavenly gases and waters i will make representations to our socalled moderns meantime who shall say i am not just i remit you your accrued pains and penalties in regard to probrosim probrosis probrosit and other enormities i oughtnt to do it but this side is occasionally human by no means bad paddy  thank you sir said vernon wondering how inspiration had visited him  then king with a few brisk remarks about science headed them back to regulus of whom and of horace and rome and evilminded commercial carthage and of the democracy eternally futile he explained in all ages and climes he spoke for ten minutes passing thence to the next odedelicta majorumwhere he fetched up fullvoiced upondis te minorem quod geris imperas thou rulest because thou bearest thyself as lower than the godsmaking it a text for a discourse on manners morals and respect for authority as distinct from bottled gases which lasted till the bell rang then beetle concertinaing his books observed to winton when kings really on tap hes an interestin dog hartopps chlorine uncorked him  yes but why did you tell me delubris was deluges you silly ass said winton  well that uncorked him too look out you hoofhanded old owl winton had cleared for action as the form poured out like puppies at play and was scragging beetle stalky from behind collared winton low the three fell in confusion  dis te minorem quod geris imperas quoth

growing boys mind it might have been the blind ferment of adolescence stalkys random remarks about virtue might have stirred him like his betters he might have sought popularity by way of clowning or as the head asserted years later the only known jest of his serious life might have worked on him as a sobersided mans one love colours and dislocates all his after days but at the next lesson mechanical drawing with mr lidgett who as drawingmaster had very limited powers of punishment winton fell suddenly from grace and let loose a live mouse in the formroom the whole form shrieking and leaping high threw at it all the plaster cones pyramids and fruit in high reliefnot to mention inkpotsthat they could lay hands on mr lidgett reported at once to the head winton owned up to his crime which venial in the upper third pardonable at a price in the lower fourth was of course rank ruffianism on the part of a fifth form boy and so by graduated stages he arrived at the heads study just before lunch penitent perturbed annoyed with himself andas the head said to king in the corridor after the mealmore human than he had known him in seven years  you see the head drawled on wintons only fault is a certain costive and unaccommodating virtue so this comes very happily  ive never noticed any sign of it said king winton was in kings house and though king as proconsul might and did infernally oppress his own province once a black and yellow cap was in trouble at the hands of the imperial authority king fought for him to the very last steps of caesars throne  well you yourself admitted just now that a mouse was beneath the occasion the head answered  it was mr king did not love mr lidgett it should have been a rat butbuti hate to plead itits the lads first offence  could you have damned him more completely king  hm what is the penalty said king in retreat but keeping up a rearguard action  only my usual few lines of virgil to be shown up by teatime  the heads eyes turned slightly to that end of the corridor where mullins captain of the games pot old pot or potiphar mullins was pinning up the usual wednesday noticebig middle and little side footballa to k l to z 3 to 445 pm  you cannot write out the heads usual few which means five hundred latin lines and play football for one hour and threequarters between the hours of 130 and 5 pm winton had evidently no intention of trying to do so for he hung about the corridor with a set face and an uneasy foot yet it was law in the school compared with which that of the medes and persians was no more than a noncommittal resolution that any boy outside the first fifteen who missed his football for any reason whatever and had not a written excuse duly signed by competent authority to explain his absence would receive not less than three strokes with a groundash from the captain of the games generally a youth between seventeen and eighteen years rarely under eleven stone pot was nearer thirteen and always in hard condition  king knew without inquiry that the head had given winton no such excuse  but he is practically a member of the first fifteen he has played for it all this term said king i believe his cap should have arrived last week  his cap has not been given him officially therefore he is naught i rely on old pot  but mullins is wintons studymate king persisted  pot mullins and pater winton were cousins and rather close friends  that will make no difference to mullinsor winton if i know em said the head  butbut king played his last card desperately i was going to recommend winton for extra subprefect in my house now carton has gone  certainly said the head why not he will be excellent by teatime i hope  at that moment they saw mr lidgett tripping down the corridor waylaid by winton  its about that mousebusiness at mechanical drawing winton opened swinging across his path  yes yes highly disgraceful mr lidgett panted  i know it was said winton itit was a cads trick because  because you knew i couldnt give you more than fifty lines said mr lidgett  well anyhow ive come to apologise for it  certainly said mr lidgett and added for he was a kindly man i think that shows quite right feeling ill tell the head at once im satisfied  nono the boys still unmended voice jumped from the growl to the squeak i didnt mean that ii did it on principle please donterdo anything of that kind  mr lidgett looked him up and down and being an artist understood  thank you winton he said this shall be between ourselves  you heard said king indecent pride in his voice  of course you thought he was going to get lidgett to beg him off the impot  king denied this with so much warmth that the head laughed and king went away in a huff  by the way said the head ive told winton to do his lines in your formroomnot in his study  thanks said king over his shoulder for the heads orders had saved winton and mullins who was doing extra army work in the study from an embarrassing afternoon together  an hour later king wandered into his still formroom as though by accident winton was hard at work  aha said king rubbing his hands this does not look like games winton dont let me arrest your facile pen whence this sudden love for virgil  impot from the head sir for that mousebusiness this morning  rumours thereof have reached us that was a lapse on your part into lower thirdery which i dont quite understand  the tumptump of the puntabouts before the sides settled to games came through the open window winton like his housemaster loved fresh air then they heard paddy vernon subprefect on duty calling the roll in the field and marking defaulters winton wrote steadily king curled himself up on a desk hands round knees one would have said that the man was gloating over the boys misfortune but the boy understood  dis te minorem quod geris imperas king quoted presently it is necessary to bear oneself as lower than the local godseven than drawingmasters who are precluded from effective retaliation i do wish youd tried that mousegame with me pater  winton grinned then sobered it was a cads trick sir to play on mr lidgett he peered forward at the page he was copying  well the sin i impute to each frustrate ghost king stopped himself why do you goggle like an owl hand me the mantuan and ill dictate no matter any rich virgilian measures will serve i may peradventure recall a few he began       tu regere imperio populos romane memento      hae tibi erunt artes pacisque imponere morem      parcere subjectis et debellare superbos  there you have it all winton write that out twice and yet once again  for the next forty minutes with never a glance at the book king paid out the glorious hexameters and king could read latin as though it were alive winton hauling them in and coiling them away behind him as trimmers in a telegraphships hold coil away deepsea cable king broke from the aeneid to the georgics and back again pausing now and then to translate some specially loved line or to dwell on the trebleshot texture of the ancient fabric he did not allude to the coming interview with mullins except at the last when he said i think at this juncture pater i need not ask you for the precise significance of atqui sciebat quae sibi barbarus tortor  the ungrateful winton flushed angrily and king loafed out to take five oclock callover after which he invited little hartopp to tea and a talk on chlorinegas hartopp accepted the challenge like a bantam and the two went up to kings study about the same time as winton returned to the formroom beneath it to finish his lines  then half a dozen of the second fifteen who should have been washing strolled in to condole with pater winton whose misfortune and its consequences were common talk no one was more sincere than the long redheaded knottyknuckled paddy vernon but being a careless animal he joggled wintons desk  curse you for a silly ass said winton dont do that  no one is expected to be polite while under punishment so vernon sinking his subprefectship replied peacefully enough  well dont be wrathy pater  im not said winton get out this aint your house formroom  formroom dont belong to you why dont you go to your own study vernon replied  because mullins is there waitin for the victim said stalky delicately and they all laughed you ought to have shaken that mouse out of your trouserleg pater thats the way i did in my youth paters revertin to his second childhood never mind pater we all respect you and your future careeah  winton still writhing growled vernon leaning on the desk somehow shook it again then he laughed  what are you grinning at winton asked  i was only thinkin of you being sent up to take a lickin from pot i swear i dont think its fair youve never shirked a game in your life and youre as good as in the first fifteen already your cap ought to have been delivered last week oughtnt it  it was law in the school that no man could by any means enjoy the privileges and immunities of the first fifteen till the black velvet cap with the gold tassel made by dilatory exeter outfitters had been actually set on his head ages ago a largebuilt and unruly second fifteen had attempted to change this law but the prefects of that age were still larger and the lively experiment had never been repeated  will you said winton very slowly kindly mind your own damned business you cursed clumsy fatheaded fool  the formroom was as silent as the empty field in the darkness outside vernon shifted his feet uneasily  well i shouldnt like to take a lickin from pot he said  wouldnt you winton asked as he paged the sheets of lines with hands that shook  no i shouldnt said vernon his freckles growing more distinct on the bridge of his white nose  well im going to take itwinton moved clear of the desk as he spoke but youre going to take a lickin from me first before any one realised it he had flung himself neighing against vernon no decencies were observed on either side and the rest looked on amazed the two met confusedly vernon trying to do what he could with his longer reach winton insensible to blows only concerned to drive his enemy into a corner and batter him to pulp this he managed over against the fireplace where vernon dropped halfstunned now im going to give you your lickin said winton lie there till i get a groundash and ill cut you to pieces if you move ill chuck you out of the window he wound his hands into the boys collar and waistband and had actually heaved him half off the ground before the others with one accord dropped on his head shoulders and legs he fought them crazily in an awful hissing silence stalkys sensitive nose was rubbed along the floor beetle received a jolt in the wind that sent him whistling and crowing against the wall perownes forehead was cut and malpass came out with an eye that explained itself like a dying rainbow through a whole week  mad quite mad said stalky and for the third time wriggled back to wintons throat the door opened and king came in hartopps little figure just behind him the mound on the floor panted and heaved but did not rise for winton still squirmed vengefully only a little play sir said perowne only hit my head against a form this was quite true  oh said king dimovit obstantes propinquos you i presume are the populus delaying wintons return tomullins eh  no sir said stalky behind his claretcoloured handkerchief were the maerentes amicos  not bad you see some of it sticks after all king chuckled to hartopp and the two masters left without further inquiries  the boys sat still on the nowpassive winton  well said stalky at last of all the putrid heasses pater you are the  im sorry im awfully sorry winton began and they let him rise he held out his hand to the bruised and bewildered vernon sorry paddy ii must have lost my temper ii dont know whats the matter with me  fat lot of good thatll do my face at tea vernon grunted why couldnt you say there was something wrong with you instead of lamming out like a lunatic is my lip puffy  just a trifle look at my beak well we got all these pretty marks at footerowin to the zeal with which we played the game said stalky dusting himself but dyou think youre fit to be let loose again pater sure you dont want to kill another subprefect i wish i was pot id cut your sprightly young soul out  i spose i ought to go to pot now said winton  and let all the other asses see you lookin like this not much well all come up to number five study and wash off in hot water beetle you arent damaged go along and light the gasstove  theres a tin of cocoa in my study somewhere perowne shouted after him rootle round till you find it and take it up  separately by different roads vernons jersey pulled half over his head the boys repaired to number five study little hartopp and king i am sorry to say leaned over the banisters of kings landing and watched  very human said little hartopp your virtuous winton having got himself into trouble takes it out of my poor old paddy i wonder what precise lie paddy will tell about his face  but surely you arent going to embarrass him by asking said king  your boy won said hartopp  to go back to what we were discussing said king quickly do you pretend that your modern system of inculcating unrelated facts about chlorine for instance all of which may be proved fallacies by the time the boys grow up can have any real bearing on educationeven the low type of it that examiners expect  i maintain nothing but is it any worse than your chinese reiteration of uncomprehended syllables in a dead tongue  dead forsooth king fairly danced the only living tongue on earth chinese on my word hartopp  and at the end of seven yearshow often have i said it hartopp went onseven years of two hundred and twenty days of six hours each your victims go away with nothing absolutely nothing except perhaps if theyve been very attentive a dozenno ill grant you twentyone score of totally unrelated latin tags which any child of twelve could have absorbed in two terms  butbut cant you realise that if our system brings laterat any rateat a pincha simple understandinggrammar and latinity aparta mere glimpse of the significance foul word of well say one ode of horace one twenty lines of virgil weve got what we poor devils of ushers are striving after  and what might that be said hartopp  balance proportion perspectivelife your scientific man is the unrelated animalthe beast without background havent you ever realised that in your atmosphere of stinks  meantime you make them lose life for the sake of living eh  blind again hartopp i told you about paddys quotation this morning but he made probrosis a verb he did you yourself heard young corkrans reference to maerentes amicos it sticksa little of it sticks among the barbarians  absolutely and essentially chinese said little hartopp who alone of the commonroom refused to be outfaced by king but i dont yet understand how paddy came to be licked by winton paddys supposed to be something of a boxer  beware of vinegar made from honey king replied pater like some other people is patient and longsuffering but he has his limits the head is oppressing him damnably too as i pointed out the boy has practically been in the first fifteen since term began  but my dear fellow ive known you give a boy an impot and refuse him leave off games again and again  ah but that was when there was real need to get at some oaf who couldnt be sensitised in any other way now in our esteemed heads action i see nothing but  the conversation from this point does not concern us  meantime winton very penitent and especially polite towards vernon was being cheered with cocoa in number five study they had some difficulty in stemming the flood of his apologies he himself pointed out to vernon that he had attacked a subprefect for no reason whatever and therefore deserved official punishment  i cant think what was the matter with me today he mourned ever since that blasted mousebusiness  well then dont think said stalky or do you want paddy to make a row about it before all the school  here vernon was understood to say that he would see winton and all the school somewhere else  and if you imagine perowne and malpass and me are goin to give evidence at a prefects meeting just to soothe your beastly conscience you jolly well err said beetle i know what you did  what croaked pater out of the valley of his humiliation  you went berserk ive read all about it in hypatia  whats going berserk winton asked  never you mind was the reply now dont you feel awfully weak and seedy  i am rather tired said winton sighing  thats what you ought to be youve gone berserk and pretty soon youll go to sleep but youll probably be liable to fits of it all your life beetle concluded shouldnt wonder if you murdered some one some day  shut upyou and your berserks said stalky go to mullins now and get it over pater  i call it filthy unjust of the head said vernon anyhow youve given me my lickin old man i hope potll give you yours  im awfully sorryawfully sorry was wintons last word  it was the custom in that consulship to deal with games defaulters between five oclock callover and tea mullins who was old enough to pity did not believe in letting boys wait through the night till the chill of the next morning for their punishments he was finishing off the last of the small fry and their excuses when winton arrived  but please mullinsthis was babcock tertius a dear little twelveyearold mothers darlingi had an awful hack on the knee ive been to the matron about it and she gave me some iodine ive been rubbing it in all day i thought that would be an excuse off  lets have a look at it said the impassive mullins thats a shinbruiseabout a week old touch your toes ill give you the iodine  babcock yelled loudly as he had many times before the face of jevons aged eleven a new boy that dark wet term low in the house low in the lower school and lowest of all in his homesick little mind turned white at the horror of the sight they could hear his working lips part stickily as babcock wailed his way out of hearing  hullo jevons what brings you here said mullins  please sir i went for a walk with babcock tertius  did you then i bet you went to the tuckshopand you paid didnt you  a nod jevons was too terrified to speak  of course and i bet babcock told you that old pot ud let you off because it was the first time  another nod with a ghost of a smile in it  all right mullins picked jevons up before he could guess what was coming laid him on the table with one hand with the other gave him three emphatic spanks then held him high in air  now you tell babcock tertius that hes got you a licking from me and see you jolly well pay it back to him and when youre prefect of games dont you let any one shirk his footer without a written excuse where dyou play in your game  forward sir  you can do better than that ive seen you run like a young buckrabbit ask dickson from me to try you as threequarter next game will you cut along  jevons left warm for the first time that day enormously set up in his own esteem and very hot against the deceitful babcock  mullins turned to winton your names on the list pater winton nodded  i know it the head landed me with an impot for that mousebusiness at mechanical drawing no excuse  he meant it then mullins jerked his head delicately towards the groundash on the table i heard something about it  winton nodded a rotten thing to do he said cant think what i was doing ever to do it it counts against a fellow so and theres some more too  all right pater just stand clear of our photobracket will you  the little formality over there was a pause winton swung round yawned in pots astonished face and staggered towards the windowseat  whats the matter with you dick ill  no perfectly all right thanks onlyonly a little sleepy winton stretched himself out and then and there fell deeply and placidly asleep  it isnt a faint said the experienced mullins or his pulse wouldnt act tisnt a fit or hed snort and twitch it cant be sunstroke this term and he hasnt been overtraining for anything he opened wintons collar packed a cushion under his head threw a rug over him and sat down to listen to the regular breathing before long stalky arrived on pretence of borrowing a book he looked at the windowseat  noticed anything wrong with winton lately said mullins  notice anything wrong with my beak stalky replied pater went berserk after callover and fell on a lot of us for jesting with him about his impot you ought to see malpasss eye  you mean that pater fought said mullins  like a devil then he nearly went to sleep in our study just now i expect hell be all right when he wakes up rummy business conscientious old bargee you ought to have heard his apologies  but pater cant fight one little bit mullins repeated  twasnt fighting he just tried to murder every one stalky described the affair and when he left mullins went off to take counsel with the head who out of a cloud of blue smoke told him that all would yet be well  winton said he is a little stiff in his moral joints hell get over that if he asks you whether todays doings will count against him in his  but you know its important to him sir his people arentvery well off said mullins  thats why im taking all this trouble you must reassure him pot i have overcrowded him with new experiences oh by the way has his cap come  it came at dinner sir mullins laughed  sure enough when he waked at teatime winton proposed to take mullins all through every one of his days lapses from grace and do you think it will count against me said he  dont you fuss so much about yourself and your silly career said mullins youre all right and ohheres your first cap at last shove it up on the bracket and come on to tea  they met king on their way stepping statelily and rubbing his hands i have applied said he for the services of an additional subprefect in cartons unlamented absence your name winton seems to have found favour with the powers that be andand all things consideredi am disposed to give my support to the nomination you are therefore a quasilictor  then it didnt count against me winton gasped as soon as they were out of hearing  a captain of games can jest with a subprefect publicly  you utter ass said mullins and caught him by the back of his stiff neck and ran him down to the hall where the subprefects who sit below the salt made him welcome with the economical bloaterpaste of midterm  king and little hartopp were sparring in the reverend john gilletts study at 10 pmclassical versus modern as usual  characterproportionbackground snarled king that is the essence of the humanities  analects of confucius little hartopp answered  time said the reverend john behind the sodawater you men oppress me hartopp what did you say to paddy in your dormitories tonight even you couldnt have overlooked his face  but i did said hartopp calmly i wasnt even humorous about it as some clerics might have been i went straight through and said naught  poor paddy now for my part said king and you know i am not lavish in my praises i consider winton a firstclass type absolutely firstclass  haardly said the reverend john firstclass of the second class i admit the very best type of second class buthe shook his headit should have been a rat paterll never be anything more than a colonel of engineers  what do you base that verdict on said king stiffly  he came to me after prayerswith all his conscience  poor old pater was it the mouse said little hartopp  that and what he called his uncontrollable temper and his responsibilities as subprefect  and you  if we had had what is vulgarly called a pijaw hed have had hysterics so i recommended a dose of epsom salts hell take it tooconscientiously dont eat me king perhaps hell be a kcb  ten oclock struck and the army class boys in the further studies coming to their houses after an hours extra work passed along the gravel path below some one was chanting to the tune of white sand and grey sand dis te minorem quod geris imperas he stopped outside mullins study they heard mullins window slide up and then stalkys voice  ah goodevening mullins my barbarus tortor were the waits we have come to inquire after the local berserk is he doin as well as can be expected in his new careeah  better than you will in a sec stalky mullins grunted  glad of that we thought hed like to know that paddy has been carried to the sickhouse in ravin delirium they think its concussion of the brain  why he was all right at prayers winton began earnestly and they heard a laugh in the background as mullins slammed down the window  night regulus stalky sang out and the light footsteps went on  you see it sticks a little of it sticks among the barbarians said king  amen said the reverend john go to bed

us every time  hi hi hold your horses stop well well a lean man in a sablelined overcoat leaped from a private car and barred my way up pall mall you dont know me youre excusable i wasnt wearing much of anything last time we metin south africa  the scales fell from my eyes and i saw him once more in a skyblue army shirt behind barbed wire among dutch prisoners bathing at simonstown more than a dozen years ago3 why its ziglerlaughton o zigler i cried well i am glad to see you  footnote 3 the captive traffics and discoveries  oh no you dont work any of your english on me so glad to see you doncher knowan tata do you reside in this village  no im up here buying stores  then you take my automobile where to oh i know them my lord marshalton is one of the directors pigott drive to the army and navy cooperative supply association limited victoria street westminister  he settled himself on the deep dovecolour pneumatic cushions and his smile was like the turning on of all the electrics his teeth were whiter than the ivory fittings he smelt of rare soap and cigarettessuch cigarettes as he handed me from a golden box with an automatic lighter on my side of the car was a goldmounted mirror card and toilette case i looked at him inquiringly  yes he nodded two years after i quit the cape shes not an ohio girl though shes in the country now is that right shes at our little place in the country well go there as soon as youre through with your grocerylist engagements the only engagement youve got is to grab your gripget your bag from your hotel i meanand come right along and meet her you are the captive of my bow and spear now  i surrender i said meekly did the zigler automatic gun do all this i pointed to the car fittings  psha think of your rememberin that well no the zigler is a great gunthe greatest everbut lifes too short an too interestin to squander on pushing her in military society ive leased my rights in her to a pennsylvaniantransylvanian citizen full of mentality and moral uplift if those things weigh with the chancelleries of europe he will make good andi shall be surprised excuse me  he bared his head as we passed the statue of the great queen outside buckingham palace  a very great lady said he i have enjoyed her hospitality she represents one of the most wonderful institutions in the world the next is the one we are going to mrs zigler uses em and they break her up every week on returned empties  oh you mean the stores i said  mrs zigler means it more they are quite ambassadorial in their outlook i guess ill wait outside and pray while you wrestle with em  my business at the stores finished and my bag retrieved from the hotel his moving palace slid us into the country  i owe it to you zigler began as smoothly as the car to tell you what i am now i represent the business end of the american invasion not the blame cars themselvesi wouldnt be found dead in onebut the tools that make em i am the zigler higherspeed tool and lathe trust the trust sir is entirely my ownin my own inventions i am the renzalaer tencylinder aÃ«rialthe lightest aeroplaneengine on the marketone price one power one guarantee i am the orlebar

wise to it yet thats all i represent at present you saw me take off my hat to your late queen i owe every cent i have to that great an good lady yes sir i came out of africa after my eighteen months restcure and openair treatment and seabathing as her prisoner of war like a giant refreshed there wasnt anything could hold me when id got my hooks into it after that experience and to you as a representative british citizen i say here and now that i regard you as the founder of the family fortunetommys and mine  but i only gave you some papers and tobacco  what more does any citizen need the cullinan diamond wouldnt have helped me as much then antalking about south africa tell me  we talked about south africa till the car stopped at the georgian lodge of a great park  well get out here i want to show you a rather sightly view said zigler  we walked perhaps half a mile across timberdotted turf past a lake entered a dark rhododendronplanted wood ticking with the noise of pheasants feet and came out suddenly where five rides met at a small classic temple between lichened stucco statues which faced a circle of turf several acres in extent irish yews of a size that i had never seen before walled the sunless circle like cliffs of riven obsidian except at the lower end where it gave on to a stretch of undulating bare ground ending in a timbered slope halfamile away  thats where the old marshalton racecourse used to be said zigler that icehouse is called floras temple nell gwynne and mrs siddons an taglioni an all that crowd used to act plays here for king george the third wasnt it well george is the only king i play let it go at that this circle was the stage i guess the kings an the nobility sat in floras temple i forget who sculped these statues at the door theyre the comic and tragic muse but its a sightly view aint it  the sunlight was leaving the park i caught a glint of silver to the southward beyond the wooded ridge  thats the oceanthe channel i mean said zigler its twentythree miles as a man flies a sightly view aint it  i looked at the severe yews the dumb yelling mouths of the two statues at the bluegreen shadows on the unsunned grass and at the still bright plain in front where some deer were feeding  its a most dramatic contrast but i think it would be better on a summers day i said and we went on up one of the noiseless rides a quarter of a mile at least till we came to the porticoed front of an enormous georgian pile four footmen revealed themselves in a hall hung with pictures  i hired this off of my lord marshalton zigler explained while they helped us out of our coats under the severe eyes of ruffed and periwigged ancestors yaas they always look at me too as if id blown in from the gutter which of course i have thats mary lady marshalton old man joshua painted her do you see any likeness to my lord marshalton why havent you ever met up with him he was captain mankeltowmy royal british artillery captain that blew up my gun in the war an then tried to bury me against my religious principles4 yaas his father died and he got the lordship that was about all he got by the time that your british deathduties were through with him so he said id oblige him by hiring his ranch its a hell an a half of a proposition to handle but tommymrs laughtonunderstands it come right in to the parlour and be very welcome  footnote 4 the captive traffics and discoveries  he guided me hand on shoulder into a babble of highpitched talk and laughter that filled a vast drawingroom he introduced me as the founder of the family fortunes to a little lithe darkeyed woman whose speech and greeting were of the softlipped south she in turn presented me to her mother a blackbrowed snowyhaired old lady with a cap of priceless venetian point hands that must have held many hearts in their time and a dignity as unquestioned and unquestioning as an empress she was indeed a burton of savannah who on their own ground outrank the lees of virginia the rest of the company came from buffalo cincinnati cleveland and chicago with here and there a softening southern strain a party of young folk popped corn beneath a mantelpiece surmounted by a gainsborough two portly men half hidden by a cased harp discussed over sheaves of typewritten documents the terms of some contract a knot of matrons talked servantsirish

whats the matteh with lord marshaltons ordeh of the gyartah we cyant find it anyweah  well miss i have heard that that order is usually returned to his majesty on the death of the holder yes miss then in a whisper to a footman more butter for the popcorn in king charless corner he stopped behind my chair your room is number eleven sir may i trouble you for your keys  he left the room with a sixyearold maiden called alice who had announced she would not go to bed less peter peter punkineater takes meso there  he very kindly looked in on me for a moment as i was dressing for dinner not at all sir he replied to some compliment i paid him i valeted the late lord marshalton for fifteen years he was very abrupt in his movements sir as a rule i never received more than an hours notice of a journey we used to go to syria frequently i have been twice to babylon mr and mrs ziglers requirements are comparatively speaking few  but the guests  very little out of the ordinary as soon as one knows their ordinaries extremely simple if i may say so sir  i had the privilege of taking mrs burton in to dinner and was rewarded with an entirely new and to me rather shocking view of abraham lincoln who she said had wasted the heritage of his land by blood and fire and had surrendered the remnant to aliens my brother suh she said fell at gettysburg in order that armenians should colonise new england today if i took any interest in any damyankee outside of my soninlaw laughton yondah i should say that my brothers death had been amply avenged  the man at her right took up the challenge and the war spread her eyes twinkled over the flames she had lit  dont these folk she said a little later remind you of arabs picnicking under the pyramids  ive never seen the pyramids i replied  hm i didnt know you were as english as all that and when i laughed are you  always it saves trouble  now thats just what i find so significant among the englishthis was alices mother i think with one elbow well forward among the salted almonds oh i know how you feel madam burton but a northerner like myselfim buffaloeven though we come over every yearnotices the desire for comfort in england theres so little conflict or uplift in british society  but we like being comfortable i said  i know it its very characteristic but aint it a little just a little lacking in adaptability an imagination  they havent any need for adaptability madam burton struck in they havent any ellis island standards to live up to  but we can assimilate the buffalo woman charged on  now you have done it i whispered to the old lady as the blessed word assimilation woke up all the old arguments for and against  there was not a dull moment in that dinner for menor afterwards when the boys and girls at the piano played the ragtime tunes of their own land while their elders inexhaustibly interested replunged into the discussion of that lands future till there was talk of cooncan when all the company had been set to tables zigler led me into his booklined study where i noticed he kept his golfclubs and spoke simply as a child gravely as a bishop of the years that were past since our last meeting  thats about all i guessup to date he said when he had unrolled the bright map of his fortunes across three continents bein rich suits me so does your country sir my own country you heard what that detroit man said at dinner a government of the alien by the alien for the alien mothers right too lincoln killed us from the highest motivesbut he killed us oh say that reminds me jever kill a man from the highest motives  not from any motiveas far as i remember  well i have it dont weigh on my mind any but it was interesting life is interesting for a richfor anyman in england yaas life in england is like settin in the front row at the theatre and never knowin when the whole blame drama wont spill itself into your lap i didnt always know that i lie abed now and i blush to think of some of the breaks i made in south africa about the british not your official method of doin business but the spirit i was way way off on the spirit are you acquainted with any other country where youd have to kill a man or two to get at the national spirit  well i answered next to marrying one of its women killing one of its men makes for pretty close intimacy with any country i take it you killed a british citizen

ranchelast year it was just before i signed the papers that our murder eventuated my lord marshalton he asked me down for the weekend to fix up something or otherabout peters and the linen i think

near on that tonight in the smokingroom here my lord marshaltonmankeltow that wasintroduces me to this walen man with the nose hed been in the war too from start to finish he knew all the columns and generals that id battled with in the days of my zigler gun we kinder fell into each others arms an let the harsh world go by for a while  walen he introduces me to your lord lundie he was a new proposition to me if he hadnt been a lawyer hed have made a lovely cattleking i thought i had played poker some another of my breaks yaas it cost me eleven hundred dollars besides what tommy said when i retired i have no fault to find with your hereditary aristocracy or your judiciary or your press  sunday we all went to church across the park here psha think o your rememberin my religion ive become an episcopalian since i married yaas after lunch walen did his crownedheadsofeurope stunt in the smokinroom here he was long on kings and continental crises i do not pretend to follow british domestic politics but in the aeroplane business a man has to know something of international possibilities at present you british are settin in kimonoes on dynamite kegs walens talk put me wise on the location and size of some of the kegs yaas  after that we four went out to look at those golflinks i was hirin we each took a club minehe glanced at a great tan bag by the fireplacewas the beginners friendthe cleek well sir this golf proposition took a holt of me as quick asquick as death they had to prise me off the greens when it got too dark to see and then we went back to the house i was walkin ahead with my lord marshalton talkin beginners golf i was the man who ought to have been killed by rights we cut cross lots through the woods to floras templethat place i showed you this afternoon lundie and walen were maybe twenty or thirty rod behind us in the dark marshalton and i stopped at the theatre to admire at the ancestral yewtrees he took me right under the biggestking somebodys yewand while i was spannin it with my handkerchief he says look heah just as if it was a rabbitand down comes a biplane into the theatre with no more noise than the dead my rush silencer is the only one on the market that allows that sort of gumshoe work what a biplanewith two men in it both men jump out and start fussin with the engines i was starting to tell mankeltowi cant remember to call him marshalton any morethat it looked as if the royal british flying corps had got on to my rush silencer at last but he steps out from under the yew to these two stealthy steves and says whats the trouble can i be of any service he thoughtso did itwas some of the boys from aldershot or salisbury well sir from there on the situation developed like a motionpicture in hell the man on the nigh side of the machine whirls round pulls his gun and fires into mankeltows face i laid him out with my cleek automatically any one who shoots a friend of mine gets whats comin to him if im within reach he drops mankeltow rubs his neck with his handkerchief the man the far side of the machine starts to run lundie down the ride or it might have been walen shouts whats happened mankeltow says collar that chap  the second man runs ringaringoroses round the machine one hand reachin behind him mankeltow heads him off to me he breaks blind for walen and lundie who are runnin up the ride theres some sort of mixup among em which its too dark to see and a thud walen says oh well collared lundie says thats the only thing i never learned at harrow mankeltow runs up to em still rubbin his neck and says he didnt fire at me it was the other chap where is he  ive stretched him alongside his machine i says  are they poachers says lundie  no airmen i cant make it out says mankeltow  look at here says walen kind of brusque this man aint breathin at all didnt you hear somethin crack when he lit lundie  my god says lundie did i i thought it was my suspendersno he said braces  right there i left them and sort o tiptoed back to my man hopin hed revived and quit but he hadnt that darned cleek had hit him on the back of the neck just where his helmet stopped hed got his i knew it by the way the head rolled in my hands then the others came up the ride totin their load no mistakin that shuffle on grass dyou remember itin south africa yaas  hsh says lundie do you know ive broken this mans neck  same here i says  what both says mankeltow  nonsense says lord lundie whod have thought he was that out of training a man oughtnt to fly if he aint fit  what did they want here anyway said walen and mankeltow says we cant leave them in the open some onell come carry em to floras temple  we toted em again and laid em out on a stone bench they were still dead in spite of our best attentions we knew it but we went through the motions till it was quite dark wonder if all murderers do that we want a light on this says walen after a spell there ought to be one in the machine why didnt they light it  we came out of floras temple and shut the doors behind us some stars were showing thensame as when cain did his little act i guess i climbed up and searched the machine she was very well equipped i found two electric torches in clips alongside her barometers by the rear seat  what make is she says mankeltow  continental renzalaer i says my engines and my rush silencer  walen whistles herelet me look he says and grabs the other torch she was sure well equipped we gathered up an armful of cameras an maps an notebooks an an album of mounted photographs which we took to floras temple and spread on a marbletopped table ill show you tomorrow which the king of naples had presented to grandfather marshalton walen starts to go through em we wanted to know why our friends had been so prejudiced against our society  wait a minute says lord lundie lend me a handkerchief  he pulls out his own and walen contributes his greenandred bandanna and lundie covers their faces now he says well go into the evidence  there wasnt any flaw in that evidence walen read out their last observations and mankeltow asked questions and lord lundie sort o summarised and i looked at the photos in the album jever see a birdseye telephotosurvey of england for military purposes its interestin but indecentlike turnin a man upside down none of those closerange panoramas of forts could have been taken without my rush silencer  i wish we was as thorough as they are says mankeltow when walen stopped translatin  weve been thorough enough says lord lundie the evidence against both accused is conclusive any other country would give em seven years in a fortress we should probably give em eighteen months as firstclass misdemeanants but their case he says is out of our hands we must review our own mr zigler he said will you tell us what steps you took to bring about the death of the first accused i told him he wanted to know specially whether id stretched first accused before or after he had fired at mankeltow mankeltow testified hed been shot at and exhibited his neck as evidence it was scorched  now mr walen says lord lundie will you kindly tell us what steps you took with regard to the second accused  the man ran directly at me me lord says walen i said oh no you dont and hit him in the face  lord lundie lifts one hand and uncovers second accuseds face there was a bruise on one cheek and the chin was all greened with grass he was a heavybuilt man  what happened after that says lord lundie  to the best of my remembrance he turned from me towards your lordship  then lundie goes ahead i stooped and caught the man round the ankles he says the sudden check threw him partially over my left shoulder i jerked him off that shoulder still holding his ankles and he fell heavily on it would appear the point of his chin death being instantaneous  death being instantaneous says walen  lord lundie takes off his gown and wigyou could see him do itand becomes our fellowmurderer thats our case he says i know how i should direct the jury but its an undignified business for a lord of appeal to lift his hand to and some of my learned brothers he says might be disposed to be facetious  i guess i cant be properly sensitised any one who steered me out of that trouble might have had the laugh on me for generations but im only a millionaire i said wed better search second accused in case hed been carryin concealed weapons  that certainly is a point says lord lundie but the question for the jury would be whether i exercised more force than was necessary to prevent him from usin them i didnt say anything he wasnt talkin my language second accused had his gun on him sure enough but it had jammed in his hippocket he was too fleshy to reach behind for business purposes and he didnt look a gunman anyway both of em carried wads of private letters by the time walen had translated we knew how many children the fat one had at home and when the thin one reckoned to be married too bad yaas  says walen to me while we was rebuttonin their jackets they was not in uniform ever read a book called the wreckers mr zigler  not that i recall at the present moment i says  well do he says youd appreciate it youd appreciate it now i assure you  ill remember i says but i dont see how this song and dance helps us any heres our corpses heres their machine and daylights bound to come  heavens that reminds me says lundie what times dinner  halfpast eight says mankeltow its halfpast five now we knocked off golf at twenty to and if they hadnt been such silly asses firin pistols like civilians wed have had them to dinner why they might be sitting with us in the smokingroom this very minute he says then he said that no man had a right to take his profession so seriously as these two mountebanks  how interestin says lundie ive noticed this impatient attitude toward their victim in a good many murderers i never understood it before of course its the disposal of the body that annoys em now i wonder he says who our case will come up before lets run through it again  then walen whirls in hed been bitin his nails in a corner we was all nerved up by now me the worst of the bunch i had to think for tommy as well  we cant be tried says walen we mustnt be tried itll make an infernal international stink what did i tell you in the smokingroom after lunch the tensions at breakingpoint already this ud snap it cant you see that  i was thinking of the legal aspect of the case says lundie with a good jury wed likely be acquitted  acquitted says walen whod dare acquit us in the face of what ud be demanded bythe other party did you ever hear of the war of jenkins ear ever hear of mason and slidel ever hear of an ultimatum you know who these two idiots are you know who we area lord of appeal a viscount of the english peerage and meme knowing all i know which the men who know dam well know that i do know its our necks or armageddon which do you think this government would choose we cant be tried he says  then i expect ill have to resign me club lundie goes on i dont think thats ever been done before by an exofficio member i must ask the secretary i guess he was kinder bunkered for the minute or maybe twas the lordship comin out on him  rot says mankeltow walens right we cant afford to be tried well have to bury them but my headgardener locks up all the tools at five oclock  not on your life says lundie he was on deck againas the highclass lawyer right or wrong if we attempt concealment of the bodies were done for  im glad of that says mankeltow because after all it aint cricket to bury em  somehowbut i know i aint englishthat consideration didnt worry me as it ought an besides i was thinkini had toan id begun to see a light way offa little glimmerin light o salvation  then what are we to do says walen zigler what do you advise your necks in it too  gentlemen i says something lord lundie let fall a while back gives me an idea i move that this committee empowers big claus and little claus who have elected to commit suicide in our midst to leave the premises as they came im asking you to take big chances i says but theyre all weve got and then i broke for the biplane  dont tell me the english cant think as quick as the next man when its up to them they lifted em out o floras templereverent but not wastin timewhilst i found out what had brought her down one cylinder was misfirin i didnt stop to fix it my renzalaer will hold up on six weve proved that if her crew had relied on my guarantees theyd have been halfway home by then instead of takin their seats with hangin heads like they was ashamed they ought to have been ashamed too playin gunmen in a british peers park i took big chances startin her without controls but twas a dead still night an a clear runyou saw itacross the theatre into the park and i prayed shed rise before she hit high timber i set her all i dared for a quick lift i told mankeltow that if i gave her too much nose shed be liable to upend and flop he didnt want another inquest on his estate no sir so i had to fix her up in the dark yaas  i took big chances too while those other three held on to her and i worked her up to full power my renzalaers no ventilationfan to pull against but i climbed out just in time id hitched the signallin lamp to her tail sos we could track her otherwise with my rush silencer we mights well have shooed an owl out of a barn she left just that way when we let her go no sound except the propellerswhoooooo whoooooo there was a dip in the ground ahead it hid her lamp for a secondbut theres no such thing as time in real life then that lamp travelled up the far slope slowtoo slow then it kinder lifted we judged then it sure was liftin then it lifted good dyou know why our four naked perspirin souls was out there underneath her hikin her heavens high yes sir we did it and that lamp kept liftin and liftin then she sideslipped my god she sideslipped twice which was what id been afraid of all along then she straightened up and went away climbin to glory for that blessed star of our hope got smaller and smaller till we couldnt track it any more then we breathed we hadnt breathed any since their arrival but we didnt know it till we breathed that timeall together then we dug our fingernails out of our palms an came alive againin instalments  lundie spoke first we therefore commit their bodies to the air he says an puts his cap on  the deepthe deep says walen its just twentythree miles to the channel  poor chaps poor chaps says mankeltow wed have had em to dinner if they hadnt lost their heads i cant tell you how this distresses me laughton  well look at here arthur i says its only gods own mercy you an me aint lyin in floras temple now and if that fat man had known enough to fetch his gun around while he was runnin lord lundie and walen would have been alongside us  i see that he says but were alive and theyre dead dont ye know  i know it i says thats where the dead are always so damned unfair on the survivors  i see that too he says but id have given a good deal if it hadnt happened poor chaps  amen says lundie then oh then we sorter walked back two an two to floras temple an lit matches to see we hadnt left anything behind walen he had confiscated the notebooks before they left there was the first mans pistol which wed forgot to return him lyin on the stone bench mankeltow puts his hand on ithe never touched the triggeran bein an automatic of course the blame thing jarred offspiteful as a rattler  look out theyll have one of us yet says walen in the dark but they didntthe lord hadnt quit being our shepherdand we heard the bullet zip across the veldtquite like old times yaas  swine says mankeltow  after that i didnt hear any more poor chap talk me i never worried about killing my man i was too busy figurin how a british jury might regard the proposition i guess lundie felt that way too  oh but say we had an interestin time at dinner folks was expected whose auto had hung up on the road they hadnt wired and peters had laid two extra places we noticed em as soon as we sat down id hate to say how noticeable they were mankeltow with his neck bandaged hed caught a relaxed throat golfin sent for peters and told him to take those empty places awayif you please it takes something to rattle peters he was rattled that time nobody else noticed anything and now  where did they come down i asked as he rose  in the channel i guess there was nothing in the papers about em shall we go into the drawinroom and see what these boys and girls are doin but say aint life in england interestin          rebirth         if any god should say          i will restore        the world her yesterday          whole as before      my judgment blasted itwho would not lift      heart eye and hand in passion oer the gift         if any god should will          to wipe from mind        the memory of this ill          which is mankind      in soul and substance nowwho would not bless      even to tears his lovingtenderness         if any god should give          us leave to fly        these present deaths we live          and safely die      in those lost lives we lived ere we were born      what man but would not laugh the excuse to scorn         for we are what we are          so broke to blood        and the strict works of war          so long subdued      to sacrifice that threadbare death commands      hardly observance at our busier hands         yet we were what we were          and fashioned so        it pleases us to stare          at the far show      of unbelievable years and shapes that flit      in our own likeness on the edge of it    the horse marines  1911  the rt hon rb haldane secretary of state for war6 was questioned in the house of commons on april 8th about the rockinghorses which the war office is using for the purpose of teaching recruits to ride lord ronaldshay asked the war secretary if rockinghorses were to be supplied to all the cavalry regiments for teaching recruits to ride the noble lord replied mr haldane is doubtless alluding to certain dummy horses on rockers which have been tested with very satisfactory results the mechanical steed is a wooden horse with an astonishing tail it is painted brown and mounted on swinging rails the recruit leaps into the saddle and pulls at the reins while the ridinginstructor rocks the animal to and fro with his foot the rockinghorses are being made at woolwich they are quite cheap  daily paper  footnote 6 now viscount haldane of cloan  my instructions to mr leggatt my engineer had been accurately obeyed he was to bring my car on completion of annual overhaul from coventry via london to southampton docks to await my arrival and very pretty she looked under the steamers side among the railway lines at six in the morning next to her new paint and varnish i was most impressed by her four brandnew tyres  but i didnt order new tyres i said as we moved away these are irresilients too  trebleribbed said leggatt diamondstud sheathing  then there has been a mistake  oh no sir theyre gratis  the number of motor manufacturers who give away complete sets of trebleribbed irresilient tyres is so limited that i believe i asked leggatt for an explanation  i dont know that i could very well explain sir was the answer it ud come better from mr pyecroft hes on leaf at portsmouthstaying with his uncle his uncle ad the body all night id defy you to find a scratch on her even with a microscope  then we will go home by the portsmouth road i said  and we went at those speeds which are allowed before the workingday begins or the police are thawed out we were blocked near portsmouth by a battalion of regulars on the move  whitsuntide manoeuvres just ending said leggatt theyve had a fortnight in the downs  he said no more until we were in a narrow street somewhere behind portsmouth town railway station where he slowed at a greengrocery shop the door was open and a small old man sat on three potatobaskets swinging his feet over a stooping blue back  you call that shinin em he piped can you see your face in em yet no then shine em or ill give you a beltin youll remember  if you stop kickin me in the mouth perhaps id do better said pyecrofts voice meekly  we blew the horn  pyecroft arose put away the brushes and received us not otherwise than as a king in his own country  are you going to leave me up here all day said the old man  pyecroft lifted him down and he hobbled into the back room  its his corns pyecroft explained you cant shine corny feetand he hasnt had his breakfast  i havent had mine either i said  breakfast for two more uncle pyecroft sang out  go out an buy it then was the answer or else its halfrations  pyecroft turned to leggatt gave him his marketing orders and despatched him with the coppers  i have got four new tyres on my car i began impressively  yes said mr pyecroft you have and i will sayhe patted my cars bonnetyou earned em  i want to know why i went on  quite justifiable you havent noticed anything in the papers have you  ive only just landed i havent seen a paper for weeks  then you can lend me a virgin ear theres been a scandal in the junior servicethe army i believe they call em  a bag of coffeebeans pitched on the counter roast that said the uncle from within  pyecroft rigged a small coffeeroaster while i took down the shutters and sold a young lady in curlpapers two bunches of mixed greens and one soft orange  sickly stuff to handle on an empty stomach aint it said pyecroft  what about my new tyres i insisted  oh any amount but the question ishe looked at me steadilyis this what you might call a courtmartial or a postmortem inquiry  strictly a postmortem said i  that being so said pyecroft we can rapidly arrive at facts last thursdaythe shutters go behind those basketslast thursday at five bells in the forenoon watch otherwise tenthirty am your mr leggatt was discovered on westminster bridge laying his course for the old kent road  but that doesnt lead to southampton i interrupted  then perhaps he was swinging the car for compasses be that as it may we found him in that latitude simultaneous as jules and me was ong route for waterloo to rejoin our respective shipsor navies i should say jules was a permissionaire which meant being on leaf same as me from a french cassowarycruiser at portsmouth a party of her trusty and wellbeloved petty officers ad been seeing london chaperoned by the rc chaplain jules ad detached himself from the squadron and was cruisin on his own when i joined him in company of copious ladyfriends but mark you your mr leggatt drew the line at the girls loud and long he drew it  im glad of that i said  you may be he adopted the puristical formation from the first yes he said when we was annealing him atbut you wouldnt know the pubi am going to southampton he says and ill stretch a point to go via portsmouth but says he seeing what sort of one hell of a time invariably trarnspires when we cruise together mr pyecroft i do not feel myself justified towards my generous and longsuffering employer in takin on that kind of ballast as well i assure you he considered your interests  and the girls i asked  oh i left that to jules im a monogomite by nature so we embarked strictly ong garÃ§ong but i should tell you in case he didnt that your mr leggatts care for your interests ad extended to sheathing the car in matting and gunnybags to preserve her paintwork she was all swathed up like an italian baby  he is careful about his paintwork i said  for a man with no service experience i should say he was fair homicidal on the subject if wed been marines he couldnt have been more pointed in his allusions to our hobnailed socks however we reduced him to a malleable condition and embarked for portsmouth id seldom rejoined my vaisseau ong automobile avec a fur coat and goggles nor ad jules  did jules say much i asked helplessly turning the handle of the coffeeroaster  thats where i pitied the pore beggar he adnt the language so to speak he was confined to heavings and shruggins and copious mong jews the french are very badly fitted with reliefvalves and then our mr leggatt drove he drove  was he in a very malleable condition  not him we recognised the value of his cargo from the outset he hadnt a chance to get more than moist at the edges after which we went to sleep and now well go to breakfast  we entered the back room where everything was in order and a screeching canary made us welcome the uncle had added sausages and piles of buttered toast to the kippers the coffee cleared with a piece of fishskin was a revelation  leggatt who seemed to know the premises had run the car into the tiny backyard where her mirrorlike back almost blocked up the windows he minded shop while we ate pyecroft passed him his rations through a flap in the door the uncle ordered him in after breakfast to wash up and he jumped in his gaiters at the old mans commands as he has never jumped to mine  to resoom the postmortem said pyecroft lighting his pipe my slumbers were broken by the propeller ceasing to revolve and by vile language from your mr leggatt  ii leggatt began a bluechecked duster in one hand and a cup in the other  when youre wanted aft youll be sent for mr leggatt said pyecroft amiably its clean mess decks for you now resooming once more we was on a lonely and desolate ocean near portsdown surrounded by gorse bushes and a boy scout was stirring my stomach with his little copperstick  you count ten he says  very good boy jones i says count em and i hauled him in over the gunnel and ten i gave him with my large flat hand the remarks he passed lying face down tryin to bite my leg would have reflected credit on any service having finished i dropped him overboard again which was my gross political error i ought to ave killed him because he began signallingrapid and accuratein a souwesterly direction few equatorial calms are to be apprehended when bps little pets take to signallin make a note o that three minutes later we were stopped and boarded by scoutsup our backs down our necks and in our boots the last i heard from your mr leggatt as he went under brushin em off his cap was thanking heaven hed covered up the new paintwork with mats an eroic soul  not a scratch on her body said leggatt pouring out the coffeegrounds  and jules said i  oh jules thought the much advertised social revolution had begun but his mackintosh hampered him  you told me to bring the mackintosh leggatt whispered to me  and when i ad em half convinced he was a french vicomte coming down to visit the commanderinchief at portsmouth he tried to take it off seeing his uniform underneath some sucking sherlock holmes of the pink eye patrol they called him eddy deduced that i wasnt speaking the truth eddy said i was tryin to sneak into portsmouth unobservedunobserved mark youand join hands with the enemy it trarnspired that the scouts was conducting a fieldday against opposin forces ably assisted by all branches of the service and they was so afraid the car wouldnt count ten points to them in the fray that theyd have scalped us but for the intervention of an umpirealso in short underdrawers a fleshy sight  here mr pyecroft shut his eyes and nodded that umpire he said suddenly was our mr morsheda gentleman whose acquaintance you have already made and profited by if i mistake not7  footnote 7 their lawful occasions traffics and discoveries  oh was the navy in it too i said for i had read of wild doings occasionally among the boy scouts on the portsmouth road in which navy army and the world at large seemed to have taken part  the navy was in it i was the only one out of itfor several seconds our mr morshed failed to recognise me in my fur boa and my appealin winks at im behind your goggles didnt arrive but when eddy darling had told his story i saluted which is difficult in furs and i stated i was bringin him dispatches from the north my mr morshed cohered on the instant ive never known his ethergram installations out of order yet go and guard your blessed road he says to the fratton orphan asylum standing at attention all round him and when they was removedpyecroft he says still sotte voce what in hongkong are you doing with this duncoloured sampan  it was your mr leggatts paintprotective matting which caught his eye she did resemble a sampan especially about the sternworks at these remarks i naturally threw myself on is bosom so far as service conditions permitted and revealed him all mentioning that the car was yours you know his way of working his lips like a rabbit yes he was quite pleased his car he kept murmuring working his lips like a rabbit i owe im more than a trifle for things he wrote about me ill keep the car  your mr leggatt now injected some semimutinous remarks to the effect that he was your chauffeur in charge of your car and as such capable of so acting mr morshed threw him a glarnce it sufficed didnt it suffice mr leggatt  i knew if something didnt happen something worse would said leggatt it never fails when youre aboard  and jules i demanded  jules was so to speak panicking in a watertight flat through his unfortunate lack of language i had to introduce him as part of the entente cordiale and he was put under arrest too then we sat on the grass and smoked while eddy and co violently annoyed the traffic on the portsmouth road till the umpires all in short panties conferred on the valuable lessons of the fieldday and added up points same as at targetpractice i didnt hear their conclusions but our mr morshed delivered a farewell address to eddy and co tellin em they ought to have deduced from a hundred signs about me that i was a friendly bringin in dispatches from the north we left em tryin to find those signs in the scout book and we reached mr morsheds hotel at portsmouth at 627 pm ong automobile here endeth the first chapter  begin the second i said  the uncle and leggatt had finished washing up and were seated smoking while the damp duster dried at the fire  about what time was it said pyecroft to leggatt when our mr morshed began to talk about uncles  when he came back to the bar after hed changed into those ratcatcher clothes said leggatt  thats right pye said he have you an uncle i have i says heres santy to him and i finished my sherry and bitters to you uncle  thats right said pyecrofts uncle sternly if you hadnt id have belted you worth rememberin emmanuel i had the body all night  pyecroft smiled affectionately so you ad uncle an beautifully you looked after her but as i was saying i have an uncle too says mr morshed dark and lowering yet somehow i cant love him i want to mortify the beggar volunteers to mortify my uncle one pace to the front  i took jules with me the regulation distance jules was getting interested your mr leggatt preserved a strictly nootral attitude  youre a pressed man says our mr morshed i owe your late employer much so to say the car will manoeuvre all night as requisite  mr leggatt come out noble as your employee and by eavens divine grace instead of arguing he pleaded his new paint and varnish which was mr morsheds one vital spot hes lootenant on one of the new catchemaliveos now true says he paints an oly thing ill give you one hour to arrange a modus vivendi full bunkers and steam ready by 9 pm tonight if you please  even so mr leggatt was far from content i ad to arrange the details we run her into the yard here pyecroft nodded through the window at my cars glossy backpanels we took off the body with its mats and put it in the stable substitooting and that yards a tight fit for extensive repairs the body of uncles blue delivery cart it overhung a trifle but after id lashed it i knew it wouldnt fetch loose thus in our composite cruiser we repaired once more to the hotel and was immediately dispatched to the toyshop in the high street where we took aboard one rockinghorse which was waiting for us  took aboard what i cried  one fourteenhand dapplegrey rockinghorse with pure green rockers and detachable tail pair gashly glass eyes complete set orrible grinnin teeth and two bloodyred nostrils which protruding from the brown papers produced the tout ensemble of a juju sacrifice in the benin campaign do i make myself comprehensible  perfectly did you say anything i asked  only to jules to him i says wishing to try him allez Ã  votre bateau je say mon lootenong eel voo donneray porkwor to me says he vous ong ate hurroo jamay de la vee and i saw by his eye hed taken on for the full term of the war jules was a blueeyed brindlehaired beggar of a useful make and inquirin habits your mr leggatt he only groaned  leggatt nodded it was like nightmares he said it was like nightmares  once more then pyecroft swept on we returned to the hotel and partook of a sumptuous repast under the able and genial chairmanship of our mr morshed who laid his projecks unreservedly before us in the first place he says opening out bicyclemaps my uncle who i regret to say is a brigadiergeneral has sold his alleged soul to dicky bridoon for a feathery hat and a pair o gilt spurs jules conspuez loncle so jules youll be glad to hear  one minute pye i said who is dicky bridoon  i dont usually mingle myself up with the bickerings of the junior service but it trarnspired that he was secretary o state for civil war an hed been issuing mechanical leatherbelly geegees which doctors recommend for tumourto the british cavalry in loo of real meat horses to learn to ride on dont you remember there was quite a stir in the papers owing to the cavalry not appreciatin em but thats a minor item the main point was that our uncle in his capacity of brigadiergeneral mark you had wrote to the papers highly approvin o dicky bridoons mechanical substitutes an ad thus obtained promotionall same as a agnosticle stoker psalmsingin imself up the service under a pious captain at that point of the narrative we caught a phosphorescent glimmer why the rockinghorse might have been issued but none the less the navigation was intricate omitting the fact it was dark and cloudy our brigadieruncle lay somewhere in the south downs with his brigade which was manoeuvrin at whitsum manoeuvres on a large scalered army versus blue et cetera an all we ad to go by was those flapping bicyclemaps and your mr leggatts groans  i was thinking what the downs mean after dark said leggatt angrily  they was worth thinkin of said pyecroft when we had studied the map till it fair spun we decided to sally forth and creep for uncle by hand in the dark dark night an present im with the rockinghorse so we embarked at 857 pm  one minute again please how much did jules understand by that time i asked  sufficient unto the dayor night perhaps i should say he told our mr morshed hed follow him more sang frays which is french for dead drunk or damned barrin is paucity o language there wasnt a blemish on jules but what i wished to imply was when we climbed into the back parts of the car our lootenant morshed says to me i doubt if id flick my cigarends about too lavish mr pyecroft we ought to be sitting on five pounds worth of selected fireworks and i think the rockets are your end not being able to smoke with my ead over the side i threw it away and then your mr leggatt aving been as nearly mutinous as it pays to be with my mr morshed arched his back and drove  where did he drive to please said i  primerrily in search of any or either or both armies seconderrily of course in search of our brigadieruncle not finding him on the road we ran about the grass looking for him this took us to a great many places in a short time ow eavenly that lilac did smell on top of that first downstinkin its blossomin little heart out  i adnt leesure to notice said mr leggatt the downs were full o chalkpits and wed no lights  we ad the bicyclelamp to look at the map by didnt you notice the old lady at the window where we saw the man in the nightgown i thought nightgowns as sleepin rig was extinck so to speak  i tell you i adnt leesure to notice leggatt repeated  thats odd then what might ave made you tell the sentry at the first camp we found that you was the daily express deliverywaggon  you cant touch pitch without being defiled leggatt answered oo told the officer in the bath we were umpires  well he asked us that was when we found the territorial battalion undressin in slow time it lay on the left flank o the blue army and it cackled as it lay too but it gave us our position as regards the respective armies we wandered a little more and at 117 pm not having had a road under us for twenty minutes we scaled the heights of something or otherwhich are about six hundred feet high here we alted to tighten the lashings of the superstructure and we smelt leather and horses three counties deep all round we was as you might say in the thick of it  ah says my mr morshed my orizon has indeed broadened what a little thing is an uncle mr pyecroft in the presence o these glitterin constellations simply ludicrous he says to waste a rockinghorse on an individual we must socialise it but we must get their eads up first touch off one rocket if you please  i touched off a green threepounder which rose several thousand metres and burst into gorgeous stars reproduce the manoeuvre he says at the other end o this ridgeif it dont end in another cliff so we steamed down the ridge a mile and a half east and then i let jules touch off a pink rocket or hed ha kissed me that was his only way to express his emotions so to speak their heads come up then all around us to the extent o thousands we hears bugles like cocks crowing below and on the top of it a most impressive sound which id never enjoyed before because itherto id always been an inteegral part of it so to saythe noise of ole armies gettin under arms they must ave anticipated a night attack i imagine most impressive then we eard a threshinmachine tutt tutt this is childish says lootenant morshed we cant wait till theyve finished cutting chaff for their horses we must make em understand were not to be trifled with expedite em with another rocket mr pyecroft  its barely possible sir i remarks that thats a searchlight churnin up and by the time we backed into a providential chalk cutting which was where our first tyre went pungo she broke out to the northward and began searching the ridge a smart bit o work  twasnt a puncture the inner tube had nipped because we skidded so leggatt interrupted  while your mr leggatt was effectin repairs another searchlight broke out to the southward and the two of em swept our ridge on both sides right at the west end of it they showed us the ground rising into a hill so to speak crowned with what looked like a little fort morshed saw it before the beams shut off thats the key of the position he says occupy it at all hazards  i havent half got occupation for the next twenty minutes says your mr leggatt rootin and blasphemin in the dark mark now ow morshed changed his tactics to suit is environment right says he ill stand by the ship mr pyecroft and jules oblige me by doubling along the ridge to the east with all the maroons and crackers you can carry without spilling read the directions careful for the maroons mr pyecroft and touch them off at halfminute intervals jules represents musketry an maxim fire under your command remember its death or salisbury gaol probly both  by these means and some moderately ard runnin we distracted em to the eastward maroons you may not be aware are same as bombs with the anarchism left out in confined spots like chalkpits they knock a fourpointseven silly but you should read the directions beforeand in the intervals of the slow but welldirected fire of my cowguns jules who had found a sheeppond in the dark a little lower down gave what you might call a cinematograph reproduction o sporadic musketry they was large size crackers and he concluded with the dull sickenin thud o blind shells burstin on soft ground  how did he manage that i said  you throw a lighted squib into water and youll see said pyecroft thus then we improvised till supplies was exhausted and the surrounding landscapes fair owled and ummed at us the jun or service might ave ad their doubts about the rockets but they couldnt overlook our gunfire both sides tumbled out full of initiative i told jules no two flatfeet ad any right to be as happy as us and we went back along the ridge to the derelict and there was our mr morshed apostrophin his andiwork over fifty square mile o country with attend all ye who list to hear out of the fifth reader hed got as far as and roused the shepherds o stonehenge the rangers o beaulieu when we come up and he drew our attention to its truth as well as its beauty thats rare in poetry im told he went right on tothe red glare on skiddaw roused those beggars at carlislewhich he pointed out was poetic license for leith hill this allowed your mr leggatt time to finish pumpin up his tyres i eard the sweat op off his nose  you know what it is sir said poor leggatt to me  it warfted across my mind as i listened to what was trarnspirin that it might be easier to make the mess than to wipe it up but such considerations weighed not with our valiant leader  mr pyecroft he says it cant have escaped your notice that we ave one angry and ighly intelligent army in front of us an another ighly angry and equally intelligent army in our rear what ud you recommend  most men would have besought im to do a lateral glide while there was yet time but all i said was the rockinghorse isnt expended yet sir  he laid his hand on my shoulder pye says he theres worse men than you in loftier places they shall ave it none the less he remarks the ice is undeniably packing  i may ave omitted to point out that at this juncture two large armies both deprived of their nights sleep was awake as you might say and hurryin into each others arms here endeth the second chapter  he filled his pipe slowly the uncle had fallen asleep leggatt lit another cigarette  we then proceeded ong automobile along the ridge in a westerly direction towards the miniature fort which had been so kindly revealed by the searchlight but which on inspection your mr leggatt bumped into an outlyin reef of it proved to be a wurzelclump cestÃ dire a parallelogrammatic pile of about three million mangoldwurzels brought up there for the sheep i suppose on all sides excep the one wed come by the ground fell away moderately quick and down at the bottom there was a large camp lit up an full of harsh words of command  i said it was the key to the position lootenant morshed remarks trot out persimmon which we rightly took to read unwrap the rockinghorse  houp la says jules in a insubordinate tone an slaps persimmon on the flank  silence says the lootenant this is the royal navy not newmarket and we carried persimmon to the top of the mangelwurzel clump as directed  owing to the inequalities of the terrain i do think your mr leggatt might have had a spiritlevel in his kit he wouldnt rock free on the bedplate and while adjustin him his detachable tail fetched adrift our lootenant was quick to seize the advantage  remove that transformation he says substitute one roman candle gaspower is superior to manual propulsion  so we substituted he arranged the piÃ¨ce de resistarnce in the shape of large drumsnot saucers mark youdrums of coloured fire with printed instructions at proper distances round persimmon there was a brief interregnum while we dug ourselves in among the wurzels by hand then he touched off the fires not omitting the roman candle and you may take it from me all was visible persimmon shone out in his naked splendour red to port green to starboard and one white light at his bows as per board o trade regulations only he didnt so much rock you might say as shrug himself in a manner of speaking every time the candle went off one cant have everything but the rest surpassed our highest expectations i think persimmon was noblest on the starboard or green sidemore like when a man thinks hes seeing mackerel in hell dont you know and yet id be the last to deprecate the effect of the port light on his teeth or that bloodshot look in his left eye he knew there was something going on he didnt approve of he looked worried  did you laugh i said  im not much of a wag myself nor it wasnt as if we ad time to allow the spectacle to sink in the coloured fires was supposed to burn ten minutes whereas it was obvious to the meanest capacity that the junior service would arrive by forced marches in about two and a half they grarsped our topical allusion as soon as it was across the footlights so to speak they were quite chafed at it of course ad we reflected we might have known that exposin illuminated rockinhorses to an army that was learnin to ride on em partook of the nature of a double entender as the french saysame as waggling the tiller lines at a man whos had a hanging in the family i knew the cox of the archimandrites galley arf killed for a similar plaisanteree but we never anticipated lobsters being so sensitive that was why we shifted we could ardly tear our commandin officer away he put his head on one side and kept cooin the only thing he ad neglected to provide was a line of retreat but your mr leggattan eroic soul in the last stage of wet prostrationhere took command of the van or rather the rearguard we walked downhill beside him holding on to the superstructure to prevent her capsizing these technical details owever are beyond me he waved his pipe towards leggatt  i saw there was two deepish ruts leadin down ill somewhere said leggatt that was when the soldiers stopped laughin and begun to run uphill  stroll lovey stroll pyecroft corrected the dervish rush took place later  so i laid her in these ruts that was where she must ave scraped her silencer a bit then they turned sharp rightthe ruts didand then she stopped bonnethigh in a manureheap sir but ill swear it was all of a one in three gradient i think it was a barnyard we waited there said leggatt  but not for long said pyecroft the lights were towering out of the drums on the position we ad so valiantly abandoned and the junior service was escaladin it en masse when numerous bodies of ighly trained men arrive simultaneous in the same latitude from opposite directions each remarking briskly what the ell did you do that for detonation as you might say is practically assured they didnt ask for extraneous aids if wed come out with sworn affidavits of what wed done they wouldnt ave believed us they wanted each others company exclusive such was the effect of persimmon on their clarss feelings idoltry i call it events transpired with the utmost velocity and rapidly increasing pressures there was a few remarks about dicky bridoon and mechanical horses and then some one was smackedhard by the soundin the middle of a remark  that was the man who kept calling for the fortyfifth dragoons said leggatt he got as far as drag   was it said pyecroft dreamily well he couldnt say they didnt come they all came and they all fell to arguin whether the infantry should ave persimmon for a regimental pet or the cavalry should keep him for stud purposes hence the issue was soon clouded with mangoldwurzels our commander said we ad sowed the good seed and it was bearing abundant fruit they weigh between four and seven pounds apiece seein the children ad got over their shyness and ad really begun to play games we backed out o the pit and went down by steps to the camp below no man as you might say making us afraid here we enjoyed a front view of the battle which rolled with renewed impetus owing to both sides receiving strong reinforcements every minute all arms were freely represented cavalry on this occasion only acting in concert with artillery they argued the relative merits of horses versus feet so to say but they didnt neglect persimmon the wounded rolling downhill with the wurzels informed us that he had long ago been socialised and the smallest souvenirs were worth a mans life speaking broadly the junior service appeared to be a shade out of and if i may venture so far they did not pay prompt and unhesitating obedience to the retires or the cease fires or the for eavens sake come to bed ducky of their officers who i regret to say were otly embroiled at the heads of their respective units  how did you find that out i asked  on account of lootenant morshed going to the mess tent to call on his uncle and raise a drink but all hands had gone to the front we thought we eard somebody bathing behind the tent and we found an oldish gentleman tryin to drown a boy in knickerbockers in a horsetrough he kept him under with a bicycle so to speak he ad nearly accomplished his fell design when we frustrated him he was in a highly malleable condition and full o juice de spree arsk not what i am he says my wife ll tell me that quite soon enough arsk rather what ive been he says ive been dinin here he says i commanded em in the eighties he says and gawd forgive me he says sobbin eavily ive spent this holy evening telling their colonel they was a set of educated inefficients hark to em we could without strainin ourselves but how he picked up the gentle murmur of his own corps in that ontheknee party up the hill i dont know theyve marched and fought thirty mile today he shouts and now theyre tearin the intestines out of the cavalry up yonder they wont stop this side the gates o delhi he says i commanded their ancestors theres nothing wrong with the service he says wringing out his trousers on his lap eaven pardon me for doubtin em same old gamesame young beggars  the boy in the knickerbockers languishing on a chair puts in a claim for one drink let him go dry says our friend in shirttails hes a reporter he run into me on his filthy bicycle and he asked me if i could furnish im with particulars about the mutiny in the army you falseearted proletarian publicist he says shakin his finger at imfor he was reelly annoyedill teach you to defile what you cant comprebend when my regiments in a state o mutiny ill do myself the honour of informing you personally you particularly ignorant and very narsty little man he says youre no better than a dhobis donkey if there wasnt dirty linen to wash youd starve he says and why i havent drowned you will be the lastin regret of my life  well we sat with em and ad drinks for about halfanhour in front of the mess tent hed ha killed the reporter if there hadnt been witnesses and the reporter might have taken notes of the battle so we acted as twoway buffers in a sense i dont hold with the press mingling up with service matters they draw false conclusions now mark you at a moderate estimate there were seven thousand men in the fighting line half of em hurt in their professional feelings an the other half rubbin in the liniment as you might say all due to persimmon if you adnt seen it you wouldnt ave believed it and yet mark you not one single unit of em even resorted to his belt they confined themselves to natural produckshands and the wurzels i thought jules was havin fits till it trarnspired the same thought had impressed him in the french language he called it incroyable i believe seven thousand men with seven thousand rifles belts and bayonets in a violently agitated condition and not a ungenteel blow struck from first to last the old gentleman drew our attention to it as well it was quite noticeable  lack of ammunition was the primerry cause of the battle ceasin a brigademajor came in wipin his nose on both cuffs and sayin he ad ad snuff the brigadieruncle followed he was so to speak sneezin we thought it best to shift our moorings without attractin attention so we shifted they ad called the cows ome by then the junior service was going to byebye all round us as happy as the ships monkey when hes been playin with the paints and lootenant morshed and jules kept bowin to port and starboard of the superstructure acknowledgin the unstinted applause which the multitude would ave given em if theyd known the facts on the other and as your mr leggatt observed they might ave killed us  that would have been about five bells in the middle watch say halfpast two a wellspent evening there was but little to be gained by entering portsmouth at that hour so we turned off on the grass this was after we had found a road under us and we cast anchors out at the stern and prayed for the day  but your mr leggatt he had to make and mend tyres all our watch below it trarnspired she had been running on the rim o two or three wheels which very properly he hadnt reported till the close of the action and thats the reason of your four new tyres mr morshed was of opinion youd earned em do you dissent  i stretched out my hand which pyecroft crushed to pulp no pye i said deeply moved i agree entirely but what happened to jules  we returned him to his own navy after breakfast he wouldnt have kept much longer without some one in his own language to tell it to i dont know any man i ever took more compassion on than jules is sufferings swelled him up centimetres and all he could do on the hard was to kiss lootenant morshed and me and your mr leggatt he deserved that much a cordial beggar  pyecroft looked at the washed cups on the table and the low sunshine on my cars back in the yard  too early to drink to him he said but i feel it just the same  the uncle sunk in his chair snored a little the canary answered with a shrill lullaby pyecroft picked up the duster threw it over the cage put his finger to his lips and we tiptoed out into the shop while leggatt brought the car round  ill look out for the news in the papers i said as i got in  oh we shortcircuited that nothing trarnspired excep a statement to the effect that some territorial battalions had played about with turnips at the conclusion of the manoeuvres the taxpayer dont know all he gets for his money farewell  we moved off just in time to be blocked by a regiment coming towards the station to entrain for london  beg your pardon sir said a sergeant in charge of the baggage but would you mind backin a bit till we get the waggons past  certainly i said you dont happen to have a rockinghorse among your kit do you  the rattle of our reverse drowned his answer but i saw his eyes one of them was blackishgreen about four days old     the legend of mirth       the four archangels so the legends tell      raphael gabriel michael azrael      being first of those to whom the power was shown      stood first of all the host before the throne      and when the charges were allotted burst      tumultuouswinged from out the assembly first      zeal was their spur that bade them strictly heed      their own high judgment on their lightest deed      zeal was their spur that when relief was given      urged them unwearied to fresh toil in heaven      for honours sake perfecting every task      beyond what een perfections self could ask      and allah who created zeal and pride      knows how the twain are perilousnear allied       it chanced on one of heavens longlighted days      the four and all the host having gone their ways      each to his charge the shining courts were void      save for one seraph whom no charge employed      with folden wings and slumberthreatened brow      to whom the word beloved what dost thou      by the permission came the answer soft      little i do nor do that little oft      as is the will in heaven so on earth      where by the will i strive to make men mirth      he ceased and sped hearing the word once more      beloved go thy way and greet the four       systems and universes overpast      the seraph came upon the four at last      guiding and guarding with devoted mind      the tedious generations of mankind      who lent at most unwilling ear and eye      when they could not escape the ministry      yet patient faithful firm persistent just      toward all that gross indifferent facile dust      the archangels laboured to discharge their trust      by precept and example prayer and law      advice reproof and rule but labouring saw      each in his fellows countenance confessed      the doubt that sickens have i done my best       even as they sighed and turned to toil anew      the seraph hailed them with observance due      and after some fit talk of higher things      touched tentative on mundane happenings      this they permitting he emboldened thus      prolused of humankind promiscuous      and since the large contention less avails      than instances observed he told them talestales      of the shop the bed the court the street      intimate elemental indiscreet      occasions where confusion smiting swift      piles jest on jest as snowslides pile the drift       whence one by one beneath derisive skies      the victims bare bewildered heads arise      tales of the passing of the spirit graced      with humour blinding as the doom it faced      stark tales of ribaldry that broke aside      to tears by laughter swallowed ere they dried      tales to which neither grace nor gain accrue      but only allah be exalted true      and only as the seraph showed that night      delighting to the limits of delight       these he rehearsed with artful pause and halt      and such pretence of memory at fault      that soon the fourso well the bait was thrown      came to his aid with memories of their own      matters dismissed long since as small or vain      whereof the high significance had lain      hid till the ungirt glosses made it plain      then as enlightenment came broad and fast      each marvelled at his own oblivious past      untilthe gates of laughter opened wide      the four with that bland seraph at their side      while they recalled compared and amplified      in utter mirth forgot both zeal and pride       high over heaven the lamps of midnight burned      ere weak with merriment the four returned      not in that order they were wont to keep      pinion to pinion answering sweep for sweep      in awful diapason heard afar      but shoutingly adrift twixt star and star      reeling a planets orbit left or right      as laughter took them in the abysmal night      or by the point of some remembered jest      winged and brought helpless down through gulfs unguessed      where the blank worlds that gather to the birth      leaped in the womb of darkness at their mirth      and een gehennas bondsmen understood      they were not damned from human brotherhood       not first nor last of heavens high host the four      that night took place beneath the throne once more      o lovelier than their morning majesty      the understanding light behind the eye      o more compelling than their old command      the newlearned friendly gesture of the hand      o sweeter than their zealous fellowship      the wise halfsmile that passed from lip to lip      o well and roundly when command was given      they told their tale against themselves to heaven      and in the silence waiting on the word      received the peace and pardon of the lord    my sons wife  1913  he had suffered from the disease of the century since his early youth and before he was thirty he was heavily marked with it he and a few friends had rearranged heaven very comfortably but the reorganisation of earth which they called society was even greater fun it demanded work in the shape of many taxirides daily hours of brilliant talk with brilliant talkers some sparkling correspondence a few silences but on the understanding that their own turn should come soon while other people expounded philosophies and a fair number of picturegalleries teafights concerts theatres musichalls and cinema shows the whole trimmed with lovemaking to women whose hair smelt of cigarettesmoke such strong days sent frankwell midmore back to his flat assured that he and his friends had helped the world a step nearer the truth the dawn and the new order  his temperament he said led him more towards concrete data than abstract ideas people who investigate detail are apt to be tired at the days end the same temperament or it may have been a woman made him early attach himself to the immoderate left of his cause in the capacity of an experimenter in social relations and since the immoderate left contains plenty of women anxious to help earnest inquirers with large independent incomes to arrive at evaluations of essentials frankwell midmores lot was far from contemptible  at that hour fate chose to play with him a widowed aunt widely separated by nature and more widely by marriage from all that midmores mother had ever been or desired to be died and left him possessions mrs midmore having that summer embraced a creed which denied the existence of death naturally could not stoop to burial but midmore had to leave london for the dank country at a season when social regeneration works best through long cushioned conferences two by two after tea there he faced the bracing ritual of the british funeral and was wept at across the raw grave by an elderly coffinshaped female with a long nose who called him master frankie and there he was congratulated behind an echoing tophat by a man he mistook for a mute who turned out to be his aunts lawyer he wrote his mother next day after a bright account of the funeral  so far as i can understand she has left me between four and five hundred a year it all comes from ther land as they call it down here the unspeakable attorney sperrit and a greeneyed daughter who hums to herself as she tramps but is silent on all subjects except huntin insisted on taking me to see it ther land is brown and green in alternate slabs like chocolate and pistachio cakes speckled with occasional peasants who do not utter in case it should not be wet enough there is a wet brook in the middle of it ther house is by the brook i shall look into it later if there should be any little memento of jenny that you care for let me know didnt you tell me that midvictorian furniture is coming into the market again jennys old maidit is called rhoda dolbietells me that jenny promised it thirty pounds a year the will does not hence i suppose the tears at the funeral but that is close on ten per cent of the income i fancy jenny has destroyed all her private papers and records of her vie intime if indeed life be possible in such a place the sperrit man told me that if i had means of my own i might come and live on ther land i didnt tell him how much i would pay not to i cannot think it right that any human being should exercise mastery over others in the merciless fashion our tomfool social system permits so as it is all mine i intend to sell it whenever the unholy sperrit can find a purchaser  and he went to mr sperrit with the idea next day just before returning to town  quite so said the lawyer i see your point of course but the house itself is rather oldfashionedhardly the type purchasers demand nowadays theres no park of course and the bulk of the land is let to a lifetenant a mr sidney as long as he pays his rent he cant be turned out and even if he didntmr sperrits face relaxed a shadeyou might have a difficulty  the property brings four hundred a year i understand said midmore  well hardlyhaardly deducting land and income tax tithes fire insurance cost of collection and repairs of course it returned two hundred and eightyfour pounds last year the repairs are rather a large itemowing to the brook i call it lirisout of horace you know  midmore looked at his watch impatiently  i suppose you can find somebody to buy it he repeated  we will do our best of course if those are your instructions then that is all excepthere midmore half rose but mr sperrits little grey eyes held his large brown ones firmlyexcept about rhoda dolbie mrs werfs maid i may tell you that we did not draw up your aunts last will she grew secretive towards the lastelderly people often doand had it done in london i expect her memory failed her or she mislaid her notes she used to put them in her spectaclecase my motor only takes eight minutes to get to the station mr midmore  but as i was saying whenever she made her will with us mrs werf always left rhoda thirty pounds per annum charlie the wills a clerk with a baldish head and a long nose dealt documents on to the table like cards and breathed heavily behind midmore its in no sense a legal obligation of course said mr sperrit ah that one is dated january the 11th eighteen eightynine  midmore looked at his watch again and found himself saying with no good grace well i suppose shed better have itfor the present at any rate  he escaped with an uneasy feeling that two hundred and fiftyfour pounds a year was not exactly four hundred and that charlies long nose annoyed him then he returned firstclass to his own affairs  of the two perhaps three experiments in social relations which he had then in hand one interested him acutely it had run for some months and promised most variegated and interesting developments on which he dwelt luxuriously all the way to town when he reached his flat he was not well prepared for a twelvepage letter explaining in the diction of the immoderate left which rubricates its is and illuminates its ts that the lady had realised greater attractions in another soul she restated rather than pleaded the gospel of the immoderate left as her justification and ended in an impassioned demand for her right to express herself in and on her own life through which she pointed out she could pass but once she added that if later she should discover midmore was essentially complementary to her needs she would tell him so that midmore had himself written much the same sort of epistlebarring the hint of returnto a woman of whom his needs for selfexpression had caused him to weary three years before did not assist him in the least he expressed himself to the gasfire in terms essential but not complimentary then he reflected on the detached criticism of his best friends and her best friends male and female with whom he and she and others had talked so openly while their gay adventure was in flower he recalled toothis must have been about midnighther analysis from every angle remote and most intimate of the mate to whom she had been adjudged under the base convention which is styled marriage later at that bad hour when the cattle wake for a little he remembered her in other aspects and went down into the hell appointed desolate desiring with no god to call upon about eleven oclock next morning eliphaz the temanite bildad the shuhite and zophar the naamathite called upon him for they had made appointment together to see how he took it but the janitor told them that job had goneinto the country he believed  midmores relief when he found his story was not written across his aching temples for mr sperrit to readthe defeated lover like the successful one believes all earth privy to his soulwas put down by mr sperrit to quite different causes he led him into a morningroom the rest of the house seemed to be full of people singing to a loud piano idiotic songs about cows and the hall smelt of damp cloaks  its our evening to take the winter cantata mr sperrit explained its high tide on the coast of lincolnshire i hoped youd come back there are scores of little things to settle as for the house of course it stands ready for you at any time i couldnt get rhoda out of itnor could charlie for that matter shes the sister isnt she of the nurse who brought you down here when you were four she says to recover from measles  is she was i said midmore through the bad tastes in his mouth dyou suppose i could stay there the night  thirty joyous young voices shouted appeal to some one to leave their pipes of parsley ollowollowollow mr sperrit had to raise his voice above the din  well if i asked you to stay here i should never hear the last of it from rhoda shes a little cracked of course but the soul of devotion and capable of anything ne sit ancillae you know  thank you then ill go ill walk he stumbled out dazed and sick into the winter twilight and sought the square house by the brook  it was not a dignified entry because when the door was unchained and rhoda exclaimed he took two valiant steps into the hall and then faintedas men sometimes will after twentytwo hours of strong emotion and little food  im sorry he said when he could speak he was lying at the foot of the stairs his head on rhodas lap  your ome is your castle sir was the reply in his hair i smelt it wasnt drink you lay on the sofa till i get your supper  she settled him in a drawingroom hung with yellow silk heavy with the smell of dead leaves and oil lamp something murmured soothingly in the background and overcame the noises in his head he thought he heard horses feet on wet gravel and a voice singing about ships and flocks and grass it passed close to the shuttered baywindow       but each will mourn his own she saith      and sweeter woman neer drew breath      than my sons wife elizabeth       cushacushacushacalling  the hoofs broke into a canter as rhoda entered with the tray and then ill put you to bed she said sidneys coming in the morning midmore asked no questions he dragged his poor bruised soul to bed and would have pitied it all over again but the food and warm sherry and water drugged him to instant sleep  rhodas voice wakened him asking whether he would have ip foot or sitz which he understood were the baths of the establishment suppose you try all three she suggested theyre all yours you know sir  he would have renewed his sorrows with the daylight but her words struck him pleasantly everything his eyes opened upon was his very own to keep for ever the carved fourpost chippendale bed obviously worth hundreds the wavy walnut william and mary chairshe had seen worse ones labelled twenty guineas apiece the oval medallion mirror the delicate eighteenthcentury wire fireguard the heavy brocaded curtains were hisall his so too a great garden full of birds that faced him when he shaved a mulberry tree a sundial and a dull steelcoloured brook that murmured level with the edge of a lawn a hundred yards away peculiarly and privately his own was the smell of sausages and coffee that he sniffed at the head of the wide square landing all set round with mysterious doors and bartolozzi prints he spent two hours after breakfast in exploring his new possessions his heart leaped up at such things as sewingmachines a rubbertyred bathchair in a tiled passage a malachiteheaded malacca cane boxes and boxes of unopened stationery sealrings bunches of keys and at the bottom of a steelnet reticule a little leather purse with seven pounds ten shillings in gold and eleven shillings in silver  you used to play with that when my sister brought you down here after your measles said rhoda as he slipped the money into his pocket now this was your pore dear aunties businessroom she opened a low door oh i forgot about mr sidney there he is an enormous old man with rheumy red eyes that blinked under downy white eyebrows sat in an empire chair his cap in his hands rhoda withdrew sniffing the man looked midmore over in silence then jerked a thumb towards the door i reckon she told you who i be he began im the only farmer youve got nothin goes off my place thout it walks on its own feet what about my pigpound  well what about it said midmore  thats just what i be come about the county councils are getting more particular did ye know there was swine fever at pashells there be itll ave to be in brick  yes said midmore politely  ive bin at your aunt that was plenty times about it i dont say she wasnt a just woman but she didnt read the lease same way i did i be used to bein put upon but theres no doing any longer thout that pigpound  when would you like it midmore asked it seemed the easiest road to take  any time or other suits me i reckon he aint thrivin where he is an i paid eighteen shillin for him he crossed his hands on his stick and gave no further sign of life  is that all midmore stammered  all nowexcephe glanced fretfully at the table beside himexcep my usuals wheres that rhoda  midmore rang the bell rhoda came in with a bottle and a glass the old man helped himself to four stiff fingers rose in one piece and stumped out at the door he cried ferociously dont suppose its any odds to you whether im drowned or not but them floodgates want a wheel and winch they do i be too old for liftin em with the barmy time o life  good riddance if e was drowned said rhoda but dont you mind him hes only amusin himself your pore dear auntie used to give im is usualtisnt the whisky you drinkan send im about is business  i see now is a pigpound the same thing as a pigsty  rhoda nodded e needs one too but e aint entitled to it you look at is leasethird drawer on the left in that bombay cabnetan next time e comes you ask im to read it thatll choke im off because e cant  there was nothing in midmores past to teach him the message and significance of a handwritten lease of the late eighties but rhoda interpreted  it dont mean anything reelly was her cheerful conclusion excep you mustnt get rid of him anyhow an e can do what e likes always lucky for us e do farm and if it wasnt for is woman  oh theres a mrs sidney is there  lor no the sidneys dont marry they keep thats his fourth sinceto my knowledge he was a takin man from the first  any families  theyd be grown up by now if there was wouldnt they but you cant spend all your days considerin is interests thats what gave your pore aunt er indigestion ave you seen the gunroom  midmore held strong views on the immorality of taking life for pleasure but there was no denying that the late colonel werfs seventyguinea breechloaders were good at their filthy job he loaded one took it out and pointedmerely pointedit at a cockpheasant which rose out of a shrubbery behind the kitchen and the flaming bird came down in a long slant on the lawn stone dead rhoda from the scullery said it was a lovely shot and told him lunch was ready  he spent the afternoon gun in one hand a map in the other beating the bounds of his lands they lay altogether in a shallow uninteresting valley flanked with woods and bisected by a brook up stream was his own house down stream less than half a mile a low red farmhouse squatted in an old orchard beside what looked like small lockgates on the thames there was no doubt as to ownership mr sidney saw him while yet far off and bellowed at him about pigpounds and floodgates these last were two great sliding shutters of weedy oak across the brook which were prised up inch by inch with a crowbar along a notched strip of iron and when sidney opened them they at once let out half the water midmore watched it shrink between its aldered banks like some conjuring trick this too was his very own  i see he said how interesting now whats that bell for he went on pointing to an old ships bell in a rude belfry at the end of an outhouse was that a chapel once the redeyed giant seemed to have difficulty in expressing himself for the moment and blinked savagely  yes he said at last my chapel when you ear that bell ring youll ear something nobody but me ud put up with itbut i reckon it dont make any odds to you he slammed the gates down again and the brook rose behind them with a suck and a grunt  midmore moved off conscious that he might be safer with rhoda to hold his conversational hand as he passed the front of the farmhouse a smooth fat woman with neatly parted grey hair under a widows cap curtsied to him deferentially through the window by every teaching of the immoderate left she had a perfect right to express herself in any way she pleased but the curtsey revolted him and on his way home he was hailed from behind a hedge by a manifest idiot with no roof to his mouth who hallooed and danced round him  what did that beast want he demanded of rhoda at tea  jimmy he only wanted to know if you ad any telegrams to send ell go anywhere so long as tisnt across running water that gives im is seizures even talkin about it for fun like makes im shake  but why isnt he where he can be properly looked after  what arms e doing es a lovechild but is family can pay for im if e was locked up ed die all off at once like a wild rabbit wont you please look at the drive sir  midmore looked in the fading light the neat gravel was pitted with large roundish holes and there was a punch or two of the same sort on the lawn  thats the unt comin ome rhoda explained your pore dear auntie always let em use our drive for a short cut after the colonel died the colonel wouldnt so much because he preserved but your auntie was always an orsewoman till er sciatica  isnt there some one who can rake it over oror something said midmore vaguely  oh yes youll never see it in the morning butyou was out when they came ome an mister fisherhes the mastertold me to tell you with is compliments that if you wasnt preservin and cared to old to the old understanding is gravelpit is at your service same as before e thought perhaps you mightnt know and it ad slipped my mind to tell you its good gravel mister fishers and it binds beautiful on the drive we ave to draw it o course from the pit but  midmore looked at her helplessly  rhoda said he what am i supposed to do  oh let em come through she replied you never know you may want to unt yourself some day  that evening it rained and his misery returned on him the worse for having been diverted at last he was driven to paw over a few score books in a panelled room called the library and realised with horror what the late colonel werfs mind must have been in its prime the volumes smelt of a dead world as strongly as they did of mildew he opened and thrust them back one after another till crude coloured illustrations of men on horses held his eye he began at random and read a little moved into the drawingroom with the volume and settled down by the fire still reading it was a foul world into which he peeped for the first timea heavyeating harddrinking hell of horsecopers swindlers matchmaking mothers economically dependent virgins selling themselves blushingly for cash and lands jews tradesmen and an illconsidered spawn of dickensandhorsedung characters i give midmores own criticism but he read on fascinated and behold from the pages leaped as it were the brother to the redeyed man of the brook bellowing at a landlord here midmore realised that he was that very animal for new barns and another man who like himself again objected to hoofmarks on gravel outrageous as thought and conception were the stuff seemed to have the rudiments of observation he dug out other volumes by the same author till rhoda came in with a silver candlestick  rhoda said he did you ever hear about a character called james piggand batsey  why o course said she the colonel used to come into the kitchen in is dressingown an read us all those jorrockses  oh lord said midmore and went to bed with a book called handley cross under his arm and a lonelier columbus into a stranger world the wetringed moon never looked upon                                       here we omit much but midmore never denied that for the epicure in sensation the urgent needs of an ancient house as interpreted by rhoda pointing to daylight through attictiles held in place by moss gives an edge to the pleasure of social research elsewhere equally he found that the reaction following prolonged research loses much of its grey terror if one knows one can at will bathe the soul in the society of plumbers all the waterpipes had chronic appendicitis village idiots jimmy had taken midmore under his weak wing and camped daily at the drivegates and a giant with red eyelids whose every action is an unpredictable outrage  towards spring midmore filled his house with a few friends of the immoderate left it happened to be the day when all things and rhoda working together a cartload of bricks another of sand and some bags of lime had been despatched to build sidney his almost dailydemanded pigpound midmore took his friends across the flat fields with some idea of showing them sidney as a type of the peasantry they hit the minute when sidney hoarse with rage was ordering bricklayer mate carts and all off his premises the visitors disposed themselves to listen  you never give me no notice about changin the pig sidney shouted the pigat least eighteen inches longreared on end in the old sty and smiled at the company  but my good man midmore opened  i aint for aught you know i be a dam sight worse than you be you cant come and beave arbitry with me you are beavin arbitry all you men go clean away an dont set foot on my land till i bid ye  but you askedmidmore felt his voice jump upto have the pigpound built  spose i did thats no reason you shouldnt send me notice to change the pig comin down on me like this thout warnin that pigs got to be got into the cowshed an all  then open the door and let him run in said midmore  dont you beave arbitry with me take all your dam men ome off my land i wont be treated arbitry  the carts moved off without a word and sidney went into the house and slammed the door  now i hold that is enormously significant said a visitor here you have the logical outcome of centuries of feudal oppressionthe frenzy of fear the company looked at midmore with grave pain  but he did worry my life out about his pigsty was all midmore found to say  others took up the parable and proved to him if he only held true to the gospels of the immoderate left the earth would soon be covered with jolly little pigsties built in the intervals of morrisdancing by the peasant himself  midmore felt grateful when the door opened again and mr sidney invited them all to retire to the road which he pointed out was public as they turned the corner of the house a smoothfaced woman in a widows cap curtsied to each of them through the window  instantly they drew pictures of that womans lot deprived of all vehicle for selfexpressionthe set grey life and apathetic end one quotedand they discussed the tremendous significance of village theatricals even a month ago midmore would have told them all that he knew and rhoda had dropped about sidneys forms of selfexpression now for some strange reason he was content to let the talk run on from village to metropolitan and world drama  rhoda advised him after the visitors left that if he wanted to do that again he had better go up to town  but we only sat on cushions on the floor said her master  theyre too old for romps she retorted an its only the beginning of things ive seen what ive seen besides they talked and laughed in the passage going to their bathssuch as took em  dont be a fool rhoda said midmore no manunless he has loved herwill casually dismiss a woman on whose lap he has laid his head  very good she snorted but that cuts both ways an now you go down to sidneys this evenin and put him where he ought to be he was in his right about you givin im notice about changin the pig but he adnt any right to turn it up before your company no manners no pigpound hell understand  midmore did his best to make him he found himself reviling the old man in speech and with a joy quite new in all his experience he wound upit was a plagiarism from a plumberby telling mr sidney that he looked like a turkeycock had the morals of a parish bull and need never hope for a new pigpound as long as he or midmore lived  very good said the giant i reckon you thought you ad something against me and now youve come down an told it me like man to man quite right i dont bear malice now you send along those bricks an sand an ill make a do to build the pigpound myself if you look at my lease youll find out youre bound to provide me materials for the repairs onlyonly i thought thered be no arm in my askin you to do it throughout like  midmore fairly gasped then why the devil did you turn my carts back whenwhen i sent them up here to do it throughout for you  mr sidney sat down on the floodgates his eyebrows knitted in thought  ill tell you he said slowly twas too dam like cheatin a suckin baby my woman she said so too  for a few seconds the teachings of the immoderate left whose humour is all their own wrestled with those of mother earth who has her own humours then midmore laughed till he could scarcely stand in due time mr sidney laughed toocrowing and wheezing crescendo till it broke from him in roars they shook hands and midmore went home grateful that he had held his tongue among his companions  when he reached his house he met three or four men and women on horseback very muddy indeed coming down the drive feeling hungry himself he asked them if they were hungry they said they were and he bade them enter jimmy took their horses who seemed to know him rhoda took their battered hats led the women upstairs for hairpins and presently fed them all with teacakes poached eggs anchovy toast and drinks from a coromandelwood liqueur case which midmore had never known that he possessed  and i will say said miss connie sperrit her spurred foot on the fender and a smoking muffin in her whip hand rhoda does one tophole she always did since i was eight  seven miss was when you began to unt said rhoda setting down more buttered toast  and so the mfh was saying to midmore when he got to your brute sidneys land we had to whip em off its a regular alsatia for em they know it whyhe dropped his voicei dont want to say anything against sidney as your tenant of course but i do believe the old scoundrels perfectly capable of putting down poison  sidneys capable of anything said midmore with immense feeling but once again he held his tongue they were a queer community yet when they had stamped and jingled out to their horses again the house felt hugely big and disconcerting  this may be reckoned the conscious beginning of his double life it ran in odd channels that summera riding school for instance near hayes common and a shooting ground near wormwood scrubs a man who has been saddlegalled or shoulderbruised for half the day is not at his london best of evenings and when the bills for his amusements come in he curtails his expenses in other directions so a cloud settled on midmores name his london world talked of a hardening of heart and a tightening of pursestrings which signified disloyalty to the cause one man a confidant of the old expressive days attacked him robustiously and demanded account of his souls progress it was not furnished for midmore was calculating how much it would cost to repave stables so dilapidated that even the village idiot apologised for putting visitors horses into them the man went away and served up what he had heard of the pigpound episode as a little newspaper sketch calculated to annoy midmore read it with an eye as practical as a womans and since most of his experiences had been among women at once sought out a woman to whom he might tell his sorrow at the disloyalty of his own familiar friend she was so sympathetic that he went on to confide how his bruised heartshe knew all about ithad found solace with a long o in another quarter which he indicated rather carefully in case it might be betrayed to other loyal friends as his hints pointed directly towards facile hampstead and as his urgent business was the purchase of a horse from a dealer beckenham way he felt he had done good work later when his friend the scribe talked to him alluringly of secret gardens and those solaces to which every man who follows the wider morality is entitled midmore lent him a fivepound note which he had got back on the price of a ninetyguinea bay gelding so true it is as he read in one of the late colonel werfs books that the young man of the present day would sooner lie under an imputation against his morals than against his knowledge of horseflesh  midmore desired more than he desired anything else at that moment to ride and above all to jump on a ninetyguinea bay gelding with black points and a slovenly habit of hitting his fences he did not wish many people except mr sidney who very kindly lent his soft meadow behind the floodgates to be privy to the matter which he rightly foresaw would take him to the autumn so he told such friends as hinted at country weekend visits that he had practically let his newly inherited house the rent he said was an object to him for he had lately lost large sums through illconsidered benevolences he would name no names but they could guess and they guessed loyally all round the circle of his acquaintance as they spread the news that explained so much  there remained only one couple of his once intimate associates to pacify they were deeply sympathetic and utterly loyal of course but as curious as any of the apes whose diet they had adopted midmore met them in a suburban train coming up to town not twenty minutes after he had come off two hours advanced tuition one guinea an hour over hurdles in a hall he had of course changed his kit but his too heavy bridlehand shook a little among the newspapers on the inspiration of the moment which is your natural liars best hold he told them that he was condemned to a restcure he would lie in semidarkness drinking milk for weeks and weeks cut off even from letters he was astonished and delighted at the ease with which the usual lie confounds the unusual intellect they swallowed it as swiftly as they recommended him to live on nuts and fruit but he saw in the womans eyes the exact reason she would set forth for his retirement after all she had as much right to express herself as he purposed to take for himself and midmore believed strongly in the fullest equality of the sexes  that retirement made one small ripple in the strenuous world the lady who had written the twelvepage letter ten months before sent him another of eight pages analysing all the motives that were leading her back to himshould she comenow that he was ill and alone much might yet be retrieved she said out of the waste of jarring lives and piteous misunderstandings it needed only a hand  but midmore needed two next morning very early for a devils diversion among wet coppices called cubbing  you havent a bad seat said miss sperrit through the morningmists but youre worrying him  he pulls so midmore grunted  let him alone then look out for the branches she shouted as they whirled up a splashy ride cubs were plentiful most of the hounds attached themselves to a straightnecked youngster of education who scuttled out of the woods into the open fields below  hold on some one shouted turn em midmore thats your brute sidneys land its all wire  oh connie stop mrs sperrit shrieked as her daughter charged at a boundaryhedge  wire be damned i had it all out a fortnight ago come on this was midmore buffeting into it a little lower down  i knew that connie cried over her shoulder and she flitted across the open pasture humming to herself  oh of course if some people have private information they can afford to thrust this was a snuffcoloured habit into which miss sperrit had cannoned down the ride  what midmore got sidney to heel you never did that sperrit this was mr fisher mfh enlarging the breach midmore had made  no confound him said the father testily go on sir injecto ter pulvereyouve kicked half the ditch into my eye already  they killed that cub a little short of the haven his mother had told him to make fora twoacre alsatia of a gorsepatch to which the mfh had been denied access for the last fifteen seasons he expressed his gratitude before all the field and mr sidney at mr sidneys farmhouse door  and if there should be any poultry claims he went on  there wont be said midmore its too like cheating a sucking child isnt it mr sidney  youve got me was all the reply i be used to bein put upon but youve got me mus midmore  midmore pointed to a new brick pigpound built in strict disregard of the terms of the lifetenants lease the gesture told the tale to the few who did not know and they shouted  such pagan delights as these were followed by pagan sloth of evenings when men and women elsewhere are at their brightest but midmore preferred to lie out on a yellow silk couch reading works of a debasing vulgarity or by invitation to dine with the sperrits and savages of their kidney these did not expect flights of fancy or phrasing they lied except about horses grudgingly and of necessity not for arts sake and men and women alike they expressed themselves along their chosen lines with the serene indifference of the larger animals then midmore would go home and identify them one by one out of the naturalhistory books by mr surtees on the table beside the sofa at first they looked upon him coolly but when the tale of the removed wire and the recaptured gorse had gone the rounds they accepted him for a person willing to play their games true a faction suspended judgment for a while because they shot and hoped that midmore would serve the glorious mammon of pheasantraising rather than the unkempt god of foxhunting but after he had shown his choice they did not ask by what intellectual process he had arrived at it he hunted three sometimes four times a week which necessitated not only one bay gelding Â£94 10s but a mannerly whitestockinged chestnut Â£114 and a black mare rather long in the back but with a mouth of silk Â£150 who so evidently preferred to carry a lady that it would have been cruel to have baulked her besides with that handling she could be sold at a profit and besides the hunt was a quiet intimate kindly little hunt not anxious for strangers of good report in the field the servant of one mfh given to hospitality riding well its own horses and with the exception of midmore not novices but as miss sperrit observed after the mfh had said some things to him at a gate it is a pity you dont know as much as your horse but you will in time it takes years and yeears ive been at it for fifteen and im only just learning but youve made a decent kickoff  so he kicked off in wind and wet and mud wondering quite sincerely why the bubbling ditches and sucking pastures held him from day to day or what solace he could find on off days in chasing grooms and bricklayers round outhouses  to make sure he uprooted himself one weekend of heavy midwinter rain and reentered his lost world in the character of galahad fresh from a restcure they all agreed with an eye over his shoulder for the next comer that he was a different man but when they asked him for the symptoms of nervous strain and led him all through their own he realised he had lost much of his old skill in lying his three months absence too had put him hopelessly behind the london field the movements the allusions the slang of the game had changed the couples had rearranged themselves or were recrystallizing in fresh triangles whereby he put his foot in it badly only one great soul he who had written the account of the pigpound episode stood untouched by the vast flux of time and midmore lent him another fiver for his integrity a woman took him in the wet forenoon to a pronouncement on the oneness of impulse in humanity which struck him as a polysyllabic rÃ©sumÃ© of mr sidneys domestic arrangements plus a clarion call to shock civilisation into commonsense  and youll come to tea with me tomorrow she asked after lunch nibbling cashew nuts from a saucer midmore replied that there were great arrears of work to overtake when a man had been put away for so long  but youve come back like a giant refreshed i hope that daphnethis was the lady of the twelve and the eightpage letterwill be with us too she has misunderstood herself like so many of us the woman murmured but i think eventually  she flung out her thin little hands however these are things that each lonely soul must adjust for itself  indeed yes said midmore with a deep sigh the old tricks were sprouting in the old atmosphere like mushrooms in a dungpit he passed into an abrupt reverie shook his head as though stung by tumultuous memories and departed without any ceremony of farewell tocatch a midafternoon express where a man meets associates who talk horse and weather as it affects the horse all the way down what worried him most was that he had missed a day with the hounds  he met rhodas keen old eyes without flinching and the drawingroom looked very comfortable that wet evening at tea after all his visit to town had not been wholly a failure he had burned quite a bushel of letters at his flat a flathere he reached mechanically towards the worn volumes near the sofaa flat was a consuming animal as for daphne  he opened at random on the words his lordship then did as desired and disclosed a tableau of considerable strength and variety midmore reflected and i used to think but she wasnt we were all babblers and skirters together i didnt babble muchthank goodnessbut i skirted he turned the pages backward for more sortes surteesianae and read when at length they rose to go to bed it struck each man as he followed his neighbour upstairs that the man before him walked very crookedly he laughed aloud at the fire  what about tomorrow rhoda asked entering with garments over her shoulder its never stopped raining since you left youll be plastered out of sight an all in five minutes youd better wear your next best adnt you im afraid theyve shrank adnt you best try em on  here said midmore  suit yourself i bathed you when you wasnt larger than a leg o lamb said the exladiesmaid  rhoda one of these days i shall get a valet and a married butler  theres many a true word spoke in jest but nobodys huntin tomorrow  why have they cancelled the meet  they say it only means slipping and overreaching in the mud and they all ad enough of that today charlie told me so just now  oh it seemed that the word of mr sperrits confidential clerk had weight  charlie came down to help mr sidney lift the gates rhoda continued  the floodgates they are perfectly easy to handle now ive put in a wheel and a winch  when the brooks really up they must be took clean out on account of the rubbish blockin em thats why charlie came down  midmore grunted impatiently everybody has talked to me about that brook ever since i came here its never done anything yet  this as been a dry summer if you care to look now sir ill get you a lantern  she paddled out with him into a large wet night halfway down the lawn her light was reflected on shallow brown water pricked through with grass blades at the edges beyond that light the brook was strangling and kicking among hedges and treetrunks  what on earth will happen to the big rosebed was midmores first word  it generally as to be restocked after a flood ah she raised her lantern theres two gardenseats knockin against the sundial now that wont do the roses any good  this is too absurd there ought to be some decently thoughtout systemforfor dealing with this sort of thing he peered into the rushing gloom there seemed to be no end to the moisture and the racket in town he had noticed nothing  it cant be elped said rhoda its just what it does do once in just so often wed better go back  all earth under foot was sliding in a thousand liquid noises towards the hoarse brook somebody wailed from the house fraid o the water come ere fraid o the water  thats jimmy wet always takes im that way she explained the idiot charged into them shaking with terror  brave jimmy how brave of jimmy come into the hall what jimmy got now she crooned it was a sodden note which ran dear rhodamr lotten with whom i rode home this afternoon told me that if this wet keeps up hes afraid the fishpond he built last year where coxens old milldam was will go as the dam did once before he says if it does its bound to come down the brook it may be all right but perhaps you had better look out cs  if coxens dam goes that means ill ave the drawingroom carpet up at once to be on the safe side the clawammer is in the libery  wait a minute sidneys gates are out you said  both hell need it if coxens pond goes ive seen it once  ill just slip down and have a look at sidney light the lantern again please rhoda  you wont get him to stir hes been there since he was born but she dont know anything ill fetch your waterproof and some topboots  fraid o the water fraid o the water jimmy sobbed pressed against a corner of the hall his hands to his eyes  all right jimmy jimmy can help play with the carpet rhoda answered as midmore went forth into the darkness and the roarings all round he had never seen such an utterly unregulated state of affairs there was another lantern reflected on the streaming drive  hi rhoda did you get my note i came down to make sure i thought afterwards jimmy might funk the water  its memiss sperrit midmore cried yes we got it thanks  youre back then oh good is it bad down with you  im going to sidneys to have a look  you wont get him out lucky i met bob lotten i told him he hadnt any business impounding water for his idiotic trout without rebuilding the dam  how far up is it ive only been there once  not more than four miles as the water will come he says hes opened all the sluices  she had turned and fallen into step beside him her hooded head bowed against the thinning rain as usual she was humming to herself  why on earth did you come out in this weather midmore asked  it was worse when you were in town the rains taking off now if it wasnt for that pond i wouldnt worry so much theres sidneys bell come on she broke into a run a cracked bell was jangling feebly down the valley  keep on the road midmore shouted the ditches were snorting bankfull on either side and towards the brookside the fields were afloat and beginning to move in the darkness  catch me going off it theres his light burning all right she halted undistressed at a little rise but the floods in the orchard look she swung her lantern to show a front rank of old appletrees reflected in still outlying waters beyond the halfdrowned hedge they could hear above the thudthud of the gorged floodgates shrieks in two keys as monotonous as a steamorgan  the high ones the pig miss sperrit laughed  all right ill get her out you stay where you are and ill see you home afterwards  but the waters only just over the road she objected  never mind dont you move promise  all right you take my stick then and feel for holes in case anythings washed out anywhere this is a lark  midmore took it and stepped into the water that moved sluggishly as yet across the farm road which ran to sidneys front door from the raised and metalled public road it was half way up to his knees when he knocked as he looked back miss sperrits lantern seemed to float in midocean  you cant come in or the waterll come with you ive bunged up all the cracks mr sidney shouted from within who be ye  take me out take me out the woman shrieked and the pig from his sty behind the house urgently seconded the motion  im midmore coxens old milldam is likely to go they say come out  i told em it would when they made a fishpond of it twasnt ever puddled proper but its a middlin wide valley shes got room to spread keep still or ill take and duck

before but you can take her shes no sort o use or sense climb out through the window didnt i tell you id plugged the doorcracks you fools daughter the parlour window opened and the woman flung herself into midmores arms nearly knocking him down mr sidney leaned out of the window pipe in mouth  take her ome he said and added oracularly       two women in one house      two cats an one mouse      two dogs an one bone      which i will leave alone  ive seen it before then he shut and fastened the window  a trap a trap you had ought to have brought a trap for me ill be drowned in this wet the woman cried  hold up you cant be any wetter than you are come along midmore did not at all like the feel of the water over his boottops  hooray come along miss sperrits lantern not fifty yards away waved cheerily  the woman threshed towards it like a panicstricken goose fell on her knees was jerked up again by midmore and pushed on till she collapsed at miss sperrits feet  but you wont get bronchitis if you go straight to mr midmores house said the unsympathetic maiden  o gawd o gawd i wish our eavenly father ud forgive me my sins an call me ome the woman sobbed but i wont go to is ouse i wont  all right then stay here now if we run miss sperrit whispered to midmore shell follow us not too fast  they set off at a considerable trot and the woman lumbered behind them bellowing till they met a third lanternrhoda holding jimmys hand she had got the carpet up she said and was escorting jimmy past the water that he dreaded  thats all right miss sperrit pronounced take mrs sidney back with you rhoda and put her to bed ill take jimmy with me you arent afraid of the water now are you jimmy  not afraid of anything now jimmy reached for her hand but get away from the water quick  im coming with you midmore interrupted  you most certainly are not youre drenched she threw you twice go home and change you may have to be out again all night its only halfpast seven now im perfectly safe she flung herself lightly over a stile and hurried uphill by the footpath out of reach of all but the boasts of the flood below  rhoda dead silent herded mrs sidney to the house  youll find your things laid out on the bed she said to midmore as he came up ill attend toto this shes got nothing to cry for  midmore raced into dry kit and raced uphill to be rewarded by the sight of the lantern just turning into the sperrits gate he came back by way of sidneys farm where he saw the light twinkling across three acres of shining water for the rain had ceased and the clouds were stripping overhead though the brook was noisier than ever now there was only that doubtful millpond to look afterthat and his swirling world abandoned to himself alone  we shall have to sit up for it said rhoda after dinner and as the drawingroom commanded the best view of the rising flood they watched it from there for a long time while all the clocks of the house bore them company  tisnt the water its the mud on the skirtingboard after it goes down that i mind rhoda whispered the last time coxens mill broke i remember it came up to the secondno thirdstep o mr sidneys stairs  what did sidney do about it  he made a notch on the step e said it was a record just like im  its up to the drive now said midmore after another long wait and the rain stopped before eight you know  then coxens dam as broke and thats the first of the floodwater she stared out beside him the water was rising in sudden pulsesan inch or two at a time with great sweeps and lagoons and a sudden increase of the brooks proper thunder  you cant stand all the time take a chair midmore said presently  rhoda looked back into the bare room the carpet bein up does make a difference thank you sir i will ave a setdown  right over the drive now said midmore he opened the window and leaned out is that wind up the valley rhoda  no thats it but ive seen it before  there was not so much a roar as the purposeful drive of a tide across a jagged reef which put down every other sound for twenty minutes a wide sheet of water hurried up to the little terrace on which the house stood pushed round either corner rose again and stretched as it were yawning beneath the moonlight joined other sheets waiting for them in unsuspected hollows and lay out all in one a puff of wind followed  its right up to the wall now i can touch it with my finger midmore bent over the windowsill  i can ear it in the cellars said rhoda dolefully well weve done what we can i think ill ave a look she left the room and was absent half an hour or more during which time he saw a fullgrown tree hauling itself across the lawn by its naked roots then a hurdle knocked against the wall caught on an iron footscraper just outside and made a squareheaded ripple the cascade through the cellarwindows diminished  its dropping rhoda cried as she returned its only tricklin into my cellars now  wait a minute i believei believe i can see the scraper on the edge of the drive just showing  in another ten minutes the drive itself roughened and became gravel again tilting all its water towards the shrubbery  the ponds gone past rhoda announced we shall only ave the common flood to contend with now youd better go to bed  i ought to go down and have another look at sidney before daylight  no need you can see is light burnin from all the upstairs windows  by the way i forgot about her whereve you put her  in my bed rhodas tone was ice i wasnt going to undo a room for that stuff  but itit couldnt be helped said midmore she was half drowned one mustnt be narrowminded rhoda even if her position isnt quiteerregular  pfff i wasnt worryin about that she leaned forward to the window theres the edge of the lawn showin now it falls as fast as it rises deariethe change of tone made midmore jumpdidnt you know that i was is first thats what makes it so hard to bear midmore looked at the long lizardlike back and had no words  she went on still talking through the black windowpane  your pore dear auntie was very kind about it she said shed make all allowances for one but no more never any more then you didnt know oo charlie was all this time  your nephew i always thought  well well she spoke pityingly everybodys business being nobodys business i suppose no one thought to tell you but charlie made is own way for imself from the beginnin but her upstairs she never produced anything just an ousekeeper as you might say turned over an went to sleep straight off she ad the impudence to ask me for ot sherrygruel  did you give it to her said midmore  me your sherry no  the memory of sidneys outrageous rhyme at the window and charlies long nose he thought it looked interested at the time as he passed the copies of mrs werfs last four wills overcame midmore without warning  this damp is givin you a cold said rhoda rising there you go again sneezins a sure sign of it better go to bed you cant do any thin excepshe stood rigid with crossed armsabout me  well what about you midmore stuffed the handkerchief into his pocket  now you know about it what are you goin to dosir  she had the answer on her lean cheek before the sentence was finished  go and see if you can get us something to eat rhoda and beer  i expec the larderll be in a swim she replied but old bottled stuff dont take any harm from wet she returned with a tray all in order and they ate and drank together and took observations of the falling flood till dawn opened its bleared eyes on the wreck of what had been a fair garden midmore cold and annoyed found himself humming       that flood strewed wrecks upon the grass      that ebb swept out the flocks to sea  there isnt a rose left rhoda       an awesome ebb and flow it was      to many more than mine and me      but each will mourn his   itll cost me a hundred  now we know the worst said rhoda we can go to bed ill lay on the kitchen sofa his lights burnin still  and she  dirty old cat you ought to ear er snore  at ten oclock in the morning after a maddening hour in his own garden on the edge of the retreating brook midmore went off to confront more damage at sidneys the first thing that met him was the pig snowy white for the water had washed him out of his new sty calling on high heaven for breakfast the front door had been forced open and the flood had registered its own height in a brown dado on the walls midmore chased the pig out and called up the stairs  i be abed o course which step as she rose to sidney cried from above the fourth then its beat all records come up  are you ill midmore asked as he entered the room the red eyelids blinked cheerfully mr sidney beneath a sumptuous patchwork quilt was smoking  nah im only thankin god i aint my own landlord take that cheer whats she done  it hasnt gone down enough for me to make sure  them floodgates o yournll be middlin far down the brook by now an your rosegarden have gone after em i saved my chickens though youd better get mus sperrit to take the law o lotten an is fishpond  no thanks ive trouble enough without that  hev ye mr sidney grinned how did ye make out with those two women o mine last night i lay they fought  you infernal old scoundrel midmore laughed  i bean then again i baint was the placid answer but rhoda she wouldnt ha left me last night fire or flood she wouldnt  why didnt you ever marry her midmore asked  waste of good money she was willin without  there was a step on the gritty mud below and a voice humming midmore rose quickly saying well i suppose youre all right now  i be i aint a landlord nor i aint youngnor anxious oh mus midmore would it make any odds about her thirty pounds comin regular if i married her charlie said maybe twould  did he midmore turned at the door and what did jimmy say about it  jimmy mr sidney chuckled as the joke took him oh hes none o mine hes charlies lookout  midmore slammed the door and ran downstairs  well this is asweetmess said miss sperrit in shortest skirts and heaviest ridingboots i had to come down and have a look at it the old mayor climbed the belfry tower been up all night nursing your family  nearly that isnt it cheerful he pointed through the door to the stairs with small twigdrift on the last three treads  its a record though said she and hummed to herself       that flood strewed wrecks upon the grass      that ebb swept out the flocks to sea  youre always singing that arent you midmore said suddenly as she passed into the parlour where slimy chairs had been stranded at all angles  am i now i come to think of it i believe i do they say i always hum when i ride have you noticed it  of course i have i notice every  oh she went on hurriedly we had it for the village cantata last winterthe brides of enderby  no high tide on the coast of lincolnshire for some reason midmore spoke sharply  just like that she pointed to the befouled walls i say lets get this furniture a little straight you know it too  every word since you sang it of course  when  the first night i ever came down you rode past the drawingroom window in the dark singing itand sweeter woman  i thought the house was empty then your aunt always let us use that short cut hahadnt we better get this out into the passage itll all have to come out anyhow you take the other side they began to lift a heavyish table their words came jerkily between gasps and their faces were as white asa newly washed and very hungry pig  look out midmore shouted his legs were whirled from under him as the table grunting madly careened and knocked the girl out of sight  the wild boar of asia could not have cut down a couple more scientifically but this little pig lacked his ancestors nerve and fled shrieking over their bodies  are you hurt darling was midmores first word and noim only windeddear was miss sperrits as he lifted her out of her corner her hat over one eye and her right cheek a smear of mud  they fed him a little later on some chickenfeed that they found in sidneys quiet barn a pail of buttermilk out of the dairy and a quantity of onions from a shelf in the backkitchen  seedonions most likely said connie youll hear about this  what does it matter they ought to have been gilded we must buy him  and keep him as long as he lives she agreed but i think i ought to go home now you see when i came out i didnt expect  did you  no yes it had to come but if any one had told me an hour ago sidneys unspeakable parlourand the mud on the carpet  oh i say is my cheek clean now  not quite lend me your hanky again a minute darling what a purler you came  you cant talk remember when your chin hit that table and you said blast i was just going to laugh  you didnt laugh when i picked you up you were going oooooo like a little owl  my dear child  say that again  my dear child do you really like it i keep it for my best friends my deear child i thought i was going to be sick there and then he knocked every ounce of wind out of methe angel but i must really go  they set off together very careful not to join hands or take arms  not across the fields said midmore at the stile come round byby your own place  she flushed indignantly  it will be yours in a little time he went on shaken with his own audacity  not so much of your little times if you please she shied like a colt across the road then instantly like a colt her eyes lit with new curiosity as she came in sight of the drivegates  and not quite so much of your airs and graces madam midmore returned or i wont let you use our drive as a short cut any more  oh ill be good ill be good her voice changed suddenly i swear ill try to be good dear im not much of a thing at the best what made you  im worseworse miles and oceans worse but what does it matter now  they halted beside the gatepillars  i see she said looking up the sodden carriage sweep to the front door porch where rhoda was slapping a wet mat to and fro i see now i really must go home no dont you come i must speak to mother first all by myself  he watched her up the hill till she was out of sight          the floods       the rain it rains without a stay        in the hills above us in the hills      and

     thy lord spoke by inspiration to the bee       al koran  i have to my grief and loss suppressed several notable stories of my friend the hon am penfentenyou8 once minister of woods and waysides in de thouars first administration later premier in all but name of one of our great and growing dominions and now as always the idol of his own province which is two and onehalf the size of england  footnote 8 see the puzzler actions and reactions  for this reason i hold myself at liberty to deal with some portion of the truth concerning penfentenyous latest visit to our shores he arrived at my house by car on a hot summer day in a white waistcoat and spats sweeping black frockcoat and glistening tophata little rounded perhaps at the edges but agile as ever in mind and body  what is the trouble now i asked for the last time we had met penfentenyou was floating a threemillion pound loan for his beloved but unscrupulous province and i did not wish to entertain any more of his financial friends  we penfentenyou replied ambassadorially have come to have a voice in your councils by the way the voice is coming down on the evening train with my agentgeneral i thought you wouldnt mind if i invited em you know were going to share your burdens henceforward youd better get into training  certainly i replied whats the voice like  hes in earnest said penfentenyou hes got it and hes got it bad hell give it to you he said  whats his name  we call him all sorts of names but i think youd better call him mr lingnam you wont have to do it more than once  whats he suffering from  the empire hes pretty nearly cured us all of imperialism at home praps hell cure you  very good what am i to do with him  dont you worry said penfentenyou hell do it  and when mr lingnam appeared halfanhour later with the agentgeneral for penfentenyous dominion he did just that  he advanced across the lawn eloquent as all the tides he said he had been observing to the agentgeneral that it was both politically immoral and strategically unsound that fortyfour million people should bear the entire weight of the defences of our mighty empire but as he had observed here the agentgeneral evaporated we stood now upon the threshold of a new era in which the selfgoverning and selfrespecting bis dominions would rightly and righteously as copartners in empery shoulder their share of any burden which the panimperial council of the future should allot the agentgeneral was already arranging for drinks with penfentenyou at the other end of the garden mr lingnam swept me on to the most remote bench and settled to his theme  we dined at eight at nine mr lingnam was only drawing abreast of things imperial at ten the agentgeneral who earns his salary was shamelessly dozing on the sofa at eleven he and penfentenyou went to bed at midnight mr lingnam brought down his bigbellied despatch box with the newspaper clippings and set to federating the empire in earnest i remember that he had three alternative plans as a dealer in words i plumped for the resonant thirdreciprocally coordinated senatorial hegemonywhich he then elaborated in detail for threequarters of an hour at halfpast one he urged me to have faith and to remember that nothing mattered except the idea then he retired to his room accompanied by one glass of cold water and i went into the dawnlit garden and prayed to any power that might be off duty for the blood of mr lingnam penfentenyou and the agentgeneral  to me as i have often observed elsewhere the hour of earliest dawn is fortunate and the wind that runs before it has ever been my most comfortable counsellor  wait it said all among the nights expectant rosebuds tomorrow is also a day wait upon the event  i went to bed so at peace with god and man and guest that when i waked i visited mr lingnam in pyjamas and he talked to me panimperially for halfanhour before his bath later the agentgeneral said he had letters to write and penfentenyou invented a cabinet crisis in his adored dominion which would keep him busy with codes and cables all the forenoon but i said firmly mr lingnam wishes to see a little of the country round here you are coming with us in your own car  its a hired one penfentenyou objected  yes paid for by me as a taxpayer i replied  and yours has a top and the weather looks thundery said the agentgeneral ours hasnt a windscreen even our goggles were hired  ill lend you goggles i said my car is under repairs  the hireling who had looked to be returned to london spat and growled on the drive she was an open car capable of some eighteen miles on the flat with tetanic gears and a perpetual palsy  it wont make the least difference sighed the agentgeneral hell only raise his voice he did it all the way coming down  i say said penfentenyou suspiciously what are you doing all this for  love of the empire i answered as mr lingnam tripped up in dustcoat and binoculars now mr lingnam will tell us exactly what he wants to see he probably knows more about england than the rest of us put together  i read it up yesterday said mr lingnam simply while we stowed the lunchbasket one can never make too sure with a hired car he outlined a very pretty and instructive little days run  youll drive of course said penfentenyou to him its the only thing you know anything about  this astonished me for your greater federationists are rarely mechanicians but mr lingnam said he would prefer to be inside for the present and enjoy our conversation  well settled on the back seat he did not once lift his eyes to the mellow landscape around him or throw a word at the life of the english road which to me is one renewed and unreasoned orgy of delight the mustardcoloured scouts of the automobile association their natural enemies the unjust police our natural enemies the deliberate marketday cattle broadsideon at all corners the bicycling butcherboy a furlong behind roadengines that pulled giddygorounds rifle galleries and swings and sucked snortingly from wayside ponds in defiance of the noticeboard tractionengines their trailers piled high with road metal uniformed village nurses one per seven statute miles flitting by on their wheels governesscarts full of pink children jogging unconcernedly past roaring brazen touringcars the wayside rector with virgins in attendance their faces screwed up against our dust motorbicycles of every shape charging down at every angle red flags of rifleranges detachments of dustyputteed territorials coveys of flagrant children playing in midstreet and the wise educated english dog safe and quite silent on the pavement if his foolmistress would but cease from trying to save him passed and repassed us in sunlit or shaded settings but mr lingnam only talked he talkedwe all sat together behind so that we could not escape himand he talked above the worn gears and a certain maddening swish of one badly patched tireand he talked of the federation of the empire against all conceivable dangers except himself yet i was neither brutally rude like penfentenyou nor swooningly bored like the agentgeneral i remembered a certain joseph finsbury who delighted the tregonwell arms on the borders of the new forest with nineit should have been tenversions of a single income of two hundred pounds placing the imaginary person inbut i could not recall the list of towns further than london paris bagdad and spitsbergen this last i must have murmured aloud for the agentgeneral suddenly became human and went on bussorah heligoland and the scilly islands  what growled penfentenyou  nothing said the agentgeneral squeezing my hand affectionately only we have just found out that we are brothers  exactly said mr lingnam thats what ive been trying to lead up to were all brothers dyou realise that fifteen years ago such a conversation as were having would have been unthinkable the empire wouldnt have been ripe for it to go back even ten years  ive got it cried the agentgeneral brighton cincinnati and nijninovgorod god bless rls go on uncle joseph i can endure much now  mr lingnam went on like our shandrydan slowly and loudly he admitted that a man obsessed with a central ideaand after all the only thing that mattered was the ideamight become a bore but the worlds work he pointed out had been done by bores so he laid his bones down to that work till we abandoned ourselves to the passage of time and the mercy of allah who alone closes the mouths of his prophets and we wasted more than fifty miles of summers vivid own england upon him the while  about two oclock we topped sumtner rising and looked down on the village of sumtner barton which lies just across a single railway line spanned by a red brick bridge the thick thunderous june airs brought us gusts of melody from a giddygoround steamorgan in full blast near the pond on the village green drums too thumped and banners waved and regalia flashed at the far end of the broad village street mr lingnam asked why  nothing imperial im afraid it looks like a foresters fÃªteone of our big mutual benefit societies i explained  the idea only needs to be coordinated to imperial scale he began  but it means that the pub will be crowded i went on  whats the matter with lunching by the roadside here said penfentenyou weve got the lunchbasket  havent you ever heard of sumtner barton ales i demanded and be became the administrator at once saying i see lingnam can drive us in and well get some while holfordthis was the hireling chauffeur whose views on beer we knew notlays out lunch here thatll be better than eating at the pub we can take in the foresters fÃªte as well and perhaps i can buy some newspapers at the station  true i answered the railway station is just under that bridge and well come back and lunch here  i indicated a terrace of cool clean shade beneath kindly beeches at the head of sumtner rise as holford got out the lunchbasket a detachment of regular troops on manoeuvres swung down the baking road  ah said mr lingnam the monthlymagazine roll in his voice all europe is an armed camp groaning as i remember i once wrote under the weight of its accoutrements  oh hop in and drive cried penfentenyou we want that beer  it made no difference mr lingnam could have federated the empire from a tight rope he continued his oration at the wheel as we trundled  the danger to the younger nations is of being drawn into this vortex of militarism he went on dodging the rear of the soldiery  slow past troops i hinted it saves em dust and we overtake on the right as a rule in england  thanks mr lingnam slued over thats another detail which needs to be coordinated throughout the empire but to go back to what i was saying my idea has always been that the component parts of the empire should take counsel among themselves on the approach of war so that after we have decided on the merits of the casus belli we can coordinate what part each dominion shall play whenever war is unfortunately a possibility  we neared the hogback railway bridge and the hireling knocked piteously at the grade mr lingnam changed gears and she hoisted herself up to a joyous youpiaddyiay from the steamorgan as we topped the arch we saw a foresters band with banners marching down the street  thats all very fine said the agentgeneral but in real life things have a knack of happening without approaching                                       some schools of thought hold that time is not and that when we attain complete enlightenment we shall behold past present and future as one awful whole i myself have nearly achieved this                                       we dipped over the bridge into the village a boy on a bicycle loaded with four paper bonnetboxes pedalled towards us out of an alley on our right he bowed his head the better to overcome the ascent and naturally took his left mr lingnam swerved frantically to the right penfentenyou shouted the boy looked up saw the car was like to squeeze him against the bridge wall flung himself off his machine and across the narrow pavement into the nearest house he slammed the door at the precise moment when the car all brakes set bunted the abandoned bicycle shattering three of the bonnetboxes and jerking the fourth over the unscreened dashboard into mr lingnams arms  there was a dead stillness then a hiss like that of escaping steam and a man who had been running towards us ran the other way  why i think that those must be bees said mr lingnam  they werefour full swarmsand the first living objects which he had remarked upon all day  some one said oh god the agentgeneral went out over the back of the car crying resolutely stop the traffic stop the traffic there penfentenyou was already on the pavement ringing a doorbell so i had both their rugs whichfor i am an apiaristi threw over my head while i was tucking my trousers into my socksfor i am an apiarist of experiencemr lingnam picked up the unexploded bonnetbox and with a single magnificent gesture he told us afterwards he thought there was a river beneath hurled it over the parapet of the bridge ere he ran across the road towards the village green now the station platform immediately below was crowded with foresters and their friends waiting to welcome a delegation from a sister court i saw the box burst on the flint edging of the station garden and the contents sweep forward conewise like shrapnel but the result was stimulating rather than sedative all those welldressed people below shouted like sodom and gomorrah then they moved as a unit into the bookingoffice the waitingrooms and other places shut doors and windows and declaimed aloud while the incoming train whistled far down the line  i pivoted round crosslegged on the back seat like a circassian beauty beneath her veil and saw penfentenyou his coatcollar over his ears dancing before a shut door and holding up handfuls of currency to a silverhaired woman at an upper window who only mouthed and shook her head a little child carrying a kitten came smiling round a corner suddenly but these things moved me no more than so many yards of threepenny cinematographfilm the kitten leaped spitting from her arms the child burst into tears penfentenyou still dancing snatched her up and tucked her under his coat the womans countenance blanched the front door opened penfentenyou and the child pressed through and i was alone in an inhospitable world where every one was shutting windows and calling children home  a voice cried youve frowtened em youve frowtened em throw dust on em and theyll settle  i did not desire to throw dust on any created thing i needed both hands for my draperies and two more for my stockings besides the bees were doing me no hurt they recognised me as a member of the county beekeepers association who had paid his annual subscription and was entitled to a free seat at all apicultural exhibitions the quiver and the churn of the hireling car or it might have been the lurching banners and the arrogant big drum inclined many of them to go up street and pay court to the advancing foresters band so they went such as had not followed mr lingnam in his flight toward the green and i looked out of two goggled eyes instead of half a one at the approaching musicians while i listened with both ears to the delayed trains second whistle down the line beneath me  the foresters band no more knew what was coming than do troops under sudden fire indeed there were the same extravagant gestures and contortions as attend wounds and deaths in war the very same uncanny cessations of speechfor the trombone was cut off at midslide even as a man drops with a syllable on his tongue they clawed they slapped they fled leaving behind them a trophy of banners and brasses crudely arranged round the big drum then that end of the street also shut its windows and the village stripped of life lay round me like a reef at low tide though i am as i have said an apiarist in good standing i never realised that there were so many bees in the world when they had woven a flashing haze from one end of the desert street to the other there remained reserves enough to form knops and pendules on all windowsills and gutterends without diminishing the multitudes in the three oozing bonnetboxes or drawing on the fourth railway battalion in charge of the station below the prisoners in the waitingrooms and other places there cried out a great deal i argued that they were dying of the heat and at regular intervals the stationmaster called and called to a signalman who was not on duty and the train whistled as it drew nearer  then penfentenyou venal and adaptable politician of the type that survives at the price of all the higher emotions appeared at the window of the house on my right broken and congested with mirth the woman beside him and the child in his arms i saw his mouth open and shut he hollowed his hands round it but the churr of the motor and the bees drowned his words he pointed dramatically across the street many times and fell back tears running down his face i turned like a hooded barbette in a heavy seaway not knowing when my trousers would come out of my socks again through one hundred and eighty degrees and in due time bore on the village green there was a salmon in the pond rising short at a cloud of midges to the tune of yipiaddy but there was none to gaff him the swingboats were empty cocoanuts sat still on their red sticks before white screens and the gaypainted horses of the giddygorounds revolved riderless all was melody green turf bright water and this greedy gambolling fish when i had identified it by its grey gills and binoculars as lingnam i prostrated myself before allah in that mirth which is more truly labour than any prayer then i turned to the purple penfentenyou at the window and wiped my eyes on the rug edge  he raised the window half one cautious inch and bellowed through the crack did you see him have they got you i can see lots of things from here its like a threering circus  can you see the station i replied nodding toward the right rear mudguard  he twisted and craned sideways but could not command that beautiful view  no whats it like he cried  hell i shouted the silverhaired woman frowned so did penfentenyou and i think apologised to her for my language  youre always so extreme he fluted reproachfully you forget that nothing matters except the idea besides they are this ladys bees  he closed the window and introduced us through it in dumb show but he contrived to give the impression that i was the specimen under glass  a spurt of damp steam saved me from apoplexy the train had lost patience at last and was coming into the station directly beneath me to see what was the matter happy voices sang and heads were thrust out all along the compartments but none answered their songs or greetings she halted and the people began to get out then they began to get in again as their friends in the waitingrooms advised all did not catch the warning so there was congestion at the doors but those whom the bees caught got in first  still the bees more bent on their own business than wanton torture kept to the south end of the platform by the bookstall and that was why the completely exposed enginedriver at the north end of the train did not at first understand the hermetically sealed stationmaster when the latter shouted to him many times to get on out o this  where are you was the reply and what for  it dont matter where i am an youll get whatfor in a minute if you dont shift said the stationmaster drop em at parsons meadow and they can walk up over the fields  that barearmed thinshirted idiot leaning out of the cab took the stationmasters orders as an insult to his dignity and roared at the shut offices youll give me whatfor will you look ere im not in the abit of his outstretched hand flew to his neck do you know that if you sting an enginedriver it is the same as stinging his train she starts with a jerk that nearly smashes the couplings and runs barking like a dog till she is out of sight nor does she think about spilled people and parted families on the platform behind her i had to do all that there was a man called fred and his wife harrieta cheery fullblooded couplewho interested me immensely before they battered their way into a small detached building already densely occupied there was also a nameless bachelor who sat under a halfopened umbrella and twirled it dizzily which was so new a game that i applauded aloud  when they had thoroughly cleared the ground the bees set about making comb for publication at the bookstall counter presently some bold hearts tiptoed out of the waitingrooms over the loud gravel with the consciously modest air of men leaving church climbed the wooden staircase to the bridge and so reached my level where the inexhaustible bonnetboxes were still vomiting squadrons and platoons there was little need to bid them descend they had wrapped their heads in handkerchiefs so that they looked like the disappointed dead scuttling back to purgatory only one old gentleman pontifically draped in a banner embroidered temperance and fortitude ran the gauntlet upstreet shouting as he passed me its night or blÃ¼cher mister they let him in at the white hart the pub where i should have bought the beer  after this the day sagged i fell to reckoning how long a man in a turkish bath weakened by excessive laughter could live without food and specially drink and how long a disenfranchised bee could hold out under the same conditions  obviously since her one practical joke costs her her life the bee can have but small sense of humour but her fundamentally dismal and ungracious outlook on life impressed me beyond words she had paralysed locomotion wiped out trade social intercourse mutual trust love friendship sport music the lonely steamorgan had run down at last all that gives substance colour or savour to life and yet in the barren desert she had created was not one whit more near to the evolution of a saner order of things the heavens were darkened with the swarms divided counsels the street shimmered with their purposeless sallies they clotted on tiles and gutterpipes and began frenziedly to build a cell or two of comb ere they discovered that their queen was not with them then flung off to seek her or whirled dishevelled and insane into another hissing nebula on the false rumour that she was there i scowled upon them with disfavour and a massy blue thunderhead rose majestically from behind the elmtrees of sumtner barton rectory arched over and scowled with me then i realised that it was not bees nor locusts that had darkened the skies but the oncoming of the malignant english thunderstormthe one thing before which even deborah the bee cannot express her silly little self  aha now youll catch it i said as the herald gusts set the big drum rolling down the street like a boxkite up and up yearned the dark cloud till the first lightning quivered and cut deborah cowered where she flew there she fled where she was there she sat still and the solid rain closed in on her as a book that is closed when the chapter is finished by the time it had soaked to my second rug penfentenyou appeared at the window wiping his false mouth on a napkin  are you all right he inquired then thats all right mrs bellamy says that her bees dont sting in the wet youd better fetch lingnam over hes got to pay for them and the bicycle  i had no words which the silverhaired lady could listen to but paddled across the flooded street between flashes to the pond on the green mr lingnam scarcely visible through the sheeting downpour trotted round the edge he bore himself nobly and lied at the mere sight of me  isnt this wet he cried it has drenched me to the skin i shall need a change  come along i said i dont know what youll get but you deserve more  penfentenyou dry fed and in command let us in you he whispered to me are to wait in the scullery mrs bellamy didnt like the way you talked about her bees hsh hsh shes a kindhearted lady shes a widow lingnam but shes kept his clothes and as soon as youve paid for the damage shell rent you a suit ive arranged it all  then tell him he mustnt undress in my hall said a voice from the stairhead  tell her lingnam began  come and look at the pretty suit ive chosen penfentenyou cooed as one cajoling a maniac  i staggered outofdoors again and fell into the car whose everrunning machinery masked my yelps and hiccups when i raised my forehead from the wheel i saw that traffic through the village had been resumed after as my watch showed one and onehalf hours suspension there were two limousines one landau one doctors car three touringcars one patent steamlaundry van three tricars one tractionengine some motorcycles one with a sidecar and one brewery lorry it was the allegory of my own imperturbable country delayed for a short time by unforeseen external events but now going about her business and i blessed her with tears in my eyes even though i knew she looked upon me as drunk and incapable  then troops came over the bridge behind mea company of dripping wet regulars without any expression in their rear carrying the lunchbasket marched the agentgeneral and holford the hired chauffeur  i say said the agentgeneral nodding at the darkened khaki backs if thats what weve got to depend on in event of war theyre a broken reed they ran like haresran like hares i tell you  and you i asked  oh i just sauntered back over the bridge and stopped the traffic that end then i had lunch pity about the beer though i saythese cushions are sopping wet  im sorry i said i havent had time to turn em  nor there wasnt any need to ave kept the engine runnin all this time said holford sternly ill ave to account for the expenditure of petrol it exceeds the mileage indicated you see  im sorry i repeated after all that is the way that taxpayers regard most crises  the housedoor opened and penfentenyou and another came out into the now thinning rain  ah there you both are heres lingnam he cried hes got a little wet hes had to change  we saw that i was too sore and weak to begin another laugh but the agentgeneral crumpled up where he stood the late mr bellamy must have been a man of tremendous personality which he had impressed on every angle of his garments i was told later that he had died in delirium tremens which at once explained the pattern and the reason why mr lingnam writhing inside it swore so inspiredly of the deliberate and diffuse federationist there remained no trace save the binoculars and two damp whiskers we stood on the pavement before elemental man calling on elemental powers to condemn and incinerate creation  well hadnt we better be getting back said the agentgeneral  look out i remarked casually those bonnetboxes are full of bees still  are they said the livid mr lingnam and tilted them over with the late mr bellamys large boots deborah rolled out in drenched lumps into the swilling gutter there was a muffled shriek at the window where mrs bellamy gesticulated  its all right ive paid for them said mr lingnam he dumped out the last dregs like mould from a potbound flowerpot  what are you going to take em home with you said the agentgeneral  no he passed a wet hand over his streaky forehead wasnt there a bicycle that was the beginning of this trouble said he  its under the foreaxle sir said holford promptly i can fish it out from ere  not till ive done with it please before we could stop him he had jumped into the car and taken charge the hireling leaped into her collar surged shrieked less loudly than mrs bellamy at the window and swept on that which came out behind her was as holford truly observed no joywheel mr lingnam swung round the big drum in the marketplace and thundered back shouting leave it alone its my meat  mincemeat e means said holford after this second trituration you couldnt say now it ad ever been one could you  mrs bellamy opened the window and spoke it appears she had only charged for damage to the bicycle not for the entire machine which mr lingnam was ruthlessly gleaning spoke by spoke from the highway and cramming into the slack of the hood at last he answered and i have never seen a man foam at the mouth before if you dont stop i shall come into your housein this carand drive upstairs andkill you  she stopped he stopped holford took the wheel and we got away it was time for the sun shone after the storm and deborah beneath the tiles and the eaves already felt its reviving influence compel her to her interrupted labours of federation we warned the village policeman at the far end of the street that he might have to suspend traffic again the proprietor of the giddygoround swings and cocoanutshies wanted to know from whom in this world or another he could recover damages mr lingnam referred him most directly to mrs bellamy then we went home  after dinner that evening mr lingnam rose stiffly in his place to make a few remarks on the federation of the empire on the lines of coordinated offensive operations backed by the entire effective forces moral military and fiscal of permanently mobilised communities the whole brought to bear without any respect to the merits of any casus belli instantaneously automatically and remorselessly at the first faint buzz of war  the trouble with us said he is that we take such an infernally long time making sure that we are right that we dont go ahead when things happen for instance i ought to have gone ahead instead of pulling up when i hit that bicycle  but you were in the wrong lingnam when you turned to the right i put in  i dont want to hear any more of your damned detached mugwumping excuses for the other fellow he snapped  now youre beginning to see things said penfentenyou i hope you wont backslide when the swellings go down    the song of seven cities       i was lord of cities very sumptuously builded      seven roaring cities paid me tribute from afar      ivory their outposts werethe guardrooms of them        gilded      and garrisoned with amazons invincible in war       all the world went softly when it walked before my        cities      neither king nor army vexed my peoples at their toil      never horse nor chariot irked or overbore my cities      never mob nor ruler questioned whence they drew        their spoil       banded mailed and arrogant from sunrise unto sunset      singing while they sacked it they possessed the land        at large      yet when men would rob them they resisted they        made onset      and pierced the smoke of battle with a thousandsabred        charge       so they warred and trafficked only yesterday my cities      today there is no mark or mound of where my cities        stood      for the river rose at midnight and it washed away my        cities      they are evened with atlantis and the towns before the        flood       rain on raingorged channels raised the waterlevels        round them      freshet backed on freshet swelled and swept their        world from sight      till the emboldened floods linked arms and flashing forward        drowned them      drowned my seven cities and their peoples in one        night       low among the alders lie their derelict foundations      the beams wherein they trusted and the plinths whereon        they built      my rulers and their treasure and their unborn populations      dead destroyed aborted and defiled with mud and        silt       the daughters of the palace whom they cherished in        my cities      my silvertongued princesses and the promise of their        may      their bridegrooms of the junetideall have perished        in my cities      with the harsh envenomed virgins that can neither        love nor play       i was lord of citiesi will build anew my cities      seven set on rocks above the wrath of any flood      nor will i rest from search till i have filled anew my cities      with peoples undefeated of the dark enduring blood       to the sound of trumpets shall their seed restore my cities      wealthy and wellweaponed that once more may i behold      all the world go softly when it walks before my cities      and the horses and the chariots fleeing from them as of old    swept and garnished  january 1915  when the first waves of feverish cold stole over frau ebermann she very wisely telephoned for the doctor and went to bed he diagnosed the attack as mild influenza prescribed the appropriate remedies and left her to the care of her one servant in her comfortable berlin flat frau ebermann beneath the thick coverlet curled up with what patience she could until the aspirin should begin to act and anna should come back from the chemist with the formamint the ammoniated quinine the eucalyptus and the little tin steaminhaler meantime every bone in her body ached her head throbbed her hot dry hands would not stay the same size for a minute together and her body tucked into the smallest possible compass shrank from the chill of the wellwarmed sheets  of a sudden she noticed that an imitationlace cover which should have lain mathematically square with the imitationmarble top of the radiator behind the green plush sofa had slipped away so that one corner hung over the bronzepainted steam pipes she recalled that she must have rested her poor head against the radiatortop while she was taking off her boots she tried to get up and set the thing straight but the radiator at once receded toward the horizon which unlike true horizons slanted diagonally exactly parallel with the dropped lace edge of the cover frau ebermann groaned through sticky lips and lay still  certainly i have a temperature she said certainly i have a grave temperature i should have been warned by that chill after dinner  she resolved to shut her hotlidded eyes but opened them in a little while to torture herself with the knowledge of that ungeometrical thing against the far wall then she saw a childan untidy thinfaced little girl of about ten who must have strayed in from the adjoining flat this provedfrau ebermann groaned again at the way the world falls to bits when one is sickproved that anna had forgotten to shut the outer door of the flat when she went to the chemist frau ebermann had had children of her own but they were all grown up now and she had never been a childlover in any sense yet the intruder might be made to serve her scheme of things  makeput she muttered thickly that white thing straight on the top of that yellow thing  the child paid no attention but moved about the room investigating everything that came in her waythe yellow cutglass handles of the chest of drawers the stamped bronze hook to hold back the heavy puce curtains and the mauve enamel new art fingerplates on the door frau ebermann watched indignantly  aie that is bad and rude go away she cried though it hurt her to raise her voice go away by the road you came the child passed behind the bedfoot where she could not see her shut the door as you go i will speak to anna butfirst put that white thing straight  she closed her eyes in misery of body and soul the outer door clicked and anna entered very penitent that she had stayed so long at the chemists but it had been difficult to find the proper type of inhaler and  where did the child go moaned frau ebermannthe child that was here  there was no child said startled anna how should any child come in when i shut the door behind me after i go out all the keys of the flats are different  no no you forgot this time but my back is aching and up my legs also besides who knows what it may have fingered and upset look and see  nothing is fingered nothing is upset anna replied as she took the inhaler from its paper box  yes there is now i remember all about it putput that white thing with the open edgethe lace i meanquite straight on that she pointed anna accustomed to her ways understood and went to it  now is it quite straight frau ebermann demanded  perfectly said anna in fact in the very centre of the radiator anna measured the equal margins with her knuckle as she had been told to do when she first took service  and my tortoiseshell hair brushes frau ebermann could not command her dressingtable from where she lay  perfectly straight side by side in the big tray and the comb laid across them your watch also in the coralline watchholder everythingshe moved round the room to make sureeverything is as you have it when you are well frau ebermann sighed with relief it seemed to her that the room and her head had suddenly grown cooler  good said she now warm my nightgown in the kitchen so it will be ready when i have perspired and the towels also make the inhaler steam and put in the eucalyptus that is good for the larynx then sit you in the kitchen and come when i ring but first my hotwater bottle  it was brought and scientifically tucked in  what news said frau ebermann drowsily she had not been out that day  another victory said anna many more prisoners and guns  frau ebermann purred one might almost say grunted contentedly  that is good too she said and anna after lighting the inhalerlamp went out  frau ebermann reflected that in an hour or so the aspirin would begin to work and all would be well tomorrowno the day aftershe would take up life with something to talk over with her friends at coffee it was rareevery one knew itthat she should be overcome by any ailment yet in all her distresses she had not allowed the minutest deviation from daily routine and ritual she would tell her friendsshe ran over their names one by oneexactly what measures she had taken against the lace cover on the radiatortop and in regard to her two tortoiseshell hair brushes and the comb at right angles how she had set everything in ordereverything in order she roved further afield as she wriggled her toes luxuriously on the hotwater bottle if it pleased our dear god to take her to himself and she was not so young as she had beenthere was that plate of the four lower ones in the blue toothglass for instancehe should find all her belongings fit to meet his eye swept and garnished were the words that shaped themselves in her intent brain swept and garnished for  no it was certainly not for the dear lord that she had swept she would have her room swept out tomorrow or the day after and garnished her hands began to swell again into huge pillows of nothingness then they shrank and so did her head to minute dots it occurred to her that she was waiting for some event some tremendously important event to come to pass she lay with shut eyes for a long time till her head and hands should return to their proper size  she opened her eyes with a jerk  how stupid of me she said aloud to set the room in order for a parcel of dirty little children  they were therefive of them two little boys and three girlsheaded by the anxiouseyed tenyearold whom she had seen before they must have entered by the outer door which anna had neglected to shut behind her when she returned with the inhaler she counted them backward and forward as one counts scalesone two three four five  they took no notice of her but hung about first on one foot then on the other like strayed chickens the smaller ones holding by the larger they had the air of utterly wearied passengers in a railway waitingroom and their clothes were disgracefully dirty  go away cried frau ebermann at last after she had struggled it seemed to her for years to shape the words  you called said anna at the livingroom door  no said her mistress did you shut the flat door when you came in  assuredly said anna besides it is made to catch shut of itself  then go away said she very little above a whisper if anna pretended not to see the children she would speak to anna later on  and now she said turning toward them as soon as the door closed the smallest of the crowd smiled at her and shook his head before he buried it in his sisters skirts  whydontyougoaway she whispered earnestly  again they took no notice but guided by the elder girl set themselves to climb boots and all on to the green plush sofa in front of the radiator the little boys had to be pushed as they could not compass the stretch unaided they settled themselves in a row with small gasps of relief and pawed the plush approvingly  i ask youi ask you why do you not go awaywhy do you not go away frau ebermann found herself repeating the question twenty times it seemed to her that everything in the world hung on the answer you know you should not come into houses and rooms unless you are invited not houses and bedrooms you know  no a solemn little sixyearold repeated not houses nor bedrooms nor diningrooms nor churches nor all those places shouldnt come in its rude  yes he said so the younger girl put in proudly he said it he told them only pigs would do that the line nodded and dimpled one to another with little explosive giggles such as children use when they tell deeds of great daring against their elders  if you know it is wrong that makes it much worse said frau ebermann  oh yes much worse they assented cheerfully till the smallest boy changed his smile to a baby wail of weariness  when will they come for us he asked and the girl at the head of the row hauled him bodily into her square little capable lap  hes tired she explained he is only four he only had his first breeches this spring they came almost under his armpits and were held up by broad linen braces which his sorrow diverted for the moment he patted proudly  yes beautiful dear said both girls  go away said frau ebermann go home to your father and mother  their faces grew grave at once  hsh we cant whispered the eldest there isnt anything left  all gone a boy echoed and he puffed through pursed lips like that uncle told me both cows too  and my own three ducks the boy on the girls lap said sleepily  so you see we came here the elder girl leaned forward a little caressing the child she rocked  ii dont understand said frau ebermann are you lost then you must tell our police  oh no we are only waiting  but what are you waiting for  we are waiting for our people to come for us they told us to come here and wait for them so we are waiting till they come the eldest girl replied  yes we are waiting till our people come for us said all the others in chorus  but said frau ebermann very patientlybut now tell me for i tell you that i am not in the least angry where do you come from where do you come from  the five gave the names of two villages of which she had read in the papers  that is silly said frau ebermann the people fired on us and they were punished those places are wiped out stamped flat  yes yes wiped out stamped flat that is why andi have lost the ribbon off my pigtail said the younger girl she looked behind her over the sofaback  it is not here said the elder it was lost before dont you remember  now if you are lost you must go and tell our police they will take care of you and give you food said frau ebermann anna will show you the way there  nothis was the sixyearold with the smilewe must wait here till our people come for us mustnt we sister  of course we wait here till our people come for us all the world knows that said the eldest girl  yes the boy in her lap had waked again little children tooas little as henri and he doesnt wear trousers yet as little as all that  i dont understand said frau ebermann shivering in spite of the heat of the room and the damp breath of the steaminhaler the aspirin was not doing its duty  the girl raised her blue eyes and looked at the woman for an instant  you see she said emphasising her statements with her ringers they told us to wait here till our people came for us so we came we wait till our people come for us  that is silly again said frau ebermann it is no good for you to wait here do you know what this place is you have been to school it is berlin the capital of germany  yes yes they all cried berlin capital of germany we know that that is why we came  so you see it is no good she said triumphantly because your people can never come for you here  they told us to come here and wait till our people came for us they delivered this as if it were a lesson in school then they sat still their hands orderly folded on their laps smiling as sweetly as ever  go away go away frau ebermann shrieked  you called said anna entering  no go away go away  very good old cat said the maid under her breath next time you may call and she returned to her friend in the kitchen  i ask youask you please to go away frau ebermann pleaded go to my anna through that door and she will give you cakes and sweeties it is not kind of you to come into my room and behave so badly  where else shall we go now the elder girl demanded turning to her little company they fell into discussion one preferred the broad street with trees another the railway station but when she suggested an emperors palace they agreed with her  we will go then she said and added half apologetically to frau ebermann you see they are so little they like to meet all the others  what others said frau ebermann  the othershundreds and hundreds and thousands and thousands of the others  that is a lie there cannot be a hundred even much less a thousand cried frau ebermann  so said the girl politely  yes i tell you and i have very good information i know how it happened you should have been more careful you should not have run out to see the horses and guns passing that is how it is done when our troops pass through my son has written me so  they had clambered down from the sofa and gathered round the bed with eager interested eyes  horses and guns going byhow fine some one whispered  yes yes believe me that is how the accidents to the children happen you must know yourself that it is true one runs out to look  but i never saw any at all a boy cried sorrowfully only one noise i heard that was when aunt emmelines house fell down  but listen to me i am telling you one runs out to look because one is little and cannot see well so one peeps between the mans legs and thenyou know how close those big horses and guns turn the cornersthen ones foot slips and one gets run over thats how it happens several times it had happened but not many times certainly not a hundred perhaps not twenty so you see you must be all tell me now that you are all that there are and anna shall give you the cakes  thousands a boy repeated monotonously then we all come here to wait till our people come for us  but now we will go away from here the poor lady is tired said the elder girl plucking his sleeve  oh you hurt you hurt he cried and burst into tears  what is that for said frau ebermann to cry in a room where a poor lady is sick is very inconsiderate  oh but look lady said the elder girl  frau ebermann looked and saw  au revoir lady they made their little smiling bows and curtseys undisturbed by her loud cries au revoir lady we will wait till our people come for us  when anna at last ran in she found her mistress on her knees busily cleaning the floor with the lace cover from the radiator because she explained it was all spotted with the blood of five childrenshe was perfectly certain there could not be more than five in the whole worldwho had gone away for the moment but were now waiting round the corner and anna was to find them and give them cakes to stop the bleeding while her mistress swept and garnished that our dear lord when he came might find everything as it should be    mary postgate  1915  of miss mary postgate lady mccausland wrote that she was thoroughly conscientious tidy companionable and ladylike i am very sorry to part with her and shall always be interested in her welfare  miss fowler engaged her on this recommendation and to her surprise for she had had experience of companions found that it was true miss fowler was nearer sixty than fifty at the time but though she needed care she did not exhaust her attendants vitality on the contrary she gave out stimulatingly and with reminiscences her father had been a minor court official in the days when the great exhibition of 1851 had just set its seal on civilisation made perfect some of miss fowlers tales none the less were not always for the young mary was not young and though her speech was as colourless as her eyes or her hair she was never shocked she listened unflinchingly to every one said at the end how interesting or how shocking as the case might be and never again referred to it for she prided herself on a trained mind which did not dwell on these things she was too a treasure at domestic accounts for which the village tradesmen with their weekly books loved her not otherwise she had no enemies provoked no jealousy even among the plainest neither gossip nor slander had ever been traced to her she supplied the odd place at the rectors or the doctors table at half an hours notice she was a sort of public aunt to very many small children of the village street whose parents while accepting everything would have been swift to resent what they called patronage she served on the village nursing committee as miss fowlers nominee when miss fowler was crippled by rheumatoid arthritis and came out of six months fortnightly meetings equally respected by all the cliques  and when fate threw miss fowlers nephew an unlovely orphan of eleven on miss fowlers hands mary postgate stood to her share of the business of education as practised in private and public schools she checked printed clotheslists and unitemised bills of extras wrote to head and house masters matrons nurses and doctors and grieved or rejoiced over halfterm reports young wyndham fowler repaid her in his holidays by calling her gatepost postey or packthread by thumping her between her narrow shoulders or by chasing her bleating round the garden her large mouth open her large nose high in air at a stiffnecked shamble very like a camels later on he filled the house with clamour argument and harangues as to his personal needs likes and dislikes and the limitations of you women reducing mary to tears of physical fatigue or when he chose to be humorous of helpless laughter at crises which multiplied as he grew older she was his ambassadress and his interpretress to miss fowler who had no large sympathy with the young a vote in his interest at the councils on his future his sewingwoman strictly accountable for mislaid boots and garments always his butt and his slave  and when he decided to become a solicitor and had entered an office in london when his greeting had changed from hullo postey you old beast to mornin packthread there came a war which unlike all wars that mary could remember did not stay decently outside england and in the newspapers but intruded on the lives of people whom she knew as she said to miss fowler it was most vexatious it took the rectors son who was going into business with his elder brother it took the colonels nephew on the eve of fruitfarming in canada it took mrs grants son who his mother said was devoted to the ministry and very early indeed it took wynn fowler who announced on a postcard that he had joined the flying corps and wanted a cardigan waistcoat  he must go and he must have the waistcoat said miss fowler so mary got the propersized needles and wool while miss fowler told the men of her establishmenttwo gardeners and an odd man aged sixtythat those who could join the army had better do so the gardeners left cheape the odd man stayed on and was promoted to the gardeners cottage the cook scorning to be limited in luxuries also left after a spirited scene with miss fowler and took the housemaid with her miss fowler gazetted nellie cheapes seventeenyearold daughter to the vacant post mrs cheape to the rank of cook with occasional cleaning bouts and the reduced establishment moved forward smoothly  wynn demanded an increase in his allowance miss fowler who always looked facts in the face said he must have it the chances are he wont live long to draw it and if three hundred makes him happy  wynn was grateful and came over in his tightbuttoned uniform to say so his training centre was not thirty miles away and his talk was so technical that it had to be explained by charts of the various types of machines he gave mary such a chart  and youd better study it postey he said youll be seeing a lot of em soon so mary studied the chart but when wynn next arrived to swell and exalt himself before his womenfolk she failed badly in crossexamination and he rated her as in the old days  you look more or less like a human being he said in his new service voice you must have had a brain at some time in your past what have you done with it where dyou keep it a sheep would know more than you do postey youre lamentable you are less use than an empty tin can you dowey old cassowary  i suppose thats how your superior officer talks to you said miss fowler from her chair  but postey doesnt mind wynn replied do you packthread  why was wynn saying anything i shall get this right next time you come she muttered and knitted her pale brows again over the diagrams of taubes farmans and zeppelins  in a few weeks the mere land and sea battles which she read to miss fowler after breakfast passed her like idle breath her heart and her interest were high in the air with wynn who had finished rolling whatever that might be and had gone on from a taxi to a machine more or less his own one morning it circled over their very chimneys alighted on veggs heath almost outside the garden gate and wynn came in blue with cold shouting for food he and she drew miss fowlers bathchair as they had often done along the heath footpath to look at the biplane mary observed that it smelt very badly  postey i believe you think with your nose said wynn i know you dont with your mind now what types that  ill go and get the chart said mary  youre hopeless you havent the mental capacity of a white mouse he cried and explained the dials and the sockets for bombdropping till it was time to mount and ride the wet clouds once more  ah said mary as the stinking thing flared upward wait till our flying corps gets to work wynn says its much safer than in the trenches  i wonder said miss fowler tell cheape to come and tow me home again  its all downhill i can do it said mary if you put the brake on she laid her lean self against the pushingbar and home they trundled  now be careful you arent heated and catch a chill said overdressed miss fowler  nothing makes me perspire said mary as she bumped the chair under the porch she straightened her long back the exertion had given her a colour and the wind had loosened a wisp of hair across her forehead miss fowler glanced at her  what do you ever think of mary she demanded suddenly  oh wynn says he wants another three pairs of stockingsas thick as we can make them  yes but i mean the things that women think about here you are more than forty  fortyfour said truthful mary  well  well mary offered miss fowler her shoulder as usual  and youve been with me ten years now  lets see said mary wynn was eleven when he came hes twenty now and i came two years before that it must be eleven  eleven and youve never told me anything that matters in all that while looking back it seems to me that ive done all the talking  im afraid im not much of a conversationalist as wynn says i havent the mind let me take your hat  miss fowler moving stiffly from the hip stamped her rubbertipped stick on the tiled hall floor mary arent you anything except a companion would you ever have been anything except a companion  mary hung up the garden hat on its proper peg no she said after consideration i dont imagine i ever should but ive no imagination im afraid  she fetched miss fowler her elevenoclock glass of contrexÃ©ville  that was the wet december when it rained six inches to the month and the women went abroad as little as might be wynns flying chariot visited them several times and for two mornings he had warned her by postcard mary heard the thresh of his propellers at dawn the second time she ran to the window and stared at the whitening sky a little blur passed overhead she lifted her lean arms towards it  that evening at six oclock there came an announcement in an official envelope that second lieutenant w fowler had been killed during a trial flight death was instantaneous she read it and carried it to miss fowler  i never expected anything else said miss fowler but im sorry it happened before he had done anything  the room was whirling round mary postgate but she found herself quite steady in the midst of it  yes she said its a great pity he didnt die in action after he had killed somebody  he was killed instantly thats one comfort miss fowler went on  but wynn says the shock of a fall kills a man at oncewhatever happens to the tanks quoted mary  the room was coming to rest now she heard miss fowler say impatiently but why cant we cry mary and herself replying theres nothing to cry for he has done his duty as much as mrs grants son did  and when he died she came and cried all the morning said miss fowler this only makes me feel tiredterribly tired will you help me to bed please maryand i think id like the hotwater bottle  so mary helped her and sat beside talking of wynn in his riotous youth  i believe said miss fowler suddenly that old people and young people slip from under a stroke like this the middleaged feel it most  i expect thats true said mary rising im going to put away the things in his room now shall we wear mourning  certainly not said miss fowler except of course at the funeral i cant go you will i want you to arrange about his being buried here what a blessing it didnt happen at salisbury  every one from the authorities of the flying corps to the rector was most kind and sympathetic mary found herself for the moment in a world where bodies were in the habit of being despatched by all sorts of conveyances to all sorts of places and at the funeral two young men in buttonedup uniforms stood beside the grave and spoke to her afterwards  youre miss postgate arent you said one fowler told me about you he was a good chapa firstclass fellowa great loss  great loss growled his companion were all awfully sorry  how high did he fall from mary whispered  pretty nearly four thousand feet i should think didnt he you were up that day monkey  all of that the other child replied my bar made three thousand and i wasnt as high as him by a lot  then thats all right said mary thank you very much  they moved away as mrs grant flung herself weeping on marys flat chest under the lychgate and cried i know how it feels i know how it feels  but both his parents are dead mary returned as she fended her off perhaps theyve all met by now she added vaguely as she escaped towards the coach  ive thought of that too wailed mrs grant but then hell be practically a stranger to them quite embarrassing  mary faithfully reported every detail of the ceremony to miss fowler who when she described mrs grants outburst laughed aloud  oh how wynn would have enjoyed it he was always utterly unreliable at funerals dyou remember and they talked of him again each piecing out the others gaps and now said miss fowler well pull up the blinds and well have a general tidy that always does us good have you seen to wynns things  everythingsince he first came said mary he was never destructiveeven with his toys  they faced that neat room  it cant be natural not to cry mary said at last im so afraid youll have a reaction  as i told you we old people slip from under the stroke its you im afraid for have you cried yet  i cant it only makes me angry with the germans  thats sheer waste of vitality said miss fowler we must live till the wars finished she opened a full wardrobe now ive been thinking things over this is my plan all his civilian clothes can be given awaybelgian refugees and so on  mary nodded boots collars and gloves  yes we dont need to keep anything except his cap and belt  they came back yesterday with his flying corps clothesmary pointed to a roll on the little iron bed  ah but keep his service things some one may be glad of them later do you remember his sizes  five feet eight and a half thirtysix inches round the chest but he told me hes just put on an inch and a half ill mark it on a label and tie it on his sleepingbag  so that disposes of that said miss fowler tapping the palm of one hand with the ringed third finger of the other what waste it all is well get his old school trunk tomorrow and pack his civilian clothes  and the rest said mary his books and pictures and the games and the toysandand the rest  my plan is to burn every single thing said miss fowler then we shall know where they are and no one can handle them afterwards what do you think  i think that would be much the best said mary but theres such a lot of them  well burn them in the destructor said miss fowler  this was an openair furnace for the consumption of refuse a little circular fourfoot tower of pierced brick over an iron grating miss fowler had noticed the design in a gardening journal years ago and had had it built at the bottom of the garden it suited her tidy soul for it saved unsightly rubbishheaps and the ashes lightened the stiff clay soil  mary considered for a moment saw her way clear and nodded again they spent the evening putting away wellremembered civilian suits underclothes that mary had marked and the regiments of very gaudy socks and ties a second trunk was needed and after that a little packingcase and it was late next day when cheape and the local carrier lifted them to the cart the rector luckily knew of a friends son about five feet eight and a half inches high to whom a complete flying corps outfit would be most acceptable and sent his gardeners son down with a barrow to take delivery of it the cap was hung up in miss fowlers bedroom the belt in miss postgates for as miss fowler said they had no desire to make teaparty talk of them  that disposes of that said miss fowler ill leave the rest to you mary i cant run up and down the garden youd better take the big clothesbasket and get nellie to help you  i shall take the wheelbarrow and do it myself said mary and for once in her life closed her mouth  miss fowler in moments of irritation had called mary deadly methodical she put on her oldest waterproof and gardeninghat and her everslipping goloshes for the weather was on the edge of more rain she gathered firelighters from the kitchen a halfscuttle of coals and a faggot of brushwood these she wheeled in the barrow down the mossed paths to the dank little laurel shrubbery where the destructor stood under the drip of three oaks she climbed the wire fence into the rectors glebe just behind and from his tenants rick pulled two large armfuls of good hay which she spread neatly on the firebars next journey by journey passing miss fowlers white face at the morningroom window each time she brought down in the towelcovered clothesbasket on the wheelbarrow thumbed and used hentys marryats levers stevensons baroness orczys garvices schoolbooks and atlases unrelated piles of the motor cyclist the light car and catalogues of olympia exhibitions the remnants of a fleet of sailingships from ninepenny cutters to a threeguinea yacht a prepschool dressinggown bats from threeandsixpence to twentyfour shillings cricket and tennis balls disintegrated steam and clockwork locomotives with their twisted rails a grey and red tin model of a submarine a dumb gramophone and cracked records golfclubs that had to be broken across the knee like his walkingsticks and an assegai photographs of private and public school cricket and football elevens and his otc on the line of march kodaks and filmrolls some pewters and one real silver cup for boxing competitions and junior hurdles sheaves of school photographs miss fowlers photograph her own which he had borne off in fun and good care she took not to ask had never returned a playbox with a secret drawer a load of flannels belts and jerseys and a pair of spiked shoes unearthed in the attic a packet of all the letters that miss fowler and she had ever written to him kept for some absurd reason through all these years a fiveday attempt at a diary framed pictures of racing motors in full brooklands career and load upon load of undistinguishable wreckage of toolboxes rabbithutches electric batteries tin soldiers fretsaw outfits and jigsaw puzzles  miss fowler at the window watched her come and go and said to herself marys an old woman i never realised it before  after lunch she recommended her to rest  im not in the least tired said mary ive got it all arranged im going to the village at two oclock for some paraffin nellie hasnt enough and the walk will do me good  she made one last quest round the house before she started and found that she had overlooked nothing it began to mist as soon as she had skirted veggs heath where wynn used to descendit seemed to her that she could almost hear the beat of his propellers overhead but there was nothing to see she hoisted her umbrella and lunged into the blind wet till she had reached the shelter of the empty village as she came out of mr kidds shop with a bottle full of paraffin in her string shoppingbag she met nurse eden the village nurse and fell into talk with her as usual about the village children they were just parting opposite the royal oak when a gun they fancied was fired immediately behind the house it was followed by a childs shriek dying into a wail  accident said nurse eden promptly and dashed through the empty bar followed by mary they found mrs gerritt the publicans wife who could only gasp and point to the yard where a little cartlodge was sliding sideways amid a clatter of tiles nurse eden snatched up a sheet drying before the fire ran out lifted something from the ground and flung the sheet round it the sheet turned scarlet and half her uniform too as she bore the load into the kitchen it was little edna gerritt aged nine whom mary had known since her perambulator days  am i hurted bad edna asked and died between nurse edens dripping hands the sheet fell aside and for an instant before she could shut her eyes mary saw the ripped and shredded body  its a wonder she spoke at all said nurse eden what in gods name was it  a bomb said mary  one o the zeppelins  no an aeroplane i thought i heard it on the heath but i fancied it was one of ours it must have shut off its engines as it came down thats why we didnt notice it  the filthy pigs said nurse eden all white and shaken see the pickle im in go and tell dr hennis miss postgate nurse looked at the mother who had dropped face down on the floor shes only in a fit turn her over  mary heaved mrs gerritt right side up and hurried off for the doctor when she told her tale he asked her to sit down in the surgery till he got her something  but i dont need it i assure you said she i dont think it would be wise to tell miss fowler about it do you her heart is so irritable in this weather  dr hennis looked at her admiringly as he packed up his bag  no dont tell anybody till were sure he said and hastened to the royal oak while mary went on with the paraffin the village behind her was as quiet as usual for the news had not yet spread she frowned a little to herself her large nostrils expanded uglily and from time to time she muttered a phrase which wynn who never restrained himself before his womenfolk had applied to the enemy bloody pagans they are bloody pagans but she continued falling back on the teaching that had made her what she was one mustnt let ones mind dwell on these things  before she reached the house dr hennis who was also a special constable overtook her in his car  oh miss postgate he said i wanted to tell you that that accident at the royal oak was due to gerritts stable tumbling down its been dangerous for a long time it ought to have been condemned  i thought i heard an explosion too said mary  you might have been misled by the beams snapping ive been looking at em they were dryrotted through and through of course as they broke they would make a noise just like a gun  yes said mary politely  poor little edna was playing underneath it he went on still holding her with his eyes and that and the tiles cut her to pieces you see  i saw it said mary shaking her head i heard it too  well we cannot be sure dr hennis changed his tone completely i know both you and nurse eden ive been speaking to her are perfectly trustworthy and i can rely on you not to say anythingyet at least it is no good to stir up people unless  oh i never doanyhow said mary and dr hennis went on to the county town  after all she told herself it might just possibly have been the collapse of the old stable that had done all those things to poor little edna she was sorry she had even hinted at other things but nurse eden was discretion itself by the time she reached home the affair seemed increasingly remote by its very monstrosity as she came in miss fowler told her that a couple of aeroplanes had passed half an hour ago  i thought i heard them she replied im going down to the garden now ive got the paraffin  yes butwhat have you got on your boots theyre soaking wet change them at once  not only did mary obey but she wrapped the boots in a newspaper and put them into the string bag with the bottle so armed with the longest kitchen poker she left  its raining again was miss fowlers last word buti know you wont be happy till thats disposed of  it wont take long ive got everything down there and ive put the lid on the destructor to keep the wet out  the shrubbery was filling with twilight by the time she had completed her arrangements and sprinkled the sacrificial oil as she lit the match that would burn her heart to ashes she heard a groan or a grunt behind the dense portugal laurels  cheape she called impatiently but cheape with his ancient lumbago in his comfortable cottage would be the last man to profane the sanctuary sheep she concluded and threw in the fusee the pyre went up in a roar and the immediate flame hastened night around her  how wynn would have loved this she thought stepping back from the blaze  by its light she saw half hidden behind a laurel not five paces away a bareheaded man sitting very stiffly at the foot of one of the oaks a broken branch lay across his lapone booted leg protruding from beneath it his head moved ceaselessly from side to side but his body was as still as the trees trunk he was dressedshe moved sideways to look more closelyin a uniform something like wynns with a flap buttoned across the chest for an instant she had some idea that it might be one of the young flying men she had met at the funeral but their heads were dark and glossy this mans was as pale as a babys and so closely cropped that she could see the disgusting pinky skin beneath his lips moved  what do you say mary moved towards him and stooped  laty laty laty he muttered while his hands picked at the dead wet leaves there was no doubt as to his nationality it made her so angry that she strode back to the destructor though it was still too hot to use the poker there wynns books seemed to be catching well she looked up at the oak behind the man several of the light upper and two or three rotten lower branches had broken and scattered their rubbish on the shrubbery path on the lowest fork a helmet with dependent strings showed like a birdsnest in the light of a longtongued flame evidently this person had fallen through the tree wynn had told her that it was quite possible for people to fall out of aeroplanes wynn told her too that trees were useful things to break an aviators fall but in this case the aviator must have been broken or he would have moved from his queer position he seemed helpless except for his horrible rolling head on the other hand she could see a pistol case at his beltand mary loathed pistols months ago after reading certain belgian reports together she and miss fowler had had dealings with onea huge revolver with flatnosed bullets which latter wynn said were forbidden by the rules of war to be used against civilised enemies theyre good enough for us miss fowler had replied show mary how it works and wynn laughing at the mere possibility of any such need had led the craven winking mary into the rectors disused quarry and had shown her how to fire the terrible machine it lay now in the toplefthand drawer of her toilettablea memento not included in the burning wynn would be pleased to see how she was not afraid  she slipped up to the house to get it when she came through the rain the eyes in the head were alive with expectation the mouth even tried to smile but at sight of the revolver its corners went down just like edna gerritts a tear trickled from one eye and the head rolled from shoulder to shoulder as though trying to point out something  cassÃ©e tout cassÃ©e it whimpered  what do you say said mary disgustedly keeping well to one side though only the head moved  cassÃ©e it repeated che me rends le mÃ©dicin toctor  nein said she bringing all her small german to bear with the big pistol ich haben der todt kinder gesehn  the head was still marys hand dropped she had been careful to keep her finger off the trigger for fear of accidents after a few moments waiting she returned to the destructor where the flames were falling and churned up wynns charring books with the poker again the head groaned for the doctor  stop that said mary and stamped her foot stop that you bloody pagan  the words came quite smoothly and naturally they were wynns own words and wynn was a gentleman who for no consideration on earth would have torn little edna into those vividly coloured strips and strings but this thing hunched under the oaktree had done that thing it was no question of reading horrors out of newspapers to miss fowler mary had seen it with her own eyes on the royal oak kitchen table she must not allow her mind to dwell upon it now wynn was dead and everything connected with him was lumping and rustling and tinkling under her busy poker into red black dust and grey leaves of ash the thing beneath the oak would die too mary had seen death more than once she came of a family that had a knack of dying under as she told miss fowler most distressing circumstances she would stay where she was till she was entirely satisfied that it was deaddead as dear papa in the late eighties aunt mary in eightynine mamma in ninetyone cousin dick in ninetyfive lady mccauslands housemaid in ninetynine lady mccauslands sister in nineteen hundred and one wynn buried five days ago and edna gerritt still waiting for decent earth to hide her as she thoughther underlip caught up by one faded canine brows knit and nostrils wideshe wielded the poker with lunges that jarred the grating at the bottom and careful scrapes round the brickwork above she looked at her wristwatch it was getting on to halfpast four and the rain was coming down in earnest tea would be at five if it did not die before that time she would be soaked and would have to change meantime and this occupied her wynns things were burning well in spite of the hissing wet though now and again a bookback with a quite distinguishable title would be heaved up out of the mass the exercise of stoking had given her a glow which seemed to reach to the marrow of her bones she hummedmary never had a voiceto herself she had never believed in all those advanced viewsthough miss fowler herself leaned a little that wayof womans work in the world but now she saw there was much to be said for them this for instance was her workwork which no man least of all dr hennis would ever have done a man at such a crisis would be what wynn called a sportsman would leave everything to fetch help and would certainly bring it into the house now a womans business was to make a happy home forfor a husband and children failing theseit was not a thing one should allow ones mind to dwell uponbut  stop it mary cried once more across the shadows nein i tell you ich haben der todt kinder gesehn  but it was a fact a woman who had missed these things could still be usefulmore useful than a man in certain respects she thumped like a pavior through the settling ashes at the secret thrill of it the rain was damping the fire but she could feelit was too dark to seethat her work was done there was a dull red glow at the bottom of the destructor not enough to char the wooden lid if she slipped it half over against the driving wet this arranged she leaned on the poker and waited while an increasing rapture laid hold on her she ceased to think she gave herself up to feel her long pleasure was broken by a sound that she had waited for in agony several times in her life she leaned forward and listened smiling there could be no mistake she closed her eyes and drank it in once it ceased abruptly  go on she murmured half aloud that isnt the end  then the end came very distinctly in a lull between two raingusts mary postgate drew her breath short between her teeth and shivered from head to foot thats all right said she contentedly and went up to the house where she scandalised the whole routine by taking a luxurious hot bath before tea and came down looking as miss fowler said when she saw her lying all relaxed on the other sofa quite handsome          the beginnings       it was not part of their blood        it came to them very late      with long arrears to make good        when the english began to hate       they were not easily moved        they were icy willing to wait      till every count should be proved        ere the english began to hate       their voices were even and low        their eyes were level and straight      there was neither sign nor show        when the english began to hate       it was not preached to the crowd        it was not taught by the state      no man spoke it aloud        when the english began to hate       it was not suddenly bred        it will not swiftly abate      through the chill years ahead        when time shall count from the date        that the english began to hate
