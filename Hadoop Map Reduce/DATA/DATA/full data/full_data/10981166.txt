that cease   and so was england born  she is not any common earth   water or wood or air but merlins isle of gramarye   where you and i will fare   the children were at the theatre acting to three cows as much as they could remember of midsummer nights dream their father had made them a small play out of the big shakespeare one and they had rehearsed it with him and with their mother till they could say it by heart they began when nick bottom the weaver comes out of the bushes with a donkeys head on his shoulders and finds titania queen of the fairies asleep then they skipped to the part where bottom asks three little fairies to scratch his head and bring him honey and they ended where he falls asleep in titanias arms dan was puck and nick bottom as well as all three fairies he wore a pointyeared cloth cap for puck and a paper donkeys head out of a christmas crackerbut it tore if you were not carefulfor bottom una was titania with a wreath of columbines and a foxglove wand  the theatre lay in a meadow called the long slip a little millstream carrying water to a mill two or three fields away bent round one corner of it and in the middle of the bend lay a large old fairy ring of darkened grass which was the stage the millstream banks overgrown with willow hazel and guelderrose made convenient places to wait in till your turn came and a grownup who had seen it said that shakespeare himself could not have imagined a more suitable setting for his play they were not of course allowed to act on midsummer night itself but they went down after tea on midsummer eve when the shadows were growing and they took their supperhardboiled eggs bath oliver biscuits and salt in an envelopewith them three cows had been milked and were grazing steadily with a tearing noise that one could hear all down the meadow and the noise of the mill at work sounded like bare feet running on hard ground a cuckoo sat on a gatepost singing his broken june tune cuckoocuk while a busy kingfisher crossed from the millstream to the brook which ran on the other side of the meadow everything else was a sort of thick sleepy stillness smelling of meadowsweet and dry grass  their play went beautifully dan remembered all his partspuck bottom and the three fairiesand una never forgot a word of titanianot even the difficult piece where she tells the fairies how to feed bottom with apricocks green figs and dewberries and all the lines end in ies they were both so pleased that they acted it three times over from beginning to end before they sat down in the unthistly centre of the ring to eat eggs and bath olivers this was when they heard a whistle among the alders on the bank and they jumped  the bushes parted in the very spot where dan had stood as puck they saw a small brown broadshouldered pointyeared person with a snub nose slanting blue eyes and a grin that ran right across his freckled face he shaded his forehead as though he were watching quince snout bottom and the others rehearsing pyramus and thisbe and in a voice as deep as three cows asking to be milked he began  what hempen homespuns have we swaggering here so near the cradle of our fairy queen  he stopped hollowed one hand round his ear and with a wicked twinkle in his eye went on  what a play toward ill be auditor an actor too perhaps if i see cause  the children looked and gasped the small thinghe was no taller than dans shoulderstepped quietly into the ring  im rather out of practice said he but thats the way my part ought to be played  still the children stared at himfrom his darkblue cap like a big columbine flower to his bare hairy feet at last he laughed  please dont look like that it isnt my fault what else could you expect he said  we didnt expect any one dan answered slowly this is our field  is it said their visitor sitting down then what on human earth made you act midsummer nights dream three times over on midsummer eve in the middle of a ring and underright under one of my oldest hills in old england pooks hillpucks hillpucks hillpooks hill its as plain as the nose on my face  he pointed to the bare ferncovered slope of pooks hill that runs up from the far side of the millstream to a dark wood beyond that wood the ground rises and rises for five hundred feet till at last you climb out on the bare top of beacon hill to look over the pevensey levels and the channel and half the naked south downs  by oak ash and thorn he cried still laughing if this had happened a few hundred years ago youd have had all the people of the hills out like bees in june  we didnt know it was wrong said dan  wrong the little fellow shook with laughter indeed it isnt wrong youve done something that kings and knights and scholars in old days would have given their crowns and spurs and books to find out if merlin himself had helped you you couldnt have managed better youve broken the hillsyouve broken the hills it hasnt happened in a thousand years  wewe didnt mean to said una  of course you didnt thats just why you did it unluckily the hills are empty now and all the people of the hills are gone im the only one left im puck the oldest old thing in england very much at your service ifif you care to have anything to do with me if you dont of course youve only to say so and ill go  he looked at the children and the children looked at him for quite half a minute his eyes did not twinkle any more they were very kind and there was the beginning of a good smile on his lips  una put out her hand dont go she said we like you  have a bath oliver said dan and he passed over the squashy envelope with the eggs  by oak ash and thorn cried puck taking off his blue cap i like you too sprinkle a plenty salt on the biscuit dan and ill eat it with you thatll show you the sort of person i am some of ushe went on with his mouth fullcouldnt abide salt or horseshoes over a door or mountainash berries or running water or cold iron or the sound of church bells but im puck  he brushed the crumbs carefully from his doublet and shook hands  we always said dan and i una stammered that if it ever happened wed know exactly what to do butbut now it seems all different somehow  she means meeting a fairy said dan i never believed in emnot after i was six anyhow  i did said una at least i sort of half believed till we learned farewell rewards do you know farewell rewards and fairies  do you mean this said puck he threw his big head back and began at the second line    good housewives now may say for now foul sluts in dairies   do fare as well as they and though they sweep their hearths no less  join in una  than maids were wont to do yet who of late for cleanliness finds sixpence in her shoe  the echoes flapped all along the flat meadow  of course i know it he said  and then theres the verse about the rings said dan when i was little it always made me feel unhappy in my inside  witness those rings and roundelays do you mean boomed puck with a voice like a great church organ    of theirs which yet remain were footed in queen marys days   on many a grassy plain but since of late elizabeth   and later james came in are never seen on any heath   as when the time hath been  its some time since i heard that sung but theres no good beating about the bush its true the people of the hills have all left i saw them come into old england and i saw them go giants trolls kelpies brownies goblins imps wood tree mound and water spirits heathpeople hillwatchers treasureguards good people little people pishogues leprechauns nightriders pixies nixies gnomes and the restgone all gone i came into england with oak ash and thorn and when oak ash and thorn are gone i shall go too  dan looked round the meadowat unas oak by the lower gate at the line of ash trees that overhang otter pool where the millstream spills over when the mill does not need it and at the gnarled old whitethorn where three cows scratched their necks  its all right he said and added im planting a lot of acorns this autumn too  then arent you most awfully old said una  not oldfairly longlived as folk say hereabouts let me seemy friends used to set my dish of cream for me o nights when stonehenge was new yes before the flint men made the dewpond under chanctonbury ring  una clasped her hands cried oh and nodded her head  shes thought a plan dan explained she always does like that when she thinks a plan  i was thinkingsuppose we saved some of our porridge and put it in the attic for you theyd notice if we left it in the nursery  schoolroom said dan quickly and una flushed because they had made a solemn treaty that summer not to call the schoolroom the nursery any more  bless your heart o gold said puck youll make a fine considering wench some marketday i really dont want you to put out a bowl for me but if ever i need a bite be sure ill tell you  he stretched himself at length on the dry grass and the children stretched out beside him their bare legs waving happily in the air they felt they could not be afraid of him any more than of their particular friend old hobden the hedger he did not bother them with grownup questions or laugh at the donkeys head but lay and smiled to himself in the most sensible way  have you a knife on you he said at last  dan handed over his big onebladed outdoor knife and puck began to carve out a piece of turf from the centre of the ring  whats that formagic said una as he pressed up the square of chocolate loam that cut like so much cheese  one of my little magics he answered and cut another you see i cant let you into the hills because the people of the hills have gone but if you care to take seizin from me i may be able to show you something out of the common here on human earth you certainly deserve it  whats taking seizin said dan cautiously  its an old custom the people had when they bought and sold land they used to cut out a clod and hand it over to the buyer and you werent lawfully seized of your landit didnt really belong to youtill the other fellow had actually given you a piece of itlike this he held out the turves  but its our own meadow said dan drawing back are you going to magic it away  puck laughed i know its your meadow but theres a great deal more in it than you or your father ever guessed try  he turned his eyes on una  ill do it she said dan followed her example at once  now are you two lawfully seized and possessed of all old england began puck in a singsong voice by right of oak ash and thorn are you free to come and go and look and know where i shall show or best you please you shall see what you shall see and you shall hear what you shall hear though it shall have happened three thousand year and you shall know neither doubt nor fear fast hold fast all i give you  the children shut their eyes but nothing happened  well said una disappointedly opening them i thought there would be dragons  though it shall have happened three thousand year said puck and counted on his fingers no im afraid there were no dragons three thousand years ago  but there hasnt happened anything at all said dan  wait awhile said puck you dont grow an oak in a yearand old englands older than twenty oaks lets sit down again and think i can do that for a century at a time  ah but youre a fairy said dan  have you ever heard me say that word yet said puck quickly  no you talk about the people of the hills but you never say fairies said una i was wondering at that dont you like it  how would you like to be called mortal or human being all the time said puck or son of adam or daughter of eve  i shouldnt like it at all said dan thats how the djinns and afrits talk in the arabian nights  and thats how i feel about sayingthat word that i dont say besides what you call them are madeup things the people of the hills have never heard oflittle buzzflies with butterfly wings and gauze petticoats and shiny stars in their hair and a wand like a schoolteachers cane for punishing bad boys and rewarding good ones i know em  we dont mean that sort said dan we hate em too  exactly said puck can you wonder that the people of the hills dont care to be confused with that paintywinged wandwaving sugarandshakeyourhead set of impostors butterfly wings indeed ive seen sir huon and a troop of his people setting off from tintagel castle for hybrasil in the teeth of a souwesterly gale with the spray flying all over the castle and the horses of the hills wild with fright out theyd go in a lull screaming like gulls and back theyd be driven five good miles inland before they could come head to wind again butterflywings it was magicmagic as black as merlin could make it and the whole sea was green fire and white foam with singing mermaids in it and the horses of the hills picked their way from one wave to another by the lightning flashes that was how it was in the old days  splendid said dan but una shuddered  im glad theyre gone then but what made the people of the hills go away una asked  different things ill tell you one of them some daythe thing that made the biggest flit of any said puck but they didnt all flit at once they dropped off one by one through the centuries most of them were foreigners who couldnt stand our climate they flitted early  how early said dan  a couple of thousand years or more the fact is they began as gods the phoenicians brought some over when they came to buy tin and the gauls and the jutes and the danes and the frisians and the angles brought more when they landed they were always landing in those days or being driven back to their ships and they always brought their gods with them england is a bad country for gods now i began as i mean to go on a bowl of porridge a dish of milk and a little quiet fun with the country folk in the lanes was enough for me then as it is now i belong here you see and i have been mixed up with people all my days but most of the others insisted on being gods and having temples and altars and priests and sacrifices of their own  people burned in wicker baskets said dan like miss blake tells us about  all sorts of sacrifices said puck if it wasnt men it was horses or cattle or pigs or metheglinthats a sticky sweet sort of beer i never liked it they were a stiffnecked extravagant set of idols the old things but what was the result men dont like being sacrificed at the best of times they dont even like sacrificing their farmhorses after a while men simply left the old things alone and the roofs of their temples fell in and the old things had to scuttle out and pick up a living as they could some of them took to hanging about trees and hiding in graves and groaning o nights if they groaned loud enough and long enough they might frighten a poor countryman into sacrificing a hen or leaving a pound of butter for them i remember one goddess called belisama she became a common wet waterspirit somewhere in lancashire and there were hundreds of other friends of mine first they were gods then they were people of the hills and then they flitted to other places because they couldnt get on with the english for one reason or another there was only one old thing i remember who honestly worked for his living after he came down in the world he was called weland and he was a smith to some gods ive forgotten their names but he used to make them swords and spears i think he claimed kin with thor of the scandinavians  heroes of asgard thor said una she had been reading the book  perhaps answered puck none the less when bad times came he didnt beg or steal he worked and i was lucky enough to be able to do him a good turn  tell us about it said dan i think i like hearing of old things  they rearranged themselves comfortably each chewing a grass stem puck propped himself on one strong arm and went on  lets think i met weland first on a november afternoon in a sleet storm on pevensey level  pevensey over the hill you mean dan pointed south  yes but it was all marsh in those days right up to horsebridge and hydeneye i was on beacon hillthey called it brunanburgh thenwhen i saw the pale flame that burning thatch makes and i went down to look some piratesi think they must have been peofns menwere burning a village on the levels and welands imagea big black wooden thing with amber beads round his necklay in the bows of a black thirtytwooar galley that they had just beached bitter cold it was there were icicles hanging from her deck and the oars were glazed over with ice and there was ice on welands lips when he saw me he began a long chant in his own tongue telling me how he was going to rule england and how i should smell the smoke of his altars from lincolnshire to the isle of wight i didnt care id seen too many gods charging into old england to be upset about it i let him sing himself out while his men were burning the village and then i said i dont know what put it into my head smith of the gods i said the time comes when i shall meet you plying your trade for hire by the wayside  what did weland say said una was he angry  he called me names and rolled his eyes and i went away to wake up the people inland but the pirates conquered the country and for centuries weland was a most important god he had temples everywherefrom lincolnshire to the isle of wight as he saidand his sacrifices were simply scandalous to do him justice he preferred horses to men but men or horses i knew that presently hed have to come down in the worldlike the other old things i gave him lots of timei gave him about a thousand yearsand at the end of em i went into one of his temples near andover to see how he prospered there was his altar and there was his image and there were his priests and there were the congregation and everybody seemed quite happy except weland and the priests in the old days the congregation were unhappy until the priests had chosen their sacrifices and so would you have been when the service began a priest rushed out dragged a man up to the altar pretended to hit him on the head with a little gilt axe and the man fell down and pretended to die then everybody shouted a sacrifice to weland a sacrifice to weland  and the man wasnt really dead said una  not a bit all as much pretence as a dolls teaparty then they brought out a splendid white horse and the priest cut some hair from its mane and tail and burned it on the altar shouting a sacrifice that counted the same as if a man and a horse had been killed i saw poor welands face through the smoke and i couldnt help laughing he looked so disgusted and so hungry and all he had to satisfy himself was a horrid smell of burning hair just a dolls teaparty  i judged it better not to say anything then twouldnt have been fair and the next time i came to andover a few hundred years later weland and his temple were gone and there was a christian bishop in a church there none of the people of the hills could tell me anything about him and i supposed that he had left england puck turned lay on the other elbow and thought for a long time  lets see he said at last it must have been some few years latera year or two before the conquest i thinkthat i came back to pooks hill here and one evening i heard old hobden talking about welands ford  if you mean old hobden the hedger hes only seventytwo he told me so himself said dan hes a intimate friend of ours  youre quite right puck replied i meant old hobdens ninth greatgrandfather he was a free man and burned charcoal hereabouts ive known the family father and son so long that i get confused sometimes hob of the dene was my hobdens name and he lived at the forge cottage of course i pricked up my ears when i heard weland mentioned and i scuttled through the woods to the ford just beyond bog wood yonder he jerked his head westward where the valley narrows between wooded hills and steep hopfields  why thats willingford bridge said una we go there for walks often theres a kingfisher there  it was welands ford then dear a road led down to it from the beacon on the top of the hilla shocking bad road it wasand all the hillside was thick thick oakforest with deer in it there was no trace of weland but presently i saw a fat old farmer riding down from the beacon under the greenwood tree his horse had cast a shoe in the clay and when he came to the ford he dismounted took a penny out of his purse laid it on a stone tied the old horse to an oak and called out smith smith here is work for you then he sat down and went to sleep you can imagine how i felt when i saw a whitebearded bent old blacksmith in a leather apron creep out from behind the oak and begin to shoe the horse it was weland himself i was so astonished that i jumped out and said what on human earth are you doing here weland  poor weland sighed una  he pushed the long hair back from his forehead he didnt recognize me at first then he said you ought to know you foretold it old thing im shoeing horses for hire im not even weland now he said they call me waylandsmith  poor chap said dan what did you say  what could i say he looked up with the horses foot on his lap and he said smiling i remember the time when i wouldnt have accepted this old bag of bones as a sacrifice and now im glad enough to shoe him for a penny  isnt there any way for you to get back to valhalla or wherever you come from i said  im afraid not he said rasping away at the hoof he had a wonderful touch with horses the old beast was whinnying on his shoulder you may remember that i was not a gentle god in my day and my time and my power i shall never be released till some human being truly wishes me well  surely said i the farmer cant do less than that youre shoeing the horse all round for him  yes said he and my nails will hold a shoe from one full moon to the next but farmers and weald clay said he are both uncommon cold and sour  would you believe it that when that farmer woke and found his horse shod he rode away without one word of thanks i was so angry that i wheeled his horse right round and walked him back three miles to the beacon just to teach the old sinner politeness  were you invisible said una puck nodded gravely  the beacon was always laid in those days ready to light in case the french landed at pevensey and i walked the horse about and about it that leelong summer night the farmer thought he was bewitchedwell he was of courseand began to pray and shout i didnt care i was as good a christian as he any fairday in the county and about four oclock in the morning a young novice came along from the monastery that used to stand on the top of beacon hill  whats a novice said dan  it really means a man who is beginning to be a monk but in those days people sent their sons to a monastery just the same as a school this young fellow had been to a monastery in france for a few months every year and he was finishing his studies in the monastery close to his home here hugh was his name and he had got up to go fishing hereabouts his people owned all this valley hugh heard the farmer shouting and asked him what in the world he meant the old man spun him a wonderful tale about fairies and goblins and witches and i know he hadnt seen a thing except rabbits and red deer all that night the people of the hills are like ottersthey dont show except when they choose but the novice wasnt a fool he looked down at the horses feet and saw the new shoes fastened as only weland knew how to fasten em weland had a way of turning down the nails that folks called the smiths clinch  hm said the novice where did you get your horse shod  the farmer wouldnt tell him at first because the priests never liked their people to have any dealings with the old things at last he confessed that the smith had done it what did you pay him said the novice penny said the farmer very sulkily thats less than a christian would have charged said the novice i hope you threw a thank you into the bargain no said the farmer waylandsmiths a heathen heathen or no heathen said the novice you took his help and where you get help there you must give thanks what said the farmerhe was in a furious temper because i was walking the old horse in circles all this timewhat you young jackanapes said he then by your reasoning i ought to say thank you to satan if he helped me dont roll about up there splitting reasons with me said the novice come back to the ford and thank the smith or youll be sorry  back the farmer had to go i led the horse though no one saw me and the novice walked beside us his gown swishing through the shiny dew and his fishingrod across his shoulders spearwise when we reached the ford againit was five oclock and misty still under the oaksthe farmer simply wouldnt say thank you he said hed tell the abbot that the novice wanted him to worship heathen gods then hugh the novice lost his temper he just cried out put his arm under the farmers fat leg and heaved him from his saddle on to the turf and before he could rise he caught him by the back of the neck and shook him like a rat till the farmer growled thank you waylandsmith  did weland see all this said dan  oh yes and he shouted his old warcry when the farmer thudded on to the ground he was delighted then the novice turned to the oak tree and said ho smith of the gods i am ashamed of this rude farmer but for all you have done in kindness and charity to him and to others of our people i thank you and wish you well then he picked up his fishingrodit looked more like a tall spear than everand tramped off down your valley  and what did poor weland do said una  he laughed and he cried with joy because he had been released at last and could go away but he was an honest old thing he had worked for his living and he paid his debts before he left i shall give that novice a gift said weland a gift that shall do him good the wide world over and old england after him blow up my fire old thing while i get the iron for my last task then he made a sworda darkgrey wavylined swordand i blew the fire while he hammered by oak ash and thorn i tell you weland was a smith of the gods he cooled that sword in running water twice and the third time he cooled it in the evening dew and he laid it out in the moonlight and said runes thats charms over it and he carved runes of prophecy on the blade old thing he said to me wiping his forehead this is the best blade that weland ever made even the user will never know how good it is come to the monastery  we went to the dormitory where the monks slept we saw the novice fast asleep in his cot and weland put the sword into his hand and i remember the young fellow gripped it in his sleep then weland strode as far as he dared into the chapel and threw down all his shoeingtoolshis hammers and pincers and raspsto show that he had done with them for ever it sounded like suits of armour falling and the sleepy monks ran in for they thought the monastery had been attacked by the french the novice came first of all waving his new sword and shouting saxon battlecries when they saw the shoeingtools they were very bewildered till the novice asked leave to speak and told what he had done to the farmer and what he had said to waylandsmith and how though the dormitory light was burning he had found the wonderful runecarved sword in his cot  the abbot shook his head at first and then he laughed and said to the novice son hugh it needed no sign from a heathen god to show me that you will never be a monk take your sword and keep your sword and go with your sword and be as gentle as you are strong and courteous we will hang up the smiths tools before the altar he said because whatever the smith of the gods may have been in the old days we know that he worked honestly for his living and made gifts to mother church then they went to bed again all except the novice and he sat up in the garth playing with his sword then weland said to me by the stables farewell old thing you had the right of it you saw me come to england and you see me go farewell  with that he strode down the hill to the corner of the great woodswoods corner you call it nowto the very place where he had first landedand i heard him moving through the thickets towards horsebridge for a little and then he was gone that was how it happened i saw it  both children drew a long breath  but what happened to hugh the novice said una  and the sword said dan  puck looked down the meadow that lay all quiet and cool in the shadow of pooks hill a corncrake jarred in a hayfield near by and the small trouts of the brook began to jump a big white moth flew unsteadily from the alders and flapped round the childrens heads and the least little haze of watermist rose from the brook  do you really want to know puck said  we do cried the children awfully  very good i promised you that you shall see what you shall see and you shall hear what you shall hear though it shall have happened three thousand year but just now it seems to me that unless you go back to the house people will be looking for you ill walk with you as far as the gate  will you be here when we come again they asked  surely surely said puck ive been here some time already one minute first please  he gave them each three leavesone of oak one of ash and one of thorn  bite these said he otherwise you might be talking at home of what youve seen and heard andif i know human beingstheyd send for the doctor bite  they bit hard and found themselves walking side by side to the lower gate their father was leaning over it  and how did your play go he asked  oh splendidly said dan only afterwards i think we went to sleep it was very hot and quiet dont you remember una  una shook her head and said nothing  i see said her father  latelate in the evening kilmeny came home for kilmeny had been she could not tell where and kilmeny had seen what she could not declare  but why are you chewing leaves at your time of life daughter for fun  no it was for something but i cant azactly remember said una  and neither of them could till    a tree song   of all the trees that grow so fair   old england to adorn greater are none beneath the sun   than oak and ash and thorn sing oak and ash and thorn good sirs   all of a midsummer morn surely we sing no little thing   in oak and ash and thorn  oak of the clay lived many a day   or ever Æneas began ash of the loam was a lady at home   when brut was an outlaw man thorn of the down saw new troy town   from which was london born witness hereby the ancientry   of oak and ash and thorn  yew that is old in churchyard mould   he breedeth a mighty bow alder for shoes do wise men choose   and beech for

 good news for cattle and corn now is the sun come up from the south   with oak and ash and thorn  sing oak and ash and thorn good sirs   all of a midsummer morn england shall bide till judgement tide   by oak and ash and thorn     young men at the manor   they were fishing a few days later in the bed of the brook that for centuries had cut deep into the soft valley soil the trees closing overhead made long tunnels through which the sunshine worked in blobs and patches down in the tunnels were bars of sand and gravel old roots and trunks covered with moss or painted red by the irony water foxgloves growing lean and pale towards the light clumps of fern and thirsty shy flowers who could not live away from moisture and shade in the pools you could see the wave thrown up by the trouts as they charged hither and yon and the pools were joined to each otherexcept in flood time when all was one brown rushby sheets of thin broken water that poured themselves chuckling round the darkness of the next bend  this was one of the childrens most secret huntinggrounds and their particular friend old hobden the hedger had shown them how to use it except for the click of a rod hitting a low willow or a switch and tussle among the young ashleaves as a line hung up for the minute nobody in the hot pasture could have guessed what game was going on among the trouts below the banks  weve got halfadozen said dan after a warm wet hour i vote we go up to stone bay and try long pool  una noddedmost of her talk was by nodsand they crept from the gloom of the tunnels towards the tiny weir that turns the brook into the millstream here the banks are low and bare and the glare of the afternoon sun on the long pool below the weir makes your eyes ache  when they were in the open they nearly fell down with astonishment a huge grey horse whose tailhairs crinkled the glassy water was drinking in the pool and the ripples about his muzzle flashed like melted gold on his back sat an old whitehaired man dressed in a loose glimmery gown of chainmail he was bareheaded and a nutshaped iron helmet hung at his saddlebow his reins were of red leather five or six inches deep scalloped at the edges and his high padded saddle with its red girths was held fore and aft by a red leather breastband and crupper  look said una as though dan were not staring his very eyes out its like the picture in your roomsir isumbras at the ford  the rider turned towards them and his thin long face was just as sweet and gentle as that of the knight who carries the children in that picture  they should be here now sir richard said pucks deep voice among the willowherb  they are here the knight said and he smiled at dan with the string of trouts in his hand there seems no great change in boys since mine fished this water  if your horse has drunk we shall be more at ease in the ring said puck and he nodded to the children as though he had never magicked away their memories a week before  the great horse turned and hoisted himself into the pasture with a kick and a scramble that tore the clods down rattling  your pardon said sir richard to dan when these lands were mine i never loved that mounted men should cross the brook except by the paved ford but my swallow here was thirsty and i wished to meet you  were very glad youve come sir said dan it doesnt matter in the least about the banks  he trotted across the pasture on the sword side of the mighty horse and it was a mighty ironhandled sword that swung from sir richards belt una walked behind with puck she remembered everything now  im sorry about the leaves he said but it would never have done if you had gone home and told would it  i spose not una answered but you said that all the fairpeople of the hills had left england  so they have but i told you that you should come and go and look and know didnt i the knight isnt a fairy hes sir richard dalyngridge a very old friend of mine he came over with william the conqueror and he wants to see you particularly  what for said una  on account of your great wisdom and learning puck replied without a twinkle  us said una why i dont know my nine timesnot to say it dodging and dan makes the most awful mess of fractions he cant mean us  una dan called back sir richard says he is going to tell what happened to welands sword hes got it isnt it splendid  naynay said sir richard dismounting as they reached the ring in the bend of the millstream bank it is you that must tell me for i hear the youngest child in our england today is as wise as our wisest clerk he slipped the bit out of swallows mouth dropped the rubyred reins over his head and the wise horse moved off to graze  sir richard they noticed he limped a little unslung his great sword  thats it dan whispered to una  this is the sword that brother hugh had from waylandsmith sir richard said once he gave it me but i would not take it but at the last it became mine after such a fight as never christened man fought see he half drew it from its sheath and turned it before them on either side just below the handle where the runic letters shivered as though they were alive were two deep gouges in the dull deadly steel now what thing made those said he i know not but you perhaps can say  tell them all the tale sir richard said puck it concerns their land somewhat  yes from the very beginning una pleaded for the knights good face and the smile on it more than ever reminded her of sir isumbras at the ford  they settled down to listen sir richard bareheaded to the sunshine dandling the sword in both hands while the grey horse cropped outside the ring and the helmet on the saddlebow clinged softly each time he jerked his head  from the beginning then sir richard said since it concerns your land i will tell the tale when our duke came out of normandy to take his england great knights have ye heard came and strove hard to serve the duke because he promised them lands here and small knights followed the great ones my folk in normandy were poor but a great knight engerrard of the eagleengenulf de aquilawho was kin to my father followed the earl of mortain who followed william the duke and i followed de aquila yes with thirty menatarms out of my fathers house and a new sword i set out to conquer england three days after i was made knight i did not then know that england would conquer me we went up to santlache with the resta very great host of us  does that mean the battle of hastingsten sixtysix una whispered and puck nodded so as not to interrupt  at santlache over the hill yonderhe pointed southeastward towards fairlightwe found harolds men we fought at the days end they ran my men went with de aquilas to chase and plunder and in that chase engerrard of the eagle was slain and his son gilbert took his banner and his men forward this i did not know till after for swallow here was cut in the flank so i stayed to wash the wound at a brook by a thorn there a single saxon cried out to me in french and we fought together i should have known his voice but we fought together for a long time neither had any advantage till by pure illfortune his foot slipped and his sword flew from his hand now i had but newly been made knight and wished above all to be courteous and fameworthy so i forbore to strike and bade him get his sword again a plague on my sword said he it has lost me my first fight you have spared my life take my sword he held it out to me but as i stretched my hand the sword groaned like a stricken man and i leaped back crying sorcery  the children looked at the sword as though it might speak again  suddenly a clump of saxons ran out upon me and seeing a norman alone would have killed me but my saxon cried out that i was his prisoner and beat them off thus see you he saved my life he put me on my horse and led me through the woods ten long miles to this valley  to here dyou mean said una  to this very valley we came in by the lower ford under the kings hill yonderhe pointed eastward where the valley widens  and was that saxon hugh the novice dan asked  yes and more than that he had been for three years at the monastery at bec by rouen wheresir richard chuckledthe abbot herluin would not suffer me to remain  why wouldnt he said dan  because i rode my horse into the refectory when the scholars were at meat to show the saxon boys we normans were not afraid of an abbot it was that very saxon hugh tempted me to do it and we had not met since that day i thought i knew his voice even inside my helmet and for all that our lords fought we each rejoiced we had not slain the other he walked by my side and he told me how a heathen god as he believed had given him his sword but he said he had never heard it sing before i remember i warned him to beware of sorcery and quick enchantments sir richard smiled to himself i was very youngvery young  when we came to his house here we had almost forgotten that we had been at blows it was near midnight and the great hall was full of men and women waiting news there i first saw his sister the lady Ælueva of whom he had spoken to us in france she cried out fiercely at me and would have had me hanged in that hour but her brother said that i had spared his lifehe said not how he saved mine from the saxonsand that our duke had won the day and even while they wrangled over my poor body of a sudden he fell down in a swoon from his wounds  this is thy fault said the lady Ælueva to me and she kneeled above him and called for wine and cloths  if i had known i answered he should have ridden and i walked but he set me on my horse he made no complaint he walked beside me and spoke merrily throughout i pray i have done him no harm  thou hast need to pray she said catching up her underlip if he dies thou shalt hang  they bore off hugh to his chamber but three tall men of the house bound me and set me under the beam of the great hall with a rope round my neck the end of the rope they flung over the beam and they sat them down by the fire to wait word whether hugh lived or died they cracked nuts with their knifehilts the while  and how did you feel said dan  very weary but i did heartily pray for my schoolmate hugh his health about noon i heard horses in the valley and the three men loosed my ropes and fled out and de aquilas men rode up gilbert de aquila came with them for it was his boast that like his father he forgot no man that served him he was little like his father but terrible with a nose like an eagles nose and yellow eyes like an eagle he rode tall warhorsesroans which he bred himselfand he could never abide to be helped into the saddle he saw the rope hanging from the beam and laughed and his men laughed for i was too stiff to rise  this is poor entertainment for a norman knight he said but such as it is let us be grateful show me boy to whom thou owest most and we will pay them out of hand  what did he mean to kill em said dan  assuredly but i looked at the lady Ælueva where she stood among her maids and her brother beside her de aquilas men had driven them all into the great hall  was she pretty said una  in all my long life i have never seen woman fit to strew rushes before my lady Ælueva the knight replied quite simply and quietly as i looked at her i thought i might save her and her house by a jest  seeing that i came somewhat hastily and without warning said i to de aquila i have no fault to find with the courtesy that these saxons have shown me but my voice shook it isit was not good to jest with that little man  all were silent awhile till de aquila laughed look mena miracle said he the fight is scarce sped my father is not yet buried and here we find our youngest knight already set down in his manor while his saxonsye can see it in their fat faceshave paid him homage and service by the saints he said rubbing his nose i never thought england would be so easy won surely i can do no less than give the lad what he has taken this manor shall be thine boy he said till i come again or till thou art slain now mount men and ride we follow our duke into kent to make him king of england  he drew me with him to the door while they brought his horsea lean roan taller than my swallow here but not so well girthed  hark to me he said fretting with his great wargloves i have given thee this manor which is a saxon hornets nest and i think thou wilt be slain in a monthas my father was slain yet if thou canst keep the roof on the hall the thatch on the barn and the plough in the furrow till i come back thou shalt hold the manor from me for the duke has promised our earl mortain all the lands by pevensey and mortain will give me of them what he would have given my father god knows if thou or i shall live till england is won but remember boy that here and now fighting is foolishness andhe reached for the reinscraft and cunning is all  alas i have no cunning said i  not yet said he hopping abroad foot in stirrup and poking his horse in the belly with his toe not yet but i think thou hast a good teacher farewell hold the manor and live lose the manor and hang he said and spurred out his shieldstraps squeaking behind him  so children here was i little more than a boy and santlache fight not two days old left alone with my thirty menatarms in a land i knew not among a people whose tongue i could not speak to hold down the land which i had taken from them  and that was here at home said una  yes here see from the upper ford welands ford to the lower ford by the belle allée west and east it ran half a league from the beacon of brunanburgh behind us here south and north it ran a full leagueand all the woods were full of broken men from santlache saxon thieves norman plunderers robbers and deerstealers a hornets nest indeed  when de aquila had gone hugh would have thanked me for saving their lives but the lady Ælueva said that i had done it only for the sake of receiving the manor  how could i know that de aquila would give it me i said if i had told him i had spent my night in your halter he would have burned the place twice over by now  if any man had put my neck in a rope she said i would have seen his house burned thrice over before i would have made terms  but it was a woman i said and i laughed and she wept and said that i mocked her in her captivity  lady said i there is no captive in this valley except one and he is not a saxon  at this she cried that i was a norman thief who came with false sweet words having intended from the first to turn her out in the fields to beg her bread into the fields she had never seen the face of war  i was angry and answered this much at least i can disprove for i swearand on my swordhilt i swore it in that placei swear i will never set foot in the great hall till the lady Ælueva herself shall summon me there  she went away saying nothing and i walked out and hugh limped after me whistling dolorously that is a custom of the english and we came upon the three saxons that had bound me they were now bound by my menatarms and behind them stood some fifty stark and sullen churls of the house and the manor waiting to see what should fall we heard de aquilas trumpets blow thin through the woods kentward  shall we hang these said my men  then my churls will fight said hugh beneath his breath but i bade him ask the three what mercy they hoped for  none said they all she bade us hang thee if our master died and we would have hanged thee there is no more to it  as i stood doubting a woman ran down from the oak wood above the kings hill yonder and cried out that some normans were driving off the swine there  norman or saxon said i we must beat them back or they will rob us every day out at them with any arms ye have so i loosed those three carles and we ran together my menatarms and the saxons with bills and axes which they had hidden in the thatch of their huts and hugh led them halfway up the kings hill we found a false fellow from picardya sutler that sold wine in the dukes campwith a dead knights shield on his arm a stolen horse under him and some ten or twelve wastrels at his tail all cutting and slashing at the pigs we beat them off and saved our pork one hundred and seventy pigs we saved in that great battle sir richard laughed  that then was our first work together and i bade hugh tell his folk that so would i deal with any man knight or churl norman or saxon who stole as much as one egg from our valley said he to me riding home thou hast gone far to conquer england this evening i answered england must be thine and mine then help me hugh to deal aright with these people make them to know that if they slay me de aquila will surely send to slay them and he will put a worse man in my place that may well be true said he and gave me his hand better the devil we know than the devil we know not till we can pack you normans home and so too said his saxons and they laughed as we drove the pigs downhill but i think some of them even then began not to hate me  i like brother hugh said una softly  beyond question he was the most perfect courteous valiant tender and wise knight that ever drew breath said sir richard caressing the sword he hung up his swordthis swordon the wall of the great hall because he said it was fairly mine and never he took it down till de aquila returned as i shall presently show for three months his men and mine guarded the valley till all robbers and nightwalkers learned there was nothing to get from us save hard tack and a hanging side by side we fought against all who camethrice a week sometimes we foughtagainst thieves and landless knights looking for good manors then we were in some peace and i made shift by hughs help to govern the valleyfor all this valley of yours was my manoras a knight should i kept the roof on the hall and the thatch on the barn but  the english are a bold people his saxons would laugh and jest with hugh and hugh with them andthis was marvellous to meif even the meanest of them said that such and such a thing was the custom of the manor then straightway would hugh and such old men of the manor as might be near forsake everything else to debate the matteri have seen them stop the mill with the corn half groundand if the custom or usage were proven to be as it was said why that was the end of it even though it were flat against hugh his wish and command wonderful  aye said puck breaking in for the first time the custom of old england was here before your norman knights came and it outlasted them though they fought against it cruel  not i said sir richard i let the saxons go their stubborn way but when my own menatarms normans not six months in england stood up and told me what was the custom of the country then i was angry ah good days ah wonderful people and i loved them all  the knight lifted his arms as though he would hug the whole dear valley and swallow hearing the chink of his chainmail looked up and whinnied softly  at last he went on after a year of striving and contriving and some little driving de aquila came to the valley alone and without warning i saw him first at the lower ford with a swineherds brat on his saddlebow  there is no need for thee to give any account of thy stewardship said he i have it all from the child here and he told me how the young thing had stopped his tall horse at the ford by waving of a branch and crying that the way was barred and if one bold bare babe be enough to guard the ford in these days thou hast done well said he and puffed and wiped his head  he pinched the childs cheek and looked at our cattle in the flat by the river  both fat said he rubbing his nose this is craft and cunning such as i love what did i tell thee when i rode away boy  hold the manor or hang said i i had never forgotten it  true and thou hast held he clambered from his saddle and with his swords point cut out a turf from the bank and gave it me where i kneeled  dan looked at una and una looked at dan  thats seizin said puck in a whisper  now thou art lawfully seized of the manor sir richard said hetwas the first time he ever called me thatthou and thy heirs for ever this must serve till the kings clerks write out thy title on a parchment england is all oursif we can hold it  what service shall i pay i asked and i remember i was proud beyond words  knights fee boy knights fee said he hopping round his horse on one foot have i said he was little and could not endure to be helped to his saddle six mounted men or twelve archers thou shalt send me whenever i call for them andwhere got you that corn said he for it was near harvest and our corn stood well i have never seen such bright straw send me three bags of the same seed yearly and furthermore in memory of our last meetingwith the rope round thy neckentertain me and my men for two days of each year in the great hall of thy manor  alas said i then my manor is already forfeit i am under vow not to enter the great hall and i told him what i had sworn to the lady Ælueva  and hadnt you ever been into the house since said una  never sir richard answered smiling i had made me a little hut of wood up the hill and there i did justice and slept  de aquila wheeled aside and his shield shook on his back no matter boy said he i will remit the homage for a year  he meant sir richard neednt give him dinner there the first year puck explained  de aquila stayed with me in the hut and hugh who could read and write and cast accounts showed him the roll of the manor in which were written all the names of our fields and men and he asked a thousand questions touching the land the timber the grazing the mill and the fishponds and the worth of every man in the valley but never he named the lady Æluevas name nor went he near the great hall by night he drank with us in the hut yes he sat on the straw like an eagle ruffled in her feathers his yellow eyes rolling above the cup and he pounced in his talk like an eagle swooping from one thing to another but always binding fast yes he would lie still awhile and then rustle in the straw and speak sometimes as though he were king william himself and anon he would speak in parables and tales and if at once we saw not his meaning he would yerk us in the ribs with his scabbarded sword  look you boys said he i am born out of my due time five hundred years ago i would have made all england such an england as neither dane saxon nor norman should have conquered five hundred years hence i should have been such a counsellor to kings as the world hath never dreamed of tis all here said he tapping his big head but it hath no play in this black age now hugh here is a better man than thou art richard he had made his voice harsh and croaking like a ravens  truth said i but for hugh his help and patience and longsuffering i could never have kept the manor  nor thy life either said de aquila hugh has saved thee not once but a hundred times be still hugh he said dost thou know richard why hugh slept and why he still sleeps among thy norman menatarms  to be near me said i for i thought this was truth  fool said de aquila it is because his saxons have begged him to rise against thee and to sweep every norman out of the valley no matter how i know it is truth therefore hugh hath made himself an hostage for thy life well knowing that if any harm befell thee from his saxons thy normans would slay him without remedy and this his saxons know is it true hugh  in some sort said hugh shamefacedly at least it was true half a year ago my saxons would not harm richard now i think they know himbut i judged it best to make sure  look children what that man had doneand i had never guessed it night after night had he lain down among my menatarms knowing that if one saxon had lifted knife against me his life would have answered for mine  yes said de aquila and he is a swordless man he pointed to hughs belt for hugh had put away his sworddid i tell youthe day after it flew from his hand at santlache he carried only the short knife and the longbow swordless and landless art thou hugh and they call thee kin to earl godwin hugh was indeed of godwins blood the manor that was thine is given to this boy and to his children for ever sit up and beg for he can turn thee out like a dog hugh  hugh said nothing but i heard his teeth grind and i bade de aquila my own overlord hold his peace or i would stuff his words down his throat then de aquila laughed till the tears ran down his face  i warned the king said he what would come of giving england to us norman thieves here art thou richard less than two days confirmed in thy manor and already thou hast risen against thy overlord what shall we do to him sir hugh  i am a swordless man said hugh do not jest with me and he laid his head on his knees and groaned  the greater fool thou said de aquila and all his voice changed for i have given thee the manor of dallington up the hill this halfhour since and he yerked at hugh with his scabbard across the straw  to me said hugh i am a saxon and except that i love richard here i have not sworn fealty to any norman  in gods good time which because of my sins i shall not live to see there will be neither saxon nor norman in england said de aquila if i know men thou art more faithful unsworn than a score of normans i could name take dallington and join sir richard to fight me tomorrow if it please thee  nay said hugh i am no child where i take a gift there i render service and he put his hands between de aquilas and swore to be faithful and as i remember i kissed him and de aquila kissed us both  we sat afterwards outside the hut while the sun rose and de aquila marked our churls going to their work in the fields and talked of holy things and how we should govern our manors in time to come and of hunting and of horsebreeding and of the kings wisdom and unwisdom for he spoke to us as though we were in all sorts now his brothers anon a churl stole up to mehe was one of the three i had not hanged a year agoand he bellowedwhich is the saxon for whisperingthat the lady Ælueva would speak to me at the great house she walked abroad daily in the manor and it was her custom to send me word whither she went that i might set an archer or two behind and in front to guard her very often i myself lay up in the woods and watched on her also  i went swiftly and as i passed the great door it opened from within and there stood my lady Ælueva and she said to me sir richard will it please you enter your great hall then she wept but we were alone  the knight was silent for a long time his face turned across the valley smiling  oh well done said una and clapped her hands very softly she was sorry and she said so  aye she was sorry and she said so said sir richard coming back with a little start very soonbut he said it was two full hours laterde aquila rode to the door with his shield new scoured hugh had cleansed it and demanded entertainment and called me a false knight that would starve his overlord to death then hugh cried out that no man should work in the valley that day and our saxons blew horns and set about feasting and drinking and running of races and dancing and singing and de aquila climbed upon a horseblock and spoke to them in what he swore was good saxon but no man understood it at night we feasted in the great hall and when the harpers and the singers were gone we four sat late at the high table as i remember it was a warm night with a full moon and de aquila bade hugh take down his sword from the wall again for the honour of the manor of dallington and hugh took it gladly enough dust lay on the hilt for i saw him blow it off  she and i sat talking a little apart and at first we thought the harpers had come back for the great hall was filled with a rushing noise of music de aquila leaped up but there was only the moonlight fretty on the floor  hearken said hugh it is my sword and as he belted it on the music ceased  over gods forbid that i should ever belt blade like that said de aquila what does it foretell  the gods that made it may know last time it spoke was at hastings when i lost all my lands belike it sings now that i have new lands and am a man again said hugh  he loosed the blade a little and drove it back happily into the sheath and the sword answered him low and crooningly asas a woman would speak to a man her head on his shoulder  now that was the second time in all my life i heard this sword sing    look said una theres mother coming down the long slip what will she say to sir richard she cant help seeing him  and puck cant magic us this time said dan  are you sure said puck and he leaned forward and whispered to sir richard who smiling bowed his head  but what befell the sword and my brother hugh i will tell on another time said he rising ohé swallow  the great horse cantered up from the far end of the meadow close to mother  they heard mother say children gleasons old horse has broken into the meadow again where did he get through  just below stone bay said dan he tore down simple flobs of the bank we noticed it just now and weve caught no end of fish weve been at it all the afternoon  and they honestly believed that they had they never noticed the oak ash and thorn leaves that puck had slyly thrown into their laps    sir richards song   i followed my duke ere i was a lover     to take from england fief and fee but now this game is the other way over     but now england hath taken me  i had my horse my shield and banner     and a boys heart so whole and free but now i sing in another manner     but now england hath taken me  as for my father in his tower     asking news of my ship at sea he will remember his own hour     tell him england hath taken me  as for my mother in her bower     that rules my father so cunningly she will remember a maidens power     tell her england hath taken me  as for my brother in rouen city     a nimble and naughty page is he but he will come to suffer and pity     tell him england hath taken me  as for my little sister waiting     in the pleasant orchards of normandie tell her youth is the time of mating     tell her england hath taken me  as for my comrades in camp and highway     that lift their eyebrows scornfully tell them their way is not my way     tell them england hath taken me  kings and princes and barons famed     knights and captains in your degree hear me a little before i am blamed     seeing england hath taken me  howso great mans strength be reckoned     there are two things he cannot flee love is the first and death is the second     and love in england hath taken me     the knights of the joyous venture    harp song of the dane women   what is a woman that you forsake her and the hearthfire and the homeacre to go with the old grey widowmaker  she has no house to lay a guest in but one chill bed for all to rest in that the pale suns and the stray bergs nest in  she has no strong white arms to fold you but the tentimesfingering weed to hold you bound on the rocks where the tide has rolled you  yet when the signs of summer thicken and the ice breaks and the birchbuds quicken yearly you turn from our side and sicken  sicken again for the shouts and the slaughters you steal away to the lapping waters and look at your ship in her winter quarters  you forget our mirth and talk at the tables the kine in the shed and the horse in the stables to pitch her sides and go over her cables  then you drive out where the stormclouds swallow and the sound of your oarblades falling hollow is all we have left through the months to follow  ah what is a woman that you forsake her and the hearthfire and the homeacre to go with the old grey widowmaker    it was too hot to run about in the open so dan asked their friend old hobden to take their own dinghy from the pond and put her on the brook at the bottom of the garden her painted name was the daisy but for exploring expeditions she was the golden hind or the long serpent or some such suitable name dan hiked and howked with a boathook the brook was too narrow for sculls and una punted with a piece of hoppole when they came to a very shallow place the golden hind drew quite three inches of water they disembarked and scuffled her over the gravel by her towrope and when they reached the overgrown banks beyond the garden they pulled themselves up stream by the low branches  that day they intended to discover the north cape like othere the old seacaptain in the book of verses which una had brought with her but on account of the heat they changed it to a voyage up the amazon and the sources of the nile even on the shaded water the air was hot and heavy with drowsy scents while outside through breaks in the trees the sunshine burned the pasture like fire the kingfisher was asleep on his watchingbranch and the blackbirds scarcely took the trouble to dive into the next bush dragonflies wheeling and clashing were the only things at work except the moorhens and a big red admiral who flapped down out of the sunshine for a drink  when they reached otter pool the golden hind grounded comfortably on a shallow and they lay beneath a roof of close green watching the water trickle over the floodgates down the mossy brick chute from the millstream to the brook a big troutthe children knew him wellrolled head and shoulders at some fly that sailed round the bend while once in just so often the brook rose a fraction of an inch against all the wet pebbles and they watched the slow draw and shiver of a breath of air through the treetops then the little voices of the slipping water began again  its like the shadows talking isnt it said una she had given up trying to read dan lay over the bows trailing his hands in the current they heard feet on the gravelbar that runs half across the pool and saw sir richard dalyngridge standing over them  was yours a dangerous voyage he asked smiling  she bumped a lot sir said dan theres hardly any water this summer  ah the brook was deeper and wider when my children played at danish pirates are you piratefolk  oh no we gave up being pirates years ago explained una were nearly always explorers now sailing round the world you know  round said sir richard he sat him in the comfortable crotch of an old ashroot on the bank how can it be round  wasnt it in your books dan suggested he had been doing geography at his last lesson  i can neither write nor read he replied canst thou read child  yes said dan barring the very long words  wonderful read to me that i may hear for myself  dan flushed but opened the book and begangabbling a littleat the discoverer of the north cape  othere the old seacaptain who dwelt in helgoland to king alfred the lover of truth brought a snowwhite walrus tooth that he held in his brown right hand  butbutthis i know this is an old song this i have heard sung this is a miracle sir richard interrupted nay do not stop he leaned forward and the shadows of the leaves slipped and slid upon his chainmail  i ploughed the land with horses but my heart was ill at ease for the old seafaring men came to me now and then with their sagas of the seas  his hand fell on the hilt of the great sword this is truth he cried for so did it happen to me and he beat time delightedly to the tramp of verse after verse  and now the land said othere bent southward suddenly and i followed the curving shore and ever southward bore into a nameless sea  a nameless sea he repeated so did iso did hugh and i  where did you go tell us said una  wait let me hear all first so dan read to the poems very end  good said the knight that is otheres taleeven as i have heard the men in the dane ships sing it not in those same valiant words but something like to them  have you ever explored north dan shut the book  nay my venture was south farther south than any man has fared hugh and i went down with witta and his heathen he jerked the tall sword forward and leaned on it with both hands but his eyes looked long past them  i thought you always lived here said una timidly  yes while my lady Ælueva lived but she died she died then my eldest son being a man i asked de aquilas leave that he should hold the manor while i went on some journey or pilgrimageto forget de aquila whom the second william had made warden of pevensey in earl mortains place was very old then but still he rode his tall roan horses and in the saddle he looked like a little white falcon when hugh at dallington over yonder heard what i did he sent for my second son whom being unmarried he had ever looked upon as his own child and by de aquilas leave gave him the manor of dallington to hold till he should return then hugh came with me  when did this happen said dan  that i can answer to the very day for as we rode with de aquila by pevenseyhave i said that he was lord of pevensey and of the honour of the eagleto the bordeaux ship that fetched him his wines yearly out of france a marsh man ran to us crying that he had seen a great black goat which bore on his back the body of the king and that the goat had spoken to him on that same day red william our king the conquerors son died of a secret arrow while he hunted in a forest this is a cross matter said de aquila to meet on the threshold of a journey if red william be dead i may have to fight for my lands wait a little  my lady being dead i cared nothing for signs and omens nor hugh either we took that wineship to go to bordeaux but the wind failed while we were yet in sight of pevensey a thick mist hid us and we drifted with the tide along the cliffs to the west our company was for the most part merchants returning to france and we were laden with wool and there were three couple of tall huntingdogs chained to the rail their master was a knight of artois his name i never learned but his shield bore gold pieces on a red ground and he limped much as i do from a wound which he had got in his youth at mantes siege he served the duke of burgundy against the moors in spain and was returning to that war with his dogs he sang us strange moorish songs that first night and half persuaded us to go with him i was on pilgrimage to forgetwhich is what no pilgrimage brings i think i would have gone but   look you how the life and fortune of man changes towards morning a dane ship rowing silently struck against us in the mist and while we rolled hither and yon hugh leaning over the rail fell outboard i leaped after him and we two tumbled aboard the dane and were caught and bound ere we could rise our own ship was swallowed up in the mist i judge the knight of the gold pieces muzzled his dogs with his cloak lest they should give tongue and betray the merchants for i heard their baying suddenly stop  we lay bound among the benches till morning when the danes dragged us to the high deck by the steeringplace and their captainwitta he was calledturned us over with his foot bracelets of gold from elbow to armpit he wore and his red hair was long as a womans and came down in plaited locks on his shoulder he was stout with bowed legs and long arms he spoiled us of all we had but when he laid hand on hughs sword and saw the runes on the blade hastily he thrust it back yet his covetousness overcame him and he tried again and again and the third time the sword sang loud and angrily so that the rowers leaned on their oars to listen here they all spoke together screaming like gulls and a yellow man such as i have never seen came to the high deck and cut our bonds he was yellownot from sickness but by natureyellow as honey and his eyes stood endwise in his head  how do you mean said una her chin on her hand  thus said sir richard he put a finger to the corner of each eye and pushed it up till his eyes narrowed to slits  why you look just like a chinaman cried dan was the man a chinaman  i know not what that may be witta had found him half dead among ice on the shores of muscovy we thought he was a devil he crawled before us and brought food in a silver dish which these seawolves had robbed from some rich abbey and witta with his own hands gave us wine he spoke a little in french a little in south saxon and much in the northmans tongue we asked him to set us ashore promising to pay him better ransom than he would get price if he sold us to the moorsas once befell a knight of my acquaintance sailing from flushing  not by my father guthrums head said he the gods sent ye into my ship for a luckoffering  at this i quaked for i knew it was still the danes custom to sacrifice captives to their gods for fair weather  a plague on thy four long bones said hugh what profit canst thou make of poor old pilgrims that can neither work nor fight  gods forbid i should fight against thee poor pilgrim with the singing sword said he come with us and be poor no more thy teeth are far apart which is a sure sign thou wilt travel and grow rich  what if we will not come said hugh  swim to england or france said witta we are midway between the two unless ye choose to drown yourselves no hair of your head will be harmed here aboard we think ye bring us luck and i myself know the runes on that sword are good he turned and bade them hoist sail  hereafter all made way for us as we walked about the ship and the ship was full of wonders  what was she like said dan  long low and narrow bearing one mast with a red sail and rowed by fifteen oars aside the knight answered at her bows was a deck under which men might lie and at her stern another shut off by a painted door from the rowers benches here hugh and i slept with witta and the yellow man upon tapestries as soft as wool i rememberhe laughed to himselfwhen first we entered there a loud voice cried out swords out swords kill kill seeing us start witta laughed and showed us it was but a greatbeaked grey bird with a red tail he sat her on his shoulder and she called for bread and wine hoarsely and prayed him to kiss her yet she was no more than a silly bird butye knew this he looked at their smiling faces  we werent laughing at you said una that must have been a parrot its just what pollies do  so we learned later but here is another marvel the yellow man whose name was kitai had with him a brown box in the box was a blue bowl with red marks upon the rim and within the bowl hanging from a fine thread was a piece of iron no thicker than that grass stem and as long maybe as my spur but straight in this iron said witta abode an evil spirit which kitai the yellow man had brought by art magic out of his own country that lay three years journey southward the evil spirit strove day and night to return to his country and therefore look you the iron needle pointed continually to the south  south said dan suddenly and put his hand into his pocket  with my own eyes i saw it every day and all day long though the ship rolled though the sun and the moon and the stars were hid this blind spirit in the iron knew whither it would go and strained to the south witta called it the wise iron because it showed him his way across the unknowable seas again sir richard looked keenly at the children how think ye was it sorcery  was it anything like this dan fished out his old brass pocketcompass that generally lived with his knife and keyring the glass has got cracked but the needle waggles all right sir  the knight drew a long breath of wonder yes yes the wise iron shook and swung in just this fashion now it is still now it points to the south  north said dan  nay south there is the south said sir richard then they both laughed for naturally when one end of a straight compassneedle points to the north the other must point to the south  té said sir richard clicking his tongue there can be no sorcery if a child carries it wherefore does it point southor north  father says that nobody knows said una  sir richard looked relieved then it may still be magic it was magic to us and so we voyaged when the wind served we hoisted sail and lay all up along the windward rail our shields on our backs to break the spray when it failed they rowed with long oars the yellow man sat by the wise iron and witta steered at first i feared the great whiteflowering waves but as i saw how wisely witta led his ship among them i grew bolder hugh liked it well from the first my skill is not upon the water and rocks and whirlpools such as we saw by the west isles of france where an oar caught on a rock and broke are much against my stomach we sailed south across a stormy sea where by moonlight between clouds we saw a flanders ship roll clean over and sink again though hugh laboured with witta all night i lay under the deck with the talking bird and cared not whether i lived or died there is a sickness of the sea which for three days is pure death when we next saw land witta said it was spain and we stood out to sea that coast was full of ships busy in the dukes war against the moors and we feared to be hanged by the dukes men or sold into slavery by the moors so we put into a small harbour which witta knew at night men came down with loaded mules and witta exchanged amber out of the north against little wedges of iron and packets of beads in earthen pots the pots he put under the decks and the wedges of iron he laid on the bottom of the ship after he had cast out the stones and shingle which till then had been our ballast wine too he bought for lumps of sweetsmelling grey ambera little morsel no bigger than a thumbnail purchased a cask of wine but i speak like a merchant  no no tell us what you had to eat cried dan  meat dried in the sun and dried fish and ground beans witta took in and corded frails of a certain sweet soft fruit which the moors use which is like paste of figs but with thin long stones aha dates is the name  now said witta when the ship was loaded i counsel you strangers to pray to your gods for from here on our road is no mans road he and his men killed a black goat for sacrifice on the bows and the yellow man brought out a small smiling image of dullgreen stone and burned incense before it hugh and i commended ourselves to god and saint barnabas and our lady of the assumption who was specially dear to my lady we were not young but i think no shame to say whenas we drove out of that secret harbour at sunrise over a still sea we two rejoiced and sang as did the knights of old when they followed our great duke to england yet was our leader an heathen pirate all our proud fleet but one galley perilously overloaded for guidance we leaned on a pagan sorcerer and our port was beyond the worlds end witta told us that his father guthrum had once in his life rowed along the shores of africa to a land where naked men sold gold for iron and beads there had he bought much gold and no few elephants teeth and thither by help of the wise iron would witta go witta feared nothingexcept to be poor  my father told me said witta that a great shoal runs three days sail out from that land and south of the shoal lies a forest which grows in the sea south and east of the forest my father came to a place where the men hid gold in their hair but all that country he said was full of devils who lived in trees and tore folk limb from limb how think ye  gold or no gold said hugh fingering his sword it is a joyous venture have at these devils of thine witta  venture said witta sourly i am only a poor seathief i do not set my life adrift on a plank for joy or the venture once i beach ship again at stavanger and feel the wifes arms round my neck ill seek no more ventures a ship is heavier care than a wife or cattle  he leaped down among the rowers chiding them for their little strength and their great stomachs yet witta was a wolf in fight and a very fox in cunning  we were driven south by a storm and for three days and three nights he took the sternoar and threddled the longship through the sea when it rose beyond measure he brake a pot of whales oil upon the water which wonderfully smoothed it and in that anointed patch he turned her head to the wind and threw out oars at the end of a rope to make he said an anchor at which we lay rolling sorely but dry this craft his father guthrum had shown him he knew too all the leechbook of bald who was a wise doctor and he knew the shipbook of hlaf the woman who robbed egypt he knew all the care of a ship  after the storm we saw a mountain whose top was covered with snow and pierced the clouds the grasses under this mountain boiled and eaten are a good cure for soreness of the gums and swelled ankles we lay there eight days till men in skins threw stones at us when the heat increased witta spread a cloth on bent sticks above the rowers for the wind failed between the island of the mountain and the shore of africa which is east of it that shore is sandy and we rowed along it within three bowshots here we saw whales and fish in the shape of shields but longer than our ship some slept some opened their mouths at us and some danced on the hot waters the water was hot to the hand and the sky was hidden by hot grey mists out of which blew a fine dust that whitened our hair and beards of a morning here too were fish that flew in the air like birds they would fall on the laps of the rowers and when we went ashore we would roast and eat them  the knight paused to see if the children doubted him but they only nodded and said go on  the yellow land lay on our left the grey sea on our right knight though i was i pulled my oar amongst the rowers i caught seaweed and dried it and stuffed it between the pots of beads lest they should break knighthood is for the land at sea look you a man is but a spurless rider on a bridleless horse i learned to make strong knots in ropesyes and to join two ropes end to end so that even witta could scarcely see where they had been married but hugh had tenfold more seacunning than i witta gave him charge of the rowers of the left side thorkild of borkum a man with a broken nose that wore a norman steel cap had the rowers of the right and each side rowed and sang against the other they saw that no man was idle truly as hugh said and witta would laugh at him a ship is all more care than a manor  how thus there was water to fetch from the shore when we could find it as well as wild fruit and grasses and sand for scrubbing of the decks and benches to keep them sweet also we hauled the ship out on low islands and emptied all her gear even to the iron wedges and burned off the weed that had grown on her with torches of rush and smoked below the decks with rushes dampened in salt water as hlaf the woman orders in her shipbook once when we were thus stripped and the ship lay propped on her keel the bird cried out swords as though she saw an enemy witta vowed he would wring her neck  poor polly did he said una  nay she was the ships bird she could call all the rowers by name those were good daysfor a wifeless manwith witta and his heathenbeyond the worlds end  after many weeks we came on the great shoal which stretched as wittas father had said far out to sea we skirted it till we were giddy with the sight and dizzy with the sound of bars and breakers and when we reached land again we found a naked black people dwelling among woods who for one wedge of iron loaded us with fruits and grasses and eggs witta scratched his head at them in sign he would buy gold they had no gold but they understood the sign all the goldtraders hide their gold in their thick hair for they pointed along the coast they beat too on their chests with their clenched hands and that if we had known it was an evil sign  what did it mean said dan  patience ye shall hear we followed the coast eastward sixteen days counting time by swordcuts on the helmrail till we came to the forest in the sea trees grew there out of mud arched upon lean and high roots and many muddy waterways ran all whither into darkness under the trees here we lost the sun we followed the winding channels between the trees and where we could not row we laid hold of the crusted roots and hauled ourselves along the water was foul and great glittering flies tormented us morning and evening a blue mist covered the mud which bred fevers four of our rowers sickened and were bound to their benches lest they should leap overboard and be eaten by the monsters of the mud the yellow man lay sick beside the wise iron rolling his head and talking in his own tongue only the bird throve she sat on wittas shoulder and screamed in that noisome silent darkness yes i think it was the silence we most feared  he paused to listen to the comfortable home noises of the brook  when we had lost count of time among those black gullies and swashes we heard as it were a drum beat far off and following it we broke into a broad brown river by a hut in a clearing among fields of pumpkins we thanked god to see the sun again the people of the village gave the good welcome and witta scratched his head at them for gold and showed them our iron and beads they ran to the bankwe were still in the shipand pointed to our swords and bows for always when near shore we lay armed soon they fetched store of gold in bars and in dust from their huts and some great blackened elephants teeth these they piled on the bank as though to tempt us and made signs of dealing blows in battle and pointed up to the treetops and to the forest behind their captain or chief sorcerer then beat on his chest with his fists and gnashed his teeth  said thorkild of borkum do they mean we must fight for all this gear and he half drew sword  nay said hugh i think they ask us to league against some enemy  i like this not said witta of a sudden back into midstream  so we did and sat still all watching the black folk and the gold they piled on the bank again we heard drums beat in the forest and the people fled to their huts leaving the gold unguarded  then hugh at the bows pointed without speech and we saw a great devil come out of the forest he shaded his brows with his hand and moistened his pink tongue between his lipsthus  a devil said dan delightfully horrified  yea taller than a man covered with reddish hair when he had well regarded our ship he beat on his chest with his fists till it sounded like rolling drums and came to the bank swinging all his body between his long arms and gnashed his teeth at us hugh loosed arrow and pierced him through the throat he fell roaring and three other devils ran out of the forest and hauled him into a tall tree out of sight anon they cast down the bloodstained arrow and lamented together among the leaves  witta saw the gold on the bank he was loath to leave it sirs said he no man had spoken till then yonder is what we have come so far and so painfully to find laid out to our very hand let us row in while these devils bewail themselves and at least bear off what we may  bold as a wolf cunning as a fox was witta he set four archers on the foredeck to shoot the devils if they should leap from the tree which was close to the bank he manned ten oars aside and bade them watch his hand to row in or back out and so coaxed he them toward the bank but none would set foot ashore though the gold was within ten paces no man is hasty to his hanging they whimpered at their oars like beaten hounds and witta bit his fingers for rage  said hugh of a sudden hark at first we thought it was the buzzing of the glittering flies on the water but it grew loud and fierce so that all men heard  what said dan and una  it was the sword sir richard patted the smooth hilt it sang as a dane sings before battle i go said hugh and he leaped from the bows and fell among the gold i was afraid to my four bones marrow but for shames sake i followed and thorkild of borkum leaped after me none other came blame me not cried witta behind us i must abide by my ship we three had no time to blame or praise we stooped to the gold and threw it back over our shoulders one hand on our swords and one eye on the tree which nigh overhung us  i know not how the devils leaped down or how the fight began i heard hugh cry out out as though he were at santlache again i saw thorkilds steel cap smitten off his head by a great hairy hand and i felt an arrow from the ship whistle past my ear they say that till witta took his sword to the rowers he could not bring his ship inshore and each one of the four archers said afterwards that he alone had pierced the devil that fought me i do not know i went to it in my mailshirt which saved my skin with longsword and beltdagger i fought for the life against a devil whose very feet were hands and who whirled me back and forth like a dead branch he had me by the waist my arms to my side when an arrow from the ship pierced him between the shoulders and he loosened grip i passed my sword twice through him and he crutched himself away between his long arms coughing and moaning next as i remember i saw thorkild of borkum bareheaded and smiling leaping up and down before a devil that leaped and gnashed his teeth then hugh passed his sword shifted to his left hand and i wondered why i had not known that hugh was a lefthanded man and thereafter i remembered nothing till i felt spray on my face and we were in sunshine on the open sea that was twenty days after  what had happened did hugh diethe children asked  never was such a fight fought by christened man said sir richard an arrow from the ship had saved me from my devil and thorkild of borkum had given back before his devil till the bowmen on the ship could shoot it all full of arrows from near by but hughs devil was cunning and had kept behind trees where no arrow could reach body to body there by stark strength of sword and hand had hugh slain him and dying the thing had clenched his teeth on the sword judge what teeth they were  sir richard turned the sword again that the children might see the two great chiselled gouges on either side of the blade  those same teeth met in hughs right arm and side sir richard went on i oh i had no more than a broken foot and a fever thorkilds ear was bitten but hughs arm and side clean withered away i saw him where he lay along sucking a fruit in his left hand his flesh was wasted off his bones his hair was patched with white and his hand was blueveined like a womans he put his left arm round my neck and whispered take my sword it has been thine since hastings o my brother but i can never hold hilt again we lay there on the high deck talking of santlache and i think of every day since santlache and it came so that we both wept i was weak and he little more than a shadow  naynay said witta at the helmrail gold is a good right arm to any man looklook at the gold he bade thorkild show us the gold and the elephants teeth as though we had been children he had brought away all the gold on the bank and twice as much more that the people of the village gave him for slaying the devils they worshipped us as gods thorkild told me it was one of their old women healed up hughs poor arm  how much gold did you getasked dan  how can i say where we came out with wedges of iron under the rowers feet we returned with wedges of gold hidden beneath planks there was dust of gold in packages where we slept and along the side and crosswise under the benches we lashed the blackened elephants teeth  i had sooner have my right arm said hugh when he had seen all  ahai that was my fault said witta i should have taken ransom and landed you in france when first you came aboard ten months ago  it is overlate now said hugh laughing  witta plucked at his long shoulderlock but think said he if i had let ye gowhich i swear i would never have done for i love ye more than brothersif i had let ye go by now ye might have been horribly slain by some mere moor in the duke of burgundys war or ye might have been murdered by landthieves or ye might have died of the plague at an inn think of this and do not blame me overmuch hugh see i will only take a half of the gold  i blame thee not at all witta said hugh it was a joyous venture and we thirtyfive here have done what never men have done if i live till england i will build me a stout keep over dallington out of my share  i will buy cattle and amber and warm red cloth for the wife said witta and i will hold all the land at the head of stavanger fiord many will fight for me now but first we must turn north and with this honest treasure aboard i pray we meet no pirate ships  we did not laugh we were careful we were afraid lest we should lose one grain of our gold for which we had fought devils  where is the sorcerer said i for witta was looking at the wise iron in the box and i could not see the yellow man  he has gone to his own country said he he rose up in the night while we were beating out of that forest in the mud and said that he could see it behind the trees he leaped out on the mud and did not answer when we called so we called no more he left the wise iron which is all that i care forand see the spirit still points to the south  we were troubled for fear that the wise iron should fail us now that its yellow man had gone and when we saw the spirit still served us we grew afraid of too strong winds and of shoals and of careless leaping fish and of all the people on all the shores where we landed  why said dan  because of the goldbecause of our gold gold changes men altogether thorkild of borkum did not change he laughed at witta for his fears and at us for our counselling witta to furl sail when the ship pitched at all  better be drowned out of hand said thorkild of borkum than go tied to a deckload of yellow dust  he was a landless man and had been slave to some king in the east he would have beaten out the gold into deep bands to put round the oars and round the prow  yet though he vexed himself for the gold witta waited upon hugh like a woman lending him his shoulder when the ship rolled and tying of ropes from side to side that hugh might hold by them but for hugh he saidand so did all his menthey would never have won the gold i remember witta made a little thin gold ring for our bird to swing in  three months we rowed and sailed and went ashore for fruits or to clean the ship when we saw wild horsemen riding among sanddunes flourishing spears we knew we were on the moors coast and stood over north to spain and a strong southwest wind bore us in ten days to a coast of high red rocks where we heard a huntinghorn blow among the yellow gorse and knew it was england  now find ye pevensey yourselves said witta i love not these narrow shipfilled seas  he set the dried salted head of the devil which hugh had killed high on our prow and all boats fled from us yet for our golds sake we were more afraid than they we crept along the coast by night till we came to the chalk cliffs and so east to pevensey witta would not come ashore with us though hugh promised him wine at dallington enough to swim in he was on fire to see his wife and ran into the marsh after sunset and there he left us and our share of gold and backed out on the same tide he made no promise he swore no oath he looked for no thanks but to hugh an armless man and to me an old cripple whom he could have flung into the sea he passed over wedge upon wedge packet upon packet of gold and dust of gold and only ceased when we would take no more as he stooped from the rail to bid us farewell he stripped off his rightarm bracelets and put them all on hughs left and he kissed hugh on the cheek i think when thorkild of borkum bade the rowers give way we were near weeping it is true that witta was an heathen and a pirate true it is he held us by force many months in his ship but i loved that bowlegged blueeyed man for his great boldness his cunning his skill and beyond all for his simplicity  did he get home all right said dan  i never knew we saw him hoist sail under the moontrack and stand away i have prayed that he found his wife and the children  and what did you do  we waited on the marsh till the day then i sat by the gold all tied in an old sail while hugh went to pevensey and de aquila sent us horses  sir richard crossed hands on his swordhilt and stared down stream through the soft warm shadows  a whole shipload of gold said una looking at the little golden hind but im glad i didnt see the devils  i dont believe they were devilsdan whispered back  eh said sir richard wittas father warned him they were unquestionable devils one must believe ones father and not ones children what were my devils then  dan flushed all over ii only thought he stammered ive got a book called the gorilla huntersits a continuation of coral island sirand it says there that the gorillas theyre big monkeys you know were always chewing iron up  not always said una only twice they had been reading the gorilla hunters in the orchard  well anyhow they always drummed on their chests like sir richards did before they went for people and they built houses in trees too  ha sir richard opened his eyes houses like flat nests did our devils make where their imps lay and looked at us i did not see them i was sick after the fight but witta told me and lo ye know it also wonderful were our devils only nestbuilding apes is there no sorcery left in the world  i dont know answered dan uncomfortably ive seen a man take rabbits out of a hat and he told us we could see how he did it if we watched hard and we did  but we didnt said una sighing oh theres puck  the little fellow brown and smiling peered between two stems of an ash nodded and slid down the bank into the cool beside them  no sorcery sir richard he laughed and blew on a full dandelion head he had picked  they tell me that wittas wise iron was a toy the boy carries such an iron with him they tell me our devils were apes called gorillas said sir richard indignantly  that is the sorcery of books said puck i warned thee they were wise children all people can be wise by reading of books  but are the books true sir richard frowned i like not all this reading and writing  yees said puck holding the naked dandelion head at arms length but if we hang all fellows who write falsely why did de aquila not begin with gilbert the clerk he was false enough  poor false gilbert yet in his fashion he was bold said sir richard  what did he do said dan  he wrote said sir richard is the tale meet for children think you he looked at puck but tell us tell us cried dan and una together    thorkilds song   theres no wind along these seas   out oars for stavanger   forward all for stavanger so we must wake the whiteash breeze   let fall for stavanger   a long pull for stavanger  oh hear the benches creak and strain   a long pull for stavanger she thinks she smells the northland rain   a long pull for stavanger  she thinks she smells the northland snow and shes as glad as we to go  she thinks she smells the northland rime and the dear dark nights of wintertime  her very bolts are sick for shore and wewe want it ten times more  so all you gods that love brave men send us a threereef gale again  send us a gale and watch us come with closecropped canvas slashing home  buttheres no wind in all these seas   a long pull for stavanger so we must wake the whiteash breeze   a long pull for stavanger     old men at pevensey    it has naught to do with apes or devilssir richard went on in an undertone it concerns de aquila than whom there was never bolder nor craftier nor more hardy knight born and remember he was an old old man at that time  when said dan  when we came back from sailing with witta  what did you do with your gold said dan  have patience link by link is chainmail made i will tell all in its place we bore the gold to pevensey on horsebackthree loads of itand then up to the north chamber above the great hall of pevensey castle where de aquila lay in winter he sat on his bed like a little white falcon turning his head swiftly from one to the other as we told our tale jehan the crab an old sour manatarms guarded the stairway but de aquila bade him wait at the stairfoot and let down both leather curtains over the door it was jehan whom de aquila had sent to us with the horses and only jehan had loaded the gold when our story was told de aquila gave us the news of england for we were as men waked from a yearlong sleep the red king was deadslain ye remember the day we set sailand henry his younger brother had made himself king of england over the head of robert of normandy this was the very thing that the red king had done to robert when our great william died then robert of normandy mad as de aquila said at twice missing of this kingdom had sent an army against england which army had been well beaten back to their ships at portsmouth a little earlier and wittas ship would have rowed through them  and now said de aquila half the great barons of the north and west are out against the king between salisbury and shrewsbury and half the other half wait to see which way the game shall go they say henry is overly english for their stomachs because he hath married an english wife and she hath coaxed him to give back their old laws to our saxons better ride a horse on the bit he knows i say but that is only a cloak to their falsehood he cracked his finger on the table where the wine was spilt and thus he spoke  william crammed us norman barons full of good english acres after santlache i had my share too he said and clapped hugh on the shoulder but i warned himi warned him before odo rebelledthat he should have bidden the barons give up their lands and lordships in normandy if they would be english lords now they are all but princes both in england and normandytrencherfed hounds with a foot in one trough and both eyes on the other robert of normandy has sent them word that if they do not fight for him in england he will sack and harry out their lands in normandy therefore clare has risen fitzosborne has risen montgomery has risenwhom our first william made an english earl even darcy is out with his men whose father i remember a little hedgesparrow knight nearby caen if henry wins the barons can still flee to normandy where robert will welcome them if henry loses robert he says will give them more lands in england oh a pesta pest on normandy for she will be our englands curse this many a long year  amen said hugh but will the war come our ways think you  not from the north said de aquila but the sea is always open if the barons gain the upper hand robert will send another army into england for sure and this time i think he will land herewhere his father the conqueror landed ye have brought your pigs to a pretty market half england alight and gold enough on the groundhe stamped on the bars beneath the tableto set every sword in christendom fighting  what is to do said hugh i have no keep at dallington and if we buried it whom could we trust  me said de aquila pevensey walls are strong no man but jehan who is my dog knows what is between them he drew a curtain by the shotwindow and showed us the shaft of a well in the thickness of the wall  i made it for a drinkingwell he said but we found salt water and it rises and falls with the tide hark we heard the water whistle and blow at the bottom will it serve said he  needs must said hugh our lives are in thy hands so we lowered all the gold down except one small chest of it by de aquilas bed which we kept as much for his delight in its weight and colour as for any of our needs  in the morning ere we rode to our manors he said i do not say farewell because ye will return and bide here not for love nor for sorrow but to be with the gold have a care he said laughing lest i use it to make myself pope trust me not but return  sir richard paused and smiled sadly  in seven days then we returned from our manorsfrom the manors which had been ours  and were the children quite well said una  my sons were young land and governance belong by right to young men sir richard was talking to himself it would have broken their hearts if we had taken back our manors they made us great welcome but we could seehugh and i could seethat our day was done i was a cripple and he a onearmed man no he shook his head and thereforehe raised his voicewe rode back to pevensey  im sorry said una for the knight seemed very sorrowful  little maid it all passed long ago they were young we were old we let them rule the manors aha cried de aquila from his shotwindow when we dismounted back again to earth old foxes but when we were in his chamber above the hall he puts his arms about us and says welcome ghosts welcome poor ghosts  thus it fell out that we were rich beyond belief and lonely and lonely  what did you do said dan  we watched for robert of normandy said the knight de aquila was like witta he suffered no idleness in fair weather we would ride along between bexlei on the one side to cuckmere on the othersometimes with hawk sometimes with hound there are stout hares both on the marsh and the downland but always with an eye to the sea for fear of fleets from normandy in foul weather he would walk on the top of his tower frowning against the rainpeering here and pointing there it always vexed him to think how wittas ship had come and gone without his knowledge when the wind ceased and ships anchored to the wharfs edge he would go and leaning on his sword among the stinking fish would call to the mariners for their news from france his other eye he kept landward for word of henrys war against the barons  many brought him newsjongleurs harpers pedlars sutlers priests and the like and though he was secret enough in small things yet if their news misliked him then regarding neither time nor place nor people he would curse our king henry for a fool or a babe i have heard him cry aloud by the fishing boats if i were king of england i would do thus and thus and when i rode out to see that the warningbeacons were laid and dry he hath often called to me from the shotwindow look to it richard do not copy our blind king but see with thine own eyes and feel with thine own hands i do not think he knew any sort of fear and so we lived at pevensey in the little chamber above the hall  one foul night came word that a messenger of the king waited below we were chilled after a long riding in the fog towards bexlei which is an easy place for ships to land de aquila sent word the man might either eat with us or wait till we had fed anon jehan at the stairhead cried that he had called for horse and was gone pest on him said de aquila i have more to do than to shiver in the great hall for every gadling the king sends left he no word  none said jehan excepthe had been with de aquila at santlacheexcept he said that if an old dog could not learn new tricks it was time to sweep out the kennel  oho said de aquila rubbing his nose to whom did he say that  to his beard chiefly but some to his horses flank as he was girthing up i followed him out said jehan the crab  what was his shieldmark  gold horseshoes on black said the crab  that is one of fulkes men said de aquila  puck broke in very gently gold horseshoes on black is not the fulkes shield the fulkes arms are  the knight waved one hand statelily  thou knowest that evil mans true name he replied but i have chosen to call him fulke because i promised him i would not tell the story of his wickedness so that any man might guess it i have changed all the names in my tale his childrens children may be still alive  truetrue said puck smiling softly it is knightly to keep faitheven after a thousand years  sir richard bowed a little and went on  gold horseshoes on black said de aquila i had heard fulke had joined the barons but if this is true our king must be of the upper hand no matter all fulkes are faithless still i would not have sent the man away empty  he fed said jehan gilbert the clerk fetched him meat and wine from the kitchens he ate at gilberts table  this gilbert was a clerk from battle abbey who kept the accounts of the manor of pevensey he was tall and palecoloured and carried those newfashioned beads for counting of prayers they were large brown nuts or seeds and hanging from his girdle with his pen and inkhorn they clashed when he walked his place was in the great fireplace there was his table of accounts and there he lay o nights he feared the hounds in the hall that came nosing after bones or to sleep on the warm ashes and would slash at them with his beadslike a woman when de aquila sat in hall to do justice take fines or grant lands gilbert would so write it in the manorroll but it was none of his work to feed our guests or to let them depart without his lords knowledge  said de aquila after jehan was gone down the stair hugh hast thou ever told my gilbert thou canst read latin handofwrite  no said hugh he is no friend to me or to odo my hound either no matter said de aquila let him never know thou canst tell one letter from its fellow andhere he jerked us in the ribs with his scabbardwatch him both of ye there be devils in africa as i have heard but by the saints there be greater devils in pevensey and that was all he would say  it chanced some small while afterwards a norman manatarms would wed a saxon wench of the manor and gilbert we had watched him well since de aquila spoke doubted whether her folk were free or slave since de aquila would give them a field of good land if she were free the matter came up at the justice in great hall before de aquila first the wenchs father spoke then her mother then all together till the hall rang and the hounds bayed de aquila held up his hands write her free he called to gilbert by the fireplace a gods name write her free before she deafens me yes yes he said to the wench that was on her knees at him thou art cerdics sister and own cousin to the lady of mercia if thou wilt be silent in fifty years there will be neither norman nor saxon but all english said he and these are the men that do our work he clapped the manatarms that was jehans nephew on the shoulder and kissed the wench and fretted with his feet among the rushes to show it was finished the great hall is always bitter cold i stood at his side hugh was behind gilbert in the fireplace making to play with wise rough odo he signed to de aquila who bade gilbert measure the new field for the new couple out then runs our gilbert between man and maid his beads clashing at his waist and the hall being empty we three sit by the fire  said hugh leaning down to the hearthstones i saw this stone move under gilberts foot when odo snuffed at it look de aquila digged in the ashes with his sword the stone tilted beneath it lay a parchment folden and the writing atop was words spoken against the king by our lord of pevenseythe second part  here was set out hugh read it us whispering every jest de aquila had made to us touching the king every time he had called out to me from the shotwindow and every time he had said what he would do if he were king of england yes day by day had his daily speech which he never stinted been set down by gilbert tricked out and twisted from its true meaning yet withal so cunningly that none could deny who knew him that de aquila had in some sort spoken those words ye see  dan and una nodded  yes said una gravely it isnt what you say so much its what you mean when you say it like calling dan a beast in fun only grownups dont always understand  he hath done this day by day before our very face said de aquila  nay hour by hour said hugh when de aquila spoke even now in the hall of saxons and normans i saw gilbert write on a parchment which he kept beside the manorroll that de aquila said soon there would be no normans left in england if his menatarms did their work aright  bones of the saints said de aquila what avail is honour or a sword against a pen where did gilbert hide that writing he shall eat it  in his breast when he ran out said hugh which made me look to see where he kept his finished stuff when odo scratched at this stone here i saw his face change so i was sure  he is bold said de aquila do him justice in his own fashion my gilbert is bold  overbold said hugh hearken here and he read upon the feast of st agatha our lord of pevensey lying in his upper chamber being clothed in his second fur gown reversed with rabbit  pest on him he is not my tirewoman said de aquila and hugh and i laughed  reversed with rabbit seeing a fog over the marshes did wake sir richard dalyngridge his drunken cupmate here they laughed at me and said peer out old fox for god is on the duke of normandys side  so did i it was a black fog robert could have landed ten thousand men and we none the wiser does he tell how we were out all day riding the marsh and how i near perished in a quicksand and coughed like a sick ewe for ten days after cried de aquila  no said hugh but here is the prayer of gilbert himself to his master fulke  ah said de aquila well i knew it was fulke what is the price of my blood  gilbert prayeth that when our lord of pevensey is stripped of his lands on this evidence which gilbert hath with fear and pains collected  fear and pains is a true word said de aquila and sucked in his cheeks but how excellent a weapon is a pen i must learn it  he prays that fulke will advance him from his present service to that honour in the church which fulke promised him and lest fulke should forget he has written below to be sacristan of battle  at this de aquila whistled a man who can plot against one lord can plot against another when i am stripped of my lands fulke will whip off my gilberts foolish head none the less battle needs a new sacristan they tell me the abbot henry keeps no sort of rule there  let the abbot wait said hugh it is our heads and our lands that are in danger this parchment is the second part of the tale the first has gone to fulke and so to the king who will hold us traitors  assuredly said de aquila fulkes man took the first part that evening when gilbert fed him and our king is so beset by his brother and his barons small blame too that he is mad with mistrust fulke has his ear and pours poison into it presently the king gives him my land and yours this is old and he leaned back and yawned  and thou wilt surrender pevensey without word or blow said hugh we saxons will fight your king then i will go warn my nephew at dallington give me a horse  give thee a toy and a rattle said de aquila put back the parchment and rake over the ashes if fulke is given my pevensey which is englands gate what will he do with it he is norman at heart and his heart is in normandy where he can kill peasants at his pleasure he will open englands gate to our sleepy robert as odo and mortain tried to do and then there will be another landing and another santlache therefore i cannot give up pevensey  good said we two  ah but wait if my king be made on gilberts evidence to mistrust me he will send his men against me here and while we fight englands gate is left unguarded who will be the first to come through thereby even robert of normandy therefore i cannot fight my king he nursed his swordthus  this is saying and unsaying like a norman said hugh what of our manors  i do not think for myself said de aquila nor for our king nor for your lands i think for england for whom neither king nor baron thinks i am not norman sir richard nor saxon sir hugh english am i  saxon norman or english said hugh our lives are thine however the game goes when do we hang gilbert  never said de aquila who knows he may yet be sacristan of battle for to do him justice he is a good writer dead men make dumb witnesses wait  but the king may give pevensey to fulke and our manors go with it said i shall we tell our sons  no the king will not wake up a hornets nest in the south till he has smoked out the bees in the north he may hold me a traitor but at least he sees i am not fighting against him and every day that i lie still is so much gain to him while he fights the barons if he were wise he would wait till that war were over before he made new enemies but i think fulke will play upon him to send for me and if i do not obey the summons that will to henrys mind be proof of my treason but mere talk such as gilbert sends is no proof nowadays we barons follow the church and like anselm we speak what we please let us go about our days dealings and say naught to gilbert  then we do nothing said hugh  we wait said de aquila i am old but still i find that the most grievous work i know  and so we found it but in the end de aquila was right  a little later in the year armed men rode over the hill the golden horseshoes flying behind the kings banner said de aquila at the window of our chamber how did i tell you here comes fulke himself to spy out his new lands which our king hath promised him if he can bring proof of my treason  how dost thou know said hugh  because that is what i would do if i were fulke but i should have brought more men my roan horse to your old shoes said he fulke brings me the kings summons to leave pevensey and join the war he sucked in his cheeks and drummed on the edge of the shaft where the water sounded all hollow  shall we go said i  go at this time of year stark madness said he take me from pevensey to fisk and flyte through fern and forest and in three days roberts keels would be lying on pevensey mud with ten thousand men who would stop themfulke  the horns blew without and anon fulke cried the kings summons at the great door that de aquila with all men and horse should join the kings camp at salisbury  how did i tell you said de aquila there are twenty barons twixt here and salisbury could give king henry good land service but he has been worked upon by fulke to send south and call memeoff the gate of england when his enemies stand about to batter it in see that fulkes men lie in the big south barn said he give them drink and when fulke has eaten we will drink in my chamber the great hall is too cold for old bones  as soon as he was offhorse fulke went to the chapel with gilbert to give thanks for his safe coming and when he had eatenhe was a fat man and rolled his eyes greedily at our good roast sussex wheatearswe led him to the little upper chamber whither gilbert had already gone with the manorroll i remember when fulke heard the tide blow and whistle in the shaft he leaped back and his long downturned stirrupshoes caught in the rushes and he stumbled so that jehan behind him found it easy to knock his head against the wall  did you know it was going to happen said dan  assuredly said sir richard with a sweet smile i put my foot on his sword and plucked away his dagger but he knew not whether it was day or night for awhile he lay rolling his eyes and bubbling with his mouth and jehan roped him like a calf he was cased all in that newfangled armour which we call lizardmail not rings like my hauberk heresir richard tapped his chestbut little pieces of daggerproof steel overlapping on stout leather we stripped it off no need to spoil good harness by wetting it and in the neckpiece de aquila found the same folden piece of parchment which we had put back under the hearthstone  at this gilbert would have run out i laid my hand on his shoulder it sufficed he fell to trembling and praying on his beads  gilbert said de aquila here be more notable sayings and doings of our lord of pevensey for thee to write down take pen and inkhorn gilbert we cannot all be sacristans of battle  said fulke from the floor ye have bound a kings messenger pevensey shall burn for this  maybe i have seen it besieged once said de aquila but heart up fulke i promise thee that thou shalt be hanged in the middle of the flames at the end of that siege if i have to share my last loaf with thee and that is more than odo would have done when we starved out him and mortain  then fulke sat up and looked long and cunningly at de aquila  by the saints said he why didst thou not say thou wast on the duke roberts side at the first  am i said de aquila  fulke laughed and said no man who serves king henry dare do this much to his messenger when didst thou come over to the duke let me up and we can smooth it out together and he smiled and becked and winked  yes we will smooth it out said de aquila he nodded to me and jehan and i heaved up fulkehe was a heavy manand lowered him into the shaft by a rope not so as to stand on our gold but dangling by his shoulders a little above it was turn of ebb and the water came to his knees he said nothing but shivered somewhat  then jehan of a sudden beat down gilberts wrist with his sheathed dagger stop he said he swallows his beads  poison belike said de aquila it is good for men who know too much i have carried it these thirty years give me  then gilbert wept and howled de aquila ran the beads through his fingers the last onei have said they were large nutsopened in two halves on a pin and there was a small folded parchment within on it was written the old dog goes to salisbury to be beaten i have his kennel come quickly  this is worse than poison said de aquila very softly and sucked in his cheeks then gilbert grovelled in the rushes and told us all he knew the letter as we guessed was from fulke to the duke and not the first that had passed between them fulke had given it to gilbert in the chapel and gilbert thought to have taken it by morning to a certain fishing boat at the wharf which trafficked between pevensey and the french shore gilbert was a false fellow but he found time between his quakings and shakings to swear that the master of the boat knew nothing of the matter  he hath called me shaved head said gilbert and he hath thrown haddockguts at me but for all that he is no traitor  i will have no clerk of mine mishandled or miscalled said de aquila that seaman shall be whipped at his own mast write me first a letter and thou shalt bear it with the order for the whipping tomorrow to the boat  at this gilbert would have kissed de aquilas handhe had not hoped to live until the morningand when he trembled less he wrote a letter as from fulke to the duke saying that the kennel which signified pevensey was shut and that the old dog which was de aquila sat outside it and moreover that all had been betrayed  write to any man that all is betrayed said de aquila and even the pope himself would sleep uneasily eh jehan if one told thee all was betrayed what wouldst thou do  i would run away said jehan it might be true  well said quoth de aquila write gilbert that montgomery the great earl hath made his peace with the king and that little darcy whom i hate hath been hanged by the heels we will give robert full measure to chew upon write also that fulke himself is sick to death of a dropsy  nay cried fulke hanging in the wellshaft drown me out of hand but do not make a jest of me  jest i said de aquila i am but fighting for life and lands with a pen as thou hast shown me fulke  then fulke groaned for he was cold and let me confess said he  now this is right neighbourly said de aquila leaning over the shaft thou hast read my sayings and doingsor at least the first part of themand thou art minded to repay me with thy own doings and sayings take pen and inkhorn gilbert here is work that will not irk thee  let my men go without hurt and i will confess my treason against the king said fulke  now why has he grown so tender of his men of a sudden said hugh to me for fulke had no name for mercy to his men plunder he gave them but pity none  té té said de aquila thy treason was all confessed long ago by gilbert it would be enough to hang montgomery himself  nay but spare my men said fulke and we heard him splash like a fish in a pond for the tide was rising  all in good time said de aquila the night is young the wine is old and we need only the merry tale begin the story of thy life since when thou wast a lad at tours tell it nimbly  ye shame me to my soul said fulke  then i have done what neither king nor duke could do said de aquila but begin and forget nothing  send thy man away said fulke  that much can i do said de aquila but remember i am like the danes king i cannot turn the tide  how long will it rise said fulke and splashed anew  for three hours said de aquila time to tell all thy good deeds begin and gilberti have heard thou art somewhat carelessdo not twist his words from his true meaning  sofear of death in the dark being upon himfulke began and gilbert not knowing what his fate might be wrote it word by word i have heard many tales but never heard i aught to match the tale of fulke his black life as fulke told it hollowly hanging in the shaft  was it bad said dan awestruck  beyond belief sir richard answered none the less there was that in it which forced even gilbert to laugh we three laughed till we ached at one place his teeth so chattered that we could not well hear and we reached him down a cup of wine then he warmed to it and smoothly set out all his shifts malices and treacheries his extreme boldnesses he was desperate bold his retreats shufflings and counterfeitings he was also inconceivably a coward his lack of gear and honour his despair at their loss his remedies and wellcoloured contrivances yes he waved the filthy rags of his life before us as though they had been some proud banner when he ceased we saw by torches that the tide stood at the corners of his mouth and he breathed strongly through his nose  we had him out and rubbed him we wrapped him in a cloak and gave him wine and we leaned and looked upon him the while he drank he was shivering but shameless  of a sudden we heard jehan at the stairway wake but a boy pushed past him and stood before us the hall rushes in his hair all slubbered with sleep my father my father i dreamed of treachery he cried and babbled thickly  there is no treachery here said fulke go and the boy turned even then not fully awake and jehan led him by the hand to the great hall  thy only son said de aquila why didst thou bring the child here  he is my heir i dared not trust him to my brother said fulke and now he was ashamed de aquila said nothing but sat weighing a wine cup in his two handsthus anon fulke touched him on the knee  let the boy escape to normandy said he and do with me at thy pleasure yea hang me tomorrow with my letter to robert round my neck but let the boy go  be still said de aquila i think for england  so we waited what our lord of pevensey should devise and the sweat ran down fulkes forehead  at last said de aquila i am too old to judge or to trust any man i do not covet thy lands as thou hast coveted mine and whether thou art any better or any worse than any other black angevin thief it is for thy king to find out therefore go back to thy king fulke  and thou wilt say nothing of what has passed said fulke  why should i thy son will stay with me if the king calls me again to leave pevensey which i must guard against englands enemies if the king sends his men against me for a traitor or if i hear that the king in his bed thinks any evil of me or my two knights thy son will be hanged from out this window fulke  but it hadnt anything to do with his son cried una startled  how could we have hanged fulke said sir richard we needed him to make our peace with the king he would have betrayed half england for the boys sake of that we were sure  i dont understand said una but i think it was simply awful  so did not fulke he was well pleased  what because his son was going to be killed  nay because de aquila had shown him how he might save the boys life and his own lands and honours i will do it he said i swear i will do it i will tell the king thou art no traitor but the most excellent valiant and perfect of us all yes i will save thee  de aquila looked still into the bottom of the cup rolling the winedregs to and fro  ay he said if i had a son i would i think save him but do not by any means tell me how thou wilt go about it  nay nay said fulke nodding his bald head wisely that is my secret but rest at ease de aquila no hair of thy head nor rood of thy land shall be forfeited and he smiled like one planning great good deeds  and henceforward said de aquila i counsel thee to serve one masternot two  what said fulke can i work no more honest trading between the two sides these troublous times  serve robert or the kingengland or normandy said de aquila i care not which it is but make thy choice here and now  the king then said fulke for i see he is better served than robert shall i swear it  no need said de aquila and he laid his hand on the parchments which gilbert had written it shall be some part of my gilberts penance to copy out the savoury tale of thy life till we have made ten twenty an hundred maybe copies how many cattle think you would the bishop of tours give for that tale or thy brother or the monks of blois minstrels will turn it into songs which thy own saxon serfs shall sing behind their ploughstilts and menatarms riding through thy norman towns from here to rome fulke men will make very merry over that tale and how fulke told it hanging in a well like a drowned puppy this shall be thy punishment if ever i find thee doubledealing with thy king any more meantime the parchments stay here with thy son him i will return to thee when thou hast made my peace with the king the parchments never  fulke hid his face and groaned  bones of the saints said de aquila laughing the pen cuts deep i could never have fetched that grunt out of thee with any sword  but so long as i do not anger thee my tale will be secret said fulke  just so long does that comfort thee fulke said de aquila  what other comfort have ye left me he said and of a sudden he wept hopelessly like a child dropping his face on his knees  poor fulke said una  i pitied him also said sir richard  after the spur corn said de aquila and he threw fulke three wedges of gold that he had taken from our little chest by the bedplace  if i had known this said fulke catching his breath i would never have lifted hand against pevensey only lack of this yellow stuff has made me so unlucky in my dealings  it was dawn then and they stirred in the great hall below we sent down fulkes mail to be scoured and when he rode away at noon under his own and the kings banner very splendid and stately did he show he smoothed his long beard and called his son to his stirrup and kissed him de aquila rode with him as far as the new mill landward we thought the night had been all a dream  but did he make it right with the king dan asked about your not being traitors i mean  sir richard smiled the king sent no second summons to pevensey nor did he ask why de aquila had not obeyed the first yes that was fulkes work i know not how he did it but it was well and swiftly done  then you didnt do anything to his son said una  the boy oh he was an imp he turned the keep doors out of dortoirs while we had him he sang foul songs learned in the barons campspoor fool he set the hounds fighting in hall he lit the rushes to drive out as he said the fleas he drew his dagger on jehan who threw him down the stairway for it and he rode his horse through crops and among sheep but when we had beaten him and showed him wolf and deer he followed us old men like a young eager hound and called us uncle his father came the summers end to take him away but the boy had no lust to go because of the otterhunting and he stayed on till the foxhunting i gave him a bitterns claw to bring him good luck at shooting an imp if ever there was  and what happened to gilbert said dan  not even a whipping de aquila said he would sooner a clerk however false that knew the manorroll than a fool however true that must be taught his work afresh moreover after that night i think gilbert loved as much as he feared de aquila at least he would not leave usnot even when vivian the kings clerk would have made him sacristan of battle abbey a false fellow but in his fashion bold  did robert ever land in pevensey after all dan went on  we guarded the coast too well while henry was fighting his barons and three or four years later when england had peace henry crossed to normandy and showed his brother some work at tenchebrai that cured robert of fighting many of henrys men sailed from pevensey to that war fulke came i remember and we all four lay in the little chamber once again and drank together de aquila was right one should not judge men fulke was merry yes always merrywith a catch in his breath  and what did you do afterwards said una  we talked together of times past that is all men can do when they grow old little maid   the bell for tea rang faintly across the meadows dan lay in the bows of the golden hind una in the stern the book of verses open in her lap was reading from the slaves dream  again in the mist and shadow of sleep he saw his native land  i dont know when you began that said dan sleepily  on the middle thwart of the boat beside unas sunbonnet lay an oak leaf an ash leaf and a thorn leaf that must have dropped down from the trees above and the brook giggled as though it had just seen some joke    the runes on welands sword   a smith makes me to betray my man in my first fight  to gather gold at the worlds end i am sent  the gold i gather comes into england out of deep water  like a shining fish then it descends into deep water  it is not given for goods or gear but for the thing  the gold i gather a king covets for an ill use  the gold i gather is drawn up out of deep water  like a shining fish then it descends into deep water  it is not given for goods or gear but for the thing     a centurion of the thirtieth   cities and thrones and powers   stand in times eye almost as long as flowers   which daily die but as new buds put forth   to glad new men out of the spent and unconsidered earth   the cities rise again  this seasons daffodil   she never hears what change what chance what chill   cut down last years but with bold countenance   and knowledge small esteems her seven days continuance   to be perpetual  so time that is oerkind   to all that be ordains us een as blind   as bold as she that in our very death   and burial sure shadow to shadow well persuaded saith   see how our works endure    a centurion of the thirtieth   dan had come to grief over his latin and was kept in so una went alone to far wood dans big catapult and the lead bullets that hobden had made for him were hidden in an old hollow beechstub on the west of the wood they had named the place out of the verse in lays of ancient rome       from lordly volaterrae        where scowls the farfamed hold      piled by the hands of giants        for godlike kings of old  they were the godlike kings and when old hobden piled some comfortable brushwood between the big wooden knees of volaterrae they called him hands of giants  una slipped through their private gap in the fence and sat still awhile scowling as scowlily and lordlily as she knew how for volaterrae is an important watchtower that juts out of far wood just as far wood juts out of the hillside pooks hill lay below her and all the turns of the brook as it wanders out of the willingford woods between hopgardens to old hobdens cottage at the forge the souwest wind there is always a wind by volaterrae blew from the bare ridge where cherry clack windmill stands  now wind prowling through woods sounds like exciting things going to happen and that is why on blowy days you stand up in volaterrae and shout bits of the lays to suit its noises  una took dans catapult from its secret place and made ready to meet lars porsenas army stealing through the windwhitened aspens by the brook a gust boomed up the valley and una chanted sorrowfully       verbenna down to ostia        hath wasted all the plain      astur hath stormed janiculum        and the stout guards are slain  but the wind not charging fair to the wood started aside and shook a single oak in gleasons pasture here it made itself all small and crouched among the grasses waving the tips of them as a cat waves the tip of her tail before she springs  now welcomewelcome sextus sang una loading the catapult  now welcome to thy home why dost thou stay and turn away here lies the road to rome  she fired into the face of the lull to wake up the cowardly wind and heard a grunt from behind a thorn in the pasture  oh my winkie she said aloud and that was something she had picked up from dan i blieve ive tickled up a gleason cow  you little painted beast a voice cried ill teach you to sling your masters  she looked down most cautiously and saw a young man covered with hoopy bronze armour all glowing among the late broom but what una admired beyond all was his great bronze helmet with a red horsetail that flicked in the wind she could hear the long hairs rasp on his shimmery shoulderplates  what does the faun mean he said half aloud to himself by telling me that the painted people have changed he caught sight of unas yellow head have you seen a painted leadslinger he called  noo said una but if youve seen a bullet  seen cried the man it passed within a hairs breadth of my ear  well that was me im most awfully sorry  didnt the faun tell you i was coming he smiled  not if you mean puck i thought you were a gleason cow ii didnt know you were aawhat are you  he laughed outright showing a set of splendid teeth his face and eyes were dark and his eyebrows met above his big nose in one bushy black bar  they call me parnesius i have been a centurion of the seventh cohort of the thirtieth legionthe ulpia victrix did you sling that bullet  i did i was using dans catapult said una  catapults said he i ought to know something about them show me  he leaped the rough fence with a rattle of spear shield and armour and hoisted himself into volaterrae as quickly as a shadow  a sling on a forked stick i understand he cried and pulled at the elastic but what wonderful beast yields this stretching leather  its laccyelastic you put the bullet into that loop and then you pull hard  the man pulled and hit himself square on his thumbnail  each to his own weapon he said gravely handing it back i am better with the bigger machine little maiden but its a pretty toy a wolf would laugh at it arent you afraid of wolves  there arent any said una  never believe it a wolfs like a winged hat he comes when he isnt expected dont they hunt wolves here  we dont hunt said una remembering what she had heard from grownups we preservepheasants do you know them  i ought to said the young man smiling again and he imitated the cry of the cockpheasant so perfectly that a bird answered out of the wood  what a big painted clucking fool is a pheasant he said just like some romans  but youre a roman yourself arent you said una  yees and no im one of a good few thousands who have never seen rome except in a picture my people have lived at vectis for generations vectisthat island west yonder that you can see from so far in clear weather  do you mean the isle of wight it lifts up just before rain and you see it from the downs  very likely our villas on the south edge of the island by the broken cliffs most of it is three hundred years old but the cowstables where our first ancestor lived must be a hundred years older oh quite that because the founder of our family had his land given him by agricola at the settlement its not a bad little place for its size in springtime violets grow down to the very beach ive gathered seaweeds for myself and violets for my mother many a time with our old nurse  was your nurse aa romaness too  no a numidian gods be good to her a dear fat brown thing with a tongue like a cowbell she was a free woman by the way are you free maiden  oh quite said una at least till teatime and in summer our governess doesnt say much if were late  the young man laughed againa proper understanding laugh  i see said he that accounts for your being in the wood we hid among the cliffs  did you have a governess then  did we not a greek too she had a way of clutching her dress when she hunted us among the gorsebushes that made us laugh then shed say shed get us whipped she never did though bless her aglaia was a thorough sportswoman for all her learning  but what lessons did you dowhenwhen you were little  ancient history the classics arithmetic and so on he answered my sister and i were thickheads but my two brothers im the middle one liked those things and of course mother was clever enough for any six she was nearly as tall as i am and she looked like the new statue on the western roadthe demeter of the baskets you know and funny roma dea how mother could make us laugh  what at  little jokes and sayings that every family has dont you know  i know we have but i didnt know other people had them too said una tell me about all your family please  good families are very much alike mother would sit spinning of evenings while aglaia read in her corner and father did accounts and we four romped about the passages when our noise grew too loud the pater would say less tumult less tumult have you never heard of a fathers right over his children he can slay them my lovesslay them dead and the gods highly approve of the action then mother would prim up her dear mouth over the wheel and answer hm im afraid there cant be much of the roman father about you then the pater would roll up his accounts and say ill show you and thenthen hed be worse than any of us  fathers canif they like said una her eyes dancing  didnt i say all good families are very much the same  what did you do in summer said una play about like us  yes and we visited our friends there are no wolves in vectis we had many friends and as many ponies as we wished  it must have been lovely said una i hope it lasted for ever  not quite little maid when i was about sixteen or seventeen the father felt gouty and we all went to the waters  what waters  at aquae solis every one goes there you ought to get your father to take you some day  but where i dont know said una  the young man looked astonished for a moment aquae solis he repeated the best baths in britain just as good im told as rome all the old gluttons sit in hot water and talk scandal and politics and the generals come through the streets with their guards behind them and the magistrates come in their chairs with their stiff guards behind them and you meet fortunetellers and goldsmiths and merchants and philosophers and feathersellers and ultraroman britons and ultrabritish romans and tame tribesmen pretending to be civilised and jew lecturers andoh everybody interesting we young people of course took no interest in politics we had not the gout there were many of our age like us we did not find life sad  but while we were enjoying ourselves without thinking my sister met the son of a magistrate in the westand a year afterwards she was married to him my young brother who was always interested in plants and roots met the first doctor of a legion from the city of the legions and he decided that he would be an army doctor i do not think it is a profession for a wellborn man but thenim not my brother he went to rome to study medicine and now hes first doctor of a legion in egyptat antinoe i think but i have not heard from him for some time  my eldest brother came across a greek philosopher and told my father that he intended to settle down on the estate as a farmer and a philosopher you seethe young mans eyes twinkledhis philosopher was a longhaired one  i thought philosophers were bald said una  not all she was very pretty i dont blame him nothing could have suited me better than my eldest brothers doing this for i was only too keen to join the army i had always feared i should have to stay at home and look after the estate while my brother took this  he rapped on his great glistening shield that never seemed to be in his way  so we were well contentedwe young peopleand we rode back to clausentum along the wood road very quietly but when we reached home aglaia our governess saw what had come to us i remember her at the door the torch over her head watching us climb the cliffpath from the boat aie aie she said children you went away men and a woman you return then she kissed mother and mother wept thus our visit to the waters settled our fates for each of us maiden  he rose to his feet and listened leaning on the shieldrim  i think thats danmy brother said una  yes and the faun is with him he replied as dan with puck stumbled through the copse  we should have come sooner puck called but the beauties of your native tongue o parnesius have enthralled this young citizen  parnesius looked bewildered even when una explained  dan said the plural of dominus was dominoes and when miss blake said it wasnt he said he supposed it was backgammon and so he had to write it out twicefor cheek you know  dan had climbed into volaterrae hot and panting  ive run nearly all the way he gasped and then puck met me how do you do sir  i am in good health parnesius answered see i have tried to bend the bow of ulysses but he held up his thumb  im sorry you must have pulled off too soon said dan but puck said you were telling una a story  continue o parnesius said puck who had perched himself on a dead branch above them i will be chorus has he puzzled you much una  not a bit excepti didnt know where akak something was she answered  oh aquae solis thats bath where the buns come from let the hero tell his own tale  parnesius pretended to thrust his spear at pucks legs but puck reached down caught at the horsetail plume and pulled off the tall helmet  thanks jester said parnesius shaking his curly dark head that is cooler now hang it up for me  i was telling your sister how i joined the army he said to dan  did you have to pass an exam dan asked eagerly  no i went to my father and said i should like to enter the dacian horse i had seen some at aquae solis but he said i had better begin service in a regular legion from rome now like many of our youngsters i was not too fond of anything roman the romanborn officers and magistrates looked down on us britishborn as though we were barbarians i told my father so  i know they do he said but remember after all we are the people of the old stock and our duty is to the empire  to which empire i asked we split the eagle before i was born  what thieves talk is that said my father he hated slang  well sir i said weve one emperor in rome and i dont know how many emperors the outlying provinces have set up from time to time which am i to follow  gratian said he at least hes a sportsman  hes all that i said hasnt he turned himself into a rawbeefeating scythian  where did you hear of it said the pater  at aquae solis i said it was perfectly true this precious emperor gratian of ours had a bodyguard of furcloaked scythians and he was so crazy about them that he dressed like them in rome of all places in the world it was as bad as if my own father had painted himself blue  no matter for the clothes said the pater they are only the fringe of the trouble it began before your time or mine rome has forsaken her gods and must be punished the great war with the painted people broke out in the very year the temples of our gods were destroyed we beat the painted people in the very year our temples were rebuilt go back further still he went back to the time of diocletian and to listen to him you would have thought eternal rome herself was on the edge of destruction just because a few people had become a little largeminded  i knew nothing about it aglaia never taught us the history of our own country she was so full of her ancient greeks  there is no hope for rome said the pater at last she has forsaken her gods but if the gods forgive us here we may save britain to do that we must keep the painted people back therefore i tell you parnesius as a father that if your heart is set on service your place is among men on the walland not with women among the cities  what wall asked dan and una at once  father meant the one we call hadrians wall ill tell you about it later it was built long ago across north britain to keep out the painted peoplepicts you call them father had fought in the great pict war that lasted more than twenty years and he knew what fighting meant theodosius one of our great generals had chased the little beasts back far into the north before i was born down at vectis of course we never troubled our heads about them but when my father spoke as he did i kissed his hand and waited for orders we britishborn romans know what is due to our parents  if i kissed my fathers hand hed laugh said dan  customs change but if you do not obey your father the gods remember it you may be quite sure of that  after our talk seeing i was in earnest the pater sent me over to clausentum to learn my footdrill in a barrack full of foreign auxiliariesas unwashed and unshaved a mob of mixed barbarians as ever scrubbed a breastplate it was your stick in their stomachs and your shield in their faces to push them into any sort of formation when i had learned my work the instructor gave me a handfuland they were a handfulof gauls and iberians to polish up till they were sent to their stations upcountry i did my best and one night a villa in the suburbs caught fire and i had my handful out and at work before any of the other troops i noticed a quietlooking man on the lawn leaning on a stick he watched us passing buckets from the pond and at last he said to me who are you  a probationer waiting for a command i answered i didnt know who he was from deucalion  born in britain he said  yes if you were born in spain i said for he neighed his words like an iberian mule  and what might you call yourself when you are at home he said laughing  that depends i answered sometimes one thing and sometimes another but now im busy  he said no more till we had saved the family gods they were respectable householders and then he grunted across the laurels listen young sometimesonethingandsometimesanother in future call yourself centurion of the seventh cohort of the thirtieth the ulpia victrix that will help me to remember you your father and a few other people call me maximus  he tossed me the polished stick he was leaning on and went away you might have knocked me down with it  who was he said dan  maximus himself our great general the general of britain who had been theodosiuss right hand in the pict war not only had he given me my centurions stick direct but three steps in a good legion as well a new man generally begins in the tenth cohort of his legion and works up  and were you pleased said una  very i thought maximus had chosen me for my good looks and fine style in marching but when i went home the pater told me he had served under maximus in the great pict war and had asked him to befriend me  a child you were said puck from above  i was said parnesius dont begrudge it me faun afterwardsthe gods know i put aside the games and puck nodded brown chin on brown hand his big eyes still  the night before i left we sacrificed to our ancestorsthe usual little home sacrificebut i never prayed so earnestly to all the good shades and then i went with my father by boat to regnum and across the chalk eastwards to anderida yonder  regnum anderida the children turned their faces to puck  regnums chichester he said pointing towards cherry clack andhe threw his arm south behind himanderidas pevensey  pevensey again said dan where weland landed  weland and a few others said puck pevensey isnt youngeven compared to me  the headquarters of the thirtieth lay at anderida in summer but my own cohort the seventh was on the wall up north maximus was inspecting auxiliariesthe abulci i thinkat anderida and we stayed with him for he and my father were very old friends i was only there ten days when i was ordered to go up with thirty men to my cohort he laughed merrily a man never forgets his first march i was happier than any emperor when i led my handful through the north gate of the camp and we saluted the guard and the altar of victory there  how how said dan and una  parnesius smiled and stood up flashing in his armour  so said he and he moved slowly through the beautiful movements of the roman salute that ends with a hollow clang of the shield coming into its place between the shoulders  hai said puck that sets one thinking  we went out fully armed said parnesius sitting down but as soon as the road entered the great forest my men expected the packhorses to hang their shields on no i said you can dress like women in anderida but while youre with me you will carry your own weapons and armour  but its hot said one of them and we havent a doctor suppose we get sunstroke or a fever  then die i said and a good riddance to rome up shieldup spears and tighten your footwear  dont think yourself emperor of britain already a fellow shouted i knocked him over with the butt of my spear and explained to these romanborn romans that if there were any further trouble we should go on with one man short and by the light of the sun i meant it too my raw gauls at clausentum had never treated me so  then quietly as a cloud maximus rode out of the fern my father behind him and reined up across the road he wore the purple as though he were already emperor his leggings were of white buckskin laced with gold  my men dropped likelike partridges  he said nothing for some time only looked with his eyes puckered then he crooked his forefinger and my men walkedcrawled i meanto one side  stand in the sun children he said and they formed up on the hard road  what would you have done he said to me if i had not been here  i should have killed that man i answered  kill him now he said he will not move a limb  no i said youve taken my men out of my command i should only be your butcher if i killed him now do you see what i meant parnesius turned to dan  yes said dan it wouldnt have been fair somehow  that was what i thought said parnesius but maximus frowned youll never be an emperor he said not even a general will you be  i was silent but my father seemed pleased  i came here to see the last of you he said  you have seen it said maximus i shall never need your son any more he will live and he will die an officer of a legionand he might have been prefect of one of my provinces now eat and drink with us he said your men will wait till you have finished  my miserable thirty stood like wineskins glistening in the hot sun and maximus led us to where his people had set a meal himself he mixed the wine  a year from now he said you will remember that you have sat with the emperor of britainand gaul  yes said the pater you can drive two mulesgaul and britain  five years hence you will remember that you have drunkhe passed me the cup and there was blue borage in itwith the emperor of rome  no you cant drive three mules they will tear you in pieces said my father  and you on the wall among the heather will weep because your notion of justice was more to you than the favour of the emperor of rome  i sat quite still one does not answer a general who wears the purple  i am not angry with you he went on i owe too much to your father  you owe me nothing but advice that you never took said the pater  to be unjust to any of your family indeed i say you may make a good tribune but so far as i am concerned on the wall you will live and on the wall you will die said maximus  very like said my father but we shall have the picts and their friends breaking through before long you cannot move all troops out of britain to make you emperor and expect the north to sit quiet  i follow my destiny said maximus  follow it then said my father pulling up a fern root and die as theodosius died  ah said maximus my old general was killed because he served the empire too well i may be killed but not for that reason and he smiled a little pale grey smile that made my blood run cold  then i had better follow my destiny i said and take my men to the wall  he looked at me a long time and bowed his head slanting like a spaniard follow it boy he said that was all i was only too glad to get away though i had many messages for home i found my men standing as they had been putthey had not even shifted their feet in the dust and off i marched still feeling that terrific smile like an east wind up my back i never halted them till sunset andhe turned about and looked at pooks hill below himthen i halted yonder he pointed to the broken brackencovered shoulder of the forge hill behind old hobdens cottage  there why thats only the old forgewhere they made iron once said dan  very good stuff it was too said parnesius calmly we mended three shoulderstraps here and had a spearhead riveted the forge was rented from the government by a oneeyed smith from carthage i remember we called him cyclops he sold me a beaverskin rug for my sisters room  but it couldnt have been here dan insisted  but it was from the altar of victory at anderida to the first forge in the forest here is twelve miles seven hundred paces it is all in the road book a man doesnt forget his first march i think i could tell you every station between this and he leaned forward but his eye was caught by the setting sun  it had come down to the top of cherry clack hill and the light poured in between the tree trunks so that you could see red and gold and black deep into the heart of far wood and parnesius in his armour shone as though he had been afire  wait he said lifting a hand and the sunlight jinked on his glass bracelet wait i pray to mithras  he rose and stretched his arms westward with deep splendidsounding words  then puck began to sing too in a voice like bells tolling and as he sang he slipped from volaterrae to the ground and beckoned the children to follow they obeyed it seemed as though the voices were pushing them along and through the goldybrown light on the beech leaves they walked while puck between them chanted something like this  cur mundus militat sub vana gloria cujus prosperitas est transitoria tam cito labitur ejus potentia quam vasa figuli quæ sunt fragilia  they found themselves at the little locked gates of the wood  quo cæsar abiit celsus imperio vel dives splendidus totus in prandio dic ubi tullius  still singing he took dans hand and wheeled him round to face una as she came out of the gate it shut behind her at the same time as puck threw the memorymagicking oak ash and thorn leaves over their heads  well you are jolly late said una couldnt you get away before  i did said dan i got away in lots of time butbut i didnt know it was so late whereve you been  in volaterraewaiting for you  sorry said dan it was all that beastly latin    a britishroman song ad 406   my fathers father saw it not   and i belike shall never come to look on that soholy spot                  the very rome  crowned by all time all art all might   the equal work of gods and man city beneath whose oldest height                  the race began  soon to send forth again a brood   unshakeable we pray that clings to romes thricehammered hardihood                  in arduous things  strong heart with triple armour bound   beat strongly for thy lifeblood runs age after age the empire round                  in us thy sons  who distant from the seven hills   loving and serving much require theethee to guard gainst homeborn ills                  the imperial fire    on the great wall   when i left rome for lalages sake   by the legions road to rimini she vowed her heart was mine to take   with me and my shield to rimini   till the eagles flew from rimini     and ive tramped britain and ive tramped gaul     and the pontic shore where the snowflakes fall   as white as the neck of lalage   as cold as the heart of lalage     and ive lost britain and ive lost gaul  the voice seemed very cheerful about it      and ive lost rome and worst of all       ive lost lalage  they were standing by the gate to far wood when they heard this song without a word they hurried to their private gap and wriggled through the hedge almost atop of a jay that was feeding from pucks hand  gently said puck what are you looking for  parnesius of course dan answered weve only just remembered yesterday it isnt fair  puck chuckled as he rose im sorry but children who spend the afternoon with me and a roman centurion need a little settling dose of magic before they go to tea with their governess ohé parnesius he called  here faun came the answer from volaterrae they could see the shimmer of bronze armour in the beech crotch and the friendly flash of the great shield uplifted  i have driven out the britons parnesius laughed like a boy i occupy their high forts but rome is merciful you may come up and up they three all scrambled  what was the song you were singing just now said una as soon as she had settled herself  that oh rimini its one of the tunes that are always being born somewhere in the empire they run like a pestilence for six months or a year till another one pleases the legions and then they march to that  tell them about the marching parnesius few people nowadays walk from end to end of this country said puck  the greater their loss i know nothing better than the long march when your feet are hardened you begin after the mists have risen and you end perhaps an hour after sundown  and what do you have to eat dan asked promptly  fat bacon beans and bread and whatever wine happens to be in the resthouses but soldiers are born grumblers their very first day out my men complained of our waterground british corn they said it wasnt so filling as the rough stuff that is ground in the roman oxmills however they had to fetch and eat it  fetch it where from said una  from that newly invented watermill below the forge  thats forge millour mill una looked at puck  yes yours puck put in how old did you think it was  i dont know didnt sir richard dalyngridge talk about it  he did and it was old in his day puck answered hundreds of years old  it was new in mine said parnesius my men looked at the flour in their helmets as though it had been a nest of adders they did it to try my patience but iaddressed them and we became friends to tell the truth they taught me the roman step you see id only served with quickmarching auxiliaries a legions pace is altogether different it is a long slow stride that never varies from sunrise to sunset romes raceromes pace as the proverb says twentyfour miles in eight hours neither more nor less head and spear up shield on your back cuirasscollar open one hands breadthand thats how you take the eagles through britain  and did you meet any adventures said dan  there are no adventures south the wall said parnesius the worst thing that happened me was having to appear before a magistrate up north where a wandering philosopher had jeered at the eagles i was able to show that the old man had deliberately blocked our road and the magistrate told him out of his own book i believe that whatever his gods might be he should pay proper respect to cæsar  what did you do said dan  went on why should i care for such things my business being to reach my station it took me twenty days  of course the farther north you go the emptier are the roads at last you fetch clear of the forests and climb bare hills where wolves howl in the ruins of our cities that have been no more pretty girls no more jolly magistrates who knew your father when he was young and invite you to stay with them no news at the temples and waystations except bad news of wild beasts theres where you meet hunters and trappers for the circuses prodding along chained bears and muzzled wolves your pony shies at them and your men laugh  the houses change from gardened villas to shut forts with watchtowers of grey stone and great stonewalled sheepfolds guarded by armed britons of the north shore in the naked hills beyond the naked houses where the shadows of the clouds play like cavalry charging you see puffs of black smoke from the mines the hard road goes on and onand the wind sings through your helmetplumepast altars to legions and generals forgotten and broken statues of gods and heroes and thousands of graves where the mountain foxes and hares peep at you redhot in summer freezing in winter is that big purple heather country of broken stone  just when you think you are at the worlds end you see a smoke from east to west as far as the eye can turn and then under it also as far as the eye can stretch houses and temples shops and theatres barracks and granaries trickling along like dice behindalways behindone long low rising and falling and hiding and showing line of towers and that is the wall  ah said the children taking breath  you may well said parnesius old men who have followed the eagles since boyhood say nothing in the empire is more wonderful than first sight of the wall  is it just a wall like the one round the kitchengarden said dan  no no it is the wall along the top are towers with guardhouses small towers between even on the narrowest part of it three men with shields can walk abreast from guardhouse to guardhouse a little curtain wall no higher than a mans neck runs along the top of the thick wall so that from a distance you see the helmets of the sentries sliding back and forth like beads thirty feet high is the wall and on the picts side the north is a ditch strewn with blades of old swords and spearheads set in wood and tyres of wheels joined by chains the little people come there to steal iron for their arrowheads  but the wall itself is not more wonderful than the town behind it long ago there were great ramparts and ditches on the south side and no one was allowed to build there now the ramparts are partly pulled down and built over from end to end of the wall making a thin town eighty miles long think of it one roaring rioting cockfighting wolfbaiting horseracing town from ituna on the west to segedunum on the cold eastern beach on one side heather woods and ruins where picts hide and on the other a vast townlong like a snake and wicked like a snake yes a snake basking beside a warm wall  my cohort i was told lay at hunno where the great north road runs through the wall into the province of valentia parnesius laughed scornfully the province of valentia we followed the road therefore into hunno town and stood astonished the place was a faira fair of peoples from every corner of the empire some were racing horses some sat in wineshops some watched dogs baiting bears and many gathered in a ditch to see cocks fight a boy not much older than myself but i could see he was an officer reined up before me and asked what i wanted  my station i said and showed him my shield parnesius held up his broad shield with its three xs like letters on a beercask  lucky omen said he your cohorts the next tower to us but theyre all at the cockfight this is a happy place come and wet the eagles he meant to offer me a drink  when ive handed over my men i said i felt angry and ashamed  oh youll soon outgrow that sort of nonsense he answered but dont let me interfere with your hopes go on to the statue of roma dea you cant miss it the main road into valentia and he laughed and rode off i could see the statue not a quarter of a mile away and there i went at some time or other the great north road ran under it into valentia but the far end had been blocked up because of the picts and on the plaster a man had scratched finish it was like marching into a cave we grounded spears together my little thirty and it echoed in the barrel of the arch but none came there was a door at one side painted with our number we prowled in and i found a cook asleep and ordered him to give us food then i climbed to the top of the wall and looked out over the pict country and ithought said parnesius the brickedup arch with finish on the plaster was what shook me for i was not much more than a boy  what a shame said una but did you feel happy after youd had a good dan stopped her with a nudge  happy said parnesius when the men of the cohort i was to command came back unhelmeted from the cockfight their birds under their arms and asked me who i was no i was not happy but i made my new cohort unhappy too  i wrote my mother i was happy but oh my friendshe stretched arms over bare kneesi would not wish my worst enemy to suffer as i suffered through my first months on the wall remember this among the officers was scarcely one except myself and i thought i had lost the favour of maximus my general scarcely one who had not done something of wrong or folly either he had killed a man or taken money or insulted the magistrates or blasphemed the gods and so had been sent to the wall as a hidingplace from shame or fear and the men were as the officers remember also that the wall was manned by every breed and race in the empire no two towers spoke the same tongue or worshipped the same gods in one thing only we were all equal no matter what arms we had used before we came to the wall on the wall we were all archers like the scythians the pict cannot run away from the arrow or crawl under it he is a bowman himself he knows  i suppose you were fighting picts all the time said dan  picts seldom fight i never saw a fighting pict for half a year the tame picts told us they had all gone north  what is a tame pict said dan  a pictthere were many suchwho speaks a few words of our tongue and slips across the wall to sell ponies and wolfhounds without a horse and a dog and a friend man would perish the gods gave me all three and there is no gift like friendship remember thisparnesius turned to danwhen you become a young man for your fate will turn on the first true friend you make  he means said puck grinning that if you try to make yourself a decent chap when youre young youll make rather decent friends when you grow up if youre a beast youll have beastly friends listen to the pious parnesius on friendship  i am not pious parnesius answered but i know what goodness means and my friend though he was without hope was ten thousand times better than i stop laughing faun  oh youth eternal and allbelieving cried puck as he rocked on the branch above tell them about your pertinax  he was that friend the gods sent methe boy who spoke to me when i first came little older than myself commanding the augusta victoria cohort on the tower next to us and the numidians in virtue he was far my superior  then why was he on the wall una asked quickly theyd all done something bad you said so yourself  he was the nephew his father had died of a great rich man in gaul who was not always kind to his mother when pertinax grew up he discovered this and so his uncle shipped him off by trickery and force to the wall we came to know each other at a ceremony in our templein the dark it was the bullkilling parnesius explained to puck  i see said puck and turned to the children thats something you wouldnt quite understand parnesius means he met pertinax in church  yesin the cave we first met and we were both raised to the degree of gryphons together parnesius lifted his hand towards his neck for an instant he had been on the wall two years and knew the picts well he taught me first how to take heather  whats that said dan  going out hunting in the pict country with a tame pict you are quite safe so long as you are his guest and wear a sprig of heather where it can be seen if you went alone you would surely be killed if you were not smothered first in the bogs only the picts know their way about those black and hidden bogs old allo the oneeyed withered little pict from whom we bought our ponies was our special friend at first we went only to escape from the terrible town and to talk together about our homes then he showed us how to hunt wolves and those great red deer with horns like jewish candlesticks the romanborn officers rather looked down on us for doing this but we preferred the heather to their amusements believe me parnesius turned again to dan a boy is safe from all things that really harm when he is astride a pony or after a deer do you remember o faunhe turned to puckthe little altar i built to the sylvan pan by the pineforest beyond the brook  which the stone one with the line from xenophon said puck in quite a new voice  no what do i know of xenophon that was pertinaxafter he had shot his first mountainhare with an arrowby chance mine i made of round pebbles in memory of my first bear it took me one happy day to build parnesius faced the children quickly  and that was how we lived on the wall for two yearsa little scuffling with the picts and a great deal of hunting with old allo in the pict country he called us his children sometimes and we were fond of him and his barbarians though we never let them paint us pict fashion the marks endure till you die  hows it done said dan anything like tattooing  they prick the skin till the blood runs and rub in coloured juices allo was painted blue green and red from his forehead to his ankles he said it was part of his religion he told us about his religion pertinax was always interested in such things and as we came to know him well he told us what was happening in britain behind the wall many things took place behind us in those days and by the light of the sun said parnesius earnestly there was not much that those little people did not know he told me when maximus crossed over to gaul after he had made himself emperor of britain and what troops and emigrants he had taken with him we did not get the news on the wall till fifteen days later he told me what troops maximus was taking out of britain every month to help him to conquer gaul and i always found the numbers were as he said wonderful and i tell another strange thing  he joined his hands across his knees and leaned his head on the curve of the shield behind him  late in the summer when the first frosts begin and the picts kill their bees we three rode out after wolf with some new hounds rutilianus our general had given us ten days leave and we had pushed beyond the second wallbeyond the province of valentiainto the higher hills where there are not even any of old romes ruins we killed a shewolf before noon and while allo was skinning her he looked up and said to me when you are captain of the wall my child you wont be able to do this any more  i might as well have been made prefect of lower gaul so i laughed and said wait till i am captain  no dont wait said allo take my advice and go homeboth of you  we have no homes said pertinax you know that as well as we do were finished menthumbs down against both of us only men without hope would risk their necks on your ponies the old man laughed one of those short pict laughslike a fox barking on a frosty night im fond of you two he said besides ive taught you what little you know about hunting take my advice and go home  we cant i said im out of favour with my general for one thing and for another pertinax has an uncle  i dont know about his uncle said allo but the trouble with you parnesius is that your general thinks well of you  roma dea said pertinax sitting up what can you guess what maximus thinks you old horsecoper  just then you know how near the brutes creep when one is eating a great dogwolf jumped out behind us and away our rested hounds tore after him with us at their tails he ran us far out of any country wed ever heard of straight as an arrow till sunset towards the sunset we came at last to long capes stretching into winding waters and on a grey beach below us we saw ships drawn up fortyseven we countednot roman galleys but the ravenwinged ships from the north where rome does not rule men moved in the ships and the sun flashed on their helmetswinged helmets of the redhaired men from the north where rome does not rule we watched and we counted and we wondered for though we had heard rumours concerning these winged hats as the picts called them never before had we looked upon them  come away come away said allo my heather wont protect you here we shall all be killed his legs trembled like his voice back we wentback across the heather under the moon till it was nearly morning and our poor beasts stumbled on some ruins  when we woke very stiff and cold allo was mixing the meal and water one does not light fires in the pict country except near a village the little men are always signalling to each other with smokes and a strange smoke brings them out buzzing like bees they can sting too  what we saw last night was a tradingstation said allo nothing but a tradingstation  i do not like lies on an empty stomach said pertinax i suppose he had eyes like an eaglesi suppose that is a tradingstation also he pointed to a smoke far off on a hilltop ascending in what we call the picts callpuffdoublepuff doublepuffpuff they make it by raising and dropping a wet hide on a fire  no said allo pushing the platter back into the bag that is for you and me your fate is fixed come  we came when one takes heather one must obey ones pictbut that wretched smoke was twenty miles distant well over on the east coast and the day was as hot as a bath  whatever happens said allo while our ponies grunted along i want you to remember me  i shall not forget said pertinax you have cheated me out of my breakfast  what is a handful of crushed oats to a roman he said then he laughed his laugh that was not a laugh  what would you do if you were a handful of oats being crushed between the upper and lower stones of a mill  im pertinax not a riddleguesser said pertinax  youre a fool said allo your gods and my gods are threatened by strange gods and all you can do is to laugh  threatened men live long i said  i pray the gods that may be true he said but i ask you again not to forget me  we climbed the last hot hill and looked out on the eastern sea three or four miles off there was a small sailinggalley of the north gaul pattern at anchor her landingplank down and her sail half up and below us alone in a hollow holding his pony sat maximus emperor of britain he was dressed like a hunter and he leaned on his little stick but i knew that back as far as i could see it and i told pertinax  youre madder than allo he said it must be the sun  maximus never stirred till we stood before him then he looked me up and down and said hungry again it seems to be my destiny to feed you whenever we meet i have food here allo shall cook it  no said allo a prince in his own land does not wait on wandering emperors i feed my two children without asking your leave he began to blow up the ashes  i was wrong said pertinax we are all mad speak up o madman called emperor  maximus smiled his terrible tightlipped smile but two years on the wall do not make a man afraid of mere looks so i was not afraid  i meant you parnesius to live and die a centurion of the wall said maximus but it seems from thesehe fumbled in his breastyou can think as well as draw he pulled out a roll of letters i had written to my people full of drawings of picts and bears and men i had met on the wall mother and my sister always liked my pictures  he handed me one that i had called maximuss soldiers it showed a row of fat wineskins and our old doctor of the hunno hospital snuffing at them each time that maximus had taken troops out of britain to help him to conquer gaul he used to send the garrisons more wineto keep them quiet i suppose on the wall we always called a wineskin a maximus oh yes and i had drawn them in imperial helmets  not long since he went on mens names were sent up to cæsar for smaller jokes than this  true cæsar said pertinax but you forget that was before i your friends friend became such a good spearthrower  he did not actually point his huntingspear at maximus but balanced it on his palmso  i was speaking of time past said maximus never fluttering an eyelid nowadays one is only too pleased to find boys who can think for themselves and their friends he nodded at pertinax your father lent me the letters parnesius so you run no risk from me  none whatever said pertinax and rubbed the spearpoint on his sleeve  i have been forced to reduce the garrisons in britain because i need troops in gaul now i come to take troops from the wall itself said he  i wish you joy of us said pertinax were the last sweepings of the empirethe men without hope myself id sooner trust condemned criminals  you think so he said quite seriously but it will only be till i win gaul one must always risk ones life or ones soul or ones peaceor some little thing  allo passed round the fire with the sizzling deers meat he served us two first  ah said maximus waiting his turn i perceive you are in your own country well you deserve it they tell me you have quite a following among the picts parnesius  i have hunted with them i said maybe i have a few friends among the heather  he is the only armoured man of you all who understands us said allo and he began a long speech about our virtues and how we had saved one of his grandchildren from a wolf the year before  had you said una  yes but that was neither here nor there the little green man orated like alike cicero he made us out to be magnificent fellows maximus never took his eyes off our faces  enough he said i have heard allo on you i wish to hear you on the picts  i told him as much as i knew and pertinax helped me out there is never harm in a pict if you but take the trouble to find out what he wants their real grievance against us came from our burning their heather the whole garrison of the wall moved out twice a year and solemnly burned the heather for ten miles north rutilianus our general called it clearing the country the picts of course scampered away and all we did was to destroy their beebloom in the summer and ruin their sheepfood in the spring  true quite true said allo how can we make our holy heatherwine if you burn our beepasture  we talked long maximus asking keen questions that showed he knew much and had thought more about the picts he said presently to me if i gave you the old province of valentia to govern could you keep the picts contented till i won gaul stand away so that you do not see allos face and speak your own thoughts  no i said you cannot remake that province the picts have been free too long  leave them their village councils and let them furnish their own soldiers he said you i am sure would hold the reins very lightly  even then no i said at least not now they have been too oppressed by us to trust anything with a roman name for years and years  i heard old allo behind me mutter good child  then what do you recommend said maximus to keep the north quiet till i win gaul  leave the picts alone i said stop the heatherburning at once andthey are improvident little animalssend them a shipload or two of corn now and then  their own men must distribute itnot some cheating greek accountant said pertinax  yes and allow them to come to our hospitals when they are sick i said  surely they would die first said maximus  not if parnesius brought them in said allo i could show you twenty wolfbitten bearclawed picts within twenty miles of here but parnesius must stay with them in hospital else they would go mad with fear  i see said maximus like everything else in the world it is one mans work you i think are that one man  pertinax and i are one i said  as you please so long as you work now allo you know that i mean your people no harm leave us to talk together said maximus  no need said allo i am the corn between the upper and lower millstones i must know what the lower millstone means to do these boys have spoken the truth as far as they know it i a prince will tell you the rest i am troubled about the men of the north he squatted like a hare in the heather and looked over his shoulder  i also said maximus or i should not be here  listen said allo long and long ago the winged hatshe meant the northmencame to our beaches and said rome falls push her down we fought you you sent men we were beaten after that we said to the winged hats you are liars make our men alive that rome killed and we will believe you they went away ashamed now they come back bold and they tell the old tale which we begin to believethat rome falls  give me three years peace on the wall cried maximus and i will show you and all the ravens how they lie  ah i wish it too i wish to save what is left of the corn from the millstones but you shoot us picts when we come to borrow a little iron from the iron ditch you burn our heather which is all our crop you trouble us with your great catapults then you hide behind the wall and scorch us with greek fire how can i keep my young men from listening to the winged hatsin winter especially when we are hungry my young men will say rome can neither fight nor rule she is taking her men out of britain the winged hats will help us to push down the wall let us show them the secret roads across the bogs do i want that no he spat like an adder i would keep the secrets of my people though i were burned alive my two children here have spoken truth leave us picts alone comfort us and cherish us and feed us from far offwith the hand behind the back parnesius understands us let him have rule on the wall and i will hold my young men quiet forhe ticked it off on his fingersone year easily the next year not so easily the third year perhaps see i give you three years if then you do not show us that rome is strong in men and terrible in arms the winged hats i tell you will sweep down the wall from either sea till they meet in the middle and you will go i shall not grieve over that but well i know tribe never helps tribe except for one price we picts will go too the winged hats will grind us to this he tossed a handful of dust in the air  oh roma dea said maximus half aloud it is always one mans workalways and everywhere  and one mans life said allo you are emperor but not a god you may die  i have thought of that too said he very good if this wind holds i shall be at the east end of the wall by morning tomorrow then i shall see you two when i inspect and i will make you captains of the wall for this work  one instant cæsar said pertinax all men have their price i am not bought yet  do you also begin to bargain so early said maximus well  give me justice against my uncle icenus the duumvir of divio in gaul he said  only a life i thought it would be money or an office certainly you shall have him write his name on these tabletson the red side the other is for the living and maximus held out his tablets  he is of no use to me dead said pertinax my mother is a widow i am far off i am not sure he pays her all her dowry  no matter my arm is reasonably long we will look through your uncles accounts in due time now farewell till tomorrow o captains of the wall  we saw him grow small across the heather as he walked to the galley there were picts scores each side of him hidden behind stones he never looked left or right he sailed away southerly full spread before the evening breeze and when we had watched him out to sea we were silent we understood that earth bred few men like to this man  presently allo brought the ponies and held them for us to mounta thing he had never done before  wait awhile said pertinax and he made a little altar of cut turf and strewed heatherbloom atop and laid upon it a letter from a girl in gaul  what do you do o my friend i said  i sacrifice to my dead youth he answered and when the flames had consumed the letter he ground them out with his heel then we rode back to that wall of which we were to be captains  parnesius stopped the children sat still not even asking if that were all the tale puck beckoned and pointed the way out of the wood sorry he whispered but you must go now  we havent made him angry have we said una he looks so far off andandthinky  bless your heart no wait till tomorrow it wont be long remember youve been playing lays of ancient rome  and as soon as they had scrambled through their gap where oak ash and thorn grew that was all they remembered    a song to mithras   mithras god of the morning our trumpets waken the wall rome is above the nations but thou art over all now as the names are answered and the guards are marched away mithras also a soldier give us strength for the day  mithras god of the noontide the heather swims in the heat our helmets scorch our foreheads our sandals burn our feet now in the ungirt hour now ere we blink and drowse mithras also a soldier keep us true to our vows  mithras god of the sunset low on the western main thou descending immortal immortal to rise again now when the watch is ended now when the wine is drawn mithras also a soldier keep us pure till the dawn  mithras god of the midnight here where the great bull dies look on thy children in darkness oh take our sacrifice many roads thou hast fashioned all of them lead to the light mithras also a soldier teach us to die aright     the winged hats    the next day happened to be what they called a wild afternoon father and mother went out to pay calls miss blake went for a ride on her bicycle and they were left all alone till eight oclock  when they had seen their dear parents and their dear preceptress politely off the premises they got a cabbageleaf full of raspberries from the gardener and a wild tea from ellen they ate the raspberries to prevent their squashing and they meant to divide the cabbageleaf with three cows down at the theatre but they came across a dead hedgehog which they simply had to bury and the leaf was too useful to waste  then they went on to the forge and found old hobden the hedger at home with his son the bee boy who is not quite right in his head but who can pick up swarms of bees in his naked hands and the bee boy told them the rhyme about the slowworm  if i had eyes as i could see no mortal man would trouble me  they all had tea together by the hives and hobden said the loafcake which ellen had given them was almost as good as what his wife used to make and he showed them how to set a wire at the right height for hares they knew about rabbits already  then they climbed up long ditch into the lower end of far wood this is sadder and darker than the volaterrae end because of an old marlpit full of black water where weepy hairy moss hangs round the stumps of the willows and alders but the birds come to perch on the dead branches and hobden says that the bitter willowwater is a sort of medicine for sick animals  they sat down on a felled oaktrunk in the shadows of the beech undergrowth and were looping the wires hobden had given them when they saw parnesius  how quietly you came said una moving up to make room wheres puck  the faun and i have disputed whether it is better that i should tell you all my tale or leave it untold he replied  i only said that if he told it as it happened you wouldnt understand it said puck jumping up like a squirrel from behind the log  i dont understand all of it said una but i like hearing about the little picts  what i cant understand said dan is how maximus knew all about the picts when he was over in gaul  he who makes himself emperor anywhere must know everything everywhere said parnesius we had this much from maximuss mouth after the games  games what games said dan  parnesius stretched his arm out stiffly thumb pointed to the ground gladiators that sort of game he said there were two days games in his honour when he landed all unexpected at segedunum on the east end of the wall yes the day after we had met him we held two days games but i think the greatest risk was run not by the poor wretches on the sand but by maximus in the old days the legions kept silence before their emperor so did not we you could hear the solid roar run west along the wall as his chair was carried rocking through the crowds the garrison beat round himclamouring clowning asking for pay for change of quarters for anything that came into their wild heads that chair was like a little boat among waves dipping and falling but always rising again after one had shut the eyes parnesius shivered  were they angry with him said dan  no more angry than wolves in a cage when their trainer walks among them if he had turned his back an instant or for an instant had ceased to hold their eyes there would have been another emperor made on the wall that hour was it not so faun  so it was so it always will be said puck  late in the evening his messenger came for us and we followed to the temple of victory where he lodged with rutilianus the general of the wall i had hardly seen the general before but he always gave me leave when i wished to take heather he was a great glutton and kept five asian cooks and he came of a family that believed in oracles we could smell his good dinner when we entered but the tables were empty he lay snorting on a couch maximus sat apart among long rolls of accounts then the doors were shut  these are your men said maximus to the general who propped his eyecorners open with his gouty fingers and stared at us like a fish  i shall know them again cæsar said rutilianus  very good said maximus now hear you are not to move man or shield on the wall except as these boys shall tell you you will do nothing except eat without their permission they are the head and arms you are the belly  as cæsar pleases the old man grunted if my pay and profits are not cut you may make my ancestors oracle my master rome has been rome has been then he turned on his side to sleep  he has it said maximus we will get to what i need  he unrolled full copies of the number of men and supplies on the walldown to the sick that very day in hunno hospital oh but i groaned when his pen marked off detachment after detachment of our bestof our least worthless men he took two towers of our scythians two of our north british auxiliaries two numidian cohorts the dacians all and half the belgians it was like an eagle pecking a carcass  and now how many catapults have you he turned up a new list but pertinax laid his open hand there  no cæsar said he do not tempt the gods too far take men or engines but not both else we refuse  engines said una  the catapults of the wallhuge things forty feet high to the headfiring nets of raw stone or forged bolts nothing can stand against them he left us our catapults at last but he took a cæsars half of our men without pity we were a shell when he rolled up the lists  hail cæsar we about to die salute you said pertinax laughing if any enemy even leans against the wall now it will tumble  give me the three years allo spoke of he answered and you shall have twenty thousand men of your own choosing up here but now it is a gamblea game played against the gods and the stakes are britain gaul and perhaps rome you play on my side  we will play cæsar i said for i had never met a man like this man  good tomorrow said he i proclaim you captains of the wall before the troops  so we went into the moonlight where they were cleaning the ground after the games we saw great roma dea atop of the wall the frost on her helmet and her spear pointed towards the north star we saw the twinkle of nightfires all along the guard towers and the line of the black catapults growing smaller and smaller in the distance all these things we knew till we were weary but that night they seemed very strange to us because the next day we knew we were to be their masters  the men took the news well but when maximus went away with half our strength and we had to spread ourselves into the emptied towers and the townspeople complained that trade would be ruined and the autumn gales blewit was dark days for us two here pertinax was more than my right hand being born and bred among the great countryhouses in gaul he knew the proper words to address to allfrom romanborn centurions to those dogs of the thirdthe libyans and he spoke to each as though that man were as highminded as himself now i saw so strongly what things were needed to be done that i forgot things are only accomplished by means of men that was a mistake  i feared nothing from the picts at least for that year but allo warned me that the winged hats would soon come in from the sea at each end of the wall to prove to the picts how weak we were so i made ready in haste and none too soon i shifted our best men to the ends of the wall and set up screened catapults by the beach the winged hats would drive in before the snowsquallsten or twenty boats at a timeon segedunum or ituna according as the wind blew  now a ship coming in to land men must furl her sail if you wait till you see her men gather up the sails foot your catapults can jerk a net of loose stones bolts only cut through the cloth into the bag of it then she turns over and the sea makes everything clean again a few men may come ashore but very few  it was not hard work except the waiting on the beach in blowing sand and snow and that was how we dealt with the winged hats that winter  early in the spring when the east winds blow like skinningknives they gathered again off segedunum with many ships allo told me they would never rest till they had taken a tower in open fight certainly they fought in the open we dealt with them thoroughly through a long day and when all was finished one man dived clear of the wreckage of his ship and swam towards shore i waited and a wave tumbled him at my feet  as i stooped i saw he wore such a medal as i wear parnesius raised his hand to his neck therefore when he could speak i addressed him a certain question which can only be answered in a certain manner he answered with the necessary wordthe word that belongs to the degree of gryphons in the science of mithras my god i put my shield over him till he could stand up you see i am not short but he was a head taller than i he said what now i said at your pleasure my brother to stay or go  he looked out across the surf there remained one ship unhurt beyond range of our catapults i checked the catapults and he waved her in she came as a hound comes to a master when she was yet a hundred paces from the beach he flung back his hair and swam out they hauled him in and went away i knew that those who worship mithras are many and of all races so i did not think much more upon the matter  a month later i saw allo with his horsesby the temple of pan o faunand he gave me a great necklace of gold studded with coral  at first i thought it was a bribe from some tradesman in the townmeant for old rutilianus nay said allo this is a gift from amal that winged hat whom you saved on the beach he says you are a man  he is a man too tell him i can wear his gift i answered  oh amal is a young fool but speaking as sensible men your emperor is doing such great things in gaul that the winged hats are anxious to be his friends or better still the friends of his servants they think you and pertinax could lead them to victories allo looked at me like a oneeyed raven  allo i said you are the corn between the two millstones be content if they grind evenly and dont thrust your hand between them  i said allo i hate rome and the winged hats equally but if the winged hats thought that some day you and pertinax might join them against maximus they would leave you in peace while you considered time is what we needyou and i and maximus let me carry a pleasant message back to the winged hatssomething for them to make a council over we barbarians are all alike we sit up half the night to discuss anything a roman says eh  we have no men we must fight with words said pertinax leave it to allo and me  so allo carried word back to the winged hats that we would not fight them if they did not fight us and they i think they were a little tired of losing men in the sea agreed to a sort of truce i believe allo who being a horsedealer loved lies also told them we might some day rise against maximus as maximus had risen against rome  indeed they permitted the cornships which i sent to the picts to pass north that season without harm therefore the picts were well fed that winter and since they were in some sort my children i was glad of it we had only two thousand men on the wall and i wrote many times to maximus and beggedprayedhim to send me only one cohort of my old north british troops he could not spare them he needed them to win more victories in gaul  then came news that he had defeated and slain the emperor gratian and thinking he must now be secure i wrote again for men he answered you will learn that i have at last settled accounts with the pup gratian there was no need that he should have died but he became confused and lost his head which is a bad thing to befall any emperor tell your father i am content to drive two mules only for unless my old generals son thinks himself destined to destroy me i shall rest emperor of gaul and britain and then you my two children will presently get all the men you need just now i can spare none  what did he mean by his generals son said dan  he meant theodosius emperor of rome who was the son of theodosius the general under whom maximus had fought in the old pict war the two men never loved each other and when gratian made the younger theodosius emperor of the east at least so ive heard maximus carried on the war to the second generation it was his fate and it was his fall but theodosius the emperor is a good man as i know parnesius was silent for a moment and then continued  i wrote back to maximus that though we had peace on the wall i should be happier with a few more men and some new catapults he answered you must live a little longer under the shadow of my victories till i can see what young theodosius intends he may welcome me as a brotheremperor or he may be preparing an army in either case i cannot spare men just now  but he was always saying that cried una  it was true he did not make excuses but thanks as he said to the news of his victories we had no trouble on the wall for a long long time the picts grew fat as their own sheep among the heather and as many of my men as lived were well exercised in their weapons yes the wall looked strong for myself i knew how weak we were i knew that if even a false rumour of any defeat to maximus broke loose among the winged hats they might come down in earnest and thenthe wall must go for the picts i never cared but in those years i learned something of the strength of the winged hats they increased their strength every day but i could not increase my men maximus had emptied britain behind us and i felt myself to be a man with a rotten stick standing before a broken fence to turn bulls  thus my friends we lived on the wall waitingwaitingwaiting for the men that maximus never sent  presently he wrote that he was preparing an army against theodosius he wroteand pertinax read it over my shoulder in our quarters tell your father that my destiny orders me to drive three mules or be torn in pieces by them i hope within a year to finish with theodosius son of theodosius once and for all then you shall have britain to rule and pertinax if he chooses gaul today i wish strongly you were with me to beat my auxiliaries into shape do not i pray you believe any rumour of my sickness i have a little evil in my old body which i shall cure by riding swiftly into rome  said pertinax it is finished with maximus he writes as a man without hope i a man without hope can see this what does he add at the bottom of the roll tell pertinax i have met his late uncle the duumvir of divio and that he accounted to me quite truthfully for all his mothers monies i have sent her with a fitting escort for she is the mother of a hero to nicaea where the climate is warm  that is proof said pertinax nicaea is not far by sea from rome a woman there could take ship and fly to rome in time of war yes maximus foresees his death and is fulfilling his promises one by one but i am glad my uncle met him  you think blackly today i asked  i think truth the gods weary of the play we have played against them theodosius will destroy maximus it is finished  will you write him that i said  see what i shall write he answered and he took pen and wrote a letter cheerful as the light of day tender as a womans and full of jests even i reading over his shoulder took comfort from it tilli saw his face  and now he said sealing it we be two dead men my brother let us go to the temple  we prayed awhile to mithras where we had many times prayed before after that we lived day by day among evil rumours till winter came again  it happened one morning that we rode to the east shore and found on the beach a fairhaired man half frozen bound to some broken planks turning him over we saw by his beltbuckle that he was a goth of an eastern legion suddenly he opened his eyes and cried loudly he is dead the letters were with me but the winged hats sank the ship so saying he died between our hands  we asked not who was dead we knew we raced before the driving snow to hunno thinking perhaps allo might be there we found him already at our stables and he saw by our faces what we had heard  it was in a tent by the sea he stammered he was beheaded by theodosius he sent a letter to you written while he waited to be slain the winged hats met the ship and took it the news is running through the heather like fire blame me not i cannot hold back my young men any more  i would we could say as much for our men said pertinax laughing but gods be praised they cannot run away  what do you do said allo i bring an ordera messagefrom the winged hats that you join them with your men and march south to plunder britain  it grieves me said pertinax but we are stationed here to stop that thing  if i carry back such an answer they will kill me said allo i always promised the winged hats that you would rise when maximus fell ii did not think he could fall  alas my poor barbarian said pertinax still laughing well you have sold us too many good ponies to be thrown back to your friends we will make you a prisoner although you are an ambassador  yes that will be best said allo holding out a halter we bound him lightly for he was an old man  presently the winged hats may come to look for you and that will give us more time see how the habit of playing for time sticks to a man said pertinax as he tied the rope  no i said time may help if maximus wrote us a letter while he was a prisoner theodosius must have sent the ship that brought it if he can send ships he can send men  how will that profit us said pertinax we serve maximus not theodosius even if by some miracle of the gods theodosius down south sent and saved the wall we could not expect more than the death maximus died  it concerns us to defend the wall no matter what emperor dies or makes die i said  that is worthy of your brother the philosopher said pertinax myself i am without hope so i do not say solemn and stupid things rouse the wall  we armed the wall from end to end we told the officers that there was a rumour of maximuss death which might bring down the winged hats but we were sure even if it were true that theodosius for the sake of britain would send us help therefore we must stand fast  my friends it is above all things strange to see how men bear ill news often the strongest till then become the weakest while the weakest as it were reach up and steal strength from the gods so it was with us yet my pertinax by his jests and his courtesy and his labours had put heart and training into our poor numbers during the past yearsmore than i should have thought possible even our libyan cohortthe thirdstood up in their padded cuirasses and did not whimper  in three days came seven chiefs and elders of the winged hats among them was that tall young man amal whom i had met on the beach and he smiled when he saw my necklace we made them welcome for they were ambassadors we showed them allo alive but bound they thought we had killed him and i saw it would not have vexed them if we had allo saw it too and it vexed him then in our quarters at hunno we came to council  they said that rome was falling and that we must join them they offered me all south britain to govern after they had taken a tribute out of it  i answered patience this wall is not weighed off like plunder give me proof that my general is dead  nay said one elder prove to us that he lives and another said cunningly what will you give us if we read you his last words  we are not merchants to bargain cried amal moreover i owe this man my life he shall have his proof he threw across to me a letter well i knew the seal from maximus  we took this out of the ship we sank he cried i cannot read but i know one sign at least which makes me believe he showed me a dark stain on the outer roll that my heavy heart perceived was the valiant blood of maximus  read said amal read and then let us hear whose servants you are  said pertinax very softly after he had looked through it i will read it all listen barbarians he read that which i have carried next my heart ever since  parnesius drew from his neck a folded and spotted piece of parchment and began in a hushed voice  to parnesius and pertinax the not unworthy captains of the wall from maximus once emperor of gaul and britain now prisoner waiting death by the sea in the camp of theodosiusgreeting and goodbye  enough said young amal there is your proof you must join us now  pertinax looked long and silently at him till that fair man blushed like a girl then read pertinax  i have joyfully done much evil in my life to those who have wished me evil but if ever i did any evil to you two i repent and i ask your forgiveness the three mules which i strove to drive have torn me in pieces as your father prophesied the naked swords wait at the tent door to give me the death i gave to gratian therefore i your general and your emperor send you free and honourable dismissal from my service which you entered not for money or office but as it makes me warm to believe because you loved me  by the light of the sun amal broke in this was in some sort a man we may have been mistaken in his servants  and pertinax read on you gave me the time for which i asked if i have failed to use it do not lament we have gambled very splendidly against the gods but they hold weighted dice and i must pay the forfeit remember i have been but rome is and rome will be tell pertinax his mother is in safety at nicaea and her monies are in charge of the prefect at antipolis make my remembrances to your father and to your mother whose friendship was great gain to me give also to my little picts and to the winged hats such messages as their thick heads can understand i would have sent you three legions this very day if all had gone aright do not forget me we have worked together farewell farewell farewell  now that was my emperors last letter the children heard the parchment crackle as parnesius returned it to its place  i was mistaken said amal the servants of such a man will sell nothing except over the sword i am glad of it he held out his hand to me  but maximus has given you your dismissal said an elder you are certainly free to serveor to rulewhom you please joindo not followjoin us  we thank you said pertinax but maximus tells us to give you such messages aspardon me but i use his wordsyour thick heads can understand he pointed through the door to the foot of a catapult wound up  we understand said an elder the wall must be won at a price  it grieves me said pertinax laughing but so it must be won and he gave them of our best southern wine  they drank and wiped their yellow beards in silence till they rose to go  said amal stretching himself for they were barbarians we be a goodly company i wonder what the ravens and the dogfish will make of some of us before this snow melts  think rather what theodosius may send i answered and though they laughed i saw that my chance shot troubled them  only old allo lingered behind a little  you see he said winking and blinking i am no more than their dog when i have shown their men the secret short ways across our bogs they will kick me like one  then i should not be in haste to show them those ways said pertinax till i was sure that rome could not save the wall  you think so woe is me said the old man i only wanted peace for my people and he went out stumbling through the snow behind the tall winged hats  in this fashion then slowly a day at a time which is very bad for doubting troops the war came upon us at first the winged hats swept in from the sea as they had done before and there we met them as beforewith the catapults and they sickened of it yet for a long time they would not trust their ducklegs on land and i think when it came to revealing the secrets of the tribe the little picts were afraid or ashamed to show them all the roads across the heather i had this from a pict prisoner they were as much our spies as our enemies for the winged hats oppressed them and took their winter stores ah foolish little people  then the winged hats began to roll us up from each end of the wall i sent runners southward to see what the news might be in britain but the wolves were very bold that winter among the deserted stations where the troops had once been and none came back we had trouble too with the forage for the ponies along the wall i kept ten and so did pertinax we lived and slept in the saddle riding east or west and we ate our wornout ponies the people of the town also made us some trouble till i gathered them all in one quarter behind hunno we broke down the wall on either side of it to make as it were a citadel our men fought better in close order  by the end of the second month we were deep in the war as a man is deep in a snowdrift or in a dream i think we fought in our sleep at least i know i have gone on the wall and come off again remembering nothing between though my throat was harsh with giving orders and my sword i could see had been used  the winged hats fought like wolvesall in a pack where they had suffered most there they charged in most hotly this was hard for the defenders but it held them from sweeping on into britain  in those days pertinax and i wrote on the plaster of the bricked archway into valentia the names of the towers and the days on which they fell one by one we wished for some record  and the fighting the fight was always hottest to left and right of the great statue of roma dea near to rutilianuss house by the light of the sun that old fat man whom we had not considered at all grew young again among the trumpets i remember he said his sword was an oracle let us consult the oracle he would say and put the handle against his ear and shake his head wisely and this day is allowed rutilianus to live he would say and tucking up his cloak he would puff and pant and fight well oh there were jests in plenty on the wall to take the place of food  we endured for two months and seventeen daysalways being pressed from three sides into a smaller space several times allo sent in word that help was at hand we did not believe it but it cheered our men the end came not with shoutings of joy but like the rest as in a dream the winged hats suddenly left us in peace for one night and the next day which is too long for spent men we slept at first lightly expecting to be roused and then like logs each where he lay may you never need such sleep when i waked our towers were full of strange armed men who watched us snoring i roused pertinax and we leaped up together  what said a young man in clean armour do you fight against theodosius look  north we looked over the red snow no winged hats were there south we looked over the white snow and behold there were the eagles of two strong legions encamped east and west we saw flame and fighting but by hunno all was still  trouble no more said the young man romes arm is long where are the captains of the wall  we said we were those men  but you are old and greyhaired he cried maximus said that they were boys  yes that was true some years ago said pertinax what is our fate to be you fine and wellfed child  i am called ambrosius a secretary of the emperor he answered show me a certain letter which maximus wrote from a tent at aquileia and perhaps i will believe  i took it from my breast and when he had read it he saluted us saying your fate is in your own hands if you choose to serve theodosius he will give you a legion if it suits you to go to your homes we will give you a triumph  i would like better a bath wine food razors soaps oils and scents said pertinax laughing  oh i see you are a boy said ambrosius and you turning to me  we bear no illwill against theodosius but in war i began  in war it is as it is in love said pertinax whether she be good or bad one gives ones best once to one only that given there remains no second worth giving or taking  that is true said ambrosius i was with maximus before he died he warned theodosius that you would never serve him and frankly i say i am sorry for my emperor  he has rome to console him said pertinax i ask you of your kindness to let us go to our homes and get this smell out of our nostrils  none the less they gave us a triumph   it was well earned said puck throwing some leaves into the still water of the marlpit the black oily circles spread dizzily as the children watched them  i want to know oh ever so many things said dan what happened to old allo did the winged hats ever come back and what did amal do  and what happened to the fat old general with the five cooks said una and what did your mother say when you came home   shed say youre settin too long over this old pit so late as tis already said old hobdens voice behind them hst he whispered  he stood still for not twenty paces away a magnificent dogfox sat on his haunches and looked at the children as though he were an old friend of theirs  oh mus reynolds mus reynolds said hobden under his breath if i knowed all was inside your head id know something wuth knowin mus dan an miss una come along o me while i lock up my liddle henhouse    a pict song   rome never looks where she treads   always her heavy hooves fall on our stomachs our hearts or our heads   and rome never heeds when we bawl her sentries pass onthat is all   and we gather behind them in hordes and plot to reconquer the wall   with only our tongues for our swords  we are the little folkwe   too little to love or to hate leave us alone and youll see   how we can drag down the great we are the worm in the wood   we are the rot at the root we are the germ in the blood   we are the thorn in the foot  mistletoe killing an oak   rats gnawing cables in two moths making holes in a cloak   how they must love what they do yesand we little folk too   we are as busy as they working our works out of view watch and youll see it some day  no indeed we are not strong   but we know peoples that are yes and well guide them along   to smash and destroy you in war we shall be slaves just the same   yes we have always been slaves but youyou will die of the shame   and then we shall dance on your graves    we are the little folk we etc     hal o the draft   prophets have honour all over the earth   except in the village where they were born where such as knew them boys from birth   natureally hold em in scorn  when prophets are naughty and young and vain   they make a wonerful grievance of it you can see by their writings how they complain   but oh tis wonerful good for the prophet  theres nothing nineveh town can give   nor being swallowed by whales between makes up for the place where a mans folk live   that dont care nothing what he has been he might ha been that or he might ha been this but they love and they hate him for what he is    a rainy afternoon drove dan and una over to play pirates in the little mill if you dont mind rats on the rafters and oats in your shoes the millattic with its trapdoors and inscriptions on beams about floods and sweethearts is a splendid place it is lighted by a footsquare window called duck window that looks across to little lindens farm and the spot where jack cade was killed  when they had climbed the attic ladder they called it the mainmast tree out of the ballad of sir andrew barton and dan swarved it with might and main as the ballad says they saw a man sitting on duck windowsill he was dressed in a plumcoloured doublet and tight plumcoloured hose and he drew busily in a rededged book  sit ye sit ye puck cried from a rafter overhead see what it is to be beautiful sir harry dawepardon halsays i am the very image of a head for a gargoyle  the man laughed and raised his dark velvet cap to the children and his grizzled hair bristled out in a stormy fringe he was oldforty at leastbut his eyes were young with funny little wrinkles all round them a satchel of embroidered leather hung from his broad belt which looked interesting  may we see said una coming forward  surelysurely he said moving up on the windowseat and returned to his work with a silverpointed pencil puck sat as though the grin were fixed for ever on his broad face while they watched the quick certain fingers that copied it presently the man took a reed pen from his satchel and trimmed it with a little ivory knife carved in the semblance of a fish  oh what a beauty cried dan  ware fingers that blade is perilous sharp i made it myself of the best low country crossbow steel and so too this fish when his backfin travels to his tailsohe swallows up the blade even as the whale swallowed gaffer jonah  yes and thats my inkhorn i made the four silver saints round it press barnabass head it opens and then he dipped the trimmed pen and with careful boldness began to put in the essential lines of pucks rugged face that had been but faintly revealed by the silverpoint  the children gasped for it fairly leaped from the page  as he worked and the rain fell on the tiles he talkednow clearly now muttering now breaking off to frown or smile at his work he told them he was born at little lindens farm and his father used to beat him for drawing things instead of doing things till an old priest called father roger who drew illuminated letters in rich peoples books coaxed the parents to let him take the boy as a sort of painters apprentice then he went with father roger to oxford where he cleaned plates and carried cloaks and shoes for the scholars of a college called merton  didnt you hate that said dan after a great many other questions  i never thought ont half oxford was building new colleges or beautifying the old and she had called to her aid the mastercraftsmen of all christendiekings in their trade and honoured of kings i knew them i worked for them that was enough no wonder he stopped and laughed  you became a great man hal said puck  they said so robin even bramante said so  why what did you do dan asked  the artist looked at him queerly things in stone and such up and down england you would not have heard of em to come nearer home i rebuilded this little st barnabas church of ours it cost me more trouble and sorrow than aught ive touched in my life but twas a sound lesson  um said dan weve had lessons this morning  ill not afflict ye lad said hal while puck roared only tis strange to think how that little church was rebuilt reroofed and made glorious thanks to some few godly sussex ironmasters a bristow sailor lad a proud ass called hal o the draft because dyou see he was always drawing and drafting andhe dragged the words slowlyand a scotch pirate  pirate said dan he wriggled like a hooked fish  even that andrew barton you were singing of on the stair just now he dipped again in the inkwell and held his breath over a sweeping line as though he had forgotten everything else  pirates dont build churches do they said dan or do they  they help mightily hal laughed but you were at your lessons this morn jack scholar  oh pirates arent lessons it was only bruce and his silly old spider said una why did sir andrew barton help you  i question if he ever knew it said hal twinkling robin how a mischiefs name am i to tell these innocents what comes of sinful pride  oh we know all about that said una pertly if you get too beanythats cheekyyou get sat upon of course  hal considered a moment pen in air and puck said some long words  aha that was my case too he cried beanyyou saybut certainly i did not conduct myself well i was proud ofof such things as porchesa galilee porch at lincoln for choiceproud of one torrigianos arm on my shoulder proud of my knighthood when i made the gilt scrollwork for the sovereignour kings ship but father roger sitting in merton library he did not forget me at the top of my pride when i and no other should have builded the porch at lincoln he laid it on me with a terrible forefinger to go back to my sussex clays and rebuild at my own charges my own church where us dawes have been buried for six generations out son of my art said he fight the devil at home ere you call yourself a man and a craftsman and i quaked and i went  hows yon robin he flourished the finished sketch before puck  me me past peradventure said puck smirking like a man at a mirror ah see the rain has took off i hate housen in daylight  whoop holiday cried hal leaping up whos for my little lindens we can talk there  they tumbled downstairs and turned past the dripping willows by the sunny milldam  body o me said hal staring at the hopgarden where the hops were just ready to blossom what are these vines no not vines and they twine the wrong way to beans he began to draw in his ready book  hops new since your day said puck theyre an herb of mars and their flowers dried flavour ale we say  turkeys heresy hops and beer came into england all in one year  heresy i know ive seen hopsgod be praised for their beauty what is your turkis  the children laughed they knew the lindens turkeys and as soon as they reached lindens orchard on the hill the full flock charged at them  out came hals book at once hoitytoity he cried heres pride in purple feathers heres wrathy contempt and the pomps of the flesh how dyou call them  turkeys turkeys the children shouted as the old gobbler raved and flamed against hals plumcoloured hose  save your magnificence he said ive drafted two good new things today and he doffed his cap to the bubbling bird  then they walked through the grass to the knoll where little lindens stands the old farmhouse weathertiled to the ground took almost the colour of a bloodruby in the afternoon light the pigeons pecked at the mortar in the chimneystacks the bees that had lived under the tiles since it was built filled the hot august air with their booming and the smell of the boxtree by the dairywindow mixed with the smell of earth after rain bread after baking and a tickle of woodsmoke  the farmers wife came to the door baby on arm shaded her brows against the sun stooped to pluck a sprig of rosemary and turned down the orchard the old spaniel in his barrel barked once or twice to show he was in charge of the empty house puck clicked back the gardengate  dyou marvel that i love it said hal in a whisper what can town folk know of the nature of housenor land  they perched themselves arow on the old hacked oak bench in lindens garden looking across the valley of the brook at the ferncovered dimples and hollows of the forge behind hobdens cottage the old man was cutting a faggot in his garden by the hives it was quite a second after his chopper fell that the chump of the blow reached their lazy ears  ehyeh said hal i mind when where that old gaffer stands was nether forgemaster john collinss foundry many a night has his big triphammer shook me in my bed here boombitty boombitty if the wind was east i could hear master tom collinss forge at stockens answering his brother boomoop boomoop and midway between sir john pelhams sledgehammers at brightling would strike in like a pack o scholars and hichaechoc theyd say hichaechoc till i fell asleep yes the valley was as full o forges and fineries as a may shaw o cuckoos all gone to grass now  what did they make said dan  guns for the kings shipsand for others serpentines and cannon mostly when the guns were cast down would come the kings officers and take our ploughoxen to haul them to the coast look heres one of the first and finest craftsmen of the sea  he fluttered back a page of his book and showed them a young mans head underneath was written sebastianus  he came down with a kings order on master john collins for twenty serpentines wicked little cannon they be to furnish a venture of ships i drafted him thus sitting by our fire telling mother of the new lands hed find the far side the world and he found them too theres a nose to cleave through unknown seas cabot was his namea bristol ladhalf a foreigner i set a heap by him he helped me to my churchbuilding  i thought that was sir andrew barton said dan  ay but foundations before roofs hal answered sebastian first put me in the way of it i had come down here not to serve god as a craftsman should but to show my people how great a craftsman i was they cared not and it served me right one split straw for my craft or my greatness what a murrain call had i they said to mell with old st barnabas ruinous the church had been since the black death and ruinous she would remain and i could hang myself in my new scaffoldropes gentle and simple high and lowthe hayes the fowles the fenners the collinsesthey were all in a tale against me only sir john pelham up yonder at brightling bade me heartup and go on yet how could i did i ask master collins for his timbertug to haul beams the oxen had gone to lewes after lime did he promise me a set of iron cramps or ties for the roof they never came to hand or else they were spaulty or cracked so with everything nothing said but naught done except i stood by them and then done amiss i thought the countryside was fair bewitched  it was surely said puck knees under chin did you never suspect ary one  not till sebastian came for his guns and john collins played him the same dogs tricks as hed played me with my ironwork week in week out two of three serpentines would be flawed in the casting and only fit they said to be remelted then john collins would shake his head and vow he could pass no cannon for the kings service that were not perfect saints how sebastian stormed i know for we sat on this bench sharing our sorrows intercommon  when sebastian had fumed away six weeks at lindens and gotten just six serpentines dirk brenzett master of the cygnet hoy sends me word that the block of stone he was fetching me from france for our new font hed hove overboard to lighten his ship chased by andrew barton up to rye port  ah the pirate said dan  yes and while i am tearing my hair over this ticehurst will my best mason comes to me shaking and vowing that the devil horned tailed and chained has run out on him from the churchtower and the men would work there no more so i took em off the foundations which we were strengthening and went into the bell tavern for a cup of ale says master john collins have it your own way lad but if i was you id take the sinnification o the sign and leave old barnabas church alone and they all wagged their sinful heads and agreed less afraid of the devil than of meas i saw later  when i brought my sweet news to lindens sebastian was limewashing the kitchenbeams for mother he loved her like a son  cheer up lad he says gods where he was only you and i chance to be pure pute asses weve been tricked hal and more shame to me a sailor that i did not guess it before you must leave your belfry alone forsooth because the devil is adrift there and i cannot get my serpentines because john collins cannot cast them aright meantime andrew barton hawks off the port of rye and why to take those very serpentines which poor cabot must whistle for the said serpentines ill wager my share of new continents being now hid away in st barnabas churchtower clear as the irish coast at noonday  theyd sure never dare to do it i said and for another thing selling cannon to the kings enemies is black treasonhanging and fine  it is sure large profit menll dare any gallows for that i have been a trader myself says he we must be upsides with em for the honour of bristol  then he hatched a plot sitting on the limewash bucket we gave out to ride o tuesday to london and made a show of taking farewells of our friendsespecially of master john collins but at wadhurst woods we turned rode home to the watermeadows hid our horses in a willowtot at the foot of the glebe and come night stole atiptoe up hill to barnabas church again a thick mist and a moon striking through  i had no sooner locked the towerdoor behind us than over goes sebastian full length in the dark  pest he says step high and feel low hal ive stumbled over guns before  i groped and one by onethe tower was pitchy darki counted the lither barrels of twenty serpentines laid out on pease straw no conceal at all  theres two demicannon my end says sebastian slapping metal theyll be for andrew bartons lower deck honesthonest john collins so this is his warehouse his arsenal his armoury now see you why your pokings and pryings have raised the devil in sussex youve hindered johns lawful trade for months and he laughed where he lay  a claycold tower is no fireside at midnight so we climbed the belfry stairs and there sebastian trips over a cowhide with its horns and tail  aha your devil has left his doublet does it become me hal he draws it on and capers in the shafts of windowmoonlightwonerful devilishlike then he sits on the stairs rapping with his tail on a board and his backaspect was dreader than his front and a howlet lit in and screeched at the horns of him  if youd keep out the devil shut the door he whispered and thats another false proverb hal for i can hear your towerdoor opening  i locked it who aplague has another key then i said  all the congregation to judge by their feet he says and peers into the blackness still still hal hear em grunt thats more o my serpentines ill be bound onetwothreefour they bear in faith andrew equips himself like an admiral twentyfour serpentines in all  as if it had been an echo we heard john collinss voice come up all hollow twentyfour serpentines and two demicannon thats the full tally for sir andrew barton  courtesy costs naught whispers sebastian shall i drop my dagger on his head  they go over to rye o thursday in the woolwains hid under the woolpacks dirk brenzett meets them at udimore as before says john  lord what a worn handsmooth trade it is says sebastian i lay we are the sole two babes in the village that have not our lawful share in the venture  there was a full score folk below talking like all robertsbridge market we counted them by voice  master john collins pipes the guns for the french carrack must lie here next month will when does your young fool me so please you come back from lunnon  no odds i heard ticehurst will answer lay em just where youve a mind mus collins were all too afraid o the devil to mell with the tower now and the long knave laughed  ah tis easy enow for you to raise the devil will says anotherralph hobden of the forge  aaamen roars sebastian and ere i could hold him he leaps down the stairswonerful devilishlike howling no bounds he had scarce time to lay out for the nearest than they ran saints how they ran we heard them pound on the door of the bell tavern and then we ran too  whats next says sebastian looping up his cowtail as he leaped the briars ive broke honest johns face  ride to sir john pelhams i said he is the only one that ever stood by me  we rode to brightling and past sir johns lodges where the keepers would have shot at us for deerstealers and we had sir john down into his justices chair and when we had told him our tale and showed him the cowhide which sebastian wore still girt about him he laughed till the tears ran  welawell he says ill see justice done before daylight whats your complaint master collins is my old friend  hes none of mine i cried when i think how he and his likes have baulked and dozened and cozened me at every turn over the churchand i choked at the thought  ah but ye see now they needed it for another use says he smoothly  so they did my serpentines sebastian cries i should be half across the western ocean by now if my guns had been ready but theyre sold to a scotch pirate by your old friend  wheres your proof says sir john stroking his beard  i broke my shins over them not an hour since and i heard john give order where they were to be taken says sebastian  words words only says sir john master collins is somewhat of a liar at best  he carried it so gravely that for the moment i thought he was dipped in this secret traffick too and that there was not an honest ironmaster in sussex  name o reason says sebastian and raps with his cowtail on the table whose guns are they then  yours manifestly says sir john you come with the kings order for em and master collins casts them in his foundry if he chooses to bring them up from nether forge and lay em out in the churchtower why they are een so much the nearer to the main road and you are saved a days hauling what a coil to make of a mere act of neighbourly kindness lad  i fear i have requited him very scurvily says sebastian looking at his knuckles but what of the demicannon i could do with em well but they are not in the kings order  kindnesslovingkindness says sir john questionless in his zeal for the king and his love for you john adds those two cannon as a gift tis plain as this coming daylight ye stockfish  so it is says sebastian oh sir john sir john why did you never use the sea you are lost ashore and he looked on him with great love  i do my best in my station sir john strokes his beard again and rolls forth his deep drumming justices voice thus butsuffer meyou two lads on some midnight frolic into which i probe not roystering around the taverns surprise master collins at hishe thinks a momentat his good deeds done by stealth ye surprise him i say cruelly  truth sir john if you had seen him run says sebastian  on this you ride breakneck to me with a tale of pirates and woolwains and cowhides which though it hath moved my mirth as a man offendeth my reason as a magistrate so i will een accompany you back to the tower with perhaps some few of my own people and threefour wagons and ill be your warrant that master john collins will freely give you your guns and your demicannon master sebastian he breaks into his proper voicei warned the old tod and his neighbours long ago that theyd come to trouble with their sidesellings and byedealings but we cannot have half sussex hanged for a little gunrunning are ye content lads  id commit any treason for two demicannon said sebastian and rubs his hands  ye have just compounded with rank treasonfelony for the same bribe says sir john wherefore to horse and get the guns  but master collins meant the guns for sir andrew barton all along didnt he said dan  questionless that he did said hal but he lost them we poured into the village on the red edge of dawn sir john horsed in halfarmour his pennon flying behind him thirty stout brightling knaves five abreast behind them four woolwains and behind them four trumpets to triumph over the jest blowing our king went forth to normandie when we halted and rolled the ringing guns out of the tower twas for all the world like friar rogers picture of the french siege in the queens missalbook  and what did wei mean what did our village do said dan  oh bore it noblynobly cried hal though they had tricked me i was proud of them they came out of their housen looked at that little army as though it had been a post and went their shutmouthed way never a sign never a word theyd ha perished sooner than let brightling overcrow us even that villain ticehurst will coming out of the bell for his morning ale he all but runs under sir johns horse  ware sirrah devil cries sir john reining back  oh says will marketday is it and all the bullocks from brightling here  i spared him his belting for thatthe brazen knave  but john collins was our masterpiece he happened alongstreet his jaw tied up where sebastian had clouted him when we were trundling the first demicannon through the lychgate  i reckon youll find her middlin heavy he says if youve a mind to pay ill loan ye my timbertug she wont lie easy on ary woolwain  that was the one time i ever saw sebastian taken flat aback he opened and shut his mouth fishylike  no offence says master john youve got her reasonable good cheap i thought ye might not grudge me a groat if i helped move her ah he was a masterpiece they say that mornings work cost our john two hundred pounds and he never winked an eyelid not even when he saw the guns all carted off to lewes  neither then nor later said puck  once twas after he gave st barnabas the new chime of bells oh there was nothing the collinses or the hayes or the fowles or the fenners would not do for the church then ask and have was their song we had rung em in and he was in the tower with black nick fowle that gave us our roodscreen the old man pinches the bellrope one hand and scratches his neck with tother sooner she was pulling yon clapper than my neck he says that was all that was sussexseely sussex for everlastin  and what happened after said una  i went back into england said hal slowly id had my lesson against pride but they tell me i left st barnabas a jeweljustabout a jewel welawell twas done for and among my own people andfather roger was righti never knew such trouble or such triumph since thats the nature o things a deardear land he dropped his chin on his chest  theres your father at the forge whats he talking to old hobden about said puck opening his hand with three leaves in it  dan looked towards the cottage  oh i know its that old oak lying across the brook pater always wants it grubbed  in the still valley they could hear old hobdens deep tones  have it as youve a mind to he was saying but the vivers of her roots they hold the bank together if you grub her out the bank shell all come tearin down an next floods the brookll swarve up but have it as youve a mind the mistuss she sets a heap by the ferns on her trunk  oh ill think it over said the pater  una laughed a little bubbling chuckle  what devils in that belfry said hal with a lazy laugh that should be a hobden by his voice  why the oak is the regular bridge for all the rabbits between the three acre and our meadow the best place for wires on the farm hobden says hes got two there now una answered he wont ever let it be grubbed  ah sussex sillly sussex for everlastin murmured hal and the next moment their fathers voice calling across to little lindens broke the spell as little st barnabas clock struck five    a smugglers song   if you wake at midnight and hear a horses feet dont go drawing back the blind or looking in the street them that asks no

soft september rain began to fall on the hoppickers the mothers wheeled the bouncing perambulators out of the gardens bins were put away and tallybooks made up the young couples strolled home two to each umbrella and the single men walked behind them laughing dan and una who had been picking after their lessons marched off to roast potatoes at the oasthouse where old hobden with blueeyed bess his lurcher dog lived all the month through drying the hops  they settled themselves as usual on the sackstrewn cot in front of the fires and when hobden drew up the shutter stared as usual at the flameless bed of coals spouting its heat up the dark well of the oldfashioned roundel slowly he cracked off a few fresh pieces of coal packed them with fingers that never flinched exactly where they would do most good slowly he reached behind him till dan tilted the potatoes into his iron scoop of a hand carefully he arranged them round the fire and then stood for a moment black against the glare as he closed the shutter the oasthouse seemed dark before the days end and he lit the candle in the lanthorn the children liked all these things because they knew them so well  the bee boy hobdens son who is not quite right in his head though he can do anything with bees slipped in like a shadow they only guessed it when besss stumptail wagged against them  a big voice began singing outside in the drizzle  old mother laidinwool had nigh twelve months been dead she heard the hops were doin well and then popped up her head  there cant be two people made to holler like that cried old hobden wheeling round  for says she the boys ive picked with when i was young and fair theyre bound to be at hoppin and im  a man showed at the doorway  well well they do say hoppin ll draw the very deadest and now i belieft em you tom tom shoesmith hobden lowered his lanthorn  youre a hem of a time makin your mind to it ralph the stranger strode inthree full inches taller than hobden a greywhiskered brownfaced giant with clear blue eyes they shook hands and the children could hear the hard palms rasp together  you aint lost none o your grip said hobden was it thirty or forty year back you broke my head at peasmarsh fair  only thirty an no odds tween us regardin heads neither you had it back at me with a hoppole how did we get home that night swimmin  same way the pheasant come into gubbss pocketby a little luck an a deal o conjurin old hobden laughed in his deep chest  i see youve not forgot your way about the woods dye do any o this still the stranger pretended to look along a gun  hobden answered with a quick movement of the hand as though he were pegging down a rabbitwire  no thats all thats left me now age she must as age she can an whats your news since all these years  oh ive bin to plymouth ive bin to dover ive bin ramblin boys the wide world over  the man answered cheerily i reckon i know as much of old england as most he turned towards the children and winked boldly  i lay they told you a sight o lies then ive been into england fur as wiltsheer once i was cheated proper over a pair of hedgingloves said hobden  theres fancytalkin everywhere youve cleaved to your own parts pretty middlin close ralph  cant shift an old tree thout it dyin hobden chuckled an i be no more anxious to die than you look to be to help me with my hops tonight  the great man leaned against the brickwork of the roundel and swung his arms abroad hire me was all he said and they stumped upstairs laughing  the children heard their shovels rasp on the cloth where the yellow hops lie drying above the fires and all the oasthouse filled with the sweet sleepy smell as they were turned  who is it una whispered to the bee boy  dunno no moren youif you dunno said he and smiled  the voices on the dryingfloor talked and chuckled together and the heavy footsteps moved back and forth presently a hoppocket dropped through the presshole overhead and stiffened and fattened as they shovelled it full clank went the press and rammed the loose stuff into tight cake  gently they heard hobden cry youll bust her crop if you lay on so you be as careless as gleasons bull tom come an sit by the fires shell do now  they came down and as hobden opened the shutter to see if the potatoes were done tom shoesmith said to the children put a plenty salt on em thatll show you the sort o man i be again he winked and again the bee boy laughed and una stared at dan  i know what sort o man you be old hobden grunted groping for the potatoes round the fire  do ye tom went on behind his back some of us cant abide horseshoes or church bells or running water an talkin o runnin waterhe turned to hobden who was backing out of the roundeldyou mind the great floods at robertsbridge when the millers man was drowned in the street  middlin well old hobden let himself down on the coals by the firedoor i was courtin my woman on the marsh that year carter to mus plum i was gettin ten shillins week mine was a marsh woman  wonerful oddgates placeromney marsh said tom shoesmith ive heard say the worlds divided like into europe ashy afriky ameriky australy an romney marsh  the marsh folk think so said hobden i had a hem o trouble to get my woman to leave it  where did she come out of ive forgot ralph  dymchurch under the wall hobden answered a potato in his hand  then shed be a pettor a whitgift would she  whitgift hobden broke open the potato and ate it with the curious neatness of men who make most of their meals in the blowy open she growed to be quite reasonablelike after livin in the weald awhile but our first twenty year or two she was oddfashioned no bounds and she was a wonerful hand with bees he cut away a little piece of potato and threw it out to the door  ah ive heard say the whitgifts could see further through a millstone than most said shoesmith did she now  she was honestinnocent of any nigromancin said hobden only shed read signs and sinnifications out o birds flyin stars fallin bees hivin and such an shed lie awakelistenin for calls she said  that dont prove naught said tom all marsh folk has been smugglers since time everlastin twould be in her blood to listen out o nights  natureally old hobden replied smiling i mind when there was smugglin a sight nearer us than what the marsh be but that wasnt my womans trouble twas a passel o nosense talkhe dropped his voiceabout pharisees  yes ive heard marsh men belieft in em tom looked straight at the wideeyed children beside bess  pharisees cried una fairies oh i see  people o the hills said the bee boy throwing half of his potato towards the door  there you be said hobden pointing at him my boyhe has her eyes and her outgate sense thats what she called em  and what did you think of it all  umum hobden rumbled a man that uses fields an shaws after dark as much as ive done he dont go out of his road excep for keepers  but settin that aside said tom coaxingly i saw ye throw the good piece outatdoors just now do ye believe ordo ye  there was a great black eye to that tater said hobden indignantly  my liddle eye didnt see un then it looked as if you meant it forfor any one that might need it but settin that aside dye believe ordo ye  i aint sayin nothin because ive heard naught an ive see naught but if you was to say there was more things after dark in the shaws than men or fur or feather or fin i dunno as id go far about to call you a liar now turnagain tom whats your say  im like you i say nothin but ill tell you a tale an you can fit it as how you please  passel o nosense stuff growled hobden but he filled his pipe  the marsh men they call it dymchurch flit tom went on slowly hap you have heard it  my woman sheve told it me scores o times dunno as i didnt end by belieftin itsometimes  hobden crossed over as he spoke and sucked with his pipe at the yellow lanthorn flame tom rested one great elbow on one great knee where he sat among the coal  have you ever bin in the marsh he said to dan  only as far as rye once dan answered  ah thats but the edge back behind of her theres steeples settin beside churches an wise women settin beside their doors an the sea settin above the land an ducks herdin wild in the diks he meant ditches the marsh is justabout riddled with diks an sluices an tidegates an waterlets you can hear em bubblin an grummelin when the tide works in em an then you hear the sea rangin left and righthanded all up along the wall youve seen how flat she isthe marsh youd think nothin easier than to walk eendon acrost her ah but the diks an the waterlets they twists the roads about as ravelly as witchyarn on the spindles so ye get all turned round in broad daylight  thats because theyve dreened the waters into the diks said hobden when i courted my woman the rushes was greeneh me the rushes was greenan the bailiff o the marshes he rode up and down as free as the fog  who was he said dan  why the marsh fever an ague heve clapped me on the shoulder once or twice till i shook proper but now the dreenin off of the waters have done away with the fevers so they make a joke like that the bailiff o the marshes broke his neck in a dik a wonerful place for bees an ducks tis too  an old tom went on flesh an blood have been there since time everlastin beyond well now speakin among themselves the marsh men say that from time everlastin beyond the pharisees favoured the marsh above the rest of old england i lay the marsh men ought to know theyve been out after dark father an son smugglin some one thing or tother since ever wool grew to sheeps backs they say there was always a middlin few pharisees to be seen on the marsh impident as rabbits they was theyd dance on the nakid roads in the nakid daytime theyd flash their liddle green lights along the diks comin an goin like honest smugglers yes an times theyd lock the church doors against parson an clerk of sundays  that ud be smugglers layin in the lace or the brandy till they could run it out o the marsh ive told my woman so said hobden  ill lay she didnt belieft it thennot if she was a whitgift a wonerful choice place for pharisees the marsh by all accounts till queen besss father he come in with his reformatories  would that be a act of parliament like hobden asked  surely cant do nothing in old england without act warrant an summons he got his act allowed him an they say queen besss father he used the parish churches something shameful justabout tore the gizzards out of i dunnamany some folk in england they held with en but some they saw it different an it eended in em takin sides an burnin each other no bounds accordin which side was top time bein that tarrified the pharisees for goodwill among flesh an blood is meat an drink to em an illwill is poison  same as bees said the bee boy bees wont stay by a house where theres hating  true said tom this reformatories tarrified the pharisees same as the reaper goin round a last stand o wheat tarrifies rabbits they packed into the marsh from all parts and they says fair or foul we must flit out o this for merry englands done with an were reckoned among the images  did they all see it that way said hobden  all but one that was called robinif youve heard of him what are you laughin at tom turned to dan the phariseess trouble didnt tech robin because hed cleaved middlin close to people like no more he never meant to go out of old englandnot he so he was sent messagin for help among flesh an blood but flesh an blood must always think of their own concerns an robin couldnt get through at em ye see they thought it was tideechoes off the marsh  what did youwhat did the faipharisees want una asked  a boat to be sure their liddle wings could no more cross channel than so many tired butterflies a boat an a crew they desired to sail em over to france where yet awhile folks hadnt tore down the images they couldnt abide cruel canterbury bells ringin to bulverhithe for more pore men an women to be burnded nor the kings proud messenger ridin through the land givin orders to tear down the images they couldnt abide it no shape nor yet they couldnt get their boat an crew to flit by without leave an goodwill from flesh an blood an flesh an blood came an went about its own business the while the marsh was swarvin up an swarvin up with pharisees from all england over strivin all means to get through at flesh an blood to tell em their sore need  i dont know as youve ever heard say pharisees are like chickens  my woman used to say that too said hobden folding his brown arms  they be you run too many chickens together an the ground sickens like an you get a squat an your chickens die same way you crowd pharisees all in one placethey dont die but flesh an blood walkin among em is apt to sick up an pine off they dont mean it an flesh an blood dont know it but thats the truthas ive heard the pharisees through bein all stenched up an frighted an trying to come through with their supplications they natureally changed the thin airs an humours in flesh an blood it lay on the marsh like thunder men saw their churches ablaze with the wildfire in the windows after dark they saw their cattle scatterin an no man scarin their sheep flockin an no man drivin their horses latherin an no man leadin they saw the liddle low green lights more than ever in the diksides they heard the liddle feet patterin more than ever round the houses an night an day day an night twas all as though they were bein creeped up on an hinted at by some one or other that couldnt rightly shape their trouble oh i lay they sweated man an maid woman an child their nature done em no service all the weeks while the marsh was swarvin up with pharisees but they was flesh an blood an marsh men before all they reckoned the signs sinnified trouble for the marsh or that the sea ud rear up against dymchurch wall an theyd be drownded like old winchelsea or that the plague was comin so they looked for the meanin in the sea or in the cloudsfar an high up they never thought to look near an kneehigh where they could see naught  now there was a poor widow at dymchurch under the wall which lacking man or property she had the more time for feeling and she come to feel there was a trouble outside her doorstep bigger an heavier than aught shed ever carried over it she had two sonsone born blind an tother struck dumb through fallin off the wall when he was liddle they was men grown but not wageearnin an she worked for em keepin bees and answerin questions  what sort of questions said dan  like where lost things might be found an what to put about a crooked babys neck an how to join parted sweethearts she felt the trouble on the marsh same as eels feel thunder she was a wise woman  my woman was wonerful weathertender too said hobden ive seen her brish sparks like off an anvil out of her hair in thunderstorms but she never laid out to answer questions  this woman was a seeker like an seekers they sometimes find one night while she lay abed hot an achin there come a dream an tapped at her window an widow whitgift it said widow whitgift  first by the wings an the whistlin she thought it was peewits but last she arose an dressed herself an opened her door to the marsh an she felt the trouble an the groanin all about her strong as fever an ague an she calls what is it oh what is it  then twas all like the frogs in the diks peepin then twas all like the reeds in the diks clipclappin an then the great tidewave rummelled along the wall an she couldnt hear proper  three times she called an three times the tidewave did her down but she catched the quiet between an she cries out what is the trouble on the marsh thats been lying down with my heart an arising with my body this month gone she felt a liddle hand lay hold on her gownhem an she stooped to the pull o that liddle hand  tom shoesmith spread his huge fist before the fire and smiled at it  will the sea drown the marsh she says she was a marsh woman first an foremost  no says the liddle voice sleep sound for all o that  is the plague comin to the marsh she says them was all the ills she knowed  no sleep sound for all o that says robin  she turned about half mindful to go in but the liddle voices grieved that shrill an sorrowful she turns back an she cries if it is not a trouble of flesh an blood what can i do  the pharisees cried out upon her from all round to fetch them a boat to sail to france an come back no more  theres a boat on the wall she says but i cant push it down to the sea nor sail it when tis there  lend us your sons says all the pharisees give em leave an goodwill to sail it for us mothero mother  ones dumb an tothers blind she says but all the dearer me for that and youll lose them in the big sea the voices justabout pierced through her an there was childrens voices too she stood out all she could but she couldnt rightly stand against that so she says if you can draw my sons for your job ill not hinder em you cant ask no more of a mother  she saw them liddle green lights dance an cross till she was dizzy she heard them liddle feet patterin by the thousand she heard cruel canterbury bells ringing to bulverhithe an she heard the great tidewave ranging along the wall that was while the pharisees was workin a dream to wake her two sons asleep an while she bit on her fingers she saw them two shed bore come out an pass her with never a word she followed em cryin pitiful to the old boat on the wall an that they took an runned down to the sea  when theyd stepped mast an sail the blind son speaks mother were waitin your leave an goodwill to take them over  tom shoesmith threw back his head and half shut his eyes  eh me he said she was a fine valiant woman the widow whitgift she stood twistin the eends of her long hair over her fingers an she shook like a poplar makin up her mind the pharisees all about they hushed their children from cryin an they waited dumbstill she was all their dependence thout her leave an goodwill they could not pass for she was the mother so she shook like a apstree makin up her mind last she drives the word past her teeth an go she says go with my leave an goodwill  then i sawthen they say she had to brace back same as if she was wadin in tidewater for the pharisees just about flowed past herdown the beach to the boat i dunnamany of emwith their wives an childern an valooables all escapin out of cruel old england silver you could hear chinkin an liddle bundles hove down dunt on the bottomboards an passels o liddle swords an shields raklin an liddle fingers an toes scratchin on the boatside to board her when the two sons pushed her off that boat she sunk lower an lower but all the widow could see in it was her boys movin hamperedlike to get at the tackle up sail they did an away they went deep as a rye barge away into the offshore mists an the widow whitgift she sat down an eased her grief till mornin light  i never heard she was all alone said hobden  i remember now the one called robin he stayed with her they tell she was all too grievious to listen to his promises  ah she should ha made her bargain beforehand i allus told my woman so hobden cried  no she loaned her sons for a pure loveloan bein as she sensed the trouble on the marshes an was simple goodwillin to ease it tom laughed softly she done that yes she done that from hithe to bulverhithe fretty man an maid ailin woman an wailin child they took the advantage of the change in the thin airs just about as soon as the pharisees flitted folks come out fresh an shinin all over the marsh like snails after wet an that while the widow whitgift sat grievin on the wall she might have belieft usshe might have trusted her sons would be sent back she fussed no bounds when their boat come in after three days  and of course the sons were both quite cured said una  noo that would have been out o nature she got em back as she sent em the blind man he hadnt seen naught of anythin an the dumb man natureally he couldnt say aught of what hed seen i reckon that was why the pharisees pitched on em for the ferryin job  but what did youwhat did robin promise the widow said dan  what did he promise now tom pretended to think wasnt your woman a whitgift ralph didnt she ever say  she told me a passel o nosense stuff when he was born hobden pointed at his son there was always to be one of em that could see further into a millstone than most  me thats me said the bee boy so suddenly that they all laughed  ive got it now cried tom slapping his knee so long as whitgift blood lasted robin promised there would allers be one o her stock thatthat no trouble ud lie on no maid ud sigh on no night could frighten no fright could harm no harm could make sin an no woman could make a fool of  well aint that just me said the bee boy where he sat in the silver square of the great september moon that was staring into the oasthouse door  they was the exact words she told me when we first found he wasnt like others but it beats me how you known em said hobden  aha theres more under my hat besides hair tom laughed and stretched himself when ive seen these two young folk home well make a night of old days ralph with passin old taleseh an where might you live he said gravely to dan an do you think your pa ud give me a drink for takin you there missy  they giggled so at this that they had to run out tom picked them both up set one on each broad shoulder and tramped across the ferny pasture where the cows puffed milky puffs at them in the moonlight  oh puck puck i guessed you right from when you talked about the salt how could you ever do it una cried swinging along delighted  do what he said and climbed the stile by the pollard oak  pretend to be tom shoesmith said dan and they ducked to avoid the two little ashes that grow by the bridge over the brook tom was almost running  yes thats my name mus dan he said hurrying over the silent shining lawn where a rabbit sat by the big whitethorn near the croquet ground here you be he strode into the old kitchen yard and slid them down as ellen came to ask questions  im helping in mus sprays oasthouse he said to her no im no foreigner i knowed this country fore your mother was born anyes its dry work oastin miss thank you  ellen went to get a jug and the children went inmagicked once more by oak ash and thorn    a threepart song   im just in love with all these three the weald an the marsh an the down countrie nor i dont know which i love the most the weald or the marsh or the white chalk coast  ive buried my heart in a ferny hill twix a liddle low shaw an a great high gill oh hopbine yaller an woodsmoke blue i reckon youll keep her middling true  ive loosed my mind for to out an run on a marsh that was old when kings begun oh romney level an brenzett reeds i reckon you know what my mind needs  ive given my soul to the southdown grass an sheepbells tinkled where you pass oh firle an ditchling an sails at sea i reckon you keep my soul for me     the treasure and the law    song of the fifth river   when first by eden tree the four great rivers ran to each was appointed a man her prince and ruler to be  but after this was ordained the ancient legends tell there came dark israel for whom no river remained  then he that is wholly just said to him fling on the ground a handful of yellow dust and a fifth great river shall run mightier than these four in secret the earth around and her secret evermore shall be shown to thee and thy race  so it was said and done and deep in the veins of earth and fed by a thousand springs that comfort the marketplace or sap the power of kings the fifth great river had birth even as it was foretold the secret river of gold  and israel laid down his sceptre and his crown to brood on that river bank where the waters flashed and sank and burrowed in earth and fell and bided a season below for reason that none might know save only israel  he is lord of the last the fifth most wonderful flood he hears her thunder past and her song is in his blood he can foresay she will fall for he knows which fountain dries behind which desertbelt a thousand leagues to the south he can foresay she will rise he knows what far snows melt along what mountainwall a thousand leagues to the north he snuffs the coming drought as he snuffs the coming rain he knows what each will bring forth and turns it to his gain  a prince without a sword a ruler without a throne israel follows his quest in every land a guest of many lands a lord in no land king is he but the fifth great river keeps the secret of her deeps for israel alone as it was ordered to be    the treasure and the law   now it was the third week in november and the woods rang with the noise of pheasantshooting no one hunted that steep cramped country except the village beagles who as often as not escaped from their kennels and made a day of their own dan and una found a couple of them towling round the kitchengarden after the laundry cat the little brutes were only too pleased to go rabbiting so the children ran them all along the brook pastures and into little lindens farmyard where the old sow vanquished themand up to the quarryhole where they started a fox he headed for far wood and there they frightened out all the pheasants who were sheltering from a big beat across the valley then the cruel guns began again and they grabbed the beagles lest they should stray and get hurt  i wouldnt be a pheasantin novemberfor a lot dan panted as he caught folly by the neck why did you laugh that horrid way  i didnt said una sitting on flora the fat ladydog oh look the silly birds are going back to their own woods instead of ours where they would be safe  safe till it pleased you to kill them an old man so tall he was almost a giant stepped from behind the clump of hollies by volaterrae the children jumped and the dogs dropped like setters he wore a sweeping gown of dark thick stuff lined and edged with yellowish fur and he bowed a bentdown bow that made them feel both proud and ashamed then he looked at them steadily and they stared back without doubt or fear  you are not afraid he said running his hands through his splendid grey beard not afraid that those men yonderhe jerked his head towards the incessant poppop of the guns from the lower woodswill do you hurt  weelldan liked to be accurate especially when he was shyold hobda friend of mine told me that one of the beaters got peppered last weekhit in the leg i mean you see mr meyer will fire at rabbits but he gave waxy garnett a quidsovereign i meanand waxy told hobden hed have stood both barrels for half the money  he doesnt understand una cried watching the pale troubled face oh i wish  she had scarcely said it when puck rustled out of the hollies and spoke to the man quickly in foreign words puck wore a long cloak toothe afternoon was just frosting downand it changed his appearance altogether  nay nay he said at last you did not understand the boy a freeman was a little hurt by pure mischance at the hunting  i know that mischance what did his lord do laugh and ride over him the old man sneered  it was one of your own people did the hurt kadmiel pucks eyes twinkled maliciously so he gave the freeman a piece of gold and no more was said  a jew drew blood from a christian and no more was said kadmiel cried never when did they torture him  no man may be bound or fined or slain till he has been judged by his peers puck insisted there is but one law in old england for jew or christianthe law that was signed at runnymede  why thats magna charta dan whispered it was one of the few history dates that he could remember kadmiel turned on him with a sweep and a whirr of his spicyscented gown  dost thou know of that babe he cried and lifted his hands in wonder  yes said dan firmly  magna charta was signed by john that henry the third put his heel upon  and old hobden says that if it hadnt been for her he calls everything her you know the keepers would have him clapped in lewes gaol all the year round  again puck translated to kadmiel in the strange solemnsounding language and at last kadmiel laughed  out of the mouths of babes do we learn said he but tell me now and i will not call you a babe but a rabbi why did the king sign the roll of the new law at runnymede for he was a king  dan looked sideways at his sister it was her turn  because he jolly well had to said una softly the barons made him  nay kadmiel answered shaking his head you christians always forget that gold does more than the sword our good king signed because he could not borrow more money from us bad jews he curved his shoulders as he spoke a king without gold is a snake with a broken back andhis nose sneered up and his eyebrows frowned downit is a good deed to break a snakes back that was my work he cried triumphantly to puck spirit of earth bear witness that that was my work he shot up to his full towering height and his words rang like a trumpet he had a voice that changed its tone almost as an opal changes coloursometimes deep and thundery sometimes thin and waily but always it made you listen  many people can bear witness to that puck answered tell these babes how it was done remember master they do not know doubt or fear  so i saw in their faces when we met said kadmiel yet surely surely they are taught to spit upon jews  are they said dan much interested where at  puck fell back a pace laughing kadmiel is thinking of king johns reign he explained his people were badly treated then  oh we know that they answered and it was very rude of them but they could not help it they stared straight at kadmiels mouth to see if his teeth were all there it stuck in their lessonmemory that king john used to pull out jews teeth to make them lend him money  kadmiel understood the look and smiled bitterly  no your king never drew my teeth i think perhaps i drew his listen i was not born among christians but among moorsin spainin a little white town under the mountains yes the moors are cruel but at least their learned men dare to think it was prophesied of me at my birth that i should be a lawgiver to a people of a strange speech and a hard language we jews are always looking for the prince and the lawgiver to come why not my people in the town we were very few set me apart as a child of the prophecythe chosen of the chosen we jews dream so many dreams you would never guess it to see us slink about the rubbishheaps in our quarter but at the days enddoors shut candles litaha then we became the chosen again  he paced back and forth through the wood as he talked the rattle of the shotguns never ceased and the dogs whimpered a little and lay flat on the leaves  i was a prince yes think of a little prince who had never known rough words in his own house handed over to shouting bearded rabbis who pulled his ears and filliped his nose all that he might learnlearnlearn to be king when his time came hé such a little prince it was one eye he kept on the stonethrowing moorish boys and the other it roved about the streets looking for his kingdom yes and he learned to cry softly when he was hunted up and down those streets he learned to do all things without noise he played beneath his fathers table when the great candle was lit and he listened as children listen to the talk of his fathers friends above the table they came across the mountains from out of all the world for my princes father was their counsellor they came from behind the armies of salauddin from rome from venice from england they stole down our alley they tapped secretly at our door they took off their rags they arrayed themselves and they talked to my father at the wine all over the world the heathen fought each other they brought news of these wars and while he played beneath the table my prince heard these meanly dressed ones decide between themselves how and when and for how long king should draw sword against king and people rise up against people why not there can be no war without gold and we jews know how the earths gold moves with the seasons and the crops and the winds circling and looping and rising and sinking away like a rivera wonderful underground river how should the foolish kings know that while they fight and steal and kill  the childrens faces showed that they knew nothing at all as with open eyes they trotted and turned beside the longstriding old man he twitched his gown over his shoulders and a square plate of gold studded with jewels gleamed for an instant through the fur like a star through flying snow  no matter he said but credit me my prince saw peace or war decided not once but many times by the fall of a coin spun between a jew from bury and a jewess from alexandria in his fathers house when the great candle was lit such power had we jews among the gentiles ah my little prince do you wonder that he learned quickly why not he muttered to himself and went on  my trade was that of a physician when i had learned it in spain i went to the east to find my kingdom why not a jew is as free as a sparrowor a dog he goes where he is hunted in the east i found libraries where men dared to thinkschools of medicine where they dared to learn i was diligent in my business therefore i stood before kings i have been a brother to princes and a companion to beggars and i have walked between the living and the dead there was no profit in it i did not find my kingdom so in the tenth year of my travels when i had reached the uttermost eastern sea i returned to my fathers house god had wonderfully preserved my people none had been slain none even wounded and only a few scourged i became once more a son in my fathers house again the great candle was lit again the meanly apparelled ones tapped on our door after dusk and again i heard them weigh out peace and war as they weighed out the gold on the table but i was not richnot very rich therefore when those that had power and knowledge and wealth talked together i sat in the shadow why not  yet all my wanderings had shown me one sure thing which is that a king without money is like a spear without a head he cannot do much harm i said therefore to elias of bury a great one among our people why do our people lend any more to the kings that oppress us because said elias if we refuse they stir up their people against us and the people are tenfold more cruel than kings if thou doubtest come with me to bury in england and live as i live  i saw my mothers face across the candle flame and i said i will come with thee to bury maybe my kingdom shall be there  so i sailed with elias to the darkness and the cruelty of bury in england where there are no learned men how can a man be wise if he hate at bury i kept his accounts for elias and i saw men kill jews there by the tower nonone laid hands on elias he lent money to the king and the kings favour was about him a king will not take the life so long as there is any gold this kingyes johnoppressed his people bitterly because they would not give him money yet his land was a good land if he had only given it rest he might have cropped it as a christian crops his beard but even that little he did not know for god had deprived him of all understanding and had multiplied pestilence and famine and despair upon the people therefore his people turned against us jews who are all peoples dogs why not lastly the barons and the people rose together against the king because of his cruelties naynaythe barons did not love the people but they saw that if the king cut up and destroyed the common people he would presently destroy the barons they joined then as cats and pigs will join to slay a snake i kept the accounts and i watched all these things for i remembered the prophecy  a great gathering of barons to most of whom we had lent money came to bury and there after much talk and a thousand runningsabout they made a roll of the new laws that they would force on the king if he swore to keep those laws they would allow him a little money that was the kings godmoneyto waste they showed us the roll of the new laws why not we had lent them money we knew all their counselswe jews shivering behind our doors in bury he threw out his hands suddenly we did not seek to be paid all in money we sought powerpowerpower that is our god in our captivity power to use  i said to elias these new laws are good lend no more money to the king so long as he has money he will lie and slay the people  nay said elias i know this people they are madly cruel better one king than a thousand butchers i have lent a little money to the barons or they would torture us but my most i will lend to the king he hath promised me a place near him at court where my wife and i shall be safe  but if the king be made to keep these new laws i said the land will have peace and our trade will grow if we lend he will fight again  who made thee a lawgiver in england said elias i know this people let the dogs tear one another i will lend the king ten thousand pieces of gold and he can fight the barons at his pleasure  there are not two thousand pieces of gold in all england this summer i said for i kept the accounts and i knew how the earths gold movedthat wonderful underground river elias barred home the windows and his hands about his mouth he told me how when he was trading with small wares in a french ship he had come to the castle of pevensey  oh said dan pevensey again and looked at una who nodded and skipped  there after they had scattered his pack up and down the great hall some young knights carried him to an upper room and dropped him into a well in a wall that rose and fell with the tide they called him joseph and threw torches at his wet head why not  why of course cried dan didnt you know it was puck held up his hand to stop him and kadmiel who never noticed went on  when the tide dropped he thought he stood on old armour but feeling with his toes he raked up bar on bar of soft gold some wicked treasure of the old days put away and the secret cut off by the sword i have heard the like before  so have we una whispered but it wasnt wicked a bit  elias took a little of the stuff with him and thrice yearly he would return to pevensey as a chapman selling at no price or profit till they suffered him to sleep in the empty room where he would plumb and grope and steal away a few bars the great store of it still remained and by long brooding he had come to look on it as his own yet when we thought how we should lift and convey it we saw no way this was before the word of the lord had come to me a walled fortress possessed by normans in the midst a fortyfoot tidewell out of which to remove secretly many horseloads of gold hopeless so elias wept adah his wife wept too she had hoped to stand beside the queens christian tiringmaids at court when the king should give them that place at court which he had promised why not she was born in englandan odious woman  the present evil to us was that elias out of his strong folly had as it were promised the king that he would arm him with more gold wherefore the king in his camp stopped his ears against the barons and the people wherefore men died daily adah so desired her place at court she besought elias to tell the king where the treasure lay that the king might take it by force andthey would trust in his gratitude why not this elias refused to do for he looked on the gold as his own they quarrelled and they wept at the evening meal and late in the night came one langtona priest almost learnedto borrow more money for the barons elias and adah went to their chamber  kadmiel laughed scornfully in his beard the shots across the valley stopped as the shooting party changed their ground for the last beat  so it was i not elias he went on quietly that made terms with langton touching the fortieth of the new laws  what terms said puck quickly the fortieth of the great charter says to none will we sell refuse or delay right or justice  true but the barons had written first to no free man it cost me two hundred broad pieces of gold to change those narrow words langton the priest understood jew though thou art said he the change is just and if ever christian and jew came to be equal in england thy people may thank thee then he went out stealthily as men do who deal with israel by night i think he spent my gift upon his altar why not i have spoken with langton he was such a man as i might have been ifif we jews had been a people but yet in many things a child  i heard elias and adah abovestairs quarrel and knowing the woman was the stronger i saw that elias would tell the king of the gold and that the king would continue in his stubbornness therefore i saw that the gold must be put away from the reach of any man of a sudden the word of the lord came to me saying the morning is come o thou that dwellest in the land  kadmiel halted all black against the pale green sky beyond the wooda huge robed figure like the moses in the picturebible  i rose i went out and as i shut the door on that house of foolishness the woman looked from the window and whispered i have prevailed on my husband to tell the king i answered there is no need the lord is with me  in that hour the lord gave me full understanding of all that i must do and his hand covered me in my ways first i went to london to a physician of our people who sold me certain drugs that i needed you shall see why thence i went swiftly to pevensey men fought all around me for there were neither rulers nor judges in the abominable land yet when i walked by them they cried out that i was one ahasuerus a jew condemned as they believe to live for ever and they fled from me everyways thus the lord saved me for my work and at pevensey i bought me a little boat and moored it on the mud beneath the marshgate of the castle that also god showed me  he was as calm as though he were speaking of some stranger and his voice filled the little bare wood with rolling music  i casthis hand went to his breast and again the strange jewel gleamedi cast the drugs which i had prepared into the common well of the castle nay i did no harm the more we physicians know the less do we do only the fool says i dare i caused a blotched and itching rash to break out upon their skins but i knew it would fade in fifteen days i did not stretch out my hand against their life they in the castle thought it was the plague and they ran out taking with them their very dogs  a christian physician seeing that i was a jew and a stranger vowed that i had brought the sickness from london this is the one time i have ever heard a christian leech speak truth of any disease thereupon the people beat me but a merciful woman said do not kill him now push him into our castle with his plague and if as he says it will abate on the fifteenth day we can kill him then why not they drove me across the drawbridge of the castle and fled back to their booths thus i came to be alone with the treasure  but did you know this was all going to happen just right said una  my prophecy was that i should be a lawgiver to a people of a strange land and a hard speech i knew i should not die i washed my cuts i found the tidewell in the wall and from sabbath to sabbath i dove and dug there in that empty christiansmelling fortress hé i spoiled the egyptians hé if they had only known i drew up many good loads of gold which i loaded by night into my boat there had been golddust too but that had been washed out by the tides  didnt you ever wonder who had put it there said dan stealing a glance at pucks calm dark face under the hood of his gown puck shook his head and pursed his lips  often for the gold was new to me kadmiel replied i know the golds i can judge them in the dark but this was heavier and redder than any we deal in perhaps it was the very gold of parvaim eh why not it went to my heart to heave it on to the mud but i saw well that if the evil thing remained or if even the hope of finding it remained the king would not sign the new laws and the land would perish  oh marvel said puck beneath his breath rustling in the dead leaves  when the boat was loaded i washed my hands seven times and pared beneath my nails for i would not keep one grain i went out by the little gate where the castles refuse is thrown i dared not hoist sail lest men should see me but the lord commanded the tide to bear me carefully and i was far from land before the morning  werent you afraid said una  why there were no christians in the boat at sunrise i made my prayer and cast the goldallall that goldinto the deep sea a kings ransomno the ransom of a people when i had loosed hold of the last bar the lord commanded the tide to return me to a haven at the mouth of a river and thence i walked across a wilderness to lewes where i have brethren they opened the door to me and they sayi had not eaten for two daysthey say that i fell across the threshold crying i have sunk an army with horsemen in the sea  but you hadnt said una oh yes i see you meant that king john might have spent it on that  even so said kadmiel  the firing broke out again close behind them the pheasants poured over the top of a belt of tall firs they could see young mr meyer in his new yellow gaiters very busy and excited at the end of the line and they could hear the thud of the falling birds  but what did elias of bury do puck demanded he had promised money to the king  kadmiel smiled grimly i sent him word from london that the lord was on my side when he heard that the plague had broken out in pevensey and that a jew had been thrust into the castle to cure it he understood my word was true he and adah hurried to lewes and asked me for an accounting he still looked on the gold as his own i told them where i had laid it and i gave them full leave to pick it up  eh well the curses of a fool and the dust of a journey are two things no wise man can escape  but i pitied elias the king was wroth with him because he could not lend the barons were wroth too because they heard that he would have lent to the king and adah was wroth with him because she was an odious woman they took ship from lewes to spain that was wise  and you did you see the signing of the law at runnymede said puck as kadmiel laughed noiselessly  nay who am i to meddle with things too high for me i returned to bury and lent money on the autumn crops why not  there was a crackle overhead a cockpheasant that had sheered aside after being hit spattered down almost on top of them driving up the dry leaves like a shell flora and folly threw themselves at it the children rushed forward and when they had beaten them off and smoothed down the plumage kadmiel had disappeared  well said puck calmly what did you think of it weland gave the sword the sword gave the treasure and the treasure gave the law its as natural as an oak growing  i dont understand didnt he know it was sir richards old treasure said dan and why did sir richard and brother hugh leave it lying about andand  never mind said una politely hell let us come and go and look and know another time wont you puck  another time maybe puck answered brr its coldand late ill race you towards home  they hurried down into the sheltered valley the sun had almost sunk behind cherry clack the trodden ground by the cattlegates was freezing at the edges and the newwaked north wind blew the night on them from over the hills they picked up their feet and flew across the browned pastures and when they halted panting in the steam of their own breath the dead leaves whirled up behind them there was oak and ash and thorn enough in that yearend shower to magic away a thousand memories  so they trotted to the brook at the bottom of the lawn wondering why flora and folly had missed the quarryhole fox  old hobden was just finishing some hedgework they saw his white smock glimmer in the twilight where he faggoted the rubbish  winter hes come i reckon mus dan he called hard times now till heffle cuckoo fair yes well all be glad to see the old woman let the cuckoo out o the basket for to start lawful spring in england  they heard a crash and a stamp and a splash of water as though a heavy old cow were crossing almost under their noses  hobden ran forward angrily to the ford  gleasons bull again playin robin all over the farm oh look mus danhis great footmark as big as a trencher no bounds to his impidence he might count himself to be a man oror somebody  a voice the other side of the brook boomed  i wonder who his cloak would turn when puck had led him round or where those walking fires would burn  then the children went in singing farewell rewards and fairies at the tops of their voices they had forgotten that they had not even said goodnight to puck    the childrens song   land of our birth we pledge to thee our love and toil in the years to be when we are grown and take our place as men and
