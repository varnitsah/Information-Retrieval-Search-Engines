markthe ringleader of the vigilantesand had left red pete who had fired it covered by their rifles and at their mercy for his hand had been cramped by hard riding and his eye distracted by their sudden onset and so the inevitable end had come he submitted sullenly to his captors his companion fugitive and horsethief gave up the protracted struggle with a feeling not unlike relief even the hot and revengeful victors were content they had taken their men alive at any time during the long chase they could have brought them down by a rifleshot but it would have been unsportsmanlike and have ended in a free fight instead of an example and for the matter of that their doom was already sealed their end by a rope and a tree although not sanctified by law would have at least the deliberation of justice it was the tribute paid by the vigilantes to that order which they had themselves disregarded in the pursuit and capture yet this strange logic of the frontier sufficed them and gave a certain dignity to the climax  ef youve got anything to say to your folks say it now and say it quick said the ringleader  red pete glanced around him he had been run to earth at his own cabin in the clearing whence a few relations and friends mostly women and children noncombatants had outflowed gazing vacantly at the twenty vigilantes who surrounded them all were accustomed to scenes of violence bloodfeud chase and hardship it was only the suddenness of the onset and its quick result that had surprised them they looked on with dazed curiosity and some disappointment there had been no fight to speak ofno spectacle a boy nephew of red pete got upon the rainbarrel to view the proceedings more comfortably a tall handsome lazy kentucky girl a visiting neighbor leaned against the doorpost chewing gum only a yellow hound was actively perplexed he could not make out if a hunt were just over or beginning and ran eagerly backwards and forwards leaping alternately upon the captives and the captors  the ringleader repeated his challenge red pete gave a reckless laugh and looked at his wife  at which mrs red pete came forward it seemed that she had much to say incoherently furiously vindictively to the ringleader his soul would roast in hell for that days work he called himself a man skunkin in the open and afraid to show himself except with a crowd of other kiyis around a house of women and children heaping insult upon insult inveighing against his low blood his ancestors his dubious origin she at last flung out a wild taunt of his invalid wife the insult of a woman to a woman until his white face grew rigid and only that westernamerican fetich of the sanctity of sex kept his twitching fingers from the lock of his rifle even her husband noticed it and with a halfauthoritative let up on that old gal and a pat of his freed left hand on her back took his last parting the ringleader still white under the lash of the womans tongue turned abruptly to the second captive and if youve got anybody to say goodby to nows your chance  the man looked up nobody stirred or spoke he was a stranger there being a chance confederate picked up by red pete and known to no one still young but an outlaw from his abandoned boyhood of which father and mother were only a forgotten dream he loved horses and stole them fully accepting the frontier penalty of life for the interference with that animal on which a mans life so often depended but he understood the good points of a horse as was shown by the one he bestrodeuntil a few days before the property of judge boompointer this was his sole distinction  the unexpected question stirred him for a moment out of the attitude of reckless indifference for attitude it was and a part of his profession but it may have touched him that at that moment he was less than his companion and his virago wife however he only shook his head as he did so his eye casually fell on the handsome girl by the doorpost who was looking at him the ringleader too may have been touched by his complete loneliness for he hesitated at the same moment he saw that the girl was looking at his friendless captive  a grotesque idea struck him  salomy jane ye might do worse than come yere and say goodby to a dying man and him a stranger he said  there seemed to be a subtle stroke of poetry and irony in this that equally struck the apathetic crowd it was well known that salomy jane clay thought no small potatoes of herself and always held off the local swain with a lazy nymphlike scorn nevertheless she slowly disengaged herself from the doorpost and to everybodys astonishment lounged with languid grace and outstretched hand towards the prisoner the color came into the gray reckless mask which the doomed man wore as her right hand grasped his left just loosed by his captors then she paused her shy fawnlike eyes grew bold and fixed themselves upon him she took the chewinggum from her mouth wiped her red lips with the back of her hand by a sudden lithe spring placed her foot on his stirrup and bounding to the saddle threw her arms about his neck and pressed a kiss upon his lips  illustration  they remained thus for a hushed momentthe man on the threshold of death the young woman in the fullness of youth and beautylinked together then the crowd laughed in the audacious effrontery of the girls act the ultimate fate of the two men was forgotten she slipped languidly to the ground she was the focus of all eyesshe only the ringleader saw it and his opportunity he shouted times upforward urged his horse beside his captives and the next moment the whole cavalcade was sweeping over the clearing into the darkening woods  their destination was sawyers crossing the headquarters of the committee where the council was still sitting and where both culprits were to expiate the offense of which that council had already found them guilty they rode in great and breathless hastea haste in which strangely enough even the captives seemed to join that haste possibly prevented them from noticing the singular change which had taken place in the second captive since the episode of the kiss his high color remained as if it had burned through his mask of indifference his eyes were quick alert and keen his mouth half open as if the girls kiss still lingered there and that haste had made them careless for the horse of the man who led him slipped in a gopherhole rolled over unseated his rider and even dragged the bound and helpless second captive from judge boompointers favorite mare in an instant they were all on their feet again but in that supreme moment the second captive felt the cords which bound his arms had slipped to his wrists by keeping his elbows to his sides and obliging the others to help him mount it escaped their notice by riding close to his captors and keeping in the crush of the throng he further concealed the accident slowly working his hands downwards out of his bonds their way lay through a sylvan wilderness midleg deep in ferns whose tall fronds brushed their horses sides in their furious gallop and concealed the flapping of the captives loosened cords the peaceful vista more suggestive of the offerings of nymph and shepherd than of human sacrifice was in a strange contrast to this whirlwind rush of stern armed men the westering sun pierced the subdued light and the tremor of leaves with yellow lances birds started into song on blue and dovelike wings and on either side of the trail of this vengeful storm could be heard the murmur of hidden and tranquil waters in a few moments they would be on the open ridge whence sloped the common turnpike to sawyers a mile away it was the custom of returning cavalcades to take this hill at headlong speed with shouts and cries that heralded their coming they withheld the latter that day as inconsistent with their dignity but emerging from the wood swept silently like an avalanche down the slope they were well under way looking only to their horses when the second captive slipped his right arm from the bonds and succeeded in grasping the reins that lay trailing on the horses neck a sudden vaquero jerk which the welltrained animal understood threw him on his haunches with his forelegs firmly planted on the slope the rest of the cavalcade swept on the man who was leading the captives horse by the riata thinking only of another accident dropped the line to save himself from being dragged backwards from his horse the captive wheeled and the next moment was galloping furiously up the slope  it was the work of a moment a trained horse and an experienced hand the cavalcade had covered nearly fifty yards before they could pull up the freed captive had covered half that distance uphill the road was so narrow that only two shots could be fired and these broke dust two yards ahead of the fugitive they had not dared to fire low the horse was the more valuable animal the fugitive knew this in his extremity also and would have gladly taken a shot in his own leg to spare that of his horse five men were detached to recapture or kill him the latter seemed inevitable but he had calculated his chances before they could reload he had reached the woods again winding in and out between the pillared tree trunks he offered no mark they knew his horse was superior to their own at the end of two hours they returned for he had disappeared without track or trail the end was briefly told in the sierra record  red pete the notorious horsethief who had so long eluded justice was captured and hung by the sawyers crossing vigilantes last week his confederate unfortunately escaped on a valuable horse belonging to judge boompointer the judge had refused one thousand dollars for the horse only a week before as the thief who is still at large would find it difficult to dispose of so valuable an animal without detection the chances are against either of them turning up again     the ladys reflections  illustration      ii   salomy jane watched the cavalcade until it had disappeared then she became aware that her brief popularity had passed mrs red pete in stormy hysterics had included her in a sweeping denunciation of the whole universe possibly for simulating an emotion in which she herself was deficient the other women hated her for her momentary exaltation above them only the children still admired her as one who had undoubtedly canoodled with a man agoing to be hunga daring flight beyond their wildest ambition salomy jane accepted the change with charming unconcern she put on her yellow nankeen sunbonneta hideous affair that would have ruined any other woman but which only enhanced the piquancy of her fresh brunette skintied the strings letting the blueblack braids escape below its frilled curtain behind jumped on her mustang with a casual display of agile ankles in shapely white stockings whistled to the hound and waving her hand with a so long sonny to the lately bereft but admiring nephew flapped and fluttered away in her short brown holland gown  her fathers house was four miles distant contrasted with the cabin she had just quitted it was a superior dwelling with a long leanto at the rear which brought the eaves almost to the ground and made it look like a low triangle it had a long barn and cattle sheds for madison clay was a great stockraiser and the owner of a quarter section it had a sittingroom and a parlor organ whose transportation thither had been a marvel of packing these things were supposed to give salomy jane an undue importance but the girls reserve and inaccessibility to local advances were rather the result of a cool lazy temperament and the preoccupation of a large protecting admiration for her father for some years a widower for mr madison clays life had been threatened in one or two feudsit was said not without causeand it is possible that the pathetic spectacle of her father doing his visiting with a shotgun may have touched her closely and somewhat prejudiced her against the neighboring masculinity the thought that cattle horses and quarter section would one day be hers did not disturb her calm as for mr clay he accepted her as housewifely though somewhat interfering and being one of his own womankind therefore not without some degree of merit  wots this yer im hearin of your doins over at red petes honeyfoglin with a horsethief eh said mr clay two days later at breakfast  i reckon you heard about the straight thing then said salomy jane unconcernedly without looking round  what do you kalkilate rube will say to it what are you goin to tell him said mr clay sarcastically  rube or reuben waters was a swain supposed to be favored particularly by mr clay salomy jane looked up  ill tell him that when hes on his way to be hung ill kiss himnot till then said the young lady brightly  this delightful witticism suited the paternal humor and mr clay smiled but nevertheless he frowned a moment afterwards  but this yer hossthief got away arter all and thats a hoss of a different color he said grimly  salomy jane put down her knife and fork this was certainly a new and different phase of the situation she had never thought of it before and strangely enough for the first time she became interested in the man got away she repeated did they let him off  not much said her father briefly slipped his cords and going down the grade pulled up short just like a vaquero agin a lassoed bull almost draggin the man leadin him off his hoss and then skyuted up the grade for that matter on that hoss o judge boompointers he mout have dragged the whole posse of em down on their knees ef he liked sarved em right too instead of stringin him up afore the door or shootin him on sight they must allow to take him down afore the hull committee for an example example be blowed ther s example enough when some stranger comes unbeknownst slap onter a man hanged to a tree and plugged full of holes thats an example and he knows what it means wot more do ye want but then those vigilantes is allus clingin and hangin onter some mere scrap othe law theyre pretendin to despise it makes me sick why when jake myers shot your ole aunt vineys second husband and i laid in wait for jake afterwards in the butternut hollow did i tie him to his hoss and fetch him down to your aunt vineys cabin for an example before i plugged him no in deep disgust no why i just meandered through the wood carelesslike till he comes out and i just rode up to him and i said  but salomy jane had heard her fathers story before even ones dearest relatives are apt to become tiresome in narration i know dad she interrupted but this yer manthis hossthiefdid he get clean away without gettin hurt at all  he did and unless hes fool enough to sell the hoss he kin keep away too so ye see ye cant ladle out purp stuff about a dyin stranger to rube he wont swaller it  all the same dad returned the girl cheerfully i reckon to say it and say more ill tell him that ef he manages to get away too ill marry himthere but ye dont ketch rube takin any such risks in gettin ketched or in gettin away arter  madison clay smiled grimly pushed back his chair rose dropped a perfunctory kiss on his daughters hair and taking his shotgun from the corner departed on a peaceful samaritan mission to a cow who had dropped a calf in the far pasture inclined as he was to reubens wooing from his eligibility as to property he was conscious that he was sadly deficient in certain qualities inherent in the clay family it certainly would be a kind of mésalliance  left to herself salomy jane stared a long while at the coffeepot and then called the two squaws who assisted her in her household duties to clear away the things while she went up to her own room to make her bed here she was confronted with a possible prospect of that proverbial bed she might be making in her willfulness and on which she must lie in the photograph of a somewhat serious young man of refined featuresreuben watersstuck in her windowframe salomy jane smiled over her last witticism regarding him and enjoyed it like your true humorist and then catching sight of her own handsome face in the little mirror smiled again but wasnt it funny about that horsethief getting off after all good lordy fancy reuben hearing he was alive and going round with that kiss of hers set on his lips she laughed again a little more abstractedly and he had returned it like a man holding her tight and almost breathless and he going to be hung the next minute salomy jane had been kissed at other times by force chance or stratagem in a certain ingenuous forfeit game of the locality known as im apinin many had pined for a sweet kiss from salomy jane which she had yielded in a sense of honor and fair play she had never been kissed like this beforeshe would never again and yet the man was alive and behold she could see in the mirror that she was blushing  she should hardly know him again a young man with very bright eyes a flushed and sunburnt cheek a kind of fixed look in the face and no beard no none that she could feel yet he was not at all like reuben not a bit she took reubens picture from the window and laid it on her workbox and to think she did not even know this young mans name that was queer to be kissed by a man whom she might never know of course he knew hers she wondered if he remembered it and her but of course he was so glad to get off with his life that he never thought of anything else yet she did not give more than four or five minutes to these speculations and like a sensible girl thought of something else once again however in opening the closet she found the brown holland gown she had worn on the day before thought it very unbecoming and regretted that she had not worn her best gown on her visit to red petes cottage on such an occasion she really might have been more impressive     the kiss repeated  illustration      iii   when her father came home that night she asked him the news no they had not captured the second horsethief who was still at large judge boompointer talked of invoking the aid of the despised law it remained then to see whether the horsethief was fool enough to try to get rid of the animal red petes body had been delivered to his widow perhaps it would only be neighborly for salomy jane to ride over to the funeral but salomy jane did not take to the suggestion kindly nor yet did she explain to her father that as the other man was still living she did not care to undergo a second disciplining at the widows hands nevertheless she contrasted her situation with that of the widow with a new and singular satisfaction it might have been red pete who had escaped but he had not the grit of the nameless one she had already settled his heroic quality  ye aint harkenin to me salomy  salomy jane started  here im askin ye if yeve see that hound phil larrabee sneaking by yer today  salomy jane had not but she became interested and selfreproachful for she knew that phil larrabee was one of her fathers enemies he wouldnt dare to go by here unless he knew you were out she said quickly  thats what gets me he said scratching his grizzled head ive been kind o thinkin o him all day and one of them chinamen said he saw him at sawyers crossing he was a kind of friend o petes wife thats why i thought yer might find out ef hed been there salomy jane grew more selfreproachful at her fathers selfinterest in her neighborliness but that aint all continued mr clay thar was tracks over the far pasture that warnt mine i followed them and they went round and round the house two or three times ez ef they mout hev bin prowlin and then i lost em in the woods again its just like that sneakin hound larrabee to hev bin lyin in wait for me and afraid to meet a man fair and square in the open  you just lie low dad for a day or two more and let me do a little prowlin said the girl with sympathetic indignation in her dark eyes ef its that skunk ill spot him soon enough and let you know whar hes hiding  youll just stay where ye are salomy said her father decisively this aint no womans workthough i aint sayin you havent got more head for it than some men i know nevertheless that night after her father had gone to bed salomy jane sat by the open window of the sittingroom in an apparent attitude of languid contemplation but alert and intent of eye and ear it was a fine moonlit night two pines near the door solitary pickets of the serried ranks of distant forest cast long shadows like paths to the cottage and sighed their spiced breath in the windows for there was no frivolity of vine or flower round salomy janes bower the clearing was too recent the life too practical for vanities like these but the moon added a vague elusiveness to everything softened the rigid outlines of the sheds gave shadows to the lidless windows and touched with merciful indirectness the hideous débris of refuse gravel and the gaunt scars of burnt vegetation before the door even salomy jane was affected by it and exhaled something between a sigh and a yawn with the breath of the pines then she suddenly sat upright  her quick ear had caught a faint click click in the direction of the wood her quicker instinct and rustic training enabled her to determine that it was the ring of a horses shoe on flinty ground her knowledge of the locality told her it came from the spot where the trail passed over an outcrop of flint scarcely a quarter of a mile from where she sat and within the clearing it was no errant stock for the foot was shod with iron it was a mounted trespasser by night and boded no good to a man like clay  she rose threw her shawl over her head more for disguise than shelter and passed out of the door a sudden impulse made her seize her fathers shotgun from the corner where it stoodnot that she feared any danger to herself but that it was an excuse she made directly for the wood keeping in the shadow of the pines as long as she could at the fringe she halted whoever was there must pass her before reaching the house  then there seemed to be a suspense of all nature everything was deadly stilleven the moonbeams appeared no longer tremulous soon there was a rustle as of some stealthy animal among the ferns and then a dismounted man stepped into the moonlight it was the horsethiefthe man she had kissed  for a wild moment a strange fancy seized her usually sane intellect and stirred her temperate blood the news they had told her was not true he had been hung and this was his ghost he looked as white and spiritlike in the moonlight dressed in the same clothes as when she saw him last he had evidently seen her approaching and moved quickly to meet her but in his haste he stumbled slightly she reflected suddenly that ghosts did not stumble and a feeling of relief came over her and it was no assassin of her father that had been prowling aroundonly this unhappy fugitive a momentary color came into her cheek her coolness and hardihood returned it was with a tinge of sauciness in her voice that she said  i reckoned you were a ghost  i mout have been he said looking at her fixedly but i reckon id have come back here all the same  its a little riskier comin back alive she said with a levity that died on her lips for a singular nervousness half fear and half expectation was beginning to take the place of her relief of a moment ago then it was you who was prowlin round and makin tracks in the far pasture  yes i came straight here when i got away  she felt his eyes were burning her but did not dare to raise her own why she began hesitated and ended vaguely how did you get here  you helped me  i  yes that kiss you gave me put life into megave me strength to get away i swore to myself id come back and thank you alive or dead  every word he said she could have anticipated so plain the situation seemed to her now and every word he said she knew was the truth yet her cool common sense struggled against it  whats the use of your escaping ef youre comin back here to be ketched again she said pertly  he drew a little nearer to her but seemed to her the more awkward as she resumed her selfpossession his voice too was broken as if by exhaustion as he said catching his breath at intervals  ill tell you you did more for me than you think you made another man o me i never had a man woman or child do to me what you did i never had a friendonly a pal like red pete who picked me up on shares i want to quit this yerwhat im doin i want to begin by doin the square thing to youhe stopped breathed hard and then said brokenly my hoss is over thar staked out i want to give him to you judge boompointer will give you a thousand dollars for him i aint lyin its gods truth i saw it on the handbill agin a tree take him and ill get away afoot take him its the only thing i can do for you and i know it dont half pay for what you did take it your father can get a reward for you if you cant  such were the ethics of this strange locality that neither the man who made the offer nor the girl to whom it was made was struck by anything that seemed illogical or indelicate or at all inconsistent with justice or the horsethiefs real conversion salomy jane nevertheless dissented from another and weaker reason  i dont want your hoss though i reckon dad might but youre just starvin ill get suthin she turned towards the house  say youll take the hoss first he said grasping her hand at the touch she felt herself coloring and struggled expecting perhaps another kiss but he dropped her hand she turned again with a saucy gesture said hol on ill come right back and slipped away the mere shadow of a coy and flying nymph in the moonlight until she reached the house  here she not only procured food and whiskey but added a long dustcoat and hat of her fathers to her burden they would serve as a disguise for him and hide that heroic figure which she thought everybody must now know as she did then she rejoined him breathlessly but he put the food and whiskey aside  listen he said ive turned the hoss into your corral youll find him there in the morning and no one will know but that he got lost and joined the other hosses  then she burst out but youyouwhat will become of you youll be ketched  ill manage to get away he said in a low voice efef  ef what she said tremblingly  ef youll put the heart in me againas you did he gasped  she tried to laughto move away she could do neither suddenly he caught her in his arms with a long kiss which she returned again and again then they stood embraced as they had embraced two days before but no longer the same for the cool lazy salomy jane had been transformed into another womana passionate clinging savage perhaps something of her fathers blood had surged within her at that supreme moment the man stood erect and determined  wots your name she whispered quickly it was a womans quickest way of defining her feelings  dart  yer first name  jack  let me go now jack lie low in the woods till tomorrow sunup ill come again  he released her yet she lingered a moment put on those things she said with a sudden happy flash of eyes and teeth and lie close till i come and then she sped away home  but midway up the distance she felt her feet going slower and something at her heartstrings seemed to be pulling her back she stopped turned and glanced to where he had been standing had she seen him then she might have returned but he had disappeared she gave her first sigh and then ran quickly again it must be nearly ten oclock it was not very long to morning  she was within a few steps of her own door when the sleeping woods and silent air appeared to suddenly awake with a sharp crack  she stopped paralyzed another crack followed that echoed over to the far corral she recalled herself instantly and dashed off wildly to the woods again  as she ran she thought of one thing only he had been dogged by one of his old pursuers and attacked but there were two shots and he was unarmed suddenly she remembered that she had left her fathers gun standing against the tree where they were talking thank god she may again have saved him she ran to the tree the gun was gone she ran hither and thither dreading at every step to fall upon his lifeless body a new thought struck her she ran to the corral the horse was not there he must have been able to regain it and escaped after the shots had been fired she drew a long breath of relief but it was caught up in an apprehension of alarm her father awakened from his sleep by the shots was hurriedly approaching her  whats up now salomy jane he demanded excitedly  nothin said the girl with an effort nothin at least that i can find she was usually truthful because fearless and a lie stuck in her throat but she was no longer fearless thinking of him i wasnt abed so i ran out as soon as i heard the shots fired she answered in return to his curious gaze  and youve hid my gun somewhere where it cant be found he said reproachfully ef it was that sneak larrabee and he fired them shots to lure me out he might have potted me without a show a dozen times in the last five minutes  she had not thought since of her fathers enemy it might indeed have been he who had attacked jack but she made a quick point of the suggestion run in dad run in and find the gun youve got no show out here without it she seized him by the shoulders from behind shielding him from the woods and hurried him half expostulating half struggling to the house  but there no gun was to be found it was strange it must have been mislaid in some corner was he sure he had not left it in the barn but no matter now the danger was over the larrabee trick had failed he must go to bed now and in the morning they would make a search together at the same time she had inwardly resolved to rise before him and make another search of the wood and perhapsfearful joy as she recalled her promisefind jack alive and well awaiting her     another escape  illustration     iv   salomy jane slept little that night nor did her father but towards morning he fell into a tired mans slumber until the sun was well up the horizon far different was it with his daughter she lay with her face to the window her head half lifted to catch every sound from the creaking of the sunwarped shingles above her head to the faroff moan of the rising wind in the pine trees sometimes she fell into a breathless halfecstatic trance living over every moment of the stolen interview feeling the fugitives arm still around her his kisses on her lips hearing his whispered voice in her earsthe birth of her new life this was followed again by a period of agonizing dreadthat he might even then be lying his life ebbing away in the woods with her name on his lips and she resting here inactive until she half started from her bed to go to his succor and this went on until a pale opal glow came into the sky followed by a still paler pink on the summit of the white sierras when she rose and hurriedly began to dress still so sanguine was her hope of meeting him that she lingered yet a moment to select the brown holland skirt and yellow sunbonnet she had worn when she first saw him and she had only seen him twice only twice it would be cruel too cruel not to see him again  she crept softly down the stairs listening to the longdrawn breathing of her father in his bedroom and then by the light of a guttering candle scrawled a note to him begging him not to trust himself out of the house until she returned from her search and leaving the note open on the table swiftly ran out into the growing day  three hours afterwards mr madison clay awoke to the sound of loud knocking at first this forced itself upon his consciousness as his daughters regular morning summons and was responded to by a grunt of recognition and a nestling closer in the blankets then he awoke with a start and a muttered oath remembering the events of last night and his intention to get up early and rolled out of bed becoming aware by this time that the knocking was at the outer door and hearing the shout of a familiar voice he hastily pulled on his boots his jean trousers and fastening a single suspender over his shoulder as he clattered downstairs stood in the lower room the door was open and waiting upon the threshold was his kinsman an old ally in many a bloodfeudbreckenridge clay  you are a cool one mad said the latter in halfadmiring indignation  whats up said the bewildered madison  you ought to be and scootin out o this said breckenridge grimly its all very well to know nothin but here phil larrabees friends hev just picked him up drilled through with slugs and deader nor a crow and now theyre lettin loose larrabees two halfbrothers on you and you must go like a derned fool and leave these yer things behind you in the bresh he went on querulously lifting madison clays dustcoat hat and shotgun from his horse which stood saddled at the door luckily i picked them up in the woods comin here ye aint got more than time to get over the state line and among your folks thar afore theyll be down on you hustle old man what are you gawkin and starin at  madison clay had stared amazed and bewilderedhorrorstricken the incidents of the past night for the first time flashed upon him clearlyhopelessly the shot his finding salomy jane alone in the woods her confusion and anxiety to rid herself of him the disappearance of the shotgun and now this new discovery of the taking of his hat and coat for a disguise she had killed phil larrabee in that disguise after provoking his first harmless shot she his own child salomy jane had disgraced herself by a mans crime had disgraced him by usurping his right and taking a mean advantage by deceit of a foe  gimme that gun he said hoarsely  breckenridge handed him the gun in wonder and slowly gathering suspicion madison examined nipple and muzzle one barrel had been discharged it was true the gun dropped from his hand  look here old man said breckenridge with a darkening face theres bin no foul play here thars bin no hiring of men no deputy to do this job you did it fair and squareyourself  yes by god burst out madison clay in a hoarse voice who says i didnt  reassured yet believing that madison clay had nerved himself for the act by an overdraught of whiskey which had affected his memory breckenridge said curtly then wake up and lite out ef ye want me to stand by you  go to the corral and pick me out a hoss said madison slowly yet not without a certain dignity of manner ive suthin to say to salomy jane afore i go he was holding her scribbled note which he had just discovered in his shaking hand  struck by his kinsmans manner and knowing the dependent relations of father and daughter breckenridge nodded and hurried away left to himself madison clay ran his fingers through his hair and straightened out the paper on which salomy jane had scrawled her note turned it over and wrote on the back      you might have told me you did it and not leave your ole     father to find it out how you disgraced yourself and him too     by a lowdown underhanded womans trick ive said i done     it and took the blame myself and all the sneakiness of it     that folks suspect if i get away aliveand i dont care much     whichyou neednt foller the house and stock are yours but     you aint any longer the daughter of your disgraced father      madison clay  he had scarcely finished the note when with a clatter of hoofs and a led horse breckenridge reappeared at the door elate and triumphant youre in nigger luck mad i found that stole hoss of judge boompointers had got away and strayed among your stock in the corral take him and youre safe he cant be outrun this side of the state line  i aint no hossthief said madison grimly  nobody sez ye are but youd be wussa foolef you didnt take him im testimony that you found him among your hosses ill tell judge boompointer youve got him and ye kin send him back when youre safe the judge will be mighty glad to get him back and call it quits so ef youve writ to salomy jane come  madison clay no longer hesitated salomy jane might return at any momentit would be part of her fool womanishnessand he was in no mood to see her before a third party he laid the note on the table gave a hurried glance around the house which he grimly believed he was leaving forever and striding to the door leaped on the stolen horse and swept away with his kinsman  but that note lay for a week undisturbed on the table in full view of the open door the house was invaded by leaves pine cones birds and squirrels during the hot silent empty days and at night by shy stealthy creatures but never again day or night by any of the clay family it was known in the district that clay had flown across the state line his daughter was believed to have joined him the next day and the house was supposed to be locked up it lay off the main road and few passed that way the starving cattle in the corral at last broke bounds and spread over the woods and one night a stronger blast than usual swept through the house carried the note from the table to the floor where whirled into a crack in the flooring it slowly rotted  but though the sting of her fathers reproach was spared her salomy jane had no need of the letter to know what had happened for as she entered the woods in the dim light of that morning she saw the figure of dart gliding from the shadow of a pine towards her the unaffected cry of joy that rose from her lips died there as she caught sight of his face in the open light  you are hurt she said clutching his arm passionately  no he said but i wouldnt mind that if  youre thinkin i was afeard to come back last night when i heard the shootin but i did come she went on feverishly i ran back here when i heard the two shots but you were gone i went to the corral but your hoss wasnt there and i thought youd got away  i did get away said dart gloomily i killed the man thinkin he was huntin me and forgettin i was disguised he thought i was your father  yes said the girl joyfully he was after dad and youyou killed him she again caught his hand admiringly  but he did not respond possibly there were points of honor which this horsethief felt vaguely with her father listen he said grimly others think it was your father killed him when i did itfor he fired at me firsti ran to the corral again and took my hoss thinkin i might be follered i made a clear circuit of the house and when i found he was the only one and no one was follerin i come back here and took off my disguise then i heard his friends find him in the wood and i know they suspected your father and then another man come through the woods while i was hidin and found the clothes and took them away he stopped and stared at her gloomily  but all this was unintelligible to the girl dad would have got the better of him ef you hadnt she said eagerly so whats the difference  all the same he said gloomily i must take his place  she did not understand but turned her head to her master then youll go back with me and tell him all she said obediently  yes he said  she put her hand in his and they crept out of the wood together she foresaw a thousand difficulties but chiefest of all that he did not love as she did she would not have taken these risks against their happiness  but alas for ethics and heroism as they were issuing from the wood they heard the sound of galloping hoofs and had barely time to hide themselves before madison clay on the stolen horse of judge boompointer swept past them with his kinsman  salomy jane turned to her lover                                       and here i might as a moral romancer pause leaving the guilty passionate girl eloped with her disreputable lover destined to lifelong shame and misery misunderstood to the last by a criminal fastidious parent but i am confronted by certain facts on which this romance is based a month
