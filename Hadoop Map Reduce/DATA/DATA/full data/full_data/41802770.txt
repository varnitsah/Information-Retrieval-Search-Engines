footsore and a little chilly there was no manservant arranging his bath and clothes no pleasant smell of coffeenone of the small luxuries to which he was accustomed on the contrary he had slept all night upon a bed of bracken with no other covering than the stiff pine needles from the tall black trees whose rustling music had lulled him to sleep  he sat up and remembered suddenly where he was and how he had come there he yawned and was on the point of struggling to his feet when he became aware of certain changed conditions in his surroundings some instinct of simple curiosity perhaps but of farreaching effect led him to crawl back into his hidingplace and watch  last night after many hours of painful walking two things alone had impressed themselves upon his consciousness the dark illimitable forest and the double line of rails which with the absolute straightness of exact science had stretched behind and in front till the treetops in the far distance seemed to touch and the rails themselves to vanish into the black heart of the closegrowing pines for miles he had limped along the painfully rough track without seeing the slightest sign of any break in the woods or any human being at last the desire for sleep had overtaken him he was a hardy young englishman and a night out of doors in the middle of june under these odorous pines presented itself merely as a not disagreeable adventure five minutes after the idea had occurred to him he was asleep  and now in the gray morning he looked out upon a different scene scarcely a dozen yards from him stood a single travellingcoach of dark green drawn by a heavy engine at intervals of scarcely twenty paces up and down the line as far as he could see soldiers were stationed like sentries they were looking sharply about in all directions and he could even hear the footsteps of others crashing through the wood from the train three or four men in long cloaks had already descended they were standing in the track talking together  the young man behind the bracken felt himself in somewhat of a dilemma there was a delightful smell of fresh coffee from the waiting coach and there seemed to be not the slightest reason why he should not emerge from his hidingplace and claim the hospitality of these people he was a quite harmless person with proper credentials and an adequate explanation of his presence there on the other hand the spirit of adventure natural to his years strongly prompted him to remain where he was and watch he felt certain that something was going to happen besides those soldiers had exactly the air of looking for somebody to shoot  whilst he was hesitating something did happen there was a shrill whistle a puff of white smoke in the distance and another train approached from the opposite direction  it drew up within a few feet of the one which was already waiting almost immediately half a dozen men who were already standing upon the platform of the car descended one of these approached rapidly and saluted the central figure of those who had been talking together in the track after a few moments conversation these two followed by one other man only who was carrying a writing portfolio ascended the platform of the train which had arrived first and disappeared inside  the young man who was watching these proceedings yawned  no duel then he muttered to himself ive half a mind to go out then he caught sight of a particularly fiercelooking soldier with his finger already upon the trigger of his gun and he decided to remain where he was  in about half an hour the two men reappeared on the platform of the car simultaneously the window of the carriage in which they had been sitting was opened and the third man was visible standing before a small table and arranging some papers suddenly he was called from outside he thrust his hat upon the papers and hastened to obey the summons  a little gust of breeze from the opening and closing of the door detached one of the sheets of paper from the restraining weight of the hat it fluttered out of the window and lay for a moment upon the side of the track no one noticed it and in a second or two it fluttered underneath the clump of bracken behind which the young englishman was hiding he thrust out his hand and calmly secured it  in less than five minutes the place was deserted amidst many hasty farewells wholly unintelligible to the watcher the two groups of men separated and climbed into their respective trains as soon as every one was out of sight the englishman rose with a little grunt of satisfaction and stretched himself  he glanced first at the sheet of paper and finding it written in german thrust it into his pocket then he commenced an anxious search for smoking materials and eventually produced a pipe a crumpled packet of tobacco and two matches  thank heaven he exclaimed lighting up and now for a tramp  he plodded steadily along the track for an hour or more all the time he was in the heart of the forest pheasants and rabbits and squirrels continually crossed in front of him once a train passed and an excited guard shouted threats and warnings to which he replied in fluent but ineffective english  johnnies seem to think im trespassing he remarked to himself in an aggrieved tone i cant help being on their beastly line  tall smoothfaced and fair he walked with the long step and lightsome grace of the athletic young englishman of his day he was well dressed in tweed clothes cut by a good tailor a little creased by his night out of doors but otherwise immaculate he hummed a popular air to himself and held his head high if only he were not so hungry  then he came to a station it was little more than a few rows of planks with a chalet at one endbut a very welcome sight confronted him a little pile of luggage with his initials g p was on the end of the platform nearest to him  that conductor was a sensible chap he exclaimed glad i tipped him hullo  the stationmaster in uniform came hurrying out the young englishman took off his hat and produced a phrase book from his pocket he ignored the stream of words which the stationmaster with many gesticulations was already pouring out  my luggage he said firmly laying one hand upon the pile and waving the phrase book  the stationmaster acquiesced heartily he waxed eloquent again but the englishman was busy with the phrase book  hungry hotel he attempted  the stationmaster pointed to where the smoke was curling upwards from a score or so of houses about half a mile distant the englishman was getting pleased with himself outside was a weirdlooking carriage and on the box seat fast asleep was a very fat man in a shiny hat ornamented by a bunch of feathers he pointed to the luggage then to the cab and finally to the village  luggage hotel carriage he suggested  the stationmaster beamed all over with a shout which must have reached the village he awakened the sleeping man in less than five minutes the englishman and his luggage were stored away in the carriage his ticket had been examined by the stationmaster and smilingly accepted there were more bows and salutes and the carriage drove off mr guy poynton leaned back amongst the mouldy leather upholstery and smiled complacently  easiest thing in the world to get on in a foreign country with a phrase book and your wits he remarked to himself jove i am hungry  he drove into a village of half a dozen houses or so which reminded him of the pictured abodes of noah and his brethren an astonished innkeeper whose morning attire apparently consisted of trousers shirt and spectacles ushered him into a bare room with a trestle table guy produced his phrase book  hungry he said vociferously want to eat coffee  the man appeared to understand but in case there should have been any mistake guy followed him into the kitchen the driver who had lost no time was already there with a long glass of beer before him guy produced a mark laid it on the table touched himself the innkeeper and the driver and pointed to the beer the innkeeper understood and the beer was good  the driver who had been of course ludicrously overpaid settled down in his corner and announced his intention of seeing through to the end this most extraordinary and heavendirected occurrence the innkeeper and his wife busied themselves with the breakfast and guy made remarks every now and then from his phrase book which were usually incomprehensible except when they concerned a further supply of beer with a brave acceptance of the courtesies of the country he had accepted a cigar from the driver and was already contemplating the awful moment when he would have to light it just then an interruption came  it was something very official but whether military or of the police guy could not tell it strode into the room with clanking of spurs and the driver and innkeeper alike stood up in respect it saluted guy guy took off his hat then there came words but guy was busy with his phrase book  i cannot a word of german speak he announced at last  a deadlock ensued the innkeeper and the driver rushed into the breach conversation became furious guy took advantage of the moment to slip the cigar into his pocket and to light a cigarette finally the officer swung himself round and departed abruptly  dolmetscher the driver announced to him triumphantly  dolmetscher the innkeeper repeated  guy turned it up in his phrase book and found that it meant interpreter he devoted himself then to stimulating the preparations for breakfast  the meal was ready at last there were eggs and ham and veal darkcolored bread and coffee sufficient for about a dozen people the driver constituted himself host and guy with a shout of laughter sat down where he was and ate in the midst of the meal the officer reappeared ushering in a small wizenedfaced individual of unmistakably english appearance guy turned round in his chair and the newcomer touched his forelock  hullo guy exclaimed youre english  yes sir the man answered came over to train polo ponies for the prince of haepsburg not in any trouble i hope sir  not i guy answered cheerily dont mind my going on with my breakfast do you whats it all about whos the gentleman with the firemans helmet on and whats he worrying about  he is an officer of the police sir on special service the man answered you have been reported for trespassing on the state railway this morning  trespassing be blowed guy answered ive got my ticket for the frontier we were blocked by signal about half a dozen miles off this place and i got down to stretch my legs i understood them to say that we could not go on for half an hour or so they never tried to stop my getting down and then off they went without any warning and left me there  i will translate to the officer sir the man said  right guy declared go ahead  there was a brisk colloquy between the two then the little man began again  he says that your train passed here at midnight and that you did not arrive until past six  quite right guy admitted i went to sleep i didnt know how far it was to the station and i was dead tired  the officer wishes to know whether many trains passed you in the night  cant say guy answered i sleep very soundly and i never opened my eyes after the first few minutes  the officer wishes to know whether you saw anything unusual upon the line the little man asked  nothing at all guy answered coolly bit inquisitive isnt he  the little man came closer to the table  he wishes to see your passport sir he announced  guy handed it to him also a letter of credit and several other documents  he wants to know why you were going to the frontier sir  sort of fancy to say that id been in russia thats all guy answered you tell him im a perfectly harmless individual never been abroad before  the officer listened and took notes in his pocketbook of the passport and letter of credit then he departed with a formal salute and they heard his horses hoofs ring upon the road outside as he galloped away the little man came close up to the table  youll excuse me sir he said but you seem to have upset the officials very much by being upon the line last night there have been some rumors going aboutbut perhaps youre best not to know that may i give you a word of advice sir  let me give you one guy declared try this beer  i thank you sir the man answered i will do so with pleasure but if you are really an ordinary tourist siras i have no doubt you arelet this man drive you to streuen and take the train for the austrian frontier you may save yourself a good deal of unpleasantness  ill do it guy declared vienna was the next place i was going to anyhow you tell the fellow where to take me will you  the man spoke rapidly to the driver  i think that you will be followed sir he added turning to guy but very likely they wont interfere with you the railway last night for twenty miles back was held up for state purposes we none of us know why and it doesnt do to be too curious over here but they have an idea that you are either a journalist or a spy  civis britannicus sum the boy answered with a laugh  it doesnt quite mean what it used to sir the man answered quietly     chapter ii  at the cafÉ montmartre   exactly a week later at five minutes after midnight guy poynton in evening dress entered the café montmartre in paris he made his way through the heterogeneous little crowd of men and women who were drinking at the bar past the scarletcoated orchestra into the inner room where the tables were laid for supper monsieur albert satisfied with the appearance of his new client led him at once to a small table submitted the wine card and summoned a waiter with some difficulty as his french was very little better than his german he ordered supper and then lighting a cigarette leaned back against the wall and looked around to see if he could discover any english or americans  the room was only moderately full for the hour was a little early for this quarter of paris nevertheless he was quick to appreciate a certain spirit of bohemianism which pleased him every one talked to his neighbor an american from the further end of the room raised his glass and drank his health a pretty fairhaired girl leaned over from her table and smiled at him  monsieur like talk with me eh  english he asked  no de wien  he shook his head smilingly  we shouldnt get on he declared cant speak the language  she raised her eyebrows with a protesting gesture but he looked away and opened an illustrated paper by his side he turned over the pages idly enough at first but suddenly paused he whistled softly to himself and stared at the two photographs which filled the sheet  by jove he said softly to himself  there was the rustling of skirts close to his table an unmistakably english voice addressed him  is it anything very interesting do show me  he looked up mademoiselle flossie pleased with his appearance had paused on her way down the room  come and sit down and ill show it you he said rising youre english arent you  mademoiselle flossie waved a temporary adieu to her friends and accepted the invitation he poured her out a glass of wine  stay and have supper with me he begged i must be off soon but im tired of being alone this is my last night thank goodness  all right she answered gayly i must go back to my friends directly afterwards  order what you like he begged i cant make these chaps understand me  she laughed and called the waiter  and now show me what you were looking at in that paper she insisted  he pointed to the two photographs  i saw those two together only a week ago he said want to hear about it  she looked startled for a moment and a little incredulous  yes go on she said  he told her the story she listened with an interest which surprised him once or twice when he looked up he fancied that the lady from vienna was also doing her best to listen when he had finished their supper had arrived  i think she said as she helped herself to hors doeuvre that you were very fortunate to get away  he laughed carelessly  the joke of it is he said ive been followed all the way here one fellow who pretended he got in at strasburg was trying to talk to me all the time but i saw him sneak in at vienna and i wasnt having any i say do you come here every evening  very often she answered i dance at the comique and then we generally go to maxims to supper and up here afterwards ill introduce you to my friends afterwards if you like and well all sit together if youre very good ill dance to you  delighted he answered if they speak english im sick of trying to make people understand my rotten french  she nodded  they speak english all right i wish that horrid viennese girl wouldnt try to listen to every word we say  he smiled  she wanted me to sit at her table he remarked  mademoiselle flossie looked at him warningly and dropped her voice  better be careful she whispered they say shes a spy  on my track very likely he declared with a grin  she threw herself back in her seat and laughed  conceited why should any one want to be on your track come and see me dance at the comique tomorrow night  cant he declared my sisters coming over from england  stupid  oh ill come one night he declared order some coffee wont youand what liqueurs  ill go and fetch my friends she declared rising well all have coffee together  who are they he asked  she pointed to a little group down the roomtwo men and a woman the men were french one middleaged and one young dark immaculate and with the slightly bored air affected by young frenchmen of fashion the woman was strikingly handsome and magnificently dressed they were quite the most distinguishedlooking people in the room  if you think theyll come he remarked doubtfully arent we rather comfortable as we are  she made her way between the tables  oh theyll come she declared theyre pals  she floated down the room with a cigarette in her mouth very graceful in her airy muslin skirts and large hat guy followed her admiringly with his eyes the viennese lady suddenly tore off a corner of her menu and scribbled something quickly she passed it over to guy  read she said imperatively  he nodded and opened it  prenez garde he said slowly then he looked at her and shook his head she was making signs to him to destroy her message and he at once did so  dont understand he said sorry  mademoiselle flossie was laughing and talking with her friends presently they rose and came across the room with her guy stood up and bowed the introductions were informal but he felt his insular prejudices a little shattered by the delightful ease with which these two frenchmen accepted the situation their breeding was as obvious as their bonhomie the table was speedily rearranged to find places for them all  your friends will take coffee with me mademoiselle guy said do be hostess please my attempts at french will only amuse everybody  the elder of the two frenchmen whom the waiter addressed as monsieur le baron and every one else as louis held up his hand  with pleasure he declared later on just now it is too early we will celebrate lentente cordiale garçon a magnum of pommery un neu frappé i know you will forgive the liberty he said smiling at guy this bottle is vowed flossie has smiled for the first time for three evenings  she threw a paper fan at him and sat down again by guy  do tell him the story you told me she whispered in his ear louis listen  guy retold his story monsieur le baron listened intently so did the lady who had accompanied him guy felt that he told it very well but for the second time he omitted all mention of that missing sheet of paper which had come into his possession monsieur le baron was obviously much interested  you are quite sureof the two men he asked quietly  quite guy answered confidently one was  madameflossies frienddropped a wineglass monsieur le baron raised his hand  no names he said it is better not we understand a most interesting adventure monsieur poynton andto your health  the wine was good and the fun of the place itself went almost to the head always there were newcomers who passed down the room amidst a chorus of greetings always the gayest of music then amidst cheers flossie and another friend whom she called from a distant table danced a cakewalkdanced very gracefully and with a marvellous display of rainbow skirts she came back breathless and threw herself down by guys side  give me some more wine she panted how close the place is  the younger frenchman who had scarcely spoken leaned over  an idea he exclaimed my automobile is outside i will drive you all round the city monsieur poynton shall see paris undressed afterwards we will go to louis rooms and make his man cook us a déjeuner anglais  flossie stood up and laughed  wholl lend me a coat she cried ive nothing but a lace mantle  plenty of frenchmen in the car the young frenchman cried are we all agreed good garçon laddition  and mine guy ordered  the women departed for their wraps guy and the two frenchmen filled their pockets with cigarettes when the bills came guy found that his own was a trifle and monsieur louis waved aside all protest  we are hosts tonight my young friend he declared with charming insistence another time you shall have your turn you must come round to the club tomorrow and we will arrange for some sport allons  they crowded out together amidst a chorus of farewells guy took flossies arm going down the stairs  i say im awfully obliged to you for introducing me to your friends he declared im having a ripping time  she laughed  oh theyre all right she declared mind my skirts  i say what does prenez garde mean he asked  take care why  he laughed again  nothing     chapter iii  a mysterious disappearance   mademoiselle the young man said with an air of somewhat weary politeness i regret to say that there is nothing more to be done  he was grieved and polite because mademoiselle was beautiful and in trouble for the rest he was a little tired of her brothers of twentyone who have never been in paris before and cannot speak the language must occasionally get lost and the british embassy is not exactly a transported scotland yard  then she declared with a vigorous little stamp of her shapely foot i dont see what we keep an ambassador here for at allor any of you it is scandalous  the hon nigel fergusson dropped his eyeglass and surveyed the young lady attentively  my dear miss poynton he said i will not presume to argue with you we are here i suppose for some purpose or other whether we fulfil it or not may well be a matter of opinion but that purpose is certainly not to look after any young idiotyou must excuse my speaking plainlywho runs amuck in this most fascinating city in your case the chief has gone out of his way to help you he has interviewed the chief of police himself brought his influence to bear in various quarters and i can tell you conscientiously that everything which possibly can be done is being done at the present moment if you wish for my advice it is this send for some friend to keep you company here and try to be patient you are in all probability making yourself needlessly miserable  she looked at him a little reproachfully he noticed however with secret joy that she was drawing on her gloves  patient he was to meet me here ten days ago he arrived at the hotel his clothes are all there and his bill unpaid he went out the night of his arrival and has never returned patient well i am much obliged to you mr fergusson i have no doubt that you have done all that your duty required good afternoon  good afternoon miss poynton and dont be too despondent remember that the french police are the cleverest in the world and they are working for you  she looked up at him scornfully  police indeed she answered do you know that all they have done so far is to keep sending for me to go and look at dead bodies down at the morgue i think that i shall send over for an english detective  you might do worse he answered but in any case miss poynton i do hope that you will send over for some friend or relation to keep you company paris is scarcely a fit place for you to be alone and in trouble  thank you she said i will remember what you have said  the young man watched her depart with a curious mixture of relief and regret  the young fools been the usual round i suppose and hes either too much ashamed of himself or too besotted to turn up i wish she wasnt quite so devilish goodlooking he remarked to himself if she goes about alone shell get badly scared before shes finished  phyllis poynton drove straight back to her hotel and went to her room a sympathetic chambermaid followed her in  mademoiselle has news yet of her brother she inquired  mademoiselle shook her head indeed her face was sufficient answer  none at all marie  the chambermaid closed the door  it would help mademoiselle perhaps if she knew where the young gentleman spent the evening before he disappeared she inquired mysteriously  of course that is just what i want to find out  marie smiled  there is a young man here in the barbers shop mademoiselle she announced he remembers monsieur poynton quite well he went in there to be shaved and he asked some questions i think if mademoiselle were to see him  the girl jumped up at once  do you know his name she asked  monsieur alphonse they call him he is on duty now  phyllis poynton descended at once to the ground floor of the hotel and pushed open the glass door which led into the coiffeurs shop monsieur alphonse was waiting upon a customer and she was given a chair in a few minutes he descended the spiral iron staircase and desired to know mademoiselles pleasure  you speak english she asked  but certainly mademoiselle  she gave a little sigh of relief  i wonder she said if you remember waiting upon my brother last thursday week he was tall and fair and something like me he had just arrived in paris  monsieur alphonse smiled he rarely forgot a face and the young englishmans tip had been munificent  perfectly mademoiselle he answered they sent for me because monsieur spoke no french  my chambermaid marie told me that you might perhaps know how he proposed to spend the evening she continued he was quite a stranger in paris and he may have asked for some information  monsieur alphonse smiled and extended his hands  it is quite true he answered he asked me where to go and i say to the folies bergères then he said he had heard a good deal of the supper cafés and he asked me which was the most amusing i tell him the café montmartre he wrote it down  do you think that he meant to go there she asked  but certainly he promised to come and tell me the next day how he amused himself  the café montmartre where is it she asked  in the place de montmartre but mademoiselle pardonsshe will understand that it is a place for men  are women not admitted she asked  alphonse smiled  butyes only mademoiselle understands that if a lady should go there she would need to be very well escorted  she rose and slipped a coin into his hand  i am very much obliged to you she said by the bye have any other people made inquiries of you concerning my brother  no one at all mademoiselle the man answered  she almost slammed the door behind when she went out  and they say that the french police are the cleverest in the world she exclaimed indignantly  monsieur alphonse watched her through the glass pane  ciel but she is pretty he murmured to himself                                       she turned into the writingroom and taking off her gloves she wrote a letter her pretty fingers were innocent of rings and her handwriting was a little shaky nevertheless it is certain that not a man passed through the room who did not find an excuse to steal a second glance at her this is what she wrote       my dear andrewi am in great distress here and      very unhappy i should have written to you before but i know      that you have your own trouble to bear just now and i hated      to bother you i arrived here punctually on the date arranged      upon between guy and myself and found that he had arrived the      night before and had engaged a room for me he was out when i      came i changed my clothes and sat down to wait for him he      did not return i made inquiries and found that he had left      the hotel at eight oclock the previous evening to cut the      matter short ten days have now elapsed and he has not yet      returned       i have been to the embassy to the police and to the morgue      nowhere have i found the slightest trace of him no one seems      to take the least interest in his disappearance the police      shrug their shoulders and look at me as though i ought to      understandhe will return very shortly they are quite sure      at the embassy they have begun to look upon me as a nuisance      the morgueheaven send that i may one day forget the horror      of my hasty visits there i have come to the conclusion      andrew that i must search for him myself how i do not know      where i do not know but i shall not leave paris until i have      found him       andrew what i want is a friend here a few months ago i      should not have hesitated a moment to ask you to come to me      today that is impossible your presence here would only be an      embarrassment to both of us do you know of any one who would      come i have not a single relative whom i can ask to help me      would you advise me to write to scotland yard for a detective      or go to one of these agencies if not can you think of any      one who would come here and help me either for your sake as      your friend or better still a detective who can speak      french and whom one can trust all our lives guy and i have      congratulated ourselves that we have no relation nearer than      india i am finding out the other side of it now       i know that you will do what you can for me andrew write to      me by return        yours in great trouble and distress         phyllis poynton  she sealed and addressed her letter and saw it despatched afterwards she crossed the courtyard to the restaurant and did her best to eat some dinner when she had finished it was only halfpast eight she rang for the lift and ascended to the fourth floor on her way down the corridor a sudden thought struck her she took a key from her pocket and entered the room which her brother had occupied  his things were still lying about in some disorder and neither of his trunks was locked she went down on her knees and calmly proceeded to go through his belongings it was rather a forlorn hope but it seemed to her just possible that there might be in some of his pockets a letter which would throw light upon his disappearance she found nothing of the sort however there were picture postcards a few photographs and a good many restaurant bills but they were all from places in germany and austria at the bottom of the second trunk however she found something which he had evidently considered it worth while to preserve carefully it was a thick sheet of officiallooking paper bearing at the top an embossed crown and covered with german writing it was numbered at the top seventeen and it was evidently an odd sheet of some document she folded it carefully up and took it back with her to her own room then with the help of a german dictionary she commenced to study it at the end of an hour she had made out a rough translation which she read carefully through when she had finished she was thoroughly perplexed she had an uncomfortable sense of having come into touch with something wholly unexpected and mysterious  what am i to do she said to herself softly  what can it mean where on earth can guyhave found this  there was no one to answer her no one to advise an overwhelming sense of her own loneliness brought the tears into her eyes she sat for some time with her face buried in her hands then she rose up calmly destroyed her translation with minute care and locked away the mysterious sheet at the bottom of her dressingbag the more she thought of it the less after all she felt inclined to connect it with his disappearance     chapter iv  the falling of the handkerchief   monsieur albert looked over her shoulder for the man who must surely be in attendancebut he looked in vain  mademoiselle wishes a tablefor herself alone he repeated doubtfully  if you please she answered  it was obvious that mademoiselle was of the class which does not frequent night cafés alone but after all that was scarcely monsieur alberts concern she came perhaps from that strange land of the free whose daughters had long ago kicked over the barriers of sex with the same abandon that mademoiselle flossie would display the soles of her feet a few hours later in their national dance if she had chanced to raise her veil no earthly persuasions on her part would have secured for her the freedom of that little room for monsieur alberts appreciation of likeness was equal to his memory for faces but it was not until she was comfortably ensconced at a corner table from which she had a good view of the room that she did so and monsieur albert realized with a philosophic shrug of the shoulders the error he had committed  phyllis looked about her with some curiosity it was too early for the habitués of the place and most of the tables were empty the scarletcoated band were smoking cigarettes and had not yet produced their instruments the conductor curled his black moustache and stared hard at the beautiful young english lady without however being able to attract a single glance in return one or two men also tried to convey to her by smiles and glances the fact that her solitude need continue no longer than she chose the unattached ladies put their heads together and discussed her with little peals of laughter to all of these things she remained indifferent she ordered a supper which she ate mechanically and wine which she scarcely drank all the while she was considering now that she was here what could she do of whom was she to make inquiries she scanned the faces of the newcomers with a certain grave curiosity which puzzled them she neither invited nor repelled notice she remained entirely at her ease  monsieur albert during one of his peregrinations round the room passed close to her table she stopped him  i trust that mademoiselle is well served he remarked with a little bow  excellently i thank you she answered  he would have passed on but she detained him  you have very many visitors here she remarked is it the same always  he smiled  tonight he declared it is nothing there are many who come here every evening they amuse themselves here  you have a good many strangers also she asked  but certainly he declared all the time  i have a brother she said who was here eleven nights agolet me seethat would be last tuesday week he is tall and fair about twentyone and they say like me i wonder if you remember him  monsieur albert shook his head slowly  that is strange he declared for as a rule i forget no one last tuesday week i remember perfectly well it was a quiet evening la scala was herebut of the rest no one if mademoiselles brother was here it is most strange  her lip quivered for a moment she was disappointed  i am so sorry she said i hoped that you might have been able to help me he left the grand hotel on that night with the intention of coming hereand he never returned i have been very much worried ever since  she was no great judge of character but monsieur alberts sympathy did not impress her with its sincerity  if mademoiselle desires he said i will make inquiries amongst the waiters i very much fear however that she will obtain no news here  he departed and phyllis watched him talking to some of the waiters and the leader of the orchestra  presently he returned  i am very sorry he announced but the brother of mademoiselle could not have come here i have inquired of the garçons and of monsieur jules there who forgets no one they answer all the same  thank you very much she answered it must have been somewhere else  she was unreasonably disappointed it had been a very slender chance but at least it was something tangible she had scarcely expected to have it snapped so soon and so thoroughly she dropped her veil to hide the tears which she felt were not far from her eyes and summoned the waiter for her bill there seemed to be no object in staying longer suddenly the unexpected happened  a hand flashing with jewels was rested for a moment upon her table when it was withdrawn a scrap of paper remained there  phyllis looked up in amazement the girl to whom the hand had belonged was sitting at the next table but her head was turned away and she seemed to be only concerned in watching the door she drew the scrap of paper towards her and cautiously opened it this is what she read written in english but with a foreign turn to most of the letters       monsieur albert lied your brother was here wait till i      speak to you  instinctively she crumpled up this strange little note in her hand she struggled hard to maintain her composure she had at once the idea that every one in the place was looking at her monsieur albert indeed on his way down the room wondered what had driven the hopeless expression from her face  the waiter brought her bill she paid it and tipped him with prodigality which for a woman was almost reckless then she ordered coffee and after a seconds hesitation cigarettes why not nearly all the women were smoking and she desired to pass for the moment as one of them for the first time she ventured to gaze at her neighbor  it was the young lady from vienna she was dressed in a wonderful demitoilette of white lace and she wore a large picture hat adjusted at exactly the right angle for her profile from her throat and bosom there flashed the sparkle of many gemsthe finger which held her cigarette was ablaze with diamonds she leaned back in her seat smoking lazily and she met phylliss furtive gaze with almost insolent coldness but a moment later when monsieur alberts back was turned she leaned forward and addressed her rapidly  a man will come here she said who could tell you if he was willing all that you seek to know he will come tonighthe comes all the nights you will see i hold my handkerchief so in my right hand when he comes i shall drop itso  the girls swift speech her halffearful glances towards the door puzzled phyllis  can you not come nearer to me and talk she asked  no you must not speak to me again you must not let any one especially the man himself know what i have told you no more now watch for the handkerchief  but what shall i say to him  the girl took no notice of her she was looking in the opposite direction she seemed to have edged away as far as possible from her phyllis drew a long breath  she felt her heart beating with excitement the place suddenly seemed to her like part of a nightmare  and then all was clear again fortune was on her side the secret of guys disappearance was in this room and a few careless words from the girl at the next table had told her more than an entire police system had been able to discover but why the mystery what was she to say to the man when he came the girl from vienna was talking to some friends and toying carelessly with a little morsel of lace which she had drawn from her bosom phyllis watched it with the eyes of a cat every now and then she watched also the door  the place was much fuller now mademoiselle flossie had arrived with a small company of friends from maxims the music was playing all the time the popping of corks was almost incessant the volume of sound had swelled the laughter and greeting of friends betrayed more abandon than earlier in the evening old acquaintances had been renewed and new ones made mademoiselle from vienna was surrounded by a little circle of admirers still she held in her right hand a crumpled up little ball of lace  men passing down the room tried to attract the attention of the beautiful young english demoiselle who looked out upon the little scene so indifferently as regarded individuals and yet with such eager interest as a whole no one was bold enough however to make a second effort necessity at times gives birth to a swift capacity fresh from her simple country life phyllis found herself still able with effortless serenity to confound the most hardened boulevarders who paused to ogle her her eyes and lips expressed with ease the most convincing and absolute indifference to their approaches a man may sometimes brave anger he rarely has courage to combat indifference so phyllis held her own and waited  and at last the handkerchief fell phyllis felt her own heart almost stop beating as she gazed down the room a man of medium height dark distinguished was slowly approaching her exchanging greetings on every side his languid eyes fell upon phyllis those who had watched her previously saw then a change the cold indifference had vanished from her face she leaned forward as though anxious to attract his attention she succeeded easily enough  he was almost opposite her table and her half smile seemed to leave him but little choice he touched the back of the chair which fronted hers and took off his hat  mademoiselle permits he asked softly  but certainly she answered it is you for whom i have been waiting  mademoiselle flatters me he murmured more than a little astonished  not in the least she answered i have been waiting to ask you what has become of my brotherguy poynton  he drew out the chair and seated himself his eyes never left her face  mademoiselle he murmured this is most extraordinary  she noticed then that his hands were trembling     chapter v  love at first sight   i am asking a great deal of you george i know it but you see how helpless i amand read the letterread it for yourself  he passed phylliss letter across the small round diningtable his guest took it and read it carefully through  how old is the young lady he asked  twentythree  and the boy  twentyone  orphans i think you said  orphans and relationless  well off  moderately  duncombe leaned back in his chair and sipped his port thoughtfully  it is an extraordinary situation he remarked  extraordinary indeed his friend assented but so far as i am concerned you can see how i am fixed i am older than either of them but i have always been their nearest neighbor and their most intimate friend if ever they have needed advice they have come to me for it if ever i have needed a days shooting for myself or a friend i have gone to them this continental tour of theirs we discussed and planned out months beforehand if my misfortune had not come on just when it did i should have gone with them and even up to the last we hoped that i might be able to go to paris with phyllis  duncombe nodded  tell me about the boy he said  his host shrugged his shoulders  you know what theyre like at that age he remarked he was at harrow but he shied at college and there was no one to insist upon his going the pair of them had only a firm of lawyers for guardians hes just a goodlooking cleanminded highspirited young fellow full of beans and needing the bit every now and then but of course hes no different from the run of young fellows of his age and if an adventure came his way i suppose hed see it through  and the girl  andrew pelham rose from his seat  i will show you her photograph he said  he passed into an inner room divided from the diningroom by curtains in a moment or two he reappeared  here it is he said and laid a picture upon the table  now duncombe was a young man who prided himself a little on being unimpressionable he took up the picture with a certain tolerant interest and examined it at first without any special feeling yet in a moment or two he felt himself grateful for those great disfiguring glasses from behind which his host was temporarily at least blind to all that passed a curious disturbance seemed to have passed into his blood he felt his eyes brighten and his breath come a little quicker as he unconsciously created in his imagination the living presentment of the girl whose picture he was still holding tall she was and slim with a soft white throat and long graceful neck eyes rather darker than her complexion warranted a little narrow but bright as starsa mouth with the divine lines of humor and understanding it was only a picture but a realization of the living image seemed to be creeping in upon him he made the excuse of seeking a better light and moved across to a distant lamp he bent over the picture but it was not the picture which he saw he saw the girl herself and even with the halfformed thought he saw her expression change he saw her eyes lit with sorrow and appealhe saw her arms outstretched towards himhe seemed even to hear her soft cry he knew then what his answer would be to his friends prayer he thought no more of the excuses which he had been building in his mind of all the practical suggestions which he had been prepared to make commonsense died away within him the matteroffact man of thirty was ready to tread in the footsteps of this great predecessor and play the modern knighterrant with the wholeheartedness of don quixote himself he fancied himself by her side and his heart leaped with joy of it he thought no more of abandoned cricket matches and neglected house parties a finger of fire had been laid upon his somewhat torpid flesh and blood  well andrew asked  duncombe returned to the table and laid the picture down with a reluctance which he could scarcely conceal  very nice photograph he remarked taken locally  i took it myself andrew answered i used to be rather great at that sort of thing beforebefore my eyes went dicky  duncombe resumed his seat he helped himself to another glass of wine  i presume he said from the fact that you call yourself their nearest friend that the young lady is not engaged  no andrew answered slowly she is not engaged  something a little different in his voice caught his friends attention duncombe eyed him keenly he was conscious of a sense of apprehension he leaned over the table  do you mean andrew he asked hoarsely do you mean  yes i mean that his friend answered quietly nice sort of old fool am i not im twelve years older than she is im only moderately well off and less than moderately goodlooking but after all im only human and ive seen her grow up from a fresh charming child into one of gods wonderful women even a gardener you know george loves the roses he has planted and watched over ive taught her a little and helped her a little and ive watched her cross the borderland  does she know  andrew shook his head doubtfully  i think he said that she was beginning to guess three months ago i should have spokenbut my trouble came i didnt mean to tell you this but perhaps it is as well that you should know you can understand now what i am suffering to think of her there alone almost maddens me  duncombe rose suddenly from his seat  come out into the garden andrew he said i feel stifled here  his host rose and took duncombes arm they passed out through the french window on to the gravel path which circled the cedarshaded lawn a shower had fallen barely an hour since and the air was full of fresh delicate fragrance birds were singing in the dripping trees blackbirds were busy in the grass the perfume from the wet lilac shrubs was a very dream of sweetness andrew pointed across a park which sloped down to the garden boundary  up there amongst the elm trees george he said can you see a gleam of white that is the hall just to the left of the rookery  duncombe nodded  yes he said i can see it  guy and she walked down so often after dinner he said quietly i have stood here and watched them sometimes she came alone what a long time ago that seems  duncombes grip upon his arm tightened  andrew he said i cant go  there was a short silence andrew stood quite still all around them was the soft weeping of dripping shrubs an odorous whiff from the walled rosegarden floated down the air  im sorry george its a lot to ask you i know  it isnt that  andrew turned his head toward his friend the tone puzzled him  i dont understand  no wonder old fellow i dont understand myself  there was another short silence andrew stood with his almost sightless eyes turned upon his friend and duncombe was looking up through the elm trees to the hall he was trying to fancy her as she must have appeared to this man who dwelt alone walking down the meadow in the evening  no he repeated softly i dont understand myself youve known me for a long time andrew you wouldnt write me down as altogether a sentimental ass would you  i should not george i should never even use the word sentimental in connection with you  duncombe turned and faced him squarely he laid his hands upon his friends shoulders  old man he said heres the truth so far as a man can be said to have lost his heart without rhyme or reason ive lost mine to the girl of that picture  andrew drew a quick breath  rubbish george he exclaimed why you never saw her you dont know her  it is quite true duncombe answered and yeti have seen her picture  his friend laughed queerly  you george duncombe in love with a picture stonyhearted george we used to call you i cant believe it i cant take you seriously its all rot you know isnt it it must be rot  it sounds like it duncombe answered quietly put it this way if you like i have seen a picture of the woman whom if ever i meet i most surely shall love what there is that speaks to me from that picture i do not know you say that only love can beget love then there is that in the picture which points beyond you see i have talked like this in an attempt to be honest you have told me that you care for her therefore i have told you these strange things now do you wish me to go to paris for if you say yes i shall surely go  again andrew laughed and this time his mirth sounded more natural  let me see he said we drank pontet canet for dinner you refused liqueurs but i think you drank two glasses of port george what has come over you what has stirred your slowmoving blood to fancies like these bah we are playing with one another listen for the sake of our friendship george i beg you to grant me this great favor go to paris tomorrow and help phyllis  you mean it  god knows i do if ever i took you seriously georgeif ever i feared to lose the woman i lovewell i should be a coward for my own sake to rob her of help when she needs it so greatly be her friend george and mine for the rest the fates must provide  the fates duncombe answered ay it seems to me that they have been busy about my head tonight it is settled then i will go     chapter vi  the vanishing lady   at precisely halfpast nine on the following evening duncombe alighted from his petite voiture in the courtyard of the grand hotel and making his way into the office engaged a room and then he asked the question which a hundred times on the way over he had imagined himself asking a man to whom nervousness in any shape was almost unknown he found himself only able to control his voice and manner with the greatest difficulty in a few moments he might see her  you have a young english ladymiss poyntonstaying here i believe he said can you tell me if she is in now  the clerk looked at him with sudden interest  miss poynton is staying here sir he said i do not believe that she is in just now will you wait one moment  he disappeared rapidly and was absent for several minutes when he returned he came out into the reception hall  the manager would be much obliged if you would step into his office for a moment sir he said confidentially will you come this way  duncombe followed him into a small room behind the counter a grayhaired man rose from his desk and saluted him courteously  sir george duncombe i believe he said will you kindly take a seat  duncombe did as he was asked all the time he felt that the manager was scrutinizing him curiously  your clerk he said told me that you wished to speak to me  exactly the manager answered you inquired when you came in for miss poynton may i askare you a friend of hers  i am here on behalf of her friends duncombe answered i have letters to her  the manager bowed gravely  i trust he said that you will soon have an opportunity to deliver them we are not of course responsible in any way for the conduct or doings of our clients here but i am bound to say that both the young people of the name you mention have been the cause of much anxiety to us  what do you mean duncombe asked quickly  mr guy poynton the manager continued arrived here about three weeks ago and took a room for himself and one for his sister who was to arrive on the following day he went out that same evening and has never since returned of that fact you are no doubt aware  duncombe nodded impatiently  yes he said that is why i am here  his sister arrived on the following day and was naturally very distressed we did all that we could for her we put her in the way of communicating with the police and the embassy here and we gave her every assistance that was possible four nights ago mademoiselle went out late since then we have seen nothing of her mademoiselle also has disappeared  duncombe sprang to his feet he was suddenly pale  good god he exclaimed four nights ago she went out alone you say  how else she had no friends here once or twice at my suggestion she had taken one of our guides with her but she discontinued this as she fancied that it made her conspicuous she was all the time going round to places making inquiries about her brother  duncombe felt himself suddenly precipitated into a new worlda nightmare of horrors he was no stranger in the city and grim possibilities unfolded themselves before his eyes four nights ago  you have sentto the police  naturally but in parismonsieur must excuse me if i speak plainlya disappearance of this sort is never regarded seriously by them you know the life here without doubt monsieur your accent proves that you are well acquainted with the city no doubt their conclusions are based upon direct observation and in most cases are correctbut it is very certain that monsieur the superintendent regards such disappearances as these as due to one cause only  duncombe frowned and something flashed in his eyes which made the manager very glad that he had not put forward this suggestion on his own account  with regard to the boy he said this might be likely enough but with regard to the young lady it is of course wildly preposterous i will go to the police myself he added rising  one moment sir george the manager continued the disappearance of the young lady was a source of much trouble to me and i made all possible inquiries within the hotel i found that on the day of her disappearance mademoiselle had been told by one of the attendants in the barbers shop who had waited upon her brother on the night of his arrival that hemonsieur guyhad asked for the name of some cafés for supper and that he had recommended café montmartre mademoiselle appears to have decided to go there herself to make inquiries we have no doubt that when she left the hotel on the night of her disappearance it was to there that she went  you have told the police this  yes i have told them the manager answered dryly here is their latest report if you care to see it  duncombe took the little slip of paper and read it hastily       disappearance of mademoiselle poynton from englandwe      regret to state no trace has been discovered of the missing      young lady         signed jules legarde superintendent  that was only issued a few hours ago the manager said  and i thought duncombe said bitterly that the french police were the best in the world  the manager said nothing duncombe rose from his chair  i shall go myself to the café montmartre he said the manager bowed  i shall be glad he said to divest myself of any further responsibility in this matter it has been a source of much anxiety to the directors as well as myself  duncombe walked out of the room and putting on his coat again called for a petite voiture he gave the man the address in the rue st honoré and was driven to a block of flats there over some shops  is monsieur spencer in he asked the concierge he was directed to the first floor an english manservant admitted him and a few moments later he was shaking hands with a man who was seated before a table covered with loose sheets of paper  duncombe by all thats wonderful he exclaimed holding out his hand why i thought that you had shaken the dust of the city from your feet forever and turned country squire sit down what will you have  first of all am i disturbing you  spencer shook his head  ive no press work tonight he answered ive a clear hour to give you at any rate when did you come  twotwenty from charing cross duncombe answered i cant tell you how thankful i am to find you in spencer im over on a very serious matter and i want your advice  spencer touched the bell cigars and cigarettes whisky and soda appeared as though by magic  now help yourself and go ahead old chap his host declared im a good listener  he proved himself so sitting with halfclosed eyes and an air of close attention until he had heard the whole story he did not once interrupt but when duncombe had finished he asked a question  what did you say was the name of this café where the boy had disappeared  café montmartre  spencer sat up in his chair his expression had changed  the devil he murmured softly  you know the place  very well it has an extraordinary reputation i am sorry to say it duncombe but it is a very bad place for your friend to have disappeared from  why  in the first place it is the resort of a good many of the most dangerous people in europepeople who play the game through to the end it is a perfect hotbed of political intrigue and it is under police protection  police protection a place like that duncombe exclaimed  not as you and i understand it perhaps spencer explained there is no scotland yard extending a protecting arm over the place and that sort of thing but the place is haunted by spies and there are intrigues carried on there in which the secret service police often take a hand in return it is generally very hard to get to the bottom of any disappearance or even robbery there through the usual channels to the casual visitor and of course it attracts thousands from its reputation it presents no more dangers perhaps than the ordinary night café of its sort but i could think of a dozen men in paris today who if they entered it i honestly believe would never be seen again  spencer was exaggerating duncombe murmured to himself he was a newspaper correspondent and he saw these things with the halo of melodrama around them and yetfour nights ago his face was white and haggard  the boy he said could have been no more than an ordinary visitor he had no great sum of money with him he had no secrets he did not even speak the language surely he would have been too small fry for the intriguers of such a place  one would think so spencer answered musingly you are sure that he was only what you say  he was barely twentyone duncombe answered and he had never been out of england before  what about the girl  she is two years older it was her first visit to paris spencer nodded  the disappearance of the boy is of course the riddle he remarked if you solve that you arrive also at his sisters whereabouts upon my word it is a poser if it had been the boy alonewell one could understand the most beautiful ladies in paris are at the montmartre no one is admitted who is not what they considerchic the great dancers and actresses are given handsome presents to show themselves there on a representative evening it is probably the most brilliant little roomful in europe the boy of course might have lost his head easily enough and then been ashamed to face his sister but when you tell me of her disappearance too you confound me utterly is she goodlooking  very  she would go there of course asking for her brother spencer continued thoughtfully an utterly absurd thing to do but no doubt she did andlook here duncombe i tell you what ill do i have my own two newsgrabbers at hand and nothing particular for them to do this evening ill send them up to the café montmartre  its awfully good of you spencer i was going myself duncombe said a little doubtfully  you idiot his friend said cheerfully yet with a certain emphasis english from your hair to your boots youd go in there and attempt to pump people who have been playing the game all their lives and who would give you exactly what information suited their books theyd know what you were there for the moment you opened your mouth honestly what manner of good do you think that you could do youd learn what they chose to tell you if theres really anything serious behind all this do you suppose it would be the truth  youre quite right i suppose duncombe admitted but it seems beastly to be doing nothing  better be doing nothing than doing harm spencer declared look round the other cafés and the boulevards and come here at eleven tomorrow morning well breakfast together at paillards     chapter vii  the decoyhouse of europe   spencer wrote out his luncheon with the extreme care of the man to whom eating has passed to its proper place amongst the arts and left to duncombe the momentous question of red wine or white finally he leaned back in his chair and looked thoughtfully across at his companion  sir george he said you have placed me in a very painful position  duncombe glanced up from his hors doeuvre  what do you mean  i will explain spencer continued you came to me last night with a story in which i hope that i showed a reasonable amount of interest but in which as a matter of fact i was not interested at all girls and boys who come to paris for the first time in their lives unattended and find their way to the café montmartre and such places generally end up in the same place it would have sounded brutal if i had added to your distress last night by talking like this so i determined to put you in the way of finding out for yourself i sent two of my most successful newsscouts to that place last night and i had not the slightest doubt as to the nature of the information which they would bring back it turns out that i was mistaken  what did they discover duncombe asked eagerly  nothing  duncombes face fell but he looked a little puzzled  nothing i dont understand they must have heard that they had been there anyhow  they discovered nothing you do not understand the significance of this i do it means that i was mistaken for one thing their disappearance has more in it than the usual significance evil may have come to them but not the ordinary sort of evil listen you say that the police have disappointed you in having discovered nothing that is no longer extraordinary to me the police or those who stand behind them are interested in this case and in the withholding of information concerning it  you are talking riddles to me spencer duncombe declared do you mean that the police in paris may become the hired tools of malefactors  not altogether that spencer said waving aside a dish presented before him by the head waiter himself with a gesture of approval not necessarily malefactors but there are other powers to be taken into consideration and most unaccountably your two friends are in deeper water than your story led me to expect now not another question please until you have tried that sauce absolute silence if you please for at least three or four minutes  duncombe obeyed with an ill grace he had little curiosity as to its flavor and a very small appetite at all with the conversation in its present position he waited for the stipulated time however and then leaned once more across the table  spencer  first i must have your judgment upon the sauce did you find enough mussels  damn the sauce duncombe answered forgive me spencer but this affair is after all a serious one to me you say that your two scouts as you call them discovered nothing well they had only one evening at it will they try again in other directions can i engage them to work for me money is absolutely no object  spencer shook his head  duncombe he said youre going to think me a poor sort of friend but the truth is best you must not count upon me any more i cannot lift even my little finger to help you i can only give you advice if you want it  and that  go back to england tomorrow chuck it altogether you are up against too big a combination you can do no one any good you are a great deal more likely to come to harm yourself  duncombe was quite quiet for several moments when he spoke again his manner had a new stiffness  you have surprised me a good deal i must confess spencer we will abandon the subject  spencer shrugged his shoulders  i know how youre feeling old chap he said i cant help it you understand my position here i write a daily letter for the best paying and most generous newspaper in the world and it is absolutely necessary that i keep hand in glove with the people in high places here my position absolutely demands it and my duty to my chief necessitates my putting all personal feeling on one side in a case like this when a conflict arises  but where duncombe asked does the conflict arise  here spencer answered i received a note this morning from a great personage in this country to whom i am under more obligation than any other breathing man requesting me to refrain from making any further inquiries or assisting any one else to make them in this matter i can assure you that i was thunderstruck but the note is in my pocket at the present moment  does it mention them by name  the exact words are spencer answered respecting the reported disappearance of the young englishman mr guy poynton and his sister this will just show you how much you have to hope for from the police for the person whose signature is at the foot of that note could command the implicit obedience of the whole system  duncombes cheeks were a little flushed he was british to the backbone and his obstinacy was being stirred  the more reason he said quietly so far as i can see that i should continue my independent efforts with such help as i can secure this girl and boy are fellow countrypeople and i havent any intention of leaving them in the clutches of any brutal gang of frenchmen into whose hands they may have got i shall go on doing what i can spencer  the journalist shrugged his shoulders  i cant help sympathizing with you duncombe he said but keep reasonable you know your paris well enough to understand that you havent a thousand to one chance besides frenchmen are not brutal if the boy got into a scrape it was probably his own fault  and the girl what of her am i to leave her to the tender mercies of whatever particular crew of blackguards may have got her into their power  you are needlessly melodramatic spencer answered i will admit of course that her position may be an unfortunate one but the personage whom i have the honor to call my friend does not often protect blackguards be reasonable duncombe these young people are not relatives of yours are they  no  nor very old friends the young lady for instance  duncombe looked up and his face was set in grim and dogged lines he felt like a man who was nailing his colors to the mast  the young lady he said is i pray heaven my future wife  spencer was honestly amazed and a little shocked  forgive me duncombe he said i had no ideathough perhaps i ought to have guessed  they went on with their luncheon in silence for some time except for a few general remarks but after the coffee had been brought and the cigarettes were alight spencer leaned once more across the table  tell me duncombe what you mean to do  i shall go to the café montmartre myself tonight at such a place there must be hangerson and parasites who see something of the game i shall try to come into touch with them i am rich enough to outbid the others who exact their silence  you must be rich enough to buy their lives then spencer answered gravely for if you do succeed in tempting any one to betray the inner happenings of that place on which the seal of silence has been put you will hear of them in the morgue before a fortnight has passed  they must take their risk duncombe said coldly i am going to stuff my pockets with money tonight and i shall bid high i shall leave word at the hotel where i am going if anything happens to me therewell i dont think the café montmartre will flourish afterwards  duncombe his friend said gravely nothing will happen to you at the café montmartre nothing ever does happen to any one there you remember poor de laurson  quite well he was stabbed by a girl in the rue pigalle  he was stabbed in the café montmartre but his body was found in the rue pigalle then there was the vicomte de sauvinac  he was found dead in his studypoisoned  he was found thereyes but the poison was given to him in the café montmartre and it was there that he died i am behind the scenes in some of these matters but i know enough to hold my tongue or my london letter wouldnt be worth a pound a week i am giving myself away to you now duncombe i am risking a position which it has taken me twenty years to secure ive got to tell you these things and you must do as i tell you go back to london  duncombe laughed as he rose to his feet  not though the vicomtes fate is to be mine tonight he answered the worse hell this place is the worse the crew it must shelter i should never hold my head up again if i sneaked off home and left the girl in their hands i dont see how you can even suggest it  only because you cant do the least good spencer answered and besides dont run away with a false impression the place is dangerous only for certain people the authorities dont protect murderers or thieves except under special circumstances the vicomtes murderer and de laursons were brought to justice only they keep the name of the place out of it always tourists in shoals visit it and visit safely every evening they pay fancy prices for what they have but i think they get their moneys worth but for certain classes of people it is the decoy house of europe foreign spies have babbled away their secrets there and the greatest criminals of the world have whispered away their lives to some fair daughter of judas at those tables i who am behind the scenes tell you these things duncombe  duncombe smiled  tomorrow he said you may add another victim to your chamber of horrors     chapter viii  duncombes holdup   the amber wine fell in a little wavering stream from his upraised glass on to the tablecloth below he leaned back in his chair and gazed at his three guests with a fatuous smile the girl in blue with the dazzlingly fair hair and wonderful complexion steadied his hand and exchanged a meaning look with the man who sat opposite surely the poor fool was ready for the plucking but madame who sat beside her frowned upon them both she had seen things which had puzzled her she signed to them to wait  she leaned over and flashed her great black eyes upon him  monsieur enjoys himself like this every night in paris  a soft a very seductive voice the woman who envied her success compared it to the purring of a cat men as a rule found no fault with it especially those who heard it for the first time  duncombe set down his glass now almost empty he looked from the stain on the tablecloth into the eyes of madame and again she thought them very unlike the eyes of a drunken man  why not its the one city in the world to enjoy ones self in halfpast four and here we are as jolly as anything chucked out of everywhere in london at halfpast twelve time gentlemen please and out go the lights jove i wonder what theyd think of this at the continental letslets have another bottle  the fairhaired girlflossie to her friends mademoiselle mermillon until you had been introducedwhispered in his ear he shook his head vaguely she had her arm round his neck he removed it gently  well have another here first anyhow he declared hi garçon ring the bell theres a good chap monsieurdash it ive forgotten your name no dont move ill do it myself  he rose and staggered towards the door  the bell isnt that way monsieur madame exclaimed it is to the right louis quick  monsieur louis sprang to his feet there was a queer grating little sound followed by a sharp click duncombe had swung round and faced them he had turned the key in the door and was calmly pocketing it the hand which held that small shining revolver was certainly not the hand of a drunken man  they all three looked at him in wondermadame monsieur louis and mademoiselle flossie the dark eyebrows of madame almost met and her eyes were full of the promise of evil things monsieur louis cowering back from that steadily pointed revolver was white with the inherited cowardice of the degenerate flossie who had drunk more wine than any of them was trying to look as though it were a joke duncombe with his disordered evening clothes his stained shirtfront and errant tie was master of the situation he came and stood a few feet away from them his blundering french accent and slow choice of words had departed he spoke to them without hesitation and his french was almost as good as their own  i want you to keep your places he said and listen to me for a few minutes i can assure you i am neither mad nor drunk i have a few questions to ask you and if your answers are satisfactory you may yet find my acquaintance as profitable as though i had been the pigeon i seemed keep your seat monsieur le baron  monsieur louis who had half risen sat down again hastily they all watched him from their places around the table it was madame whom he addressed more directlymadame with the jet black hair and golden earrings the pale cheeks and scarlet lips  i invited you into a private room here he said because what i have said to you three is between ourselves alone you came i presume because it promised to be profitable all that i want from you is information and for that i am willing to pay  monsieur louis interposed he stroked his little black moustache with a much beringed hand with the other he gesticulated  monsieur talks reasonably he declared but why all this mystery why this feigned drunkenness why the show of arms if we can help monsieurit is an affair of pleasure and if he chooses to make a present to these ladies in returnwhy no doubt they will be charmed me i presume he has no intention to insult permit me monsieur  he drew a card from a small gold case and presented it to duncombe who accepted it with a little bow  if i can aid you in any way monsieur louis continued i am entirely at your service but i require first of all that in addressing us you recognize my position as a french nobleman who amuses himself in this place as you monsieur also do and also that you unlock that door  duncombe smiled quietly  monsieur le baron he said i think that we are very well as we aresecure from interruption i have sent others here on this same mission and they did not succeed both of these ladies i believe have been approached for the information i desire and they have thought well to withhold it i have set my heart upon success this time and i wish to secure at least the opportunity of being heard  monsieur louis shrugged his shoulders  there are secrets he murmured affairs of honor  duncombe interrupted him  monsieur louis he said i am not so young as i look and i have lived in paris i know that this café for all its outward smartness bears perhaps the worst reputation in europe i have heard of you three many timesthe trinity from hell they call you sometimes i think you see i know where i am and the risk i run even this little room has its secretsa murder or two i believe and other thingssecrets which i dont suppose there is gold enough in france to buy well i dont want to buy them you can go your way so far as i am concerned there is only one thing i want to know from you and for that i offer youthe ladies of course i meanfive thousand francs each  five thousand francs madame murmured  mademoiselle flossie said nothing but her eyes shone  the question monsieur  what has become of mademoiselle phyllis poynton the young english lady  the eyes of madame seemed to narrow for a moment monsieur louis lit a cigarette with fingers which shook a little and the fair face of mademoiselle flossie was suddenly white then they all three looked at one another  do you know whom monsieur may mean  not i  an english girl there are none come here  mademoiselle poynton it is a name unheard of  the young englishman smiled upon them grimly  madame he said you have in your satcheldont move if you pleasea roll of french notesindeed you must not movevery cleverly abstracted from my pocket by my charming young companion mademoiselle flossie here now i have at least half a dozen friends in the café below whom i could summon here by touching that bell and the identification of those notes would be a perfectly simple matter shall i do it or will you earn another roll by giving me the information i seek  madame leaned forward and whispered in the mans ear monsieur louis nodded  tell him mademoiselle flossie murmured tremulously monsieur will not break faith with us he will not let it be known from whence he gained the knowledge  agreed the young englishman declared go on  madame held up her hand  i she said will tell monsieur what we know  she rose to her feet and leaned over the table the blueblack sequins on her dress glittered and shone in the dull light her figure was superb her neck and bosom a flawless white the englishman however was unmoved his keen gray eyes were fixed upon her but the revolver remained in his right hand from downstairs they could hear the music of violins the rattle of glasses the hum of voices and laughter madame frowned slightly as she marked the young englishmans alertness she was used to victims and his imperturbability annoyed her  i trust she said that you will remember monsieur that i am breaking a pledged word if monsieur the director here knew that i was telling you of mademoiselle poynton there would be much trouble for all of us  duncombe nodded  go on he said  mademoiselle came here first about a month or perhaps six weeks ago she said from that time on she was a regular visitor she came alone she spoke to no one she was always a mystery she was very handsomely dressedfor an english girl quite chic she spent money and monsieur albert the director kept always a table for her as time went on we began to feel the mystery we asked ourselves for what purpose does she come here for what indeed  one night monsieur albert who was always besieged with questions about her took too much wine i have seen that happen with him but oncesince that time never he told us about mademoiselle she made some inquiries about her brother and monsieur albert was able to tell her his whereabouts after that he scarcely expected to see her again but the next night she was here also  then monsieur albert learned more mademoiselle was in a small way an artist and she had conceived the idea of painting a picture of the caféan early morning picture of effects monsieur understands there was to be the morning sunlight streaming across the suppertables the faces of all of us aged and haggard monsieur louis here without doubt a very child of the devil oh a very moral picture monsieur it was to convert us all monsieur albert declared that he would arrange to have it here on exhibition and we should all mend our ways monsieur knew perhaps that the young lady was an artist  the question was flashed suddenly upon him as though the intention was to take him by surprise duncombe however remained unmoved  i am here madame to ask not to answer questions he said will you kindly proceed i am greatly interested  madame put her hand to her throat for a moment as though to loosen her necklace she had not the appearance of being greatly in love with her questioner  there came a night she continued when mademoiselle broke through her rule a man came in and sat at her table his name was the vicomte daubarde and he was known to most of us though to the young lady he appeared to be a stranger they talked earnestly for an hour or more when she lefthe accompanied her  the englishman had grown paler madame saw it and smiled her lover perhaps it was good to make him suffer  flossie here she continued was outside and saw them depart they drove off together in the vicomtes coupé they were apparently on the best of terms since then we have not seen her againnor the vicomte monsieur knows now as much as we know  and how long ago is that duncombe asked quietly  a week tonight madame replied  duncombe laid down a roll of notes upon the table  i wish he said to prove to you that i am in earnest i am therefore going to pay you the amount i promised although i am perfectly well aware that the story of madame isfalse  monsieur  as i remarked he repeated false now listen to me i want to tempt one of you i dont care which to break through this thieves compact of yours i have paid a thousand francs for liesi will pay ten thousand francs for truth ten thousand francs for the present whereabouts of mademoiselle phyllis poynton  mademoiselle flossie looked up at him quickly then she glanced furtively at madame and the flash of madames eyes was like lightning upon blue steel duncombe moved towards the door  i will pay the bill downstairs he said good night think over what i have said ten thousand francs  monsieur louis stood up and bowed stiffly mademoiselle flossie ventured to throw him a kiss madame smiled inscrutably  the door closed they heard him go downstairs madame picked up his card and read aloud          sir george duncombe                          risley hall                                     norfolk      grand hotel paris  if one could only madame murmured tell him the truth collect the moneyand  and flossie murmured half fearfully  monsieur le baron smiled     chapter ix  the story of a call   mademoiselle mermillon was not warmly welcomed at the grand hotel the porter believed that sir george duncombe was out he would inquire if mademoiselle would wait but he did not usher her into the drawingroom as would have been his duty in an ordinary case or even ask her to take a seat  mademoiselle mermillon was of the order of young person who resents but this afternoon she was far too nervous during the porters temporary absence she started at every footstep and scrutinized anxiously every passerby often she looked behind her through the glass doors into the street when at last he reappeared alone her disappointment was obvious  sir george duncombe is out mademoiselle he announced will you be pleased to leave a message or your name  you do not know how long he will be she inquired  sir george left no word the man answered he has been out since before déjeuner  mademoiselle decided to leave a note the porter supplied her with notepaper and envelopes she sat down at a small round table and once more glanced furtively around convinced that she was not being watched she hastily wrote a few lines sealed and addressed the envelope and handed it to the porter  you will give this to sir george immediately he returns she begged it is important  monsieur shall have it without doubt mademoiselle the man answered  she pulled down her veil and left the place hurriedly when she reached the boulevard she slackened her pace and drew a little breath of relief  ten thousand francs she murmured to herself if i took that with me they would receive me at home i might start all over again it is worth a little risk heavens how nervous i am  she entered a café and drank à petit verre as she set her glass down a man looked at her over the top of his newspaper she tried to smile but her heart was beating and she was sick with fear  what a fool i am she muttered it is a stranger too if he were one of gustavs lot i should know him  she returned his smile and he came and sat down beside her they had another liqueur later they left the place together                                       duncombe returned to his hotel tired out after a disappointing day spent in making fruitless inquiries in various parts of paris he had learnt nothing he seemed as far off the truth as ever he opened the note which the porter handed him listlessly enough afterwards however it was different this is what he read       i can tell you about the young english lady if you will      promise upon your honor that you will not betray me i dare      not come here again i dare not even speak to you while the      others are about go to the café sylvain tonight and order      dinner in a private room i will come at halfpast      sevenflossie  duncombe drew a little sigh of relief at last then he was to know something he was very english a bad amateur detective and very weary of his task nothing but his intense interest in the girl herselfan interest which seemed to have upset the whole tenor of his lifewould have kept him here plodding so relentlessly away at a task which seemed daily to present more difficulties and complications yet so absorbed had he become that the ordinary duties and pleasures which made up the routine of his life scarcely ever entered into his mind there had been men coming down to shoot whom in an ordinary way he would not have dreamed of putting offa cricket match which had been postponed until his return and which he had completely forgotten paris had nothing in the shape of amusement to offer him in place of these things yet in his own mind these things were as if they had not been every interest and energy of his life was concentrated upon the one simple object of his search  he gave the man half a crown and walked to the lift whistling the porter shook his head and duncombe receded considerably in his estimation notwithstanding the tip he considered mademoiselle flossie a little obvious for a gentleman of duncombes class duncombe treated himself to a cocktail and a cigarette as he changed his clothes it was positively the first gleam of hope he had had and then suddenly he remembered spencers warning and he became grave  he was at the café sylvain early he ordered dinner gave elaborate instructions about a young lady when she arrived and with a glass of absinthe and another cigarette sat down to wait at a quarter to eight he began to get restless he summoned the waiter again and gave a more detailed description of mademoiselle flossie the waiter was regretful but positive no young lady of any description had arrived expecting to meet a gentleman in a private room duncombe tried him with her name but yes mademoiselle mermillon was exceedingly well known there he would give orders that she should be shown up immediately she arrived it would be soon without doubt  at a quarterpast eight duncombe dined alone too disappointed to resent the waiters sympathetic attitude at nine oclock he returned to the hotel on the chance that a message might have been sent there he read the english newspapers and wrote letters until midnight then he ordered a carriage and drove to the café montmartre  he mounted the stairs and passed through the little bar which led into the supperroom monsieur albert came forward with a low bow  you can find me a table i suppose duncombe remarked looking round where shall i sit  monsieur albert shook his head slowly his hands were outstretched his manner sad but resigned  i am very sorry monsieur but tonight every place is taken i have had to turn others away already he declared a thousand regrets  duncombe looked at him astonished the place was more than half empty  surely you can find me a small table somewhere he said i was here last evening you know if it is because i am alone i will order supper for two and a magnum of wine  monsieur albert was immovable he remembered duncombe well and he was proud of his patronage but tonight it was impossible to offer him a table duncombe began to be annoyed  very well he said i will stay in the bar you cant turn me out of there can you  monsieur albert was evasive he desired monsieur duncombe to be amused and the people who remained in the barwell it was not possible to get rid of them but they were not fitting company for him  there is the café mazarin he added confidentially a few steps only from herea most amusing place the most wonderful ladies there too very chic and crowded every night monsieur should really try it the commissionaire would direct hima few yards only  much obliged to you duncombe answered turning on his heel i may look in there presently  he seated himself at a small round table and ordered a drink the people here were of a slightly different class from those who had the entrée to the supperroom and were mostly crowded round the bar itself at a small desk within a few feet of him a middleaged woman with a cold hard face sat with a book of account before her and a pile of bills there was something almost sphynxlike about her appearance she never spoke her expression never changed once their eyes met she looked at him steadfastly but said nothing the girl behind the bar also took note of him she was very tall and slim absolutely colorless and with coils of fair hair drawn tightly back from her forehead she was never without a cigarette lighting a fresh one always from its predecessor talking all the while unceasingly but without the slightest change of expression once she waved the men and girls who stood talking to her on one side and duncombe fancied that it was because she desired a better view of him  suddenly he was startled by a voice close at hand he looked up the woman at the desk was speaking to him  monsieur would be well advised she said if he departed  duncombe looked at her in amazement she was writing rapidly in her book and her eyes were fixed upon her work if he had not actually heard her it would have been hard to believe that she had spoken  but why madame he asked why should i go i am in no ones way i can pay for what i have  she dipped her pen in the ink  i know nothing of monsieur or his business she said still without even glancing towards him but i know that monsieur albert does not wish him to remain  the devil take monsieur albert duncombe answered angrily i am waiting to speak to some one who comes here regularly and i shall stay until she comes  the woman wrote steadily for a moment then she blotted the page on which she had been writing and raising her head looked at him  it is no affair of mine she said but monsieur albert has sent for the police they may say that you have had too much wine or that you owe money in either case you will be removed the police will not listen to you monsieur albert has special discretion it is no affair of mine she repeated but if i were monsieur i would go  duncombe rose slowly to his feet and summoning a waiter paid his bill the man produced a second one dated a few days back for a large amount  what is the meaning of this he asked i do not owe you anything  monsieur was here with a party last thursday night he said glibly he promised to pay the next time i will call the manager  duncombe tore the bill in half and turned away he bowed to the lady at the desk  i see that you were right he said i will leave  monsieur is wise she answered without looking up  he left the café without speaking to any one further when he reached the pavement he slipped a fivefranc piece into the hand of the tall commissionaire  you know most of the young ladies who come here i suppose he asked  but certainly the man answered with a smile monsieur desires  i want the address of a young lady named mermillonflossie i think they call her duncombe said  thirtyone rue pigalle the man answered promptly but she should be here within an hour she never misses  duncombe thanked him and hailed a carriage  shall i give mademoiselle any message the man asked confidentially  i am going to call for her duncombe answered if i do not find her i will return  to drive to the rue pigalle was an affair of five minutes only duncombe climbed a couple of flights of narrow stairs pushed open a swing gate and found himself in front of an office in which an elderly woman sat reading  can you tell me where to find mademoiselle mermillon duncombe asked  next floor first door on the left the woman answered mademoiselle is not often in at this hour though  duncombe thanked her and climbed another flight of stairs he had to strike a match to look for a bell or knocker and then found neither he knocked on the door with his knuckles there was no reply he was on the point of departure when he noticed that the door was ajar after a moments hesitation he pushed it open  he found himself in a narrow passage with dresses and other articles of apparel hanging from a row of pegs on the wall the place was in complete darkness he struck another match at the end of the passage was an inner door also ajar he rapped upon it and finally pushed it open just then his match went out     chapter x  spencers surprise   duncombe had the nerves and temperament of the young englishman of his class whose life is mostly spent out of doors and who has been an athlete all his days but nevertheless at that moment he was afraid something in the stillness of the room oppressed him he could see nothing hear nothing except the clock ticking upon the mantlepiece and yet he was afraid  he fumbled desperately in his pocket for his matchbox when he had found it he discovered that it was empty with a sense of positive relief he backed out of the room and hastily descended the stairs the old lady was still in her sittingroom reading the paper she set it down at his entrance and looked at him over the top of her spectacles  pardon madame he said removing his hat i find the rooms of mademoiselle are open but all is in darkness i cannot make any one hear  madame took up her paper  then mademoiselle is probably out she declared it is generally so at this hour monsieur can leave his name  but the doors are all open duncombe said  i go presently and close them madame answered the careless hussy  duncombe produced a small piece of gold madame laid down the paper at once she looked at it as though ready to snatch it from his hand  madame would oblige me very much if she would ascend with me at once duncombe said i should like to make quite sure whether the young lady is there or not  madame was on her feet with remarkable celerity she accepted the coin and carefully placed it in a purse drawn from somewhere amongst the folds of her voluminous skirts  we shall need a candle duncombe reminded her  she lit a lamp talking all the while  monsieur is very generous she declared mademoiselle flossie is a charming young lady no wonder she has many friends there was one she continued who came here with her this afternoonbut he left almost at once she added hastily aware of her indiscretion ah these stairs they grow steeper for one so corpulent at last  she pushed open the door and went sideways down the narrow passage directly they had entered it they had a view of the room beyond madame cried out and duncombe felt all his vague fears spring into a terrified apprehension of actual evil  the curtain before the window had been hastily drawn but the lamp which the portress carried was sufficient feebly to illuminate the room the tablecloth and a broken vase lay upon the floor a few feet off was an overturned chair upon the canopied bed lay a prostrate figure the head thrown back at an unnatural angle the eyes open but glazed duncombe dared do no more than cast one single horrified glance at it madame set down the lamp upon the table and made the room hideous with shrieks  good god she cried it is the little one who is dead  duncombe himself fetched in the gendarmes and waited whilst they took voluminous notes of the occurrence the murder seemed to them and to madame to be one of a very common class the assassin had left no clue whatever behind him the poor girls rings had been torn from her fingers her little stock of jewellery ransacked her purse was empty everything of value had been taken there was not a shred of evidence against any one madame who had seen the man upon the stairs could only say that he was short and wore a black felt hat the officer who took down what they had to say shrugged his shoulders as he replaced the book in his pocket the affair would pass most certainly he feared into the long list of undiscoverable crimes  duncombe left his name and address and enough money for the funeral then he returned to his hotel this was the end then of the clue from which he had hoped so much spencers warning as to what would surely happen to those whom he might succeed in bribing came back into his mind with sickening insistence in a measure he was responsible for the girls death after all what chance had he he was fighting against powers which moving always in the darkness seemed able with the most ridiculous ease to frustrate his every move he reentered the hotel in a state of complete nervous depression for the first time he had forebodings on his own account what had happened to mademoiselle flossie might happen so easily to himself  a man rose quickly from the lounge in the hotel as he entered duncombe greeted him with a little expression of wonder  spencer he exclaimed were you waiting to see me  the journalist nodded he was not in evening dress and he too had the appearance of a man who has received something of a shock  yes the café is closed i suppose let us go down into the smokeroom i want to talk to you  duncombe led the way they found two easychairs and despatched a waiter for whiskies and soda then spencer turned to his friend  have you met he asked with any success  none duncombe answered gloomily  i have something to tell you spencer continued no it is not good news he added hastily it is more a personal matter it is of something which has happened to myself  duncombe sighed  go on he said  for twentytwo and a half years spencer said i have lived in paris as the correspondent to various english journals i have made many friends and it has been considered amongst all my fellow journalists that i had the ear of more influential people in politics and society here than any other writer today i have resigned my position  duncombe managed to summon up enough interest to be surprised  i had no idea he said that you were contemplating anything of the sort  i was not spencer answered grimly i am as much surprised myself as all my friends will be  duncombe was puzzled  i am afraid i dont quite understand he said you cant mean that your people  no my people have nothing to do with it spencer answered i have had the sack but not from them it is paris which will have no more of me i live here of course on my faculties for obtaining information and my entrée into political and social life today the minister of police has declined to receive me or at any future timemy cards of entry into the chamber and half a dozen places have been revoked my name has been expunged from the visiting list of the president and practically of every other person of importance all that i may see of paris now is from the outside and there is no appeal  but what is the reason of it spencer what have you done how have you offended all these people  spencer hesitated  i dont want you to blame yourself in any way duncombe he said you could not possibly have guessed the sort of thing you were up against but the fact remains that my offence is in having sent my friends to the café montmartre on your account and in being suspected of rendering you further assistance in your search for those two marvellous young english people  you are not joking by any chance are you duncombe asked gravely  the matter spencer replied does not appear to me to lend itself to anything of the sort  duncombe buried his head in his hands for several moments  great heavens he murmured let me think i cant tell you how sorry i am old chap cant the thing be explained as a matter of fact you were discretion itself  i dont want it explained spencer said even if it would do any goodwhich it wouldnt i should have retired in any case in less than a year and as it is i believe my successor is on his way over already now would you like to know why i have come here at this hour of the night to tell you this  duncombe nodded  go on he said afterwards ive something to tell you  ive come spencer said because im free now if you like to help you i was interested in your story before i am ten times more interested in it now if you still want me ill do what i can for you  want you spencer do you mean it duncombe exclaimed want you why theres no one id rather interest in the affair than you  well i can promise you my interest is pretty well excited already spencer answered im with you right along now tell me where youve been this evening and whats happened  duncombe recounted the evenings events his new ally listened and afterwards smoked for a moment or two in silence  it is simply wonderful he declared the whole secretservice system of paris is working to cover up the traces of this boy and girl their spies of course are everywhere and their organization perfect the first one of their creatures who tries to break away is mademoiselle flossie the poor little fool lived for only a few hours afterwards your bribe was high but she ought to have known better  you mean  why of course the theft of her poor little jewels was only a blind it was to deceive the public for as a matter of fact her murderer would have been perfectly safe if he had strolled into the nearest police station and made his report she was killed because she was going to give you certain information  duncombe shuddered  great heaven he exclaimed tell me spencer who or what can be at the back of all this guy poynton was simply a healthyminded not overintelligent young saxon unambitious and passionately fond of his home and his country life he had no friends over here no interests no ties of any sort he was abroad for the first time of his life he regarded foreign countries and people simply with the tolerant curiosity of the untravelled britisher he appears in paris for one night and disappears and forthwith all the genius of french espionage seems to have combined to cover up his traces it is the same with his sister only as she came afterwards it was evidently on his account that she also is drawn into the mystery what can be the meaning of it spencer  my young friend spencer said i will be frank with you i have not the least idea i only know that somehow or other youre up against a big thing in a weekperhaps a dayi may know more meanwhile i want you to go on your way precisely as though you and i had not discussed this matter  we may not work together then duncombe asked  certainly not you are a marked man everywhere every door is closed to you i shall nominally stick to my post you must be content to be the actual lookeron though you had better not abandon your inquiries altogether i will put you up at the cercle anglais it will serve to pass the time and you may gain information at the most unlikely places and now goodbye  the liftman thrust a pencilled note into duncombes hand as he ascended to his room  from i do not know whom monsieur he announced it was left here by some one whom i cannot say  duncombe opened it in his dressingroom there was only one sentence       monsieur would be well advised to leave paris tonight     chapter xi  a word of warning   in the most unlikely places duncombe murmured to himself as he bowed to the frenchman whose name his friend had mentioned i am very glad to meet you again monsieur le baron he said aloud  they were in the covered garden at the ritz duncombe had accepted the pressing invitation of an old college friend whom he had met on the boulevards to drop in and be introduced to his wife and the third at the teatable was monsieur louis known in society apparently as monsieur le baron de seurs  lady hadley his friends wife smiled languidly upon them both she was a frail pink and white little woman with the reputation of a beauty to sustain wherein lay her lifes work  you two know one another of course she remarked paris is no larger than london after all  sir george and i have met once at least the baron said smiling i am glad that he does me the honor of remembering the occasion  duncombe felt himself no match for his companion with the foils he let the conversation drift and waited for his opportunity presently some more guests arrived and duncombe drew his host on one side  hadley he said how long have you known the baron  met him at dorset house about two years ago i think hadley answered he was doing a round of countryhouses im not sure that he didnt stay at sandringham one of the real old french families you know de seurs  duncombe nodded there did not seem to be much that he could say he mingled with the other guests and observed his social duties but he watched the baron and he took care that they left together  are you going my way baron he asked as they stepped into the place vendôme  i was going to the cercle anglais the baron answered do you belong  i am up for a months membership but i am not elected yet duncombe answered  then you shall come in as my guest the baron declared  you are exceedingly kind duncombe answered i wonder whether i might presume still further upon your good nature and ask you a question  the asking the baron murmured involves nothing  you bear i am told an honored name and you are well received in society why do you associate with murderers and thieves in that hell of a café where i saw you first  the baron smiled  my friend he said i seek always the life amusing and i find it there  i was robbed before your eyes baron  the frenchman sighed  i am so sorry he said that i did not see it that indeed would have been amusing  you know that the young lady who sat with us is dead  a most bizarre happening the baron assented with a little sigh i cannot imagine how it occurred the newspaper reports are not convincing one would like to reconstruct the story poor little flossie she was most amusing but just a little a very little too fond of flourishing her jewellery one will miss her though  referring for one moment to our meeting at the café you told me a story thereyou and your friend madameof a young english ladywhich the facts seem scarcely to sustain  the baron sighed  my friend he said we did the best we could at a moments notice i rather fancied the story myself as to factswhat have they to do with it you demanded a story and you got it i rather flattered myself that under the circumstances it was not bad  you admit now then that it was not the truth  the truth my dear sir george supposing that the whereabouts of your charming young friend had been known to me do you suppose that i should have permitted myself to be bullied into disclosing it forgive me if i speak plainly but if you really wished for information which you supposed that i had your method of seeking it put you at once out of court a french gentleman does not permit himself to be bullied  duncombe was silent for several moments there were many things which he could have said but where was the use  as a french gentleman then he said at last will you permit me to make a personal appeal to you miss phyllis poynton is a young lady in whom i am deeply interested she was last seen at the café montmartre from which place she disappeared i am an englishman of your own station tell me where i can find her or what has become of her  my dear sir george the baron said you might have saved yourself a great deal of trouble if you had spoken like this to me at the first frankly then i have not the least idea young english ladies come and go every evening at the café montmartre and such places one remembers only those who happen to have amused one and not always those forgive me if i speak plainly a young lady who had visited the café montmartre alonewell you might look for her anywhere but most assuredly in that case if your anxiety was to induce her to return to her friends you would be a little too late ah we have arrived now my friend i must make you free of the place  duncombe was fuming with anger but he had discretion enough to remain silent  do you play bridge the baron asked as they entered the cardroom  occasionally duncombe assented  i will go and see if i can find any men the baron remarked i will leave my young friend de bergillac to entertain you the vicomte de bergillacsir george duncombe  duncombe shook hands with a pale wearylooking youth whose whole appearance was distinguished by marked symptoms of lassitude and illhealth they sat in easychairs almost opposite to one another and duncombe found the others scrutiny almost embarrassing  you speak french perhapsyes the young man asked at length  yes i speak french duncombe admitted  then listen to me the vicomte said slowly i speak as one man of honor to another do not play cards in this club  not play cards why not duncombe asked amazed  you can take my advice or leave it the vicomte answered calmly i have no explanation to offer you if you chose to repeat my remark you would place me in an exceedingly awkward position you see i rely upon you as a man of honor  i am only too much obliged to you for the hint duncombe declared but this clubthe cercle anglais  the club is all right the vicomte admitted calmly unfortunately there is no place in paris which would be entirely safe for you you have the misfortune you see to be in opposition to some of my friends who have really unlimited opportunities for making things disagreeable for you now i am beginning to talk and it is very foolish of me why dont you leave paris sir george  why should i duncombe asked a little sharply i break no laws here i wrong no one i am here on my own business and i only ask to be let alone  the vicomte regarded him as one might look at a spoilt child whom it was yet advisable to humor  ah he said they will not let you alone you are so obstinate like all your countrypeople or you would recognize it without my risking so much by speaking you will have to leave paris and very soon it is so easily to be managed a dispute at cards hereyou would certainly be in the wrong and an ugly scandal if you were not away in twentyfour hours it is one method of a thousand  you know so much duncombe said i have no doubt that you know the one thing which i would give years of my life to be satisfied about  the boys dark eyes were fixed steadily upon his  sir george he said there is nothing which i can possibly say to you my warning has been exceeding foolish but after all if i can persuade you to leave paris i shall have done no great harm as for the cardswell i must plead guilty to weakness there i have not the slightest objection to taking the life of a man who is making a nuisance of himself but his honor i think one should not tamper with may i offer you a cigarette well louis what luck  the baron had strolled back into the room and was sitting on the arm of a chair  it will be all right directly the baron answered we have three and old darcon has telephoned that he will be here in five minutes  duncombe rose to his feet  it was really very careless of me he said but i completely forgot that i had an engagement at the hotel at six oclock i am afraid that i shall not be able to stop  the baron glanced quickly at his young friend there was nothing whatever to be learnt though from his pale boyish face his own countenance had darkened for the moment but he recovered his composure immediately  as you will he answered carelessly perhaps you can drop in later come and dine will you at halfpast eight  i am much obliged to you baron duncombe said but i cannot accept your invitation i am a lover of plain speaking so i will not plead a previous engagement but the one thing i want from you the thing which i have almost a right to demand you will not give i do not feel therefore that any more than ordinary intercourse is possible between us  the baron bowed gravely  my dear sir george he said i am answered i wish i could drive out of your mind that extraordinary hallucination relative to my supposed knowledge of your young english friend it is impossible very good i shall look forward to a time sir george when we may meet on a better footing  duncombe left the hotel with the recollection of that curiously ironic smile fresh in his mind     chapter xii  the shadowing of duncombe   for three days duncombe saw nothing of spencer three long days devoid of incident hopelessly dull aimless and uninteresting on the fourth the only change in the situation was scarcely a reassuring one he became aware that he was being watched  there was no particular secrecy about it even in the hotel itself some one was always on his heels the absence of any attempt at concealment convinced him that it was the authorized police who had thus suddenly showed their interest in him the suspicion was soon to be confirmed the manager called him on the fourth morning into his private office  monsieur will pardon me i trust he said if i take the liberty of asking him a question  certainly duncombe answered go ahead  monsieur is aware that he has been placed under the surveillance of the police  the fact duncombe said has been borne in upon me during the last few hours what of it  the manager coughed  this is a cosmopolitan hotel sir george he said and we make no pretence at ultraexclusiveness but we do not care to see the police on the premises  neither do i duncombe answered can you suggest how we may get rid of them  monsieur does not quite understand the manager said smoothly clearly he has done something to bring him under the suspicion of the law under these circumstances it would be more agreeable to the management of the hotel if monsieur would depart  duncombe did not wish to depart the hotel at which phyllis poyntons trunks were still awaiting her return was the hotel at which he wished to stay  look here monsieur huber he said i give you my word of honor that i have broken no law nor engaged in any criminal action whatever since i came to paris this game of having me watched is simply a piece of bluff i have done nothing except make inquiries in different quarters respecting those two young english people who are still missing in doing this i seem to have run up against what is nothing more nor less than a disgraceful conspiracy every hand is against me instead of helping me to discover them the police seem only anxious to cover up the tracks of those young people  the manager looked down at his desk  we hotelkeepers he said are very much in the hands of the police we cannot judge between them and the people whom they treat as suspected persons i know very well sir george that you are a person of respectability and character but if the police choose to think otherwise i must adapt my views to theirs i am sorry but we must really ask you to leave  sir george turned on his heel  very good he said i will go and take rooms elsewhere  he left the hotel and walked towards the ritz at the corner of the place vendôme an automobile was pulled up with a jerk within a few feet of him a tiredlooking boy leaned over wearily towards him from the front seat  sir george he said can you give me five minutes  with pleasure he answered i was going into the ritz come and have something  to maxims if you dont mind the vicomte said it will take us only a moment  sir george stepped in the vicomte in whose fingers the wheel seemed scarcely to rest so light and apparently careless was his touch touched a lever by his side released the clutch and swung the great car round the corner at a speed which made duncombe grasp the sides at a pace which seemed to him most ridiculous they dashed into the rue de rivoli and with another sharp turn pulled up before maxims the vicomte rose with a yawn as though he had just awoke from a refreshing dream his servant slipped off his fur coat and he descended to the pavement faultlessly dressed and quite unruffled the commissionaire preceded them hat in hand to the door a couple of waiters ushered them to the table which the vicomte intimated by a gesture  i myself he remarked drawing off his gloves take nothing but absinthe what may i have the pleasure of ordering for you  duncombe ordered a whisky and soda  i think he said there is one thing which i ought to tell you at once i am being shadowed by the police the man who has just arrived and who seems a little breathless is i believe the person whose duty it is to dog my footsteps in the daytime  what a pity the vicomte murmured i would at least have taken you a mile or so round the boulevards if i had known but wait you are surethat it is the police by whom you are being watched  quite duncombe answered the manager of the hotel has spoken to me about it he has asked me in fact to leave  to leave the hotel  yes i was on my way to the ritz to secure rooms when i met you  the vicomte sipped his absinthe gravely  i should not take those rooms he said you will in all probability not occupy them  why not  it has been decided the vicomte said that you are to be driven out of paris in the end you will have to go i think if i were you i would not wait the train de luxe to calais is more comfortable than a wet bench in the morgue or a french prison  who has decided this duncombe asked what emperor has signed the decree of my banishment  there have been worse served emperors the vicomte remarked than the shall we say person who bids you go  what is my offence duncombe asked  i know nothing the vicomte answered slowly pouring himself out some absinthe  who are my judges then what secret authorities have i incensed i am an honest man engaged in an honest mission why should i not be allowed to execute it  the vicomte half closed his eyes duncombe was a little angry the vicomte regarded him with reproachful wonder  you ask me so many questions he murmured and i tell you that i know nothing i have asked you to come here with me because i had just this to say i can answer no questions offer no explanations i have no particular liking for you but i am afflicted with a cursedly sensitive disposition andthere are things which i find it hard to watch with equanimity there is a train for england at nine oclock this evening sir george take it  duncombe rose from his seat  i am very much obliged to you he said i believe that you are giving me what you believe to be good advice whether i can follow it or not is a different matter  the vicomte sighed  you englishmen he said are so obstinate it is the anxiety concerning your friends i suppose which keeps you here  yes  the vicomte hesitated he looked up and down the room and especially at the man whom duncombe had pointed out to him he had edged nearer and nearer till he was almost within earshot the vicomtes voice always low became a whisper  i can tell you this much at any rate he said whatever their present condition may be it is more likely to be improved than made worse by your departure you are a wellmeaning person monsieur but you do nobody any good here and you riskmore than i dare tell you  the vicomte turned away to greet a little party of friends who had just entered duncombe strolled back to the hotel and found spencer walking restlessly up and down the hall waiting for him  at last he exclaimed with a sigh of relief come up into my room spencer we can talk there  he rang for the lift and as they ascended he watched the other anxiously spencer was looking pale and disturbed his eyes showed signs of sleeplessness and he had not the air of a man who has good news to impart as soon as they were inside the room he locked the door  duncombe he said there is a train which leaves paris for london at four oclock you must catch itif you are allowed to dont look like that man i tell you youve got to do it if you are in paris tonight you will be in prison  for what offence duncombe asked  for the murder of mademoiselle flossie they are training the witnesses now the whole thing is as easy as a b c they can prove you so guilty that not even your best friend would doubt it pack your clothes man or ring for the valet  duncombe hesitated but he too was pale  are you serious spencer he asked  i am so serious spencer answered that unless you obey me i will not move another finger in this matter you lose nothing by going all that a human being can do i will do but you lose your life or at any rate your liberty if you stay  duncombe bowed his head to fate  very well he said i will go     chapter xiii  her voice   you have heard now duncombe said finally the whole history of my wanderings i feel like a man who has been beating the air who has been at war with unseen and irresistible forces i never seemed to have a chance in plain words i have failed utterly  the two men were sitting in a room impossible of classification it might have been a study smokingroom or gunroom the walls were adorned with stags heads and various trophies of the chase there were guns and rifles in plenty in a rack by the chimneypiece a row of bookcases along the north wall golf clubs cricket bats and foils everywhere a pile of logs ready for burning stood in the open grate and magnificent rugs were spread about the floor nowhere was there the slightest trace of a womans presence for duncombe had no sisters and his was entirely a bachelor household  duncombe himself and andrew pelham were seated in great easychairs in front of the open window it was his first fine evening at home and he was drinking in great draughts of the fresh pure air fragrant with the perfume of roses and huge clusters of wallflowers paris had seemed to him like a great oven all the time he had been half stifled and yet he knew very well that at a word from spencer he would have returned there at an hours notice he knew too that the home which he had loved all his days could never be quite the same place to him again  andrew roused himself from rather a prolonged silence  you were a brick to go george he said it is more than any one else in the world would have done for me  duncombe laughed a little uneasily he knocked the ashes from his pipe and refilled it slowly  andrew he said i dont want to seem a fraud i dare say that i might have gone for you alonebut i didnt  his friend smiled faintly  ah he remarked i had forgotten your little infatuation it hasnt worn off yet then  no nor any signs of it duncombe answered bluntly its an odd position for a matteroffact person like myself isnt it i tell you andrew ive really tried to care for some of the girls about here the place wants a mistress and im the tenth baronet in the direct line ones got to think about these things you know ive tried hard and ive never even come near it  it will wear off andrew said it is a very charming little fancy a most delightful bit of sentiment george but with nothing behind it it cant last  perhaps not duncombe answered quietly all that i know is that it has shown no signs of wearing off up to now it was in paris exactly as it is here and i know very well that if i thought it would do her the least bit of good i would start back to paris or to the end of the world tonight  i must readjust my views of you george his friend said with mild satire i always looked upon you as fair game for the norfolk dowagers with their broods of daughters but i never contemplated your fixing your affections upon a little piece of pasteboard  rot it is the girl herself duncombe declared  but you have never seen her  duncombe shrugged his shoulders he said nothing what was the use never seen her had she not found her way into every beautiful place his life had knowledge of  if you had andrew murmuredah well the picture is like her i remember when she was a child she was always fascinating always delightful to watch  duncombe looked out upon the gardens which he loved and sighed  if only spencer would send for me to go back to paris he said with a sigh  andrew turned his head  you can imagine now he said what i have been suffering the desire for action sometimes is almost maddening i think that the man who sits and waits has the hardest task  they were silent for some time smoking steadily then duncombe reverted once more to his wanderings  you remember the story they told me at the café andrew he said it was a lie of course but was miss poynton anything of an artist  to the best of my belief andrew answered she has never touched a brush or a pencil since she left school  duncombe looked out into the gathering twilight  it is a devils riddle this he said slowly why did she go to that place at all  god only knows andrew murmured  duncombes teeth were hard set a paperknife which he had caught up from the table snapped in his fingers there was something in his throat which nearly choked him  phyllis poynton andrew continued was as sweet and pure a woman as ever breathed she must have loathed that place she could only have gone there to seek for her brother or  or for whom  for those who knew where he was  duncombe turned his head  andrew  yes old chap  let me look at her photograph again  andrew drew it from his pocket and passed it over duncombe studied it for several moments under the lamplight  you are right andrew he said slowly for her the other things would not be possible i wonder  his fingers clung to the photograph he looked across at his friend there was a slight flush in his face he spoke nervously  andrew he said im afraid it sounds a bit brutal butthis photograph is no use to you just now is it until your eyes get better will you lend it me  i couldnt andrew answered quietly i cant see it now of course but i like to feel it in my pocket and it will be the first thing i shall look at when the doctor lets me take off these beastly glassesif ever he does until thenwell i like to feel ive got it thats all  they both smoked furiously for several moments without looking at one another duncombe spoke first  andrew  well  if she comes backshall you ever ask her to marry you  i dont know george im poor and im twelve years older than she is i dont know  there was another silence then the conversation drifted back once more to the one subject which was monopolizing the thought of both of them  i tell you what seems to me to be the most extraordinary part of the whole business duncombe said first the brother disappears then without a word to any one the sister also rushes off to paris and vanishes from the face of the earth after a series of extraordinary proceedings one supposes naturally that if they have come to harm anywhereif there has been a crimethere must have been a motive what is it you say that their banking account has been undisturbed  it was last week i should hear if any cheques were presented  and the boys letter of credit even has never been drawn upon  no not since he left vienna  then the motive cannot be robbery thank heaven duncombe added with a little shudder that it was the boy who went first  dont  a great winged insect came buzzing into the room duncombe struck viciously at it with the palm of his hand  lord he muttered what a fool i am ive never been away from home before andrew without longing to get back and here i am just back from paris in august from turning night into day from living just the sort of life i hate and id give anything to be going back there tomorrow im a haunted man andrew i got up last night simply because i couldnt sleep and walked down as far as the paddock i seemed to see her face in all the shadowy corners to see her moving towards me from amongst the trees and im not an imaginative person andrew and ive got no nerves look  he held out his hand strong and firm and brown it was as steady as a rock  i cant sleep he continued i cant rest is there witchcraft in this thing andrew  andrew pelham laughed shortly it was a laugh which had no kinship to mirth  and i he said have seen her grow up we were boy and girl together i stole apples for her i have watched her grow from girlhood into womanhood i have known flesh and blood and you a cardboard image i too am a strong man and i am helpless i lie awake at night and i think it is as though the red flames of hell were curling up around me george if she has come to any evil whether i am blind or whether i can see ill grope my way from country to country till my hand is upon the throat of the beast who has harmed her  the mans voice shook with passion duncombe was awed into silence he had known andrew pelham always as a goodnatured goodhearted giant beloved of children and animals deeply religious a man whose temper if he possessed such a thing was always strictly under control such an outburst as this was a revelation duncombe understood then how slight a thing his own suffering was  you shall not go alone andrew he said softly but for the present we must wait if any one can help us spencer will  a servant came in with the whisky and glasses and silently arranged them upon the table duncombe rose and attended to his duties as host  can i get you anything further sir the man asked  nothing thanks duncombe answered tell the servants to go to bed we will lock up say when andrew  andrew took his glass mechanically out in the lane the silence of the summer night was suddenly broken by the regular tread of horses feet and the rumbling of vehicles duncombe hall was built like many of the oldfashioned houses in the country with its back to the road and the window at which they were sitting looked out upon it duncombe leaned forward in his chair  visitors by the last train going up to runton place he remarked runton has quite a large party for the first hullo theyre stopping id better go out  he rose from his chair the omnibus had stopped in the lane and they could hear the voices of the occupants clearly through the soft darkness some one was apparently getting out and stumbled a girls soft laugh rang out distinctly above the mans exclamation duncombe was already stepping over the windowsill when he felt a clutch like iron upon his shoulder he looked round in amazement andrews face was transformed he was struggling for words  her voice he exclaimed hoarsely am i dreaming george it was her voice     chapter xiv  laughter of women   the door of the omnibus was opened as duncombe stepped over the low wall into the road a tall man in a long light inverness descended  hullo duncombe he exclaimed holding out his hand i was coming in to see you for a moment  good man duncombe answered bring your friends wont you  he held open the gate hospitably but lord runton shook his head  i only wanted a word with you he said were all starving and if you dont mind well get on as quickly as we can about tomorrow you shoot with us of course  delighted duncombe answered  cresswell met me at the station lord runton continued id drawn out a plan for the shoot but it seems that cresswellold foolhasnt got his harvest in from the two fields by kettons gorse what i wanted to ask you was if we might take your turnips up from miles bottom to the north end of the gorse we can make our circuit then without a break  my dear fellow duncombe protested was it worth while asking me such a thing of course you can  thats settled then lord runton declared turning back towards the omnibus let me introduce you to my friends he added resting his hand upon the others shoulder and then well be off  duncombe in whose ears his friends cry was still ringing pressed eagerly forward  this is my neighbor sir george duncombe lord runton said looking into the carriage who will shoot with us tomorrow miss fielding and mr fielding lady angrave and the baron von rothe  lady angrave held out her hand  sir george and i are almost old friends she said with a somewhat languid smile we were both at castle holkham last autumn  duncombe murmured something conventional as he bowed over her fingers his whole attention was riveted upon the tall pale girl in the further corner of the omnibus her acknowledgment of his introduction had been of the slightest and her features were obscured by a white veil she looked away from him at once and continued a whispered conversation with the whitehaired gentleman at her side duncombe could think of no excuse for addressing her  i shall have the pleasure of meeting you all again tomorrow he said closing the door after lord runton i wont keep you now i know what the journey is down from town good night runton  good night george ten oclock sharp  the carriage rolled off and duncombe returned to his own domain andrew was waiting for him impatiently by the gate  well he exclaimed eagerly you have seen her well  the man was trembling with excitement there were drops of perspiration upon his forehead his voice sounded unnatural  i saw a young lady in the carriage duncombe answered or rather i did not see her for she wore a veil and she scarcely looked at me but she was introduced to me as miss fielding and her father was with her  fielding fielding andrew repeated never mind that what was she like what colored hair had she  i told you that she kept her veil down duncombe repeated her hair was a sort of deep redbrownwhat i could see of it but seriously andrew what is the use of discussing her one might as soon expect one of my housemaids to change into phyllis poynton as to discover her with a brandnew father a brandnew name and a guest at runton place  andrew was silent for a moment he touched his spectacles with a weary gesture and covered his eyes with his hand  yes he said i suppose you are right i suppose i am a fool butthe voice  the laughter of women said duncombe is music all the world over one cannot differ very much from the other  you are quite wrong george andrew said the voices of women vary like the thumbmarks of criminals there are no two attuned exactly alike it is the receptive organs that are at fault we who have lost one sense find the others a little keener the laughter of that girlgeorge will you keep me a few days longer somehow i cannot bring myself to leave until i have heard her voice once more  duncombe laughed heartily  my dear fellow he said i shall bless your uncommonly sensitive ears if they keep you here with me even for an extra few days you shall have your opportunity too i always dine at runton place after our first shoot and i know runton quite well enough to take you you shall sit at the same table hullo whats this light wobbling up the drive  he strolled a yard or so away and returned  a bicycle he remarked one of the grooms has been down to the village i shall have to speak to burdett in the morning i will not have these fellows coming home at all sorts of times in the morning come along in andrew just a drain eh and a cigaretteand then to bed runtons keen on his bag and they say that german von rothe is a fine shot cant let them have it all their own way  no fear of that andrew answered stepping through the window ill have the cigarette please but i dont care about any more whisky the field mentioned your name only a few weeks ago as one of the finest shots at rising birds in the country so i dont think you need fear the german  i ought to hold my own with the partridges duncombe admitted helping himself from the siphon but come in come in  a servant entered with a telegram upon a silver salver  a boy has just brought this from runton sir he said  duncombe tore it open he was expecting a message from his gunmaker and he opened it without any particular interest but as he read his whole manner changed he held the sheet in front of him long enough to have read it a dozen times he could not restrain the slight starta half exclamation then his teeth came together he remembered the servant and looked up  there will be no answer tonight murray he said give the boy a shilling and some supper if he goes home by the runton gates tell him to be sure and close them because of the deer  very good sir  the man departed duncombe laid the telegram upon the table he felt that andrew was waiting impatiently for him to speak  well  the telegram is from spencer duncombe said  from paris  yes  he has discovered something  on the contrary duncombe answered he is asking me for information and very curious information too  what does he want to know  the telegram duncombe said slowly is in french he asks me to wire him at once the names of all the guests at runton place  andrew struck the table a mighty blow with his clenched fist  i knew it he cried it was her laugh her voice phyllis poynton is there  duncombe looked at his friend incredulously  my dear andrew he said be reasonable the young lady and her father in that omnibus were introduced to me by runton himself as mr and miss fielding they are going to his house as his guests naturally therefore he knows all about them miss poynton as you have told me more than once is an orphan  commonsense wont even admit it as a matter of argument andrew said i know that quite well but how do you account for spencers telegram  remember that he is a newspaper correspondent duncombe said he has many interests and many friends with whom he is constantly exchanging information it is a coincidence i admit but the wildest flight of imagination could not make any more of it  you must be right andrew said quietly it all sounds and is so convincing but i wish that i had not heard that laugh     chapter xv  miss fielding from america   duncombe leaned his gun up against a gate a few yards away his host was talking to the servants who had brought down luncheon the rest of the party were only just in sight a field or two off  have a glass of sherry before lunch george his host asked strolling towards him  nothing to drink thanks id like a cigarette if you have one  lord runton produced his case and a servant brought them matches they both leaned over the gate and watched the scattered little party slowly coming towards them  who is your friend fielding duncombe asked a little bluntly  fellow from new york lord runton answered hes been very decent to my brother out there and archibald wrote and asked me to do all we could for them the girl is very handsome youll see her at dinner tonight  here for long  no unfortunately lord runton answered i had very hard work to get them to come at all cicely has written them three or four times i think but theyve always had engagements theyre only staying till monday i think very quiet inoffensive sort of chap fielding but the girls a ripper hullo here they are ill introduce you  a groom had thrown open the gate of the field across which they were looking and lady runton from the box seat of a small mail phaeton waved her whip she drove straight across the furrows towards them a little recklessly the groom running behind by her side was a girl with coils of deep brown hair and a thick black veil worn after the fashion of the travelling american  just in time arent we lady runton remarked as she brought the horses to a standstill help me down jack and look after miss fielding sir george by the bye have you two met yet  duncombe bowedhe was bareheadedand held out his hands  i saw miss fielding for a moment last night he said or rather i didnt see her we were introduced however what do you think of our maligned english weather miss fielding he asked  she raised her veil and looked at him deliberately he had been prepared for this meeting and yet it was with difficulty that he refrained from a start the likeness of the photograph it was even at that moment in his pocket was wonderful she looked a little older perhaps there were shadows in her face of which there were no traces in the picture and yet the likeness was wonderful  today at least is charming she said but then i am quite used to your climate you know i have lived in europe almost as much as in america  she certainly had no trace of any accent she spoke a little more slowly perhaps than most young englishwomen but there was nothing whatever in her words or in her pronunciation of them to suggest a transatlantic origin she stood by his side looking about her with an air of interest and duncombe began to wonder whether after all she was not more beautiful than the photograph which he had treasured so jealously he became conscious of a desire to keep her by his side  is your father shooting miss fielding  she laughed softly  you dont know my father sir george she answered he hates exercise detests being out of doors and his idea of paradise when he is away from business is to be in a large hotel where every one speaks english where there are tapes and special editions and an american bar  duncombe laughed  then i am afraid mr fielding will find it rather hard to amuse himself down here  well hes discovered the telephone she said hes spending the morning ringing up people all over the country he was talking to his bankers when we came out oh here come the rest of them how tired they look poor thingsespecially the baron nature never meant him to tramp over ploughed fields i am sure baron i was just saying how warm you look  the baron took off his cap gave up his gun to a keeper and turned a glowing face towards them  my dear young lady he declared i am warm i admit it but it is good for me very good indeed i tried to make your father walk with us he will be sure to suffer some day if he takes no exercise  oh fathers never ill the girl answered but then he eats nothing sir george i hope youre going to devote yourself to me at luncheon im terribly hungry  so we all are lady runton declared come along every one  luncheon was served in a large open barn pleasantly fragrant of dried hay and with a delightful view of the sea far away in the distance miss fielding chattered to every one was amusing and amused the baron gave her as much of his attention as he was ever disposed to bestow upon any one at mealtimes and duncombe almost forgot that he had breakfasted at eight oclock  charming young person that said lady runtons neighbor to her one of our future duchesses i suppose  lady runton smiled  lots of money teddy she answered what a pity you havent a title  the young manhe was in the foreign officesighed and shook his head  such things are not for me he declared sententiously my affections are engaged  that isnt the least reason why you shouldnt marry money her ladyship declared lighting a cigarette go and talk to her  cant spoil sport he answered shaking his head by jove duncombe is making the running though isnt he  her ladyship raised her glasses duncombe and miss fielding had strolled outside the barn he was showing her his housea very picturesque old place it looked down in the valley  its nothing but a farmhouse of course he said no pretensions to architecture or anything of that sort of course but its rather a comfortable old place  i think it is perfectly charming the girl said do you live there all alone you have sisters perhaps  he shook his head  no such luck he answered mine is entirely a bachelor establishment a great part of the time i am alone just now i have a pal staying with meawfully decent chap from devonshire  she was certainly silent for a moment he fancied too that there was a change in her face  from devonshire she repeated with a carelessness which if it was not natural was exceedingly well assumed i believe i knew some people once who came from there what is your friends name sir george  he turned slowly towards her  andrew pelham he said quietly he comes from a place called raynesworth  he is staying here nowwith you  yes he answered gravely  it was not his fancy this time of that he felt sure her face for the moment had been the color of chalka little exclamation had been strangled upon her lips she shot a quick glance at him he met it steadily  you know the name he asked  she shook her head  the nameyes she answered but not the person a very old friend of mine was called andrew pelham but he was an american and he has never been in england it startled me though to hear the exact name from you  she was herself again her explanation was carelessly given it sounded even convincing but duncombe himself was not convinced he knew that she wanted him to be he felt her eyes seeking his studying his face perhaps she was only anxious that he should not misunderstand  george are you ready his host called out were going to take smiths pastures  quite duncombe answered until this evening miss fielding  you are dining at runton place she asked quietly  yes he answered will you tell me all about your andrew pelham  she raised her eyes to his and smiled  do you think that you would be interested she asked  you know that i should he answered quietly  for a time he shot badly then he felt that his hosts eye was upon him and pulled himself together but he was never at his best he felt that the whole world of his sensations had been suddenly disturbed it was impossible that there could be any connection between this girl and the photograph which had first fired him with the impulse to undertake that most extraordinary and quixotic mission yet the fact remained that the girl herself had had very much the same effect upon him as his first sight of the photograph it was a coincidence of course miss fielding was charming there was no reason why he should not indulge to the full his admiration of her she had affected him in a most curious manner another man would have declared himself in love with her it was not possible that she could be any one but miss fielding that start which he had fancied that he had noticed the sudden aging of her face the look almost of fear absurd he was losing his nerves it was not possible he told himself steadfastly and yet  some of the women were following them in a leisurely sort of way behind miss fielding was there walking a little apart she carried her hat in her hand the wind which was blowing the skirts of her white cloth dress about her was making havoc in her glorious hair she walked with her head thrown back with all the effortless grace of youtha light heart an easy conscience he deliberately left his place and walked back to meet her she waved her hand gayly there was color in her cheeks now and her eyes laughed into his the shadows were gone he felt that this was madness and yet he said what he had come back to say  i thought that you might be interested to know miss fielding that you will meet the gentlemanwith the same name as your friendthis evening lord runton has been good enough to ask him to come up and dine  she nodded gayly  what a crowd of sentimental memories his coming will evoke she declared be nice to me wont you and help me dispel them  perhaps he said smiling with a great relief i might prefer to try to construct a few on my own account  go and do your duty she commanded laughing  duncombe hastened to his place his eyes were bright he felt that he was walking upon air  what a double distilled ass i nearly made of myself he muttered     chapter xvi  miss fielding asks a question   she came into the room a little late and her entrance created almost a sensation duncombe only knew that she wore a black gown and looked divine lady runton murmured paquin with a sigh and frown  these girls might at least leave us black she murmured to her neighbor what pearls  duncombe stepped forward to meet her he could not keep the admiration from his eyes her shoulders and slim graceful neck were as white as alabaster her hair was a gorgeous brown kissed into fine gold glimmering as though with a touch of some hidden fire she moved with the delightful freedom of absolute naturalness he murmured something which sounded ridiculously commonplace and she laughed at him  do you know that you are going to take me in she said i hope that you are prepared to be very amusing do tell me which is your friend  then duncombe remembered andrew who was standing by his side he turned towards him and the words suddenly died away upon his lips andrews tall frame was shaking as though with some powerful emotion he was standing with his head thrust forward as though listening intently duncombe set his teeth  will you allow me to present my friend miss fielding he said andrew this is miss fielding mr pelham miss fielding  she held out her hand and took his passive fingers  i am so glad to know you mr pelham she said pleasantly sir george gave me quite a shock today when he spoke of you i was once very nearly engaged to an andrew pelham in baltimore and i had most distressing visions of all my old sweethearts turning up to spoil my good time here  andrews voice sounded odd and restrained  i have never been in america he said  she laughed  you need not be afraid that i am going to claim you she declared you are at least a foot taller than my andrew you dont even inspire me with any tender recollections of him baron i do hope that you have not taken too much exercise  my dear young lady he answered bowing i never felt better in my life be thankful that it is not your hard fate to be my dinner companion i am so hungry i should have no time for conversation  on the contrary she declared ialmost regret it i much prefer to do some of the talking myself but i seldom get a chance will you promise to give me a show tonight sir george  as long as you permit me to say two or three things which are in my mind he answered lowering his voice a little you may do all the rest of the talking  dear me i am curious already she exclaimed what are the two or three things sir george why do you seenearly every one has gone she added suddenly come along  she laid her hand upon his arm and led him away soon he was by her side at the table their companions were uninteresting andrew was out of sight duncombe forgot everything else in the world except that he was with her  their conversation was of trifles yet intimate trifles the general talk buzzed all round them neither made any effort to arrest it to duncombe she seemed simply the image he had created and worshipped suddenly come to life that it was not in fact her picture went for nothing there was no infidelity the girl who had existed in his dreams was here it was for her that he had departed from the even tenor of his ways for her he had searched in paris for her he had braved the horrors of that unhappy week already he felt that she belonged to him and in a vague sort of way she too seemed to be letting herself drift to be giving color to his unconscious assumption by her lowered tone by the light in her eyes which answered his by all those little nameless trifles which go to the sealing of unwritten compacts  once her manner changed her father who was on the opposite side of the table a little way off leaned forward and addressed her  say sybil where did we stay in paris ive forgotten the name of the place  lhôtel dathènes she answered and at once resumed her conversation with duncombe  but somehow the thread was broken duncombe found himself watching the little gray man opposite who ate and drank so sparingly who talked only when he was spoken to and yet who seemed to be taking a keen but covert interest in everything that went on about him her father there was no likeness no shadow of a likeness yet duncombe felt almost a personal interest in him they would know one another better some day he felt  so youve been in paris lately he asked her suddenly  she nodded  for a few days  i arrived from there barely a week ago he remarked  i hate the place she answered talk of something else  and he obeyed  the second interruption came from andrew during a momentary lull in the conversation they heard his firm clear voice talking  my time was up yesterday but i find so much to interest me down here that i think i shall stay on for a few more days if my host remains as hospitable as ever  so much to interest him she murmured are not all places the same to the blind what does he mean  he is not really blind duncombe answered lowering his voice he can see things very dimly the doctor has told him that if he wears those glasses for a few more months he may be able to preserve some measure of eyesight poor chap  he does not attract meyour friend she said a little coldly what can he find to interest him so much here do you see how he keeps his head turned this way it is almost as though he wished to listen to what we were saying  there is a sort of reason for that duncombe answered shall i explain it  do  pelham lives as i think i told you in a small countryhouse near raynesworth duncombe began the hall in his village was occupied by a young mana boy reallyand his sister early in the year the boy who had never been abroad thought that he would like to travel a little in europe he wandered about some time in germany and austria and was coming home by paris suddenly all letters from him ceased he did not return he did not write he drew no money from his letter of credit he simply disappeared  the girl was proceeding tranquilly with her dinner the story so far did not seem to interest her  his sister who went over to paris to meet him found herself quite alone there and we supposed that she devoted herself to searching for him and then curiously enough she too disappeared letters from her suddenly ceased no one knew what had become of her  she looked at him with a faint smile  now she said your story is becoming interesting do go on i want to know where you and mr pelham come in  pelham i think he continued gravely was their oldest friend he sent for me we were old college chums and i went this trouble with his eyes had only just come on and he was practically helplessmuch more helpless than the ordinary blind person because it was all new to him this boy and girl were his old and dear friends he was longing to be off to paris to search for them himself and yet he knew that so far as he was concerned it would be simply wasted time he showed me the girls photograph  well  i went in his place  and did you find either of them  no  i wonder she said why you have told me this story  i am going to tell you why he answered because when pelham heard you laugh last night he was like a madman he believed that it was the voice of phyllis poynton and iiwhen i saw you i also felt that miracles were at hand look here  he drew a photograph from his pocket and showed it to her she looked at it long and earnestly  yes she admitted there is a likeness it is like what i might have been years ago but will you tell me something  of course  why do you carry the picture of that girl about with you  he leaned towards her and at that moment lady runton rose from her place  in the winter garden afterwards he whispered you have asked me the very question that i wanted to answer     chapter xvii  george duncombes lie   there was something strange about andrews manner as he moved up to duncombes side the latter who was in curiously high spirits talked incessantly for several minutes then he came to a dead stop he was aware that his friend was not listening  what is the matter with you old chap he asked abruptly you are positively glum  andrew pelham shook his head  nothing much he said  rubbish what is it  andrew dropped his voice almost to a whisper the words came hoarsely he seemed scarcely master of himself  the girls voice tortures me he declared it doesnt seem possible that there can be two so much alike and then spencers telegram what does it mean  be reasonable old fellow duncombe answered you knew phyllis poynton well do you believe that she would be content to masquerade under a false name invent a father be received hereheaven knows howand meet you an old friend as a stranger the things absurd isnt it  granted but what about spencers telegram  it is an enigma of course we can only wait for his solution i have wired him the information he asked for in the meantime  well in the meantime  there is nothing to be gained by framing absurd hypotheses i dont mind telling you andrew that i find miss fielding the most delightful girl i ever met in my life  tell me exactly george how she compares with the photograph you have of phyllis poynton  duncombe sipped his wine slowly  she is very like it he said and yet there are differences she is certainly a little thinner and taller the features are similar but the hair is quite differently arranged i should say that miss fielding is two or three years older than phyllis poynton and she has the air of having travelled and been about more  a few months of events andrew murmured might account for all those differences  duncombe laughed as he followed his hosts lead and rose  get that maggot out of your brain andrew he exclaimed as quickly as possible will you take my arm mind the corner  they found the drawingroom almost deserted runton raised his eyeglass and looked around  i bet those women have collared the billiard table he remarked come along you fellows  they recrossed the hall and entered the billiardroom lady runton was playing with the lord lieutenants wife the countess of appleton the others were all sitting about either on the lounge or in the winter garden beyond miss fielding was standing on the threshold and duncombe advanced eagerly towards her on the way however he was buttonholed by an acquaintance and the master of the hounds had something to say to him afterwards about one of his covers when he was free miss fielding had disappeared he made his way into the winter garden only to find her sitting in a secluded corner with the baron she looked up at his entrance but made no sign duncombe reluctantly reentered the billiardroom and was captured by his host for a rubber of bridge  the rubber was a long one duncombe played badly and lost his money declining to cut in again he returned to the winter garden miss fielding and the baron were still together only they had now pushed their chairs a little further back and were apparently engaged in a very confidential conversation duncombe turned on his heel and reentered the billiardroom  it was not until the party broke up that he found a chance of speaking to her he was sensible at once of a change in her manner she would have passed him with a little nod but he barred her way  you have treated me shockingly he declared with a smile which was a little forced you promised to let me show you the winter garden  did i she answered i am so sorry i must have forgotten all about it the baron has been entertaining me delightfully good night  he half stood aside  i havent by any chance offended you have i he asked in a low tone  she raised her eyebrows  certainly not she answered excuse me wont you i want to speak to lady runton before she goes upstairs  duncombe stood on one side and let her pass with a stiff bow as he raised his eyes he saw that mr fielding was standing within a few feet of him smoking a cigarette he might almost have overheard their conversation  good night mr fielding he said holding out his hand are you staying down here for long  for two days i believe mr fielding answered my daughter makes our plans  he spoke very slowly but without any accent nothing in his appearance except perhaps the fact that he wore a black evening tie accorded with the popular ideas of the travelling american  if you have an hour to spare duncombe said it would give me a great deal of pleasure if you and your daughter would walk down and have a look over my place part of the hall is elizabethan and i have some relics which might interest miss fielding  mr fielding removed the cigarette from his mouth  i thank you very much sir he said we are lord runtons guests and our stay is so short that we could scarcely make any arrangements to visit elsewhere glad to have had the pleasure of meeting you all the same  duncombe sought out his host  runton old chap he said do me a favor bring that fellow fielding and his daughter round to my place before they go  lord runton laughed heartily  is it a case he exclaimed and you our show bachelor too never mind my chaff old chap shes a ripping goodlooking girl and money enough to buy the country  i dont mind your chaff duncombe answered but will you bring her  lord runton looked thoughtful  how the dickens can i we are all shooting at the dukes tomorrow and i believe theyre off on saturday youre not in earnest by any chance are you george  damnably he answered  lord runton whistled softly  fielding doesnt shoot he remarked but theyre going with us to beaumanor shall i drop him a hint he might stay a day longerjust to make a few inquiries about you on the spot you know  get him to stay a day longer if you can duncombe answered but dont give me away the old chaps none too cordial as it is  i must talk to him runton said your baronetcy is a thundering sight better than any of these mushroom peerages he probably doesnt understand that sort of thing but what about the girl old von rothe has been making the running pretty strong you know  we all have to take our chance in that sort of thing duncombe said quietly i am not afraid of von rothe  ill do what i can for you runton promised good night  andrew who had left an hour or so earlier was sitting in the library smoking a pipe when his host returned  not gone to bed yet then duncombe remarked let me make you a whisky and soda old chap you look a bit tired  very good of youi think i will andrew answered and george are you sure that i should not be putting you out at all if i were to staysay another couple of days with you  duncombe wheeled round and faced his friend his reply was not immediate  andrew he said you know very well that i havent a pal in the world id sooner have here than you for just as long as you choose to stay butforgive me if i ask you one question is it because you want to watch miss fielding that you have changed your mind  that has a good deal to do with it george andrew said quietly if i left without meeting that young lady again i should be miserable i want to hear her speak when she does not know that any one is listening  duncombe crossed the room and laid his hand upon the others shoulder  andrew old fellow he said i cant have it i cant allow even my best friend to spy upon miss fielding you seeive come a bit of a cropper quick work i suppose youd say but im there all the same  who wants to spy upon miss fielding andrew exclaimed hoarsely she can be the daughter of a multimillionaire or a penniless adventurer for all i care all i want is to be sure that she isnt phyllis poynton  you are not yet convinced  no  there was a moments silence duncombe walked to the window and returned  andrew he said doesnt what i told you just now make a difference  andrew groaned  of course it would he answered butim fool enough to feel the same about phyllis poynton  duncombe in the full glow of sensations which seemed to him to give a larger and more wonderful outlook on life felt his sympathies suddenly awakened andrew pelham his old chum sitting there with his huge disfiguring glasses and bowed head was surely the type of all that was pathetic he forgot all his small irritation at the others obstinacy he remembered only their long years of comradeship and the tragedy which loomed over the life of his chosen friend once more his arm rested upon his shoulder  im a selfish brute andrew he said stay as long as you please and get this idea out of your brain im trying to get miss fielding and her father down here and if i can manage it anyhow ill leave you two alone and you shall talk as long as you like come well have a drink together now and a pipe afterwards  he walked across to the sideboard where the glasses and decanters were arranged then for the first time he saw upon the tray awaiting him a telegram he gave a little exclamation as he tore it open  andrew looked up  what is it george he asked a telegram  duncombe stood with his eyes glued upon the oblong strip of paper a curious pallor had crept into his face from underneath the healthy tan of his complexion andrew sightless though he was seemed to feel the presence in the room of some exciting influence he rose to his feet and moved softly across to the sideboard  is it a telegram george he whispered hoarsely read it to me is it from spencer  duncombe collected himself with an effort  its nothing he answered with a little laugh in which all the elements of mirth were lacking nothing at all a note from heggs my headkeeperabout some poachers confound the fellow  andrews hand was suddenly upon the sideboard travelling furtively across its shining surface duncombe watched it with a curious sense of fascination he felt altogether powerless to interfere he was simply wondering how long it would be before those long powerful fingers seized upon what they sought he might even then have swept aside the envelope but he felt no inclination to do so the fingers were moving slowly but surely finally with a little grab they seized upon it then there was another moment of suspense  slowly the hand was withdrawn without a seconds warning duncombe felt himself held in the grip of a giant andrew had him by the throat  you have lied to me george he cried there was a telegram     chapter xviii  who are these people   it seemed to duncombe that time stood still andrews face wholly disfigured by the hideous dark spectacles unrecognizable threatening was within a few inches of his own he felt the others hot breath upon his cheek for a moment there stole through his numbed senses the fear of more terrible things and then the grip which held him relaxed andrew stood away gasping the crisis was over  you lied to me george why  duncombe did not answer he could not it was as though his body had been emptied of all breath  you meant to keep the contents of that telegram a secret from me why was i right after all read me that telegram george read it me truthfully  the telegram is from spencer duncombe said he is coming here  here is he giving up the search has he failed then  he does not say duncombe answered he says simply that he is coming here he has wired for a motor to meet him at lynn he may be here tonight  a discordant laugh broke from pelhams lips  what about your miss fielding now he exclaimed why do you suppose that he is leaving paris and coming here i was right i knew that i was right  duncombe stood up his expanse of shirtfront was crumpled and battered his white tie was hanging down in ribbons  listen andrew he exclaimed i am speaking of the girl by whose side i sat tonight at dinner who calls herself miss fielding who hasin plain wordsdenied that she knows anything of phyllis poynton i want you to understand this whatever she may choose to call herself that shall be her name i will not have her questioned or bullied or watched if spencer comes here to do either i have finished with him i elect myself her protector i will stand between her and all suspicion of evil things  she has found a champion indeed pelham exclaimed fiercely with miss fielding i have nothing to do yet you had better understand this if she be phyllis poynton she belongs to me and not to you she was mine before you heard her name i have watched her grow up from a child i taught her to ride and to shoot and to swim i have watched her listening to the wind bending over the flowers in her garden i have walked with her over the moor when the twilight fell and the mists rose we have seen the kindling of the stars and we have seen the moon grow pale and the eastern sky ablaze i have taught her where to look for the beautiful things of life she has belonged to me in all ways save one i am a poor helpless creature now george but by the gods i will let no one rob me of my one holy compensation she is the girl i love the better part of myself  phyllis poynton may be all these things to you duncombe answered i do not know her i do not recognize her find her if you can make of her what you will all that i ask of you is that you divest your mind of these senseless suspicions seek phyllis poynton where you will but leave alone the woman whom i love i will not have her troubled or annoyed by needless importunities she says she is miss fielding then she is miss fielding it is enough for me it must be enough for you  and what about spencer pelham asked grimly  spencer in this matter is my servant duncombe answered if his search for phyllis poynton entails his annoying miss fielding then he is dismissed i will have no more to do with the business  i have heard of this man spencer andrew answered if you think that he is the sort of creature whom you can order about like that i fancy that you are mistaken you may try to call him off if you like but you wont succeed he is searching for phyllis poynton and he is coming here i believe that he will find her  the windows were wide open and both men suddenly turned round there was no mistaking the sound which came to them from the road outsidethe regular throb and beat of a perfectly balanced engine then they heard a mans voice cool and precise  here you are then and a sovereign for yourself a capital little car this good night  the little iron gate opened and closed a tall man in a loose travellingcoat and carrying a small bag entered he saw duncombe standing at the open window and waved his hand as he approached his boyish face lit up into a smile  what luck to find you up he exclaimed you got my telegram  an hour ago duncombe answered this is my friend mr andrew pelham what will you have  whisky and soda and a biscuit please was the prompt reply havent upset you i hope coming down from the clouds in this fashion  not in the least duncombe answered youve made us very curious though  dear me spencer exclaimed what a pity i came here to ask questions not to answer them youve set me a regular poser duncombe by jove thats good whisky  help yourself duncombe answered we wont bother you tonight ill show you a room as soon as youve had a cigarette fair crossing  no idea spencer answered i slept all the way jolly place youve got here duncombe nice country too  there is just one question pelham began  shant answer ittonight spencer interrupted firmly im dead sleepy and i couldnt guarantee to tell the truth and when tomorrow comesill be frank with youive very little to say pardon me but where does mr pelham come in in this matter  pelham duncombe said slowly was a neighbor of miss poyntons in devonshire it was through him that i first went to paris to search for her  spencer nodded  glad to meet him then he remarked there are a few questions i shall be glad to ask him in the morning  there is one pelham said which you must answer now  spencer raised his eyebrows he was standing with his back to them now helping himself to sandwiches from a dish upon the sideboard  by jove your cook does understand these things he remarked with his mouth full no idea i was so hungry what was that mr pelham a question which must be answered now  yes you telegraphed to duncombe to know the names of lord runtons guests and now you have come here yourself why  spencer helped himself to another sandwich  i came here he said because i didnt seem to be getting on in paris it struck me that the clue to miss poyntons disappearance might after all be on this side of the channel  pelham guided himself by the table to the sideboard he stood close to spencer  mr spencer he said i am almost blind and i cannot see your face but i want you to tell me the truth i expect it from you  my dear fellow spencer answered im awfully sorry for you of course but i really dont see why i should answer your questions at all truthfully or untruthfully i have been making a few inquiries for my friend duncombe at present i regret to say that i have been unsuccessful in their present crude state i should prefer keeping my discoveries such as they are to myself  pelham struck the sideboard with his clenched fist so that all the glasses rattled upon the tray his face was dark with passion  i will not be ignored in this matter he declared phyllis poynton and her brother are nothing to duncombe he acted only for me he cannot deny it ask him for yourself  i do not need to ask him spencer answered i am perfectly well aware of the circumstances of the case all the same i go about my business my own way i am not ready to answer questions from you or anybody else  you shall tell me this at least pelham declared you shall tell me why you telegraphed here for the names of lord runtons house party  simplest thing in the world spencer answered relinquishing his attack upon the sandwiches and lighting a cigarette i did it to oblige a friend who writes society notes for the new york herald  duncombe gave vent to a little exclamation of triumph pelham for the moment was speechless  awfully sorry if i misled you in any way spencer continued i never imagined your connecting my request with the disappearance of phyllis poynton why should i  the fact is duncombe interposed there is a girl staying at runton place whose voice pelham declares is exactly like phyllis poyntons and whose general appearance i will admit is somewhat similar to the photograph i showed you it is a coincidence of course but beyond that it is absurd to go this young lady is a miss fielding she is there with her father and they are invited guests with all the proper credentials  spencer nodded  i suppose it is because i am not a ladys man he said carelessly but i must admit that all girls voices sound pretty much alike to me  i wish to heaven that i could see your face pelham exclaimed i should know then whether you were telling me the truth  the weak point about my temporary profession is spencer remarked thoughtfully that it enables even strangers to insult one with impunity  if i have misjudged you pelham said with some dignity i am sorry i am to understand then that you have no news whatever to give us about the disappearance of phyllis poynton and her brother  not a scrap spencer answered  i will wish you both good night then pelham said no dont trouble george i can find my way quite well by myself  he disappeared and duncombe drew a little sigh of relief  excitable person your friend spencer remarked  duncombe nodded  very i am frightened to death that he will make an ass of himself before miss fielding if he hears her speak he loses his head  nice girl spencer asked  yesvery  what sort of a fellows the father  very quiet ive scarcely spoken to him theyre americans friends of lord runtons brother out in new york ever heard of them  yes a few times  you seem interested  i amvery  duncombe turned suddenly white  what do you mean he asked  spencer held his cigarette between his fingers and looked at it thoughtfully  mr fielding of new york he said sailed for america from havre last saturday his daughter has gone to russia with a party of friends  duncombe sprang from his seat his cigarette slipped from his fingers and fell unheeded upon the carpet  then whowho are these people he exclaimed  spencer shrugged his shoulders  i thought it worth while he said to come over and find out     chapter xix  a hillside encounter   a few minutes before ten the following morning a mounted messenger from runton place brought the following note for duncombe         runton place friday morning       my dear duncombefielding has cried off the shoot      today says he has a motor coming over for him to try from      norwich and his dutiful daughter remains with him thought i      would let you know in case you cared to come and look them up      best i could do for you       ever yours sincerely         runton  duncombe had breakfasted alone pelham had asked for something to be sent up for him and spencer after a cup of coffee in his room had gone out duncombe did not hesitate for a moment he started at once for runton place  a marvellous change had taken place in the weather since the previous day the calm splendor of the early autumn seemed to have vanished a strong north wind was blowing and the sky was everywhere gray and threatening the fields of uncut corn were bent like the waves of the sea and the yellow leaves came down from the trees in showers piled up masses of black clouds were driven across the sky scanty drops of rain kept falling an earnest of what was to come as soon as the wind should fail duncombe had almost to fight his way along until through a private gate he entered runton park the house lay down in the valley about a mile away to reach it one had to cross a ridge of hills covered with furze bushes and tumbled fragments of ancient rock  halfway up the first ascent he paused a figure had struggled into sight from the opposite sidethe figure of a girl her skirts and cloak were being blown wildly about her she wore a flat tamoshanter hat from under the confines of which her hair was defying the restraint of hatpins and elastic she stood there swaying a little from the violence of the wind slim and elegant notwithstanding a certain intensity of gaze and bearing duncombe felt his heart give a quick jump as he recognized her then he started up the hill as fast as he could go  she stood perfectly still watching him clamber up to her side her face showed no sign of pleasure or annoyance at his coming he felt at once that it was not he alone who had realized the coming of the tragedy  no words of conventional greeting passed between them as he clambered breathless to her side the wind had brought no color into her cheeks there were rims under her eyes she had the appearance of one who had come into touch with fearsome things  what do you want with me she asked why are you here  to be with you he answered you know why  she laughed mirthlessly  better go back she exclaimed i am no fit companion for any one today i came out to be alone  a gust of wind came tearing up the hillside they both struggled for breath  i came he said to find you i was going to the house something has happened which you ought to know  she looked back towards the long white front of the house and there was terror in her eyes  something is happening there she muttered and i am afraid  he took her gloveless hand it was as cold as ice she did not resist his touch but her fingers lay passively in his  let me be your friend he pleaded never mind what has happened or what is going to happen you are in trouble let me share it with you  you cannot she answered you nor any one else in the world let me go you dont understand  i understand more than you think he answered  she turned her startled eyes upon him  what do you mean she cried  i mean that the man whom we employed to trace the whereabouts of phyllis poynton and her brother arrived from paris last night he answered he wanted a list of lord runtons house party can you guess why  go on  mr fielding of new york left havre on saturday  stop  her voice was a staccato note of agony between the fingers which were pressed to her face he could see the slow painful flushing of her cheeks  why did you come to tell me this she asked in a low tone  you know he answered  did you guess last night that we were impostors she asked  certainly not he answered andrew was tortured with doubts about you he believed that you were phyllis poynton  i am she whispered i was afraid of him all the evening he must have known  it seemed to duncombe that the rocks and gorse bushes were spinning round and the ground was swaying under his feet the wind which had kept them both half breathless seemed full of mocking voices she was an impostor these were her own words she was in danger of detection perhaps of other things at that very moment spencer might have gained an entrance into runton place he felt uncertain of himself and all the time her eyes watched him jealously  why did you come here she cried why do you look at me like that it is no concern of yours who i am why do you interfere  everything that concerns you concerns me he answered i dont care who you are or who you say you are i dont even ask you for any sort of explanation i came to warn you about spencer for the rest here am i your friend whatever happens you are terrified dont go back to the house give me the right to take care of you ill do it  then for the first time a really human expression lit up her face the sick fear passed away her features were suddenly softer the light in her eyes was a beautiful thing  you are kind she murmured kinder than i ever dreamed any one could be whoknew will you be kinder still  try me he begged  then go away forget who i am forget who i am not shut yourself up in your study for twentyfour hours and come out without any memories at all oh do this for medo this she begged with a sudden break in her voice  she leaned a little towards him a long wisp of her hair blew in his face a moment of madness came to him with the gust of wind which blew her almost into his arms for one exquisite moment he held her the violets at her bosom were crushed against his coat then she tore herself away  you are mad she cried it is my fault oh let me go  never he answered passionately clasping at her hand call yourself by what name you will i love you if you are in trouble let me help let me go back to the house with you and we will face it together whatever it may be come  she wrung her hands the joy had all gone from her face  oh what have i done she moaned dont you understand that i am an impostor the man down there is not my father ioh let me go  she wrenched herself free she stood away from him her skirt gathered up into her hand prepared for flight  if you would really do me a kindness she cried get mr spencer to stop his search for me tell him to forget that such a person ever existed and you too you must do the same what i have done i have done of my own free will i am my own mistress i will not be interfered with listen  she turned a white intent face towards the house duncombe could hear nothing for the roaring of the wind but the girls face was once more convulsed with terror  what was that she cried  i heard nothing he answered what can one hear the wind is strong to drown even our voices  and those she cried again pointing with outstretched finger to two rapidly moving black specks coming towards them along the winding road which led from the highway to runton place  duncombe watched them for a moment  they are the runton shooting brakes he declared  i expect lord runton and the rest of them are coming back  coming back she repeated with a little gasp  but they were going to shoot all day and dine there they are not expected home till past midnight  i expect the shoot is off duncombe remarked one couldnt possibly hit anything a day like this i wonder they ever started  her face was white enough before but it was deathly now her lips parted but only a little moan came from them he heard the rush of her skirts and saw her spring forward he was left alone upon the hilltop     chapter xx  mr fielding in a new rÔle   runton was apparently enjoying the relaxation of having got rid of practically the whole of its guests for the day the women servants were going about their duties faithfully enough but with a marked absence of any superfluous energy mr harrison the butler was enjoying a quiet pipe in his room and a leisurely perusal of the morning paper mrs ellis the muchrespected housekeeper was also in her room comfortably ensconced in an easychair and studying a new volume of collected menus which a friend had sent her from paris the servants were not exactly neglecting their work but every one was appreciating a certain sense of peace which the emptying of the house from a crowd of more or less exacting guests had brought about  in one room only things were different and neither mrs ellis nor mr harrison nor any of the household knew anything about that it was the principal guestchamber on the first floora large and handsomely furnished apartment barely an hour ago it had been left in spotless order by a couple of painstaking servants just now it had another aspect  in the middle of the room a man lay stretched upon the floor face downwards the blood was slowly trickling from a wound in the side of the head down on to the carpet with nearly every breath he drew he groaned overturned chairs and tables showed that he had taken part in no ordinary struggle the condition of the other man also testified this  the other man was mr fielding he was down on his knees upon the floor rapidly going through the contents of a dark mahogany box which was apparently full of papers scattered over the carpet by his side were various strangelooking tools by means of which he had forced the lock mr fielding was not at all his usual self his face was absolutely colorless and every few moments his hand went up to his shoulderblade and a shiver went through his whole frame there was a faint odor of gunpowder in the room and somewhere near the feet of the prostrate man lay a small shining revolver nevertheless mr fielding persevered in his task  suddenly there came an interruption footsteps outside in the corridor had paused there was a sharp tapping at the door the prostrate man groaned louder than ever and half turned over proving that he was not wholly unconscious mr fielding closed the box and staggered to his feet  he stood for a moment staring wildly at the door who could it be he had asked as a special favor that he might not be disturbed and mr fielding knew how to ask favors of servants interruption now meant disaster absolute and unqualifiedthe end perhaps of a career in which he had achieved some success big drops of perspiration stood out upon his forehead drawn there by the pain and this new fear slowly and on tiptoe he drew near the door  who is that he asked with wonderful calmness  it is i let me in came the swift answer and mr fielding drew a little breath of relief nevertheless he was angry he opened the door and drew the girl in  you fool he exclaimed i sent you out of the way on purpose why have you come back  she opened her lips but no words came the man on the floor groaned again she swayed upon her feet it was all so horrible  speak cant you he muttered between his teeth things have gone badly here im wounded and im afraidive hurt that chappretty badly  i was in the park she faltered and saw them they are all coming back  coming back  they are almost here sir george duncombe told me that they could not shoot because of the wind  the car  downstairswaiting  he had forgotten his hurt he caught up his hat and a coat and pushed her out of the room he locked the door and thrust the key into his pocket as they walked down the corridor he lit a cigarette  a footman met them in the hall  a gentleman has called to see you sira mr spencer he announced i have shown him into the library  mr fielding appeared to hesitate for a moment  it is the man who wants to sell us the car he exclaimed turning towards the girl but i havent even seen it yet better tell him to wait for a quarter of an hour he added turning towards the footman ill just drive down to the lodge gates and back come along sybil  she followed him to the front door a man was seated at the wheel of the motor car and turned his head quickly as they approached mr fielding nodded pleasantly though his face was white with excruciating pain  kept you waiting im afraid he said can you drive at all in a wind like this  jump in sir and see the man answered is the young lady coming  mr fielding nodded and stepped into the front seat the girl was already in the tonneau the man slipped in his clutch and they glided round the broad circular sweep in front of the entrance just as they started the wagonette drew up  we shant be more than a few minutes mr fielding cried out waving his hand sorry youve lost your days sport  hold on a minute and ill come with you runton called out that car looks like going  but mr fielding did not hear                                       duncombe who had returned from the park by the fields was crossing the road to enter his own gates when a black speck far away on the top of the hill attracted his attention he stood still gazing at it and was instantly aware that it was approaching him at an almost incredible speed it gathered shape swiftly and he watched it with a fascination which kept him rooted to the spot above the wind he could hear the throbbing of its engines he saw it round a slight curve in the road with two wheels in the air and a skid which seemed for a moment as though it must mean destruction mud and small stones flew up around it the driver was crouching forward over the wheel tense and motionless duncombe moved to the side of the road to let it pass with a little exclamation of anger  then it came more clearly into sight and he forgot his anger in his amazement the seat next the driver was occupied by a man leaning far back whose face was like the face of the dead behind was a solitary passenger she was leaning over as though trying to speak to her companion her hair streamed wild in the wind and on her face was a look of blank and fearful terror duncombe half moved forward she saw him and touched the drivers arm his hand seemed to fly to the side of the car and his right foot was jammed down with grinding of brakes and the screaming of locked wheels the car was brought to a standstill within a few feet of him he sprang eagerly forward she was already upon her feet in the road  sir george she said your warning as you see was barely in time we are adventurer and adventuressdetected i suppose you are a magistrate dont you think that you ought to detain us  what can i do to help you he asked simply  she looked at him eagerly there were mud spots all up her gown even upon her face her hair was wildly disordered she carried her hat in her hand  you mean it she cried  you know that i do  she turned and looked up the road along which they had come there was no soul in sight she looked even up at the long line of windows which frowned down upon them from the back of the hall they too were empty she thrust a long envelope suddenly into his hand  guard this for me she whispered dont let any one know that you have it dont speak of it to any one keep it until i can send for it  he thrust it into his inner pocket and buttoned his coat  it is quite safe he said simply  her eyes flashed her gratitude upon him for the first time he saw something in her faceheard it in her tone which made his heart beat after all she was human  you are very good to me she murmured believe me i am not quite as bad as i seem goodbye  he turned with her towards the car and she gave a low cry he too started the car was a mile away tearing up a hill and almost out of sight in the lane behind they could hear the sound of galloping horses he caught her by the wrist dragged her through the gate and behind a great shrub on the lawn  stay there he exclaimed hoarsely dont move i will come back  half a dozen horsemen were coming along the lane at steeplechase pace lord runton on his wonderful black horse which no man before had ever seen him gallop save across the softest of country pulled up outside the gate  seen a motor go by duncombe he called out  duncombe nodded  rather he answered fielding and miss fielding in it going like hell  runton waved his companions on and leaned down to duncombe  beastly unpleasant thing happened duncombe he said fielding and his daughter have bolted fielding seems to have half killed a messenger who came down from london to see von rothe and stolen some papers fact of the matter is hes not fielding at alland as for the girl lord knows who she is sorry for you duncombe hope you werent very hard hit  he gathered up his reins  weve sent telegrams everywhere he said but the beast has cut the telephone and von rothe blasphemes if we talk about the police its a queer business  he rode off duncombe returned where the girl was standing she was clutching at the branches of the shrub as though prostrate with fear but at his return she straightened herself how much had she heard he wondered  dont move he said  she nodded  can any one see me she asked  not from the road  from the house  they could he admitted but it is the servants dinner hour dont you notice how quiet the house is  yes  she was very white she seemed to find some difficulty in speaking there was fear in her eyes  it would not be safe for you to leave here at present he said i am going to take you into a little room leading out of my study no one ever goes in it you will be safe there for a time  if i could sit downfor a little while  he took her arm and led her unresistingly towards the house the library window was closed but he opened it easily and helped her through at the further end of the room was an inner door which he threw open  this is a room which no one except myself ever enters he said i used to do a little painting here sometimes sit down please in that easychair i am going to get you a glass of wine  they heard the library door suddenly opened a voice shaking with passion called out his name  duncombe are you here duncombe  there was a dead silence they could hear him moving about the room  hiding are you brute come out or illby heavens ill shoot you if you dont tell me the truth i heard her voice in the lane ill swear to it  duncombe glanced quickly towards his companion she lay back in the chair in a dead faint     chapter xxi  a womans cry   the three men were sitting at a small round diningtable from which everything except the dessert had been removed duncombe filled his own glass and passed around a decanter of port pelham and spencer both helped themselves almost mechanically a cloud of restraint had hung over the little party duncombe raised his glass and half emptied its contents then he set it down and leaned back in his chair  well he said i am ready for the inquisition go on andrew  pelham fingered his own glass nervously he seemed to find his task no easy one  george he said we are old friends i want you to remember it i want you also to remember that i am in a hideous state of worry and nerveshe passed his hand over his forehead just above his eyes as though they were hurting him i am not behaving to you as a guest should to his host i admit it freely i have lost my temper more than once during the last twentyfour hours i am sorry forgive me if you can george  willingly andrew duncombe answered i shall think no more about it  at the same time pelham continued there is another point to be considered have you been quite fair to me george remember that phyllis poynton is the one person whose existence reconciles me to life you had never even heard her name before i sent for you you went abroad like the good fellow you are to find her for me you assure me that you have discoverednothing let me put you upon your honor george is this absolutely true  i have discovered nothing about phyllis poynton duncombe declared quietly  about miss fielding then  phyllis poynton and miss fielding are two very different persons duncombe declared  that may be so pelham said although i find it hard to believe that god ever gave to two women voices so exactly similar yet if you are assured that this is so why not be altogether frank with me  what have you to complain of duncombe asked  something has happened at runton place in which mr fielding and his daughter are concerned pelham continued i have heard all manner of strange rumors this afternoon i distinctly heard the girls voice in the lane outside she was crying out as though in fear a few minutes later i heard you speaking to some one in the library yet when i entered the room you would not answer me  supposing i grant everything that you say andrew duncombe answered supposing i admit that strange things have happened with regard to mr fielding and his daughter which have resulted in their leaving runton placeeven that she was there in the lane this afternoonhow does all this concern you  because pelham declared striking the table with his fist i am not satisfied that the girl who has been staying at runton place and calling herself miss fielding is not in reality phyllis poynton  duncombe lit a cigarette and passed the box round  do you know what they are saying tonight of mr fielding and his daughter he asked quietly  no  that the one is a robber and the other an adventuress duncombe answered this much is certainly true they have both left runton place at a moments notice and without taking leave of their host and hostess remember i never knew phyllis poynton you did ask yourself whether she is the sort of young person to obtain hospitality under false pretences and then abuse itto associate herself in a fraud with a selfconfessed robber  the idea pelham said quietly is absurd  while we are on the subject spencer remarked drawing the cigarettes towards him may i ask you a few questions mr pelham for instance had miss poynton any relations in france  not to my knowledge pelham answered i have known both her and her brother for a great many years and i never heard either of them mention any  why did she go to paris then  to meet her brother  and why did he go abroad  it was a whim i think just a desire to see a few foreign countries before he settled down to live the life of a country gentleman  you believe that he had no other reason  i think i may go so far as to say that i am sure of it pelham answered  one more question spencer added intervening  but the question remained unasked the butler had opened the diningroom door and was announcing lord runton  duncombe rose to his feet in surprise for the moment a sudden fear drew the color from his cheeks  he looked apprehensively towards his unexpected visitor lord runton however showed no signs of any great discomposure he was wearing his ordinary dinner clothes and in reply to duncombes first question assured him that he had dined  i will try a glass of your port if i may george he declared thanks  the butler had wheeled a chair up to the table for him and left the room lord runton filled his glass and sent the decanter round then he turned towards spencer to whom he had just been introduced  mr spencer he said my visit tonight is mainly to you i dare say you are aware that a somewhat unpleasant thing has happened at my house my people tell me that you called there this morning and inquired for mr fielding  spencer nodded  quite true he answered i called but did not see him he appears to have left somewhat hurriedly while i was waiting  you did not even catch a glimpse of him  no  you know mr fielding by sight i presume  i have seen him in paris once or twice spencer answered  you will not think me impertinent for asking you these questions i am sure lord runton continued apologetically but could you describe mr fielding to me  certainly spencer answered he was tall and thin wears glasses was cleanshaven bald and limped a little  lord runton nodded  thank you he said i presume that your visit this morning was one of courtesy you are acquainted with mr fielding  i have not that pleasure spencer answered i am afraid i must confess that my visit was purely one of curiosity  curiosity lord runton repeated  exactly do you mind passing those excellent cigarettes of yours duncombe  lord runton hesitated for a moment he was conscious of a certain restraint in spencers answers suddenly he turned towards him  mr spencer he said may i ask if you are mr jarvis spencer of the daily messengerthe mr spencer who was mentioned in connection with the investigations into the lawson estates  spencer nodded  yes he said i am that person  then lord runton continued i want to tell you exactly what has happened today in my house and to ask your advice may i  if our host has no objection spencer answered glancing towards pelham  none whatever duncombe answered also glancing towards pelham  there was a moments silence pelham raised his head  if lord runton desires it i will withdraw he said slowly at the same time i must confess that i too am interested in this matter if lord runton has no objection to my presence i should like to remain my discretion goes without saying  duncombe moved uneasily in his chair his eyes sought spencers for guidance but found his head averted lord runton raised his eyebrows slightly at what he considered a somewhat vulgar curiosity but his reply was prompt  you are a friend of duncombes mr pelham he said and that is enough i have to ask not only you but all three of you to consider what i am going to tell you as absolutely confidential  they all signified their assent lord runton continued  mr and miss fielding came to me with letters from my brother and with many convincing proofs of their identity we none of us had the slightest suspicion concerning them their behavior was exactly what it should have been nothing about them excited remark in any way except the unusual number of telegrams and telephone messages which mr fielding was always receiving that however was quite in accord with our ideas of an american business man and didnt seem to us in the least remarkable  the telegrams were delivered through a neighboring office spencer asked quietly  yes lord runton answered but they were all in code i happen to know that because the postmaster brought the first one up himself and explained that he was afraid that he must have made some mistake as the message was incomprehensible fielding only laughed and gave the man a sovereign the message was absolutely correct he declared he told me afterwards that whenever he was speculating he always coded his messages and it seemed perfectly reasonable  spencer nodded  just so he murmured  this morning lord runton continued mr fielding rather upset our plans we were all to have spent the day at the dukes and dined there there was a big shoot for the men as you know at breakfasttime however mr fielding announced that he had a man coming over with a motor car from norwich for them to try and begged to be excused so we had to go without them  von rothe was staying with me as you know and just before we started he had a telegram that a messenger from the embassy was on his way down he hesitated for some time as to whether he ought not to stay at home so as to be here when he arrived but we persuaded him to come with us and promised to send him back after luncheon when we got to chestow however the wind had become a gale and it was impossible to shoot decently von rothe was a little uneasy all the time i could see so he and i and a few of the others returned here and the rest went up to chestow just as we arrived fielding passed us in a great motor car with his daughter behind when we got to the house von rothe inquired for the messenger he was told that he was in mr fieldings sittingroom but when we got there we found the door locked and through the keyhole we could hear a man groaning we broke the door in and found von rothes messenger half unconscious and a rifled despatch box upon the floor he has given us no coherent account of what has happened yet but it is quite certain that he was attacked and robbed by mr fielding  what was stolen spencer asked money  no a letter lord runton answered von rothe says very little but i never saw a man so broken up he has left for london tonight  the matter is in the hands of the police of course spencer asked  lord runton shook his head  von rothe took me into his room and locked the door a few minutes after we had discovered what had happened he implored me to keep the whole affair from the press and from publicity in any form his whole career was at stake he said and very much more than his career all that we could do was to follow mr fielding and drag him back by force if we could even then he had little hope of recovering the letter we did our best but of course we had no chance mr fielding and his daughter simply drove off von rothe is dealing with the affair in his own way  it is a most extraordinary story spencer said quietly  lord runton turned towards him  i have treated you with confidence mr spencer he said will you tell me now why you called at my house to see mr fielding today  spencer hesitated but only for a moment  certainly he said i came because i knew that mr fielding was halfway to america and his daughter in russia some friends of mine were curious to know who your guests could be  pelham raised his head  you lied to me then he exclaimed  i had as much right to lie to you spencer answered calmly as you had to ask me questions i had  he stopped short in the middle of his sentence the faces of the three men were a study in varying expressions from some other part of the house there came to them the sound of a womans sudden cry of terrorthe cry of a woman who had awakened suddenly to look into the face of death duncombes uplifted glass fell with a crash upon the table the red wine trickled across the tablecloth     chapter xxii  lord runton is suspicious   duncombe was out of the room in a very few seconds the others hesitated for a moment whether to follow him or not spencer was the first to rise to his feet and moved towards the door lord runton and pelham followed a moment or two later outside in the hall the house was perfectly silent  duncombe reached the library door just in time to find himself confronted by half a dozen of the men and women servants coming from the back of the house with his hand upon the doorknob he waved them back  be so good mrs harrison he said to the housekeeper as to keep better order in the servants hall we could hear some girls calling or laughing in the diningroom  indeed sir mrs harrison answered with some dignity the noise whatever it was did not come from the servants quarters we fancied that it came from your library  quite impossible duncombe answered coolly if i require any one i will ring  he passed through the door and locked it on the inside in half a dozen hasty strides he was across the room and inside the smaller apartment where he had left the girl with a little gasp of relief he realized that she was there still she was pale and a spot of color was blazing in her cheeks her hair and dress were a little disordered with trembling fingers she was fastening a little brooch into her blouse as he entered a rush of night air struck him from a wideopen window  what has happened he called out  i have been terrified she answered i am sorry i called out i could not help it a man came herethrough the window he talked so fast that i could scarcely hear what he said but he wanted that paper i tried to make him understand that i had not got it but he did not believe meand he was rude  duncombe shut down the window swearing softly to himself  i cannot stay with you he said just now the whole house is alarmed at your cry listen  there was a loud knocking at the library door duncombe turned hastily away  i must let them in he said i will come back to you  she pointed to the window  he is coming back she said at twelve oclock  do you wish me to give up the paper he asked  no  very well i will be with you when he comesbefore then i must get rid of these men first  he closed the door softly and drew the curtain which concealed it then he opened the library window and a moment afterwards the door  come in you fellows he said i scarcely know what i was doing when i locked the door i fancy one of the housemaids has been seeing ghosts in the garden i saw something white in amongst the shrubs but i could find nothing come on out with me  spencer followed with a perfectly grave face lord runton looked puzzled pelham did not attempt to leave the library spencer drew his host a little on one side  what a rotten liar you are george he said i dont think that even runton was taken in  i suppose it sounded a little thin duncombe answered coolly put it this way then so far as you are concerned the shriek occurred in my house ive no explanation to offer to anybody  i like the sound of that better duncombe he remarked hullo whats the matter with runton  lord runton was calling to them  youve had a visitor who was in a hurry old chap he remarked send for a lantern  duncombe concealed his annoyance  i dont want to alarm the whole household he said ive a little electric torch in my study ill fetch that  he brought it out the progress of a man from the road to the small window towards which duncombe glanced every now and then apprehensively was marked by much destruction the intruder had effected his exit either in great haste or in a singularly unfortunate manner he had apparently missed the gate which at this point was only a small hand one and in clambering over the fence he had broken the topmost strand of wire he had blundered into a bed of wallflowers which were all crushed and downtrodden and snapped off a rose tree in the middle below the window were distinct traces of footmarks lord runton who held the torch was becoming excited  duncombe he said there is something which i have not told you yet i have had numerous reports in about the car and was able to trace it as far as lynn but they all agreed in saying that it contained only two personsthe driver and the man who called himself fielding what became of the girl  i have no idea duncombe answered steadily  of course not lord runton continued but dont you think it possible thatwithout your knowledge of courseshe may be hidden somewhere about here that cry was not like the cry of a housemaid let us have the whole place searched  duncombe shrugged his shoulders  as you will he answered i am certain however that it will be useless there is no place here where any one could hide  your servants may know something runton suggested  i have already questioned them duncombe answered  come along mr spencer lord runton exclaimed let us search the grounds  spencer shook his head  waste of time lord runton he answered if you really want to discover the whereabouts of this missing young lady and she should by any chance be close at hand i should recommend you to induce sir george to let you search the room to which those footsteps lead  the library duncombe interrupted quickly search it by all means if you like i have done so myself already  spencer was facing the house  the library he remarked reflectively ah  he stooped down to light a cigarette suddenly he felt duncombes hot breath upon his cheek in the momentary glow of the match he caught a silhouette of a pale angry face whose eyes were flashing upon him  this isnt your affair spencer shut up  spencer blew out the match deliberately they both followed lord runton to the library pelham was standing in the middle of the room he had the appearance of a man listening intently  george he asked sharply what is on the north side of this room  the wall duncombe answered  and beyond  a passage and the billiardroom  pelham seemed dissatisfied  i fancied he mutteredbut i suppose it must have been fancy do the women servants use that passage  of course upon my word duncombe added with a nervous little laugh you all seem to be trying to make my house into a maskelyne and cookes home of mystery let us go into the diningroom and have a whisky and soda  not for me thanks lord runton declared i must go back the real object of my coming here duncombe was to see if the mr spencer who called at runton place today was really mr jarvis spencer and if so to ask him whether he would help me  to what extent lord runton spencer asked quietly  to the extent of recovering or attempting to recover the papers which were stolen from the baron von rothe lord runton said the baron was a guest in my house and i feel the occurrence very much he will not let me even mention the matter to the police but i feel sure that he could not object to mr spencers taking the matter in hand  i think you will find spencer said that von rothe has already placed the matter in the hands of his own people the german secret service is pretty active over here you know i have come in contact with it once or twice  nevertheless for my own satisfaction lord runton continued i should like the matter inquired into by you mr spencer  i am not quite sure whether i am free to help you or not spencer said slowly may i come and see you tomorrow morning  if you prefer it lord runton said doubtfully come as early as possible good night duncombe i should like to know who your nocturnal visitor was  if he comes again duncombe said i may be able to tell you  he walked to his desk and taking out a revolver slipped it into his pocket then he rang the bell for lord runtons carriage it seemed to duncombe that there was a shade of coolness in his visitors manner as he took his leave he drew spencer a little on one side  i want you to promise to come and see me in any case tomorrow morning he said there is something which i should prefer saying to you in my own house to saying here  spencer nodded  very well he said i will come i can promise that much at least  lord runton departed pelham went off to bed spencer and his host were left alone in the library  billiards or a whisky and soda in the smokeroom the latter asked i know that you are not a late bird  neither thanks just a word with you here spencer answered  duncombe paused on his way to the door spencer was standing in a reflective attitude with his hands behind his back gently balancing himself upon his toes  i am very much disposed he said to accept lord runtons offer have you any objection  of course i have duncombe answered you are working for me  was working for you spencer corrected gently that is all over isnt it  what do you mean duncombe exclaimed  spencer stood squarely upon his feet he looked a little tired  my engagement from you was to find miss phyllis poynton he said softly you and i are perfectly well aware that the young lady in question iswell a few yards behind that curtain he said motioning with his head towards it my task is accomplished and i consider myself a free man  duncombe was silent for a moment he walked restlessly to the window and back again  how did you find out that she was here he asked  spencer looked a little disgusted  my dear fellow he said any one with the brains of a mouse must have discovered that why lord runton without any of the intimations which i have received is a little suspicious that is merely a matter of a b c there were difficulties i admit and i am sorry to say that i have never solved them i cannot tell you at this moment how it comes about that a young lady brought up in the country here and from all i can learn an ordinary unambitious virtuous sort of young person should disappear from england in search of a missing brother and return in a few months the companion of one of the most dangerous and brilliant members of the french secret service this sort of thing is clean beyond me i admit i will be frank with you duncombe i have met with difficulties in this case which i have never met with beforepeculiar difficulties  go on duncombe exclaimed eagerly  i have many sources of information in paris spencer continued slowly i have acquaintances amongst waiters cabmen caféproprietors detectives and many such people i have always found them most useful i went amongst them making careful inquiries about phyllis poynton and her brother they were like men struck dumb their mouths were closed like rattraps the mention of either the boy or the girl seemed to change them as though like magic from pleasant talkative men and women very eager to make the best of their little bit of information into surly idiots incapable of understanding or answering the slightest question it was the most extraordinary experience i have ever come across  duncombe was breathlessly interested  what do you gather from it he asked eagerly  i can only surmise spencer said slowly i can only surmise the existence of some power some force or combination of forces behind all this of the nature of which i am entirely ignorant i am bound to admit that there is a certain amount of fascination to me in the contemplation of any such thing the murder of that poor girl for instance who was proposing to give you information interests me exceedingly  duncombe shuddered at the recollection the whole scene was before him once more the whole series of events which had made his stay in paris so eventful he laid his hand upon spencers arm  spencer he said you speak as though your task were accomplished it isnt phyllis poynton may indeed be where you say but if so it is phyllis poynton with the halter about her neck with the fear of terrible things in her heart it is not you nor i who is the jailer of her captivity it is some power which has yet to be discovered our task is not finished yet tonight i will try to question her about this network of intrigue into which she seems to have been drawn if she will see you you too shall ask her about it dont think of deserting us yet  my dear duncombe spencer said i may as well confess at once that the sole interest i felt in lord runtons offer was that it is closely connected with the matter we have been discussing  you shall have my entire confidence spencer duncombe declared the man who called himself fielding was badly wounded and he passed here almost unconscious he entrusted the paper or letter or whatever it was he stole from von rothes messenger to his socalled daughter and she in her turn passed it on to me it is at this moment in my possession  spencer looked very serious  my dear fellow he said i congratulate you upon your pluck but not upon your discretion you are interfering in what may turn out to be a very great mattera matter in which a few lives are like the pawns which are swept from the chessboard does any one know this  she and i only you heard her shriek  yes  a man threw up her window and climbed in he demanded the packet he searched the room when he left her he declared that he should return at twelve tonight and if she did not hand it to him then he threatened her  spencer smiled and rubbed his hands softly together  really he murmured this is most interesting i am with you duncombe with you altogether there is only one more question  well  you did not know phyllis poynton you took up this search for her out of your friendship for pelham you are a rich man young strong with every capacity for enjoyment what induces you to risk your life in an adventure of this sort you see i dont mince words  then duncombe became grave his face fell into firm hard lines yet as he spoke there was something boyish about his expression  it is a fair question he answered you wont understand me i dont understand myself ive a brilliant galaxy of fools behind me theyve made the pages of history interesting theyve been the butt always of wiser men such as you spencer the girl in that room may be phyllis poynton or the worst adventuress who ever lied her way through the mazes of intrigue but i love her shes in my lifea part of it if i lose herwell you know what life is like when the flame has gone and only the embers burn  spencer nodded very softly  that is sufficient he said you speak of things that i myself do not understand but that is nothing i know that they exist but  well  but what about pelham  pelham has no prior claim he answered as soon as she is safe he shall know the whole truth i would tell him at this moment but that i am a little afraid of him he would never understand as we can the intricacy of the situation and nowto the prosaic  he rang the bell  groves he told the butler i am hungry bring me in anything you can rake up for supper on a tray and a pint of champagne  spencer raised his eyebrows and smiled duncombe nodded  for her of course he said i am going to take it in and i want you to stay here it is past eleven oclock already     chapter xxiii  her first kiss   i was never she declared quite so pleased to see any one in all my life i was wondering whether it would occur to you that i was starving  he set the tray down for her placed a chair in front of the table and busied himself opening the wine all the time he was looking at her  whatever have you been doing to yourself he asked at length  she laughed softly  oh i had to amuse myself somehow she answered ive done my hair a new way rearranged all my ornaments and really i dont think a man has a right to such a delightful manicure set i felt terribly nervous in the lavatory though i could hear some one in the billiardroom all the time  thats all right he declared ive locked the door there and have the key in my pocket no one can get in from that side  please talk and dont watch me she begged im ashamed to be so hungry  he smiled and helped her to some more chicken if he talked he was scarcely conscious of what he said all the time his eyes kept straying towards her she had taken off her jacket and was dressed simply enough in a blouse of some soft white material and a dark skirt everything from the ornaments at her neck the dull metal waistband and the trim shoes seemed to him to be carefully chosen and the best of their sort she wore no rings and her fingers had the rosy pinkness of health if she had seemed graceful to him before in the drawingroom of runton place and surrounded by some of the most beautiful women in the country she seemed more than ever so now seated in the somewhat worn chair of his little studio the color too seemed to have come back to her cheeks she seemed to have regained in some measure her girlishness her eyes were ever ready to laugh into his she chattered away as though the world after all contained nothing more serious for her than for any other girl duncombe hated to strike another note yet he knew that sooner or later it must be done  you are quite sure that you will not have anything else he asked  absolutely thanks i have never enjoyed anything so much in my life  he glanced at his watch it was halfpast eleven  i am afraid he said that i am going to be a nuisance to you but ones friends often are that i want to be your friend i want to prove myself such i am not an inquisitive person by any means but fate has declared that i should be your inquisitor there are some questions which i am bound to ask you  her face grew suddenly grave  there is so little she murmured which i can tell you  we shall see he answered in the first place lord runton has been here he is one of my oldest friends and a very good fellow he came to tell me that von rothe had been robbed in his house of some valuable papers he came partly to ask my advice all the time i was sitting opposite to him with those papers in my pocket  she looked at him strangely  perhaps she said quietly you gave them up to him  i did not he answered you know very well that i did not  it was your duty she said in a low tone  perhaps so on the other hand he continued you trusted me the papers are safe  does he know that you have them she asked  he knows nothing  she looked at him steadfastlynot with any appearance of doubting his word and yet as though she were revolving something in her mind concerning him  i am thinking she said how much better it would have been for both of us if we had never met  the fates thought otherwise he answered i searched paris for you only to find you at my gates the fates meant you to be my friend we must be careful not to disappoint them  she shook her head a little wistfully  you have been very good to me she said but you dont understand  precisely he interrupted i dont understand i want to to begin withwhat in this world induced you to throw in your lot even for an hour with the man who called himself fielding  i can answer no questions concerning myself she said sadly  he smiled  come he said it isnt so serious as all that is it sooner or later your friends are sure to find you and they will not be content with such a statement as that you were summoned one day to paris by or on behalf of your brother who had unaccountably disappeared there you immediately appear to have followed suit you had no friends in parisneither i think had he i believe i am correct in saying that you had neither of you ever been there before if your brother has fallen into bad hands and if those same people are trying to work upon your fears by leading you into this sort of thingwell i have friends who are powerful enough to bring you safely out of any den of thieves in the world you are in an impossible situation my dear young lady nature never meant you for an adventuress there is no necessity for you to become one why do you look at me like that  there was terror in her face he had hoped to reassure her to give her courage on the contrary every word he spoke only seemed to increase her distress  oh i am afraid she murmured i wish i had taken my chance i ought not to have burdened you for a moment with my affairs i have given you the right to ask me questions which i cannot answer  he was perplexed  if you have given promises to these people he began  oh there is no question of promises she interrupted i am here of my own free will i refuse to answer any questions i pray only if you would be generous that you ask me none that you keep me until tomorrow and let me go not only from this place but out of your life then indeed i will be grateful to you  he took her hand in his she yielded it without any attempt at resistance but it lay in his palm a cold dead thing  i am only concerned for your good he said gently it is your happiness only that i am anxious for you were not born or trained for a life of lies and crime i want to save you from it before it is too late  what i do she said slowly i do of my own free will  not quite i think he answered but let that pass listen if you will not talk to me about these things will you talk to my friend jarvis spencer he is a gentleman and a journalist by profession but he is also one of the cleverest amateur detectives in england  she held up her hands with a little gesture of horror her eyes were alight with fear  no she cried no a thousand times no dont let him come near me please oh i wish i could make you understand she continued helplessly you yourself in paris only a few weeks ago were in terrible danger a girl who only gave or meant to give you information about my brother and me was murdered you too would have been killed if you had found anything out  he would have answered her lightly but the memory of mademoiselle flossie lying dead upon the bed in that gloomy little room suddenly rose up before him and the words died away upon his lips he was silent for a moment and glanced again at his watch it wanted only five minutes to twelve he came and leaned over her chair  phyllis he said what am i to do about you i cannot let you go out of my life like this no you must listen to me for a moment when pelham sent for me after you had disappeared he showed me your picture i am not exactly the sort of man of whom knighterrants are made i have never gone a mile out of my way to meet any woman in my life my life here has seemed of all things the best to me i am a dull unambitious sort of fellow you know since i settled down here and i expected to go on for the rest of my days pretty much in the same way and yet when pelham showed me your picture it was different i made him give a copy to me i told himliar that i wasthat i could not carry the memory of your face in my mind when it was already engraven in my heart and i went off to paris phyllis like the veriest don quixote and i came back very sad indeed when i could not find you then you came to runton place and the trouble began i did not care who you were phyllis poynton sybil fielding or any one else i let the others dispute you wereyourself and i love you dear now do you understand why i cannot let you go away like this  he had both her hands in his now but her face was turned away then without any warning there came a soft rapping at the door which led into the library  duncombe reached it in a couple of strides he opened it cautiously and found spencer standing there  i thought it best to let you know he said that a carriage has stopped in the lane if i can be of any assistance i shall be hereand ready  duncombe nodded and closed the door the girl was sitting upright in her chair with the old look of fear in her eyes  who was that she asked quickly  spencer he answered he discovered your presence here but he is perfectly discreet he knocked to tell me that a carriage has stopped in the lane outside  she was white with fear but he only laughed and stooping down would have taken her hands once more but at that moment an unexpected sound intervened the deep silence of the house was broken by the ringing of the front door bell  duncombe started back the girl half rose to her feet  the front door he exclaimed the servants will have gone to bed i must answer it myself  she clung to him with a sudden abandon she was white to the lips  i am afraid she moaned dont leave me alone  he glanced towards the window  by jove it may be a trap he exclaimed let them ring ill stay here with you  they stood hand in hand listening his head was turned towards the door but the gentle pressure of her fingers drew him round her face was upturned to his something of the fear had gone there was an eager almost desperate light in her softened eyes and a tinge of color in her cheeks he caught her into his arms and their lips met she disengaged herself almost immediately  i dont care she said with a little laugh that is the first kiss i have ever given to a man and very likely it will be the last you wont be able to say that i have gone away without paying my bill now go and open the front door sir george  he hesitated for a moment  say only the word phyllis and no one in the world shall ever take you away  she did not even answer him he left her with a little sigh  spencer he said if you hear the slightest noise in that room go in and shout for me  spencer nodded the front door bell rang again     chapter xxiv  the empty room   duncombe unfastened the chain and bolts of the ponderous front door and looked out into the darkness a carriage and pair of horses were drawn up outside a man and a woman both dressed in long travellingcoats were standing upon the doorstep  this is duncombe hall i believe the man said is sir george duncombe at home  i am sir george duncombe he answered will you come inside  they crossed the threshold at once the man was tall and dark and his voice and bearing were unmistakable the woman was fair petite and apparently very sleepy she wore magnificent furs and she had the air of being in a very bad temper  we really are heartily ashamed of ourselves for disturbing you at such an hour sir george the man said but you will pardon us when you understand the position i am the marquis de st ethol and this is my wife i have a letter to you from my friend the duke of chestow with whom we have been staying  duncombe concealed his astonishment as well as he was able he bowed to the lady and led them towards the library spencer who had heard them coming had hastily concealed his revolver and was lounging in an easychair reading the evening paper  i am afraid that my servants are all in bed duncombe said and i can offer you only a bachelors hospitality this is my friend mr spencerthe marquis and marquise de st ethol wheel that easychair up spencer will you  spencers brow had betrayed not the slightest sign of surprise but duncombe fancied that the marquis had glanced at him keenly he was holding a note in his hand which he offered to duncombe  my errand is so unusual and the hour so extraordinary he said that i thought it would be better for chestow to write you a line or two will you please read it  duncombe tore open the envelope         chestow wednesday evening       my dear duncombemy friend de st ethol tells me      that he is obliged at great personal inconvenience to      execute a commission for a friend which involves a somewhat      unceremonious call upon you tonight he desires me      therefore to send you these few lines the marquis de st      ethol and his wife are amongst my oldest friends it gives me      great pleasure to vouch for them both in every way       yours sincerely         chestow  the letter i am afraid the marquis said smiling does little to satisfy your curiosity permit me to explain my errand in a few words  certainly duncombe interrupted but wont you take something i am glad to see that spencer is looking after your wife  the marquise had raised her veil and was leaning back in a chair with a sandwich poised in the fingers of one hand and a glass of burgundy in the other she was looking a little less bored and was chatting gayly to spencer whose french was equal to her own  i thank you very much the marquis said i will not take anything to drink but if you have cigarettesah thanks  he lit one and sat on the arm of an easychair  the facts are these he said i have a great friend in paris who knowing that i was at chestow and returning to france tomorrow has i must say taken some advantage of my good nature i am asked to call here and escort home to her friends a young lady who i understand is for the moment a guest under your roof my friend i must say telegraphs in a most mysterious manner but he is evidently very anxious that we should accede to his request our appearance here at this time of night i admit is most unjustifiable but what were we to do it is absolutely necessary for my wife to catch the twotwenty from charing cross tomorrow i hope that my friend will some day appreciate my devotion to come round by your house i have had to borrow a carriage from my friend chestow we shall have to drive to norwich and catch a train from there to london in the small hours of the morning i presume the young lady is here  the young lady is here duncombe answered may i inquire the name of the friend to whom you are asked to take her  the marquis yawned slightly he too seemed weary  my dear sir george he said i trust that you will appreciate my position in this matter i do not even know the young ladys name my eccentric friend in his telegram which occupied four forms most specially insisted that i should ask or answer no questions concerning her  you are not aware then of the circumstances which led to her coming here duncombe asked  i am utterly ignorant of them the marquis answered i am constrained to remain so  you no doubt have some message for her duncombe said her position here is a little peculiar she may desire some sort of information as to her destination  the marquis knocked the ash off his cigarette  if you will produce the young lady he said i think that you will find her prepared to come with us without asking any questions  duncombe threw open the door which led into the inner room the girl stepped forward as far as the threshold and looked out upon them  the marquis and the marquise de st ethol duncombe said to her they have brought me a letter from the duke of chestow and they have come to take you back to france  the girl looked fixedly for a moment at the marquise if any word or sign passed between them it escaped duncombe phyllis was content however to ask no questions  i am quite ready she said calmly  the marquise rose  your luggage can be sent on she remarked  duncombe approached phyllis and stood by her side  these people he said will not tell me where they are taking you to are you content to go  i must go she answered simply  you wish me to give you  if you please she interrupted  he turned towards the door  i have something belonging to missto my guest he said in my own room if you will excuse me for a moment i will fetch it  he returned with the sealed envelope which she had given him and which he placed in her hands he carried also a fur coat and an armful of wraps  you must take these he declared it is cold travelling  but how can i return them to you she protested no not the coat please i will take a rug if you like  you will take both he said firmly there need be no trouble about returning them i shall be in paris myself shortly and no doubt we shall come across one another  her eyes flashed something at him what it was he could not rightly tell it seemed to him that he saw pleasure there and fear but more of the latter the marquis intervened  i trust he said that in that case you will give us the pleasure of seeing something of you we live in the avenue de st cloud  you are very kind duncombe said i shall not fail to come and see you  spencer threw open the door and they passed out phyllis kept by duncombes side he felt her hand steal into his  i want you to keep this envelope for me she whispered it contains nothing which could bring you into trouble or which concerns any one else it is just something which i should like to feel was in safe keeping  he thrust it into his pocket  i will take care of it he promised andyou wont forget me we shall meet againsooner perhaps than you expect  she shook her head  i hope to heaven that we shall not at least not yet she murmured fervently  from the carriage window she put out her hand  you have been very kind to me she said goodbye  an impossible word he answered with wellaffected gayety a pleasant journey to you  then the carriage rolled away and spencer and he were left alone duncombe secured the front door and they walked slowly back to the library  you know paris well duncombe said have you ever heard of these people  spencer smiled  my dear fellow he exclaimed de st ethol is one of the first nobles in france i have seen him at the races many times  not the sort of people to lend themselves to anything shady  the last in the world spencer answered she was the comtesse de laugnan and between them they are connected with half a dozen royal houses this business is getting exceedingly interesting duncombe  but duncombe was thinking of the empty room     book ii     chapter i  guy poynton again   i suppose the boy said thoughtfully i must seem to you beastly ungrateful youve been a perfect brick to me ever since that night but i cant help being a bit homesick you see it was really the first time id ever been away from home for long and though my little place isnt a patch on this of course still i was born there and im jolly fond of it  his companion nodded and his dark eyes rested for a moment upon the others face guy poynton was idly watching the reapers at work in the golden valley below and he did not catch his friends expression  you are very young mon cher ami he said as one grows older one demands change change always of scene and occupation now i too am most hideously bored here although it is my home for me to live is only possible in parisparis the beautiful  guy looked away from the fields he resented a little his friends air of superiority  theres only a years difference in our ages he remarked  henri de bergillac smiledthis time more expressively than ever and held out his hands  i speak of experience not years he said you have lived for twenty years in a very delightful spot no doubt but away from everything which makes life endurable possible even for the child of the cities i have lived for twentyone years mostly in paris ah the difference  guy shrugged his shoulders and leaned back in his chair  well he said briefly tastes differ ive seen quite all i want to of paris for the rest of my life give me a fine june morning in the country and a tramp round the farm or an early morning start in september walking down the partridges or a gray day in november with a good gee underneath plenty of grass ahead and hounds talking good god i wish i were back in england  henri smiled and caressed his upper lip where symptoms of a moustache were beginning to appear  my dear guy he said you speak crudely because you do not understand you know of paris only its grosser side how can one learn more when he cannot even speak its language you know the paris of the tourist the real magic of my beautiful city has never entered into your heart your little dabble in its vices and frivolities must not count to you as anything final the joy of paris to one who understands is the exquisite refinement the unsurpassed culture of its abysmal wickedness  the devil guy exclaimed have you found out all that for yourself  henri was slightly annoyed he was always annoyed when he was not taken seriously  i have had the advantage he said of many friendships with men whose names you would scarcely know but who directed the intellectual tendencies of the younger generation of parisians people call us decadentsi suppose because we prefer intellectual progression to physical activity i am afraid dear friend that you would never be one of us  i am quite sure of it guy answered  you will not even drink absinthe henri continued helping himself from a little carafe which stood between them absolutely the most artistic of all drinks you prefer a thing you call a pipe to my choicest cigarettes and you have upon your cheeks a color of which a ploughboy should be ashamed  guy laughed goodhumoredly  well i cant help being sunburnt he declared henri sighed delicately  ah it is not only that he said i wish so much that i could make you understand you positively cultivate good health take cold baths and walks and exercises to preserve it  why the dickens shouldnt i  henri half closed his eyes he was a dutiful nephew but he felt that another month with this clodhopper of an english boy would mean the snapping of his finely strung nerves  my friend he began gently we in paris of the set to whom i belong do not consider good health to be a state which makes for intellectual progression good health means the triumph of the physical side of man over the nervous the healthy animal sleeps and eats too much he does not know the stimulus of pain his normal condition is unaspiringnot to say bovine the first essential therefore of life according to our tenets is to get rid of superfluous health  guy did not trust himself to speak this time he only stared at his companion who seemed pleased to have evoked his interest  directly the body is weakened henri continued the brain begins to act with the indisposition for physical effort comes activity of the imagination cigarettes drugs our friend here he continued patting the carafe late nights la belle passionall theseall these  he broke off in the middle of his sentence simultaneously he abandoned his carefully chosen attitude of studied languor he was leaning forward in his chair watching a carriage which had just come into sight along the straight wide road which led from the outside world to the chateau  the devil he exclaimed my respected uncle jacques  a manservant stepped out upon the terrace  monsieur  remove the absinthe jacques monsieur le duc arrives  guy who also had been watching the carriage gave utterance to a little exclamation he pointed to two figures on horseback who rode behind the carriage  the gendarmes he exclaimed they have come for me at last  his face was no longer ruddy the pallor of fear had crept to his cheeks a note of despair rang in his voice  his companion only laughed  gendarmes perhaps he answered but not for you my young friend have i not told you that you are in sanctuary here a guest of the duc de bergillac evades all suspicion ah i understand well those gendarmes let their presence cause you no anxiety cher monsieur they are a guard of honor for my reverend uncle and the personage who rides with him  guy resumed his chair and sat with his head buried in his hands in an attitude of depression his companion leaned over the stone balustrade of the terrace and waved his hand to the occupants of the carriage below they pulled up at the bottom of the steps and commenced slowly to ascend in obedience to an imperious gesture from his uncle henri advanced to meet them he greeted his uncle with graceful affection before the other man although his appearance was homely and his dress almost untidy he bowed very low indeed and accepted his proffered hand as a mark of favor  the duc de bergillac was tall sallow with black moustache and imperial he possessed all the personal essentials of the aristocrat and he had the air of one accustomed to command  henri he said your young friend is with you  but certainly his nephew answered with a sigh am i not always obedient he has scarcely been out of my sight since we arrived  very good you saw us arrive just now did you mention the name of monsieur grisson the duke asked  but certainly not henri answered  the duke nodded  you have discretion he said monsieur grisson is here incognito he wishes to hear your young friends story from his own lips  the dukes companion nodded silently he had the air of a silent man he was short inclined to be stout and his dress and bearing were almost bourgeois his features were large and not particularly intelligent his cheeks were puffy and his gray beard illhumored he had the double neck of the frenchman of the lower class who has not denied himself the joys of the cuisine and his appearance would have been hopelessly commonplace but for the deepset brilliant black eyes which lit up his whole face and gave it an aspect of power  after déjeuner you understand he said it is well that your young friend should not understand that i came here for no other reason i will see first your manuscripts monsieur le duc  the duke waved his hand courteously to guy as the two men passed along on their way to the library henri resumed his seat with a little shrug of the shoulders  my respected uncle will bring such strange people here to see his manuscripts and collection of missals he remarked for myself it is a hobby which wearies me and you mon cher guy  i know nothing about them he answered but the gendarmes henri why did they ride with your uncles carriage  henri smiled reassuringly  the old gentleman he said has something to do with the government and they were in attendance upon him you can realize my friend he added that you are indeed in a republican country such people must have the entrée to our houses even to our table i presume that you will have the pleasure of taking luncheon with him even  a manservant came out upon the terrace  monsieur le duc desires me to say that luncheon is served he announced  henri passed his arm through his friends  come he said let us go and see if we can amuse ourselves with my uncles venerable friend i do not suppose that he speaks english but i will interpret for you     chapter ii  an old story   guy moved uneasily upon his chair the color mounted almost to his forehead it was a humiliation this upon which he had not counted monsieur grisson was sitting within a few feet of him a serviette was tucked carefully underneath his collar and his face was a little flushed with the exercise of eating his eyes however were undimmed and his manners although a little brusque had certainly not merited the epithet of bourgeois  it isnt much of a story guy began making a desperate effort it was my first visit to paris and i lost my head a bit i drank too much wine and quarrelled with a fellow who certainly insulted me they all told me that i must fight him so  stop monsieur poynton  guy raised his head in surprise the exclamation had come from the duc de bergillac monsieur grisson was looking towards him as though for an explanation  my dear young friend the duke remarked with a smile it is my stupidity which is to blame i had forgotten the little matter to which you are alluding andbetween ourselvesit is one which is very much better not related to monsieur grisson i was alluding to your other adventureup in the pozen forest  guy for a moment was too astonished for words then he recovered himself with a little laugh and raised his head there was nothing terrible in the other affair  i will tell monsieur grisson about that with pleasure he said if it is likely to interest him i was in the north of germany on a walkingtour and i had rather a stupid fancy to go as far as the russian frontier and then return by vienna to paris i was quite alone and had no ones plans but my own to consult so i started off from steritz i think the place was called well we were within about forty miles of a place called renzan when our train was stopped and shunted we were told that some specials were to go by i should think we must have waited there for an hour or more anyhow i got sick of it and passed through the cars on to the rear platform and down on to the line i spoke to the guard and i understood him to say that we should not be starting for at least half an hour i strolled along the line a little way and stopped to light a pipe suddenly i heard a whistle and when i turned round the rear light of the train was moving away i shouted and ran as hard as i could but it was no use in less than two minutes the train was out of my sight and i was left alone  the duke pushed a small atlas across the table  i wonder he said if you could put your finger on about the spot where you were here you see is the railway line  guy studied it for a few moments carefully and looked at the scale then he pointed to a certain spot  as near as i could say he declared about there  the duke and monsieur grisson exchanged quick glances guy was beginning to feel a little mystified  proceed if you please the duke said courteously i am sure that monsieur grisson finds your story most interesting permit me  guy sipped the fin champagne from the glass which the duke had carefully filled and took a cigarette from the box at his elbow  i found myself he continued in the middle of a dense pine forest with just sufficient clearing for two lines of rails and no more there seemed to be nothing for me to do but to walk ahead in the direction which the train had taken i lit a pipe and started out all right but i very soon got tired the sleepers were a long way apart and the track between frightfully rough i walked for hours without seeing the slightest sign of a station or a break in the woods and finally i sat down dead beat my feet were all blisters and i felt that i couldnt walk another yard fortunately it was a warm night and i made up my mind to crawl under the bracken just inside the wood and go to sleep i found a comfortable place and id just gone off when a noise close at hand woke me i sat up and looked around  within a few feet of me an engine and a single carriage had pulled up at intervals along the line as far as i could see soldiers were stationed like sentries i could see that they were looking sharply up and down and even a little way into the wood from the train three or four men in long cloaks had already descended they were standing in the track talking together  for the first time monsieur grisson interrupted he took his cigar from his mouth and leaned over towards the young englishman  you were lost yourself you did not accost them ask them the way anywhere  it seems odd i suppose that i didnt guy answered but do you know there was an air of secrecy about the whole thing which rather frightened me and those soldiers had exactly the air of looking for somebody to shoot anyhow while i was hesitating what to do there was a whistle and another train came from the opposite direction then of course i waited to see what was going to happen  and you saw the duke began  i saw another single carriage arrive more men in long cloaks and more soldiers there was a brief but hearty greeting between two men who seemed to be the principals in this little pantomime then they both got into the train which had arrived first and i could see them sitting at a table talking and a third man who seemed to be a sort of secretary was writing all the time in about half an hour they both stepped back on to the line and every one commenced shaking hands and saying goodbye then the whole thing seemed to melt away the trains went on the soldiers climbed into a truck attached to one of them and everything was just as quiet as before  and afterwards  i waited until it was clear daylight and then i resumed my walk along the line i found the next station about five miles off and i was thankful to see that the guard of the train which had left me behind had had the sense to put my luggage out there i went to the hotel and had some breakfast and afterwards i chucked my idea of going so far as the frontier and left for vienna a week later i was in paris  the duke nodded  i have asked you this question before he said but monsieur grisson is anxious to hear it from your own lips to how many people did you tell this little adventure of yours before you reached paris  to not a soul guy answered i was very dull in vienna i found no one who could speak english and my few words of german did me no good at all i came on to paris within a week  the duke nodded  and in paris for the first time he remarked you mentioned the affair  yes i took up an illustrated paper at a café on the night of my arrival whilst waiting for supper and saw pictures of two men there who reminded me very much of the two whom i had seen on the railway near pozen i think i made some remark out loud which attracted the attention of a woman who was sitting at the next table and later on i told her the whole story  and since then  since then i have told it to no one  was there any one in the café you have spoken of who seemed to take any particular interest in you  guy considered for a moment  there was a young lady from vienna he said who seemed to want to talk to me  the two men exchanged glances  madame has justified herself the duke murmured  she was trying to listen to what i was saying to the english girlmademoiselle flossie she called herself and when she went away with her friends she threw me a note with two words on itprenez garde i know it struck me as being rather queer because  he hesitated the duke nodded  go on he said  well i may as well tell you everything guy continued even if it does sound rather like rot all the time i was in vienna and on the journey to paris i fancied that i was being followed i kept on seeing the same people and a man who got in at strasburgi had seen him before at the hotel in viennatried all he could to pal up to me i hate germans though and i didnt like the look of the fellow so i wouldnt have anything to say to him though i feel sure he tipped the conductor to put him in my compartment i gave him the slip at the railway station at paris but im almost sure i saw him that night at the café montmartre  your story monsieur grisson said quietly becomes more and more interesting monsieur le duc here has hinted at some slight indiscretion of yours on the night of your arrival in paris i have some influence with the government here and i think i can promise you some very substantial help in return for the information you have given us but i want you to turn your thoughts back to the night you spent by the railroad can you remember anything further about it however trifling which you have not told us  guy leaned back in his chair and thought for a moment  by jove he declared there is something which i forgot altogether just before that little party in the railway saloon broke up the chap in the car who had been writing left his seat and a loose page of paper fluttered through the window  the two men leaned across the table almost simultaneously  what became of it the duke asked sharply  i picked it up and put it in my pocket guy answered  did you read it the duke asked  i couldnt it was in german  where is it now monsieur grisson demanded  guy reflected the faces of the two men amazed him it was as though great things depended upon his answer  it is with my pocketbook and my letter of credit i remember that i kept it as a curiosity  a curiosity the duke exclaimed you have it here  guy shook his head  it is in my portmanteau he answered  the faces of the two men betrayed their disappointment they conversed for a few moments in rapid french then the duke turned to guy  you do not object to our sending a trusted person to look through your portmanteau he asked monsieur grisson and i are very curious about that sheet of paper  certainly not guy answered but may i not have my luggage here  the duke shook his head  not yet he said it would not be wise we must give monsieur grisson time to arrange your little affair  i dont want to seem a nuisance guy continued but about my sister  she has been assured of your safety the duke declared for the rest we will talk later in the day monsieur grisson and i are going to the telephone you will find henri on the terrace     chapter iii  a body from the seine   at the sport my young friend henri murmured from the depths of his basket chair i yield you without question supremacy your rude games trials mostly of brute strength do not interest me your horsemanship i must confess that i envy and i fear that you are a better shot but two things remain to me  only two guy murmured what unexampled modesty  i can drive a racing automobile at eighty miles an hour and with the foils i can play with you  i give you the first guy answered but im beginning to fancy myself a bit with the sticks lets have a bout  my dear guy henri exclaimed forgive me but what a crude suggestion the first breeze of the day is just coming up from the lake close your eyes as i do cant you catch the perfume of the roses and the late lilac exquisite in half an hour you will see a new green in the woods there as the sun drops this is silent joy you would exchange it for vulgar movement  i dont see anything vulgar about fencing guy replied its all right here of course but im getting stiff and i havent the appetite of a kitten i should like a good hours bout a swim afterwards in the baths and a rub down come on henri itll make us as fit as possible  henri shivered a little  my young friend he murmured you move me to despair how can an alliance between nations with such contrary ideals be possible you would desert a beautiful scene like this to gain by vulgar exercise an appetite that you may eat cant you realize the crudeness of it yet i must remember that you are my guest he added striking the bell by his side antoine shall prepare my linen clothes and i will give you a lesson antoine he added half turning to the manservant who stood by his elbow my black linen fencingclothes and shoes in the dressingroom and have the floor in the fencinggallery sprinkled with sand  the man bowed and henri slowly rose from his chair  dont bother about it you know if you mind very much guy said would you rather have a game of billiards or a swim in the lake  henri thrust his arm through his friends  by no means he answered if we are to do anything at all we will do the thing in which i excel it feeds my vanity which is good for me for by disposition i am overmodest  but they were not destined to fence that night for on their way across the hall the dukes own servant intercepted them  monsieur le duc he announced desires to speak with monsieur in the library  henri let go his friends arm  i return to the terrace mon ami he said you can fetch me when my respected uncle has finished with you  monsieur le duc and monsieur grisson were still together immediately the door was closed the former turned to guy  your luggage has been thoroughly searched he announced by a trusty agent the letter of credit is still there but the paper of which you spoke is missing  guy looked a little incredulous  i know it was there the evening i left the hotel he answered it was fastened to my letter of credit by an elastic band the man you sent must have missed it  the duke shook his head  that he said is impossible the paper has been abstracted  but who could have known about it guy protested  monsieur poynton the duke said we think it wellmonsieur grisson and ito take you a little further into our confidence has it occurred to you i wonder to appreciate the significance of what you saw on the railway in the forest of pozen  im afraidnot altogether guy answered  we assumed as much the duke said what you did see was this you saw a meeting between the german emperor and the czar of russia it was marvellously well arranged and except those interested you were probably the only witness according to the newspapers they were never less than four hundred miles apart but on the day in question the emperor was reported to be confined to his room by a slight chill and the czar to be resting after a fatiguing journey you understand that this meeting was meant to be kept a profound secret  guy nodded  but why he asked was there any special reason why they should not meet  my young friend the duke answered gravely this meeting of which you were the only witness might but for your chance presence there have altered the destiny of europe try how you will you cannot appreciate its farreaching possibilities i will endeavor to give you the bare outlines of the affair even you i suppose have observed or heard of the growing friendship between my country and yours which has culminated in what is called the entente cordiale  yes i know as much as that guy admitted  this movement the duke said has been looked upon with growing distaste and disfavor in russia russia is the traditional and inevitable enemy of your country russia had i may go so far as to say made up her mind for war with england very soon after her first reverses at the hands of japan i am telling you now what is a matter of common knowledge amongst diplomatists when i tell you that it was the attitude of my countryof francewhich alone has stayed her hand  this is very interesting guy said even to me who have never taken any interest in politics but  wait russia as i say found us indisposed to back her in any quarrel with england she turned then of course to germany we became aware through our secret service that something was on foot between the two countries with our utmost vigilance we were unable to obtain any particulars it is you monsieur poynton who have brought us the first information of a definite character  guy looked his amazement but he said nothing  to you the duke continued a secret meeting between these two monarchs may not seem at all an astonishing thing to us it is of the gravest political importance some sort of an understanding was arrived at between them what was it that sheet of paper which was once in your possession might very possibly contain the clue now you can appreciate its importance to us  what an ass i was not to take more care of it guy muttered  there are other things to be considered the duke continued for the last month every dockyard in germany has been working night and day and we have authentic information as to a huge mobilization scheme which is already on foot we might have wondered against whom these preparations were intended but for you as it is the english government has been fully apprised of everything your magnificent fleet under the pretext of seeing the baltic squadron safely on its way has been gradually concentrated from despatches to the german ambassador which we have managed to intercept in england we know that it is intended to raise a casus belli during the presence of the squadron in british waters quite unexpectedly as it was hoped germany was to range herself on russias side and strike against england we russias nominal ally have had no intimation of this whatever we are apparently left to ourselvesignored our friendship with your country has destroyed russias friendship for us she relies no doubt on our neutrality and she makes terms doubtless absurdly favorable ones with our ancient enemy in the eyes of the world france is to be made to appear ridiculous the german empire is to be ruled from london and the emperor wilhelms known ambition is to be realized  it sounds guy admitted like a nightmare i know you foreigners all think we english are a lot too cocksure but we have our own ideas you know about any attempt at invasion  i am afraid the duke said that when it comes to throwing a million men at different points of your coasts protected by a superb navy you might find yourselves unpleasantly surprised but let that pass have i said enough to make you understand the importance of what you saw in the forest of pozen good now i want you to understand this in the interests of your country and mine it is most important that the fact of our knowledge of this meeting should be kept a profound secret  yes guy said i understand that  your presence there the duke continued created a certain amount of suspicion you were watched to paris by german spies and if they had had the least idea of how much you had seen your life would not have been worth five minutes purchase as it is they are uneasy over your disappearance there are at least a dozen men and women in paris and england today who are searching for you you are moderately safe here but not altogether i want to put them finally off the scent i might of course put you into such confinement that detection would be impossible i do not want to do that you have rendered your own country and mine an immense service i prefer to treat you as a gentleman and a man of honor and to take you as i hope you will see that i have done into our entire confidence  monsieur le duc guy answered i can assure you that i appreciate all that you have said i am willing to do exactly as you say  tomorrow mornings papers the duke said slowly will contain an account of the finding of your body in the seine  my what guy exclaimed  your body we are going to stab and drown you perhaps i should say we are going to discover you stabbed and drowned  guy half rose from his seat  i say he began  i need not explain of course the duke continued that you will suffer by proxy the whole affair has been carefully arranged by the commissioners of police  an account of your doings since you arrived in paris will be given which i fear may not flatter you but you must remember that it is necessary to put our german friends completely off the scent and in a months time or so you will reappear and everything will be contradicted  but my sister guy exclaimed  concerning your sister the duke continued we have further explanations perhaps i should say apologies to offer you at some future time for the presentthis only she is now in paris she is to some extent in our confidence and you shall see her within the next few days  and what are you going to do with me really guy asked  you will remain here half the servants of the household have been dismissed and every one who is not absolutely trustworthy has been got rid of we are in close consultation with your english cabinet and the moment the time arrives for us to disclose our knowledge of these secrets you will be free to go where you please  absolutely free guy asked anxiously  certainly the duke answered the other little affair is cancelled by your present services in fact as regards that you need not give yourself another moments anxiety  a small telephone which stood upon the table rang sharply the duke exchanged a few sentences and replaced the receiver he turned to guy  it is an affair of the tides he said your body was washed up this afternoon six hours before time it will be in the evening papers ah  the telephone rang again this time it was monsieur grisson who was required he listened for a moment or two with inscrutable countenance then he glanced at the clock  the russian ambassador he said replacing the receiver desires an immediate interview with me on a matter of the utmost importanceand the russian fleet has left the baltic     chapter iv  the insolence of madame la marquise   duncombe was passed from the concierge to a footman and from a footman to a quietly dressed groom of the chambers who brought him at last to madame la marquise she gave him the tips of her fingers and a somewhat inquiring gaze  sir george duncombe is it not she remarked i am not receiving this afternoon but your message was so urgent forgive me but it was not by any chance my husband whom you wished to see  your husband would have done as well madame duncombe answered bluntly but i learned that he was not at home my visit is really to miss poynton i should be exceedingly obliged if you would allow me the privilege of a few minutes conversation with her  the forehead of the marquise was wrinkled with surprise she stood amidst all the wonders of her magnificent drawingroom like a dainty dresden dollpetite cold dressed to perfection her manner and her tone were alike frigid  but monsieur she said that is wholly impossible mademoiselle is too thoroughly upset by the terrible news in the paper this morning it is unheard of monsieur may call again if he is a friend of mademoiselle poyntonssay in a fortnight  marquise he said it is necessary that i see mademoiselle at once i am the bearer of good news  the marquise looked at him steadily  of good news monsieur  certainly  but how can that be  if madame will give me the opportunity he said i should only be too glad to explainto mademoiselle poynton  if indeed it should be good news the marquise said slowly it were better broken gradually to mademoiselle i will take her a message  permit me to see her marquise he begged my errand is indeed important  she shook her head  it is not she said according to the convenances mademoiselle is under my protection i have not the honor of knowing you monsieur  duncombe raised his eyebrows  but you remember calling at my house in norfolk and bringing miss poynton away he said  she stared at him calmly  the matter she said has escaped my memory i do not love your country monsieur and my rare visits there do not linger in my mind  your husband he reminded her asked me to visit you here  my husbands friends she replied are not mine  the calm insolence of her manner towards him took him aback he had scarcely expected such a reception  i can only apologize madame he said with a bow for intruding i will await your husbands return in the hall  he bowed low and turned to leave the room he had almost reached the door before she stopped him  wait  he turned round her voice was different  come and sit down here she said pointing to a sofa by her side  he obeyed her thoroughly amazed she leaned back amongst the cushions and looked at him thoughtfully  how is it that youan englishmanspeak french so well she asked  i lived in paris for some years he answered  indeed and yet you returned tonorfolk is it  he bowed  it is true madame he admitted  how droll she murmured miss poyntonshe is an old friend of yours  i am very anxious to see her madame  why  he hesitated after all his was no secret mission  i have reason to believe he said that a mistake has been made in the identity of the body found in the seine and supposed to be her brothers  she gave a little start it seemed to him that from that moment she regarded him with more interest  but that monsieur she said is not possible  why not  she did not answer him for a moment instead she rang a bell  a servant appeared almost immediately  request monsieur le marquis to step this way immediately he returns she ordered  the man bowed and withdrew the marquise turned again to duncombe  it is quite impossible she repeated do you know who it was that identifiedthe young man  duncombe shook his head  i know nothing he said i saw the notice in the paper and i have been to the morgue with a friend  were you allowed to see it  no for some reason or other we were not but we managed to bribe one of the attendants and we got the police description  this madame said is interesting well  there was one point in particular in the description duncombe said and a very important one which proved to us both that the dead man was not guy poynton  it is no secret i presume she said tell me what it was  duncombe hesitated he saw no reason for concealing the facts  the height of the body he said was given as five feet nine guy poynton was over six feet  the marquise nodded her head slowly  and now she said shall i tell you who it is who identified the body at the morgueapart from the papers which were found in his pocket and which certainly belonged to mr poynton  i should be interested to know he admitted  it was miss poynton herself it is that which has upset her so she recognized him at once  are you sure of this madame duncombe asked  i myself the marquise answered accompanied her there it was terrible  duncombe looked very grave  i am indeed sorry to hear this he said there can be no possibility of any mistake then  none whatever the marquise declared  you will permit me to see her duncombe begged if i am not a very old friendi am at least an intimate one  the marquise shook her head  she is not in a fit state to see any one she declared the visit to the morgue has upset her almost as much as the affair itself you must have patience monsieur in a fortnight or three weeks at the earliest she may be disposed to see friends certainly not at present  i may send her a message duncombe asked  the marquise nodded  yes you may write it if you like  and i may wait for an answer  yes  duncombe scribbled a few lines on the back of a visitingcard the marquise took it from him and rose  i will return she said you shall be entirely satisfied  she left him alone for nearly ten minutes she had scarcely left the room when another visitor entered the vicomte de bergillac in a dark brown suit and an applegreen tie bowed to duncombe and carefully selected the most comfortable chair in his vicinity  so you took my advice monsieur he remarked helping himself to a cushion from another chair and placing it behind his head  i admit it duncombe answered on the whole i believe that it was very good advice  would you the vicomte murmured like another dose  i trust duncombe said that there is no necessity  the vicomte reflected  why are you here he asked  to see miss poynton  and again why  duncombe smiled the boys manner was so devoid of impertinence that he found it impossible to resent his questions  well he said i came hoping to bring miss poynton some good news i had information which led me seriously to doubt whether the body which has been found in the seine is really her brothers  the vicomte sat up as though he had been shot  my friend he said slowly i take some interest in you but upon my word i begin to believe that you will end your days in the morgue yourself as you value your life dont tell any one else what you have told me i trust that i am the first  i have told the marquise duncombe answered and she has gone to find out whether miss poynton will see me  the vicomtes patent boot tapped the floor slowly  you have told the marquise he repeated thoughtfully stop i must think  there was a short silence then the vicomte looked up  very well he said now listen have you any confidence in me  undoubtedly duncombe answered the advice you gave me before was i know good it was confirmed a few hours following and as you know i followed it  then listen the vicomte said laffaire poynton is in excellent hands the young lady will come to no harm you are here i know because you are her friend you can help her if you will  how duncombe asked  by leaving paris today  your advice duncombe said grimly seems to lack variety  the vicomte shrugged his shoulders  the other affair he said is still open if i stepped to the telephone here you would be arrested within the hour  cant you leave the riddles out and talk so that an ordinary man can understand you for a few minutes duncombe begged  it is exactly what remains impossible the vicomte answered smoothly but you know the old saying you have doubtless something similar in your own country it is from our friends we suffer most your presence here yourforgive mesomewhat clumsy attempts to solve this affaire poynton are likely to be a cause of embarrassment to the young lady herself and to others apart from that it will certainly cost you your life  without some shadow of an explanation duncombe said calmly i remain where i am in case i can be of assistance to miss poynton  the young man shrugged his shoulders and sauntering to a mirror rearranged his tie madame la marquise entered  you henri she exclaimed  he bowed low with exaggerated grace and kissed the tips of her fingers  i he answered andfor this time with a perfectly legitimate reason for my coming a commission from my uncle  laffaire poynton  exactly dear cousin  but why she asked did they not show you into my room  i learnt that my friend sir george duncombe was here and i desired to see him he rejoined  she shrugged her dainty shoulders  you will wait she directed then she turned to duncombe and handed him a sealed envelope  if you please she said will you read thatnow  he tore it open and read the few hasty lines then he looked up and met the marquises expectant gaze  madame he said slowly does this come from miss poynton of her own free will  she laughed insolently  monsieur she said my guests are subject to no coercion in this house  he bowed and turned towards the door  your answer monsieur she called out  there is no answer he replied     chapter v  the interviewing of phyllis   the marquise made a wry face at his departing figure which changed swiftly into a smile as she turned to the young vicomte  ah these englishmen she exclaimed these dull good obstinate stupid pigs of englishmen if they would lose their tempers onceget angry anything do they make love as coldly i wonder  dear cousin he answered i do not know but if you will permit me i will show you  henri  he sighed  you are so adorable angèle he murmured  and you she answered are so indiscreet it is not your day and i am expecting gustav at any moment i have left word that he is to be shown up here there my hand for one moment not so roughly sir and now tell me why you came  on a diplomatic errand my dear cousin i must see miss poynton  she touched a bell  i will send for her she said i shall not let you see her alone she is much too goodlooking and you are far too impressionable  he looked at her reproachfully  angèle he said you speak so of a young english missto me henri de bergillacto me who have knownwho knows  she interrupted him laughing the exaggerated devotion of his manner seemed to amuse her  my dear henri she said i do not believe that even a young english miss is safe from you but attend she comes  phyllis entered the room and came towards them she was dressed in black and she was still pale but her eyes and mouth were wholly without affinity to the class of young person whom henri had expected to see he rose and bowed and phyllis regarded him with frank interest  phyllis the marquise said this is the vicomte de bergillac and he brings you messages from some one or other your affairs are quite too complicated for my little head sit down and let him talk to you  if monsieur le vicomte has brought me messages from the right person phyllis said with a smile he will be very welcome seriously monsieur i seem to have fallen amongst friends here whose only unkindness is an apparent desire to turn my life into a maze i hope that you are going to lead me out  i can conceive mademoiselle the vicomte answered with his hand upon his heart no more delightful undertaking  then i am quite sure she answered laughing softly that we are both going to be very happy please go on  mademoiselle speaks delightful french he murmured a little surprised  and monsieur i can see she answered is an apt flatterer afterwards as much as you please but nowwell i want to hear about guy  mademoiselle has commanded he said with a little gesture to proceed then monsieur guy is well and is my constant companion he is with friends who wish him well and this morning mademoiselle the president himself has given written orders to the police to proceed no further in the unfortunate little affair of which mademoiselle has knowledge  phyllis had lost all her pallor she smiled delightfully upon him madame la marquise rose with a little impatient movement and walked to the further end of the room  how nice of you to come and tell me this she exclaimed and what a relief i am sure i think he is very fortunate to have made such good friends  mademoiselle he declared with emphasis one at least of those friends is more than repaid  she laughed back into his eyes frankly amused by his gallantry  and now she said we come to the beginning of the riddles why is it necessary for him to be supposed drowned if he is no longer in danger from the police  ah mademoiselle he said i must speak to you now of strange things but first i must implore you to promise me this and remember it always every word that i am going to say to you now must remain for the present a profound secret that is agreed  certainly she answered  your brother he continued in his travels on the continent stumbled by chance upon a state secret of international importance he had himself no idea of it but a chance word which he let fall on the first evening i met him gave the clue to myself and some friends in his enforced retirement wethat is my uncle and otherslearned from him the whole story of his adventure it has placed the government of this country under great obligations this together with your service to us has secured his pardon  this is wonderful she murmured  it is not all he continued the spies of the country where he learnt this secret have followed him to paris they are today searching for him everywhere if they knew that he realized the importance of what he had seen and had communicated it to the proper persons here our advantage in knowing it would be largely lost so far they have not traced him now i think that you have the key to what must have puzzled you so much  this is wonderful she murmured let me think for a moment  you are naturally anxious the vicomte continued to see your brother before very long mademoiselle i trust that it may be my pleasure to bring you together but when i tell you that you are watched continually in the hope that through you your brothers hidingplace may be found you will understand the wisdom which for the present keeps you apart  i suppose so she answered dubiously but now that his death is reported  exactly mademoiselle the affair has been arranged so that the search for your brother will be abandoned and the espionage on you removed if the story of his doings in paris and the tragic sequel to them be believed by those whom we wish to believe it then they will also assume that his secret has died with him and that their schemes move on towards success you understand  yes monsieur le vicomte i understand she answered slowly what then do you wish me to do  mademoiselle the vicomte answered fixing his dark eyes impressively upon her for you there remains the hardest of all tasksinaction believe me that when i came here it was not my intention to put the truth of the matter so plainly before you neither was it the will of those whose orders i carry out but i mademoiselle before all things i believe in inspiration i find in mademoisellehe bowed once morequalities which alter the situation ia judge of faces as i venture to believe myselfhave looked into yours and many things have happened  she laughed delightfully her eyes were lit with humor  ah monsieur she protested  with you mademoiselle he continued reposes now a secret of great importance to your country and mine i ask for no pledge of discretion but i rely upon it and especially mademoiselle may i warn you against your friends  i understand she answered you wish me to share this confidence with no one  with no one the vicomte repeated impressively not even mademoiselle if i may venture to mention a name with your very persistent admirer sir george duncombe whom i saw here a few moments since  she sighed and the vicomtes face became one of pale anxiety  i have not been permitted to see him she answered he was here a few minutes ago  it is wiser so mademoiselle the vicomte said i wonder he added whether mademoiselle will pardon the impertinence of a purely personal question  i will try she answered demurely  this englishmansir george duncombeare you perhapshow you say betrothed to him  a certain bluntness in the question and the real or affected anxiety of the young mans tone brought the color streaming into her cheeks  monsieur she exclaimed you really must not  ah but mademoiselle he interrupted so much depends upon your answer  absurd she murmured i really do not see why i should answer such a question at all  you will be merciful he begged lowering his tone  i will she answered i hope you will appreciate my confidence i am not engaged to sir george duncombe  his sigh of relief was marvellous she found it harder than ever to keep the laughter from her eyes  mademoiselle he declared it makes me happy to have you say this  really vicomte she protested  the situation too he said becomes less complex we can very easily deal with him now he shall annoy you no more  but he doesnt annoy me she answered calmly on the contrary i should like to see him very much if i were permitted  mademoiselle will understand well the indiscretion he said earnestly  she sighed a little wearily  i am afraid she said that i find it a little hard to understand anything clearly but you see that i trust you i will not see him  mademoiselle is very wise he answered indeed it is better not there remains now a question which i have come to ask  well  mademoiselle did not by chance whilst waiting for her brother think of examining his luggage  she nodded  i did look through it she admitted  there was a paper there which is missing nowa sheet of paper with writing on itin german it is not possible that mademoiselle took possession of it he demanded eagerly  she nodded  that is just what i did do she said i could read a few words and i could not understand how it came to be in his bag it seemed to be part of an official agreement between two countries  you have it now he cried eagerly you have it in your possession  she shook her head  i gave it to some one to take care of she said when i was over in england i got frightened when we were nearly caught at runton and i did not want it to be found upon me  to whom he cried  to sir george duncombe  the vicomte was silent for a moment  you believe he asked that sir george duncombe would guard it carefully  i am sure he would she answered  mademoiselle he said this is very important your brothers luggage has been searched and we came to the conclusion that the paper had been taken by those who had followed him here and may possibly have been aware that he had it if we can get possession of it it will be very much to the advantage of your country and mine i scarcely dare say more will you give me a letter to sir george instructing him to deliver it up to me  she leaned a little forward and looked steadily into his eyes  monsieur le vicomte she said i do not know you very well and it is very hard indeed for me to tell who are my friends here can i trust you  mademoiselle he answered i will not say like your brother for it is a relationship i have no wish to bear let me say like the person to whom your welfare is dearer even than his own  phyllis felt her lips curve into a smile despite his youth and manner which seemed to her a little affected there was nevertheless undoubted earnestness in the admiration which he took no pains to conceal  very well monsieur le vicomte she said i will give you the letter     chapter vi  the blundering of andrew   they came face to face in the hall of the grand hotel duncombe had just returned from his call upon the marquise andrew was leaning upon the arm of a dark smoothshaven man and had apparently just descended from the lift at the sound of duncombes little exclamation they both stopped short andrew turned his heavily spectacled eyes in duncombes direction but it was obvious that he saw nothing  you here andrew  yes why not  the tone was curt almost discourteous duncombe understood at once  let us sit down somewhere and talk for a few minutes he said i did not expect you you should have let me know that you were coming  andrew laughed a little bitterly  i scarcely see why he said to tell you the truth i see no advantage to either of us in any intercourse  duncombe took him by the arm and led him towards the smokingroom  andrew he said perhaps i have behaved badlyat least from your point of view but remember that i warned you let us sit down here who is your friend  never mind andrew answered you can say what you have to before him he is in my confidence  duncombe glanced around the man had taken the chair next to them and was evidently prepared to listen to all that was said his clothes and bearing and quiet unobtrusive manners all seemed to suggest truthfully enough his possible identityan english detective from an advertised office duncombe smiled as he realized the almost pitiful inadequacy of such methods  come andrew he said turning to his friend you have a small grievance against me and you think you have a great one  a small grievance andrew murmured softly thank you duncombe  go on then state it duncombe declared let me hear what is in your mind  andrew raised his brows slowly twice he seemed to speak but at the last moment remained silent he was obviously struggling to control himself  there is this in my mind against you duncombe he said finally i sent for you as a friend you accepted a charge from meas my friend and you betrayed me  duncombe shook his head  listen andrew he said i want to remind you again of what i said just now i warned you no dont interrupt it may have sounded like nonsense to you i meant every word i said i honestly tried to make you understand i came here i risked many things i failed i returned to england up till then you had nothing to complain of then heaven knows why but the very girl whom i had gone to paris to seek came to runton in the guise at least of an adventuress  andrew lifted his head quickly  you admit it at last then he cried  yes i admit it now duncombe agreed  you lied to me thereto me who had no eyes who trusted you what was that but betrayal rank inexcusable betrayal  listen andrew duncombe said she told me that she was not phyllis poynton it was enough for me i disregarded my convictions her word was my law she said that she was not phyllis poynton and to me she never was phyllis poynton she was afraid of you and i helped her to avoid you i admit it it is the extent of my failing in our friendship and you were warned  and now  i am here now duncombe said a little sadly because i love her and because i cannot keep away but she will not see me and i am no nearer solving the mystery than ever on the contrary i know that i am in danger here it is possible that i may be driven to leave paris tonight  you know where she is now  yes  andrew leaned suddenly over and his grip was on duncombes shoulder like a vise  then by god you shall tell me he said fiercely dont you know man that guy has been found in the seine robbed and drugged and murdered without a doubt do you want me to wait whilst something of the same sort happens to her you shall tell me where she is duncombe i say that you shall tell me  duncombe hesitated  you can do no more than i have done he said  then at least i will do as much andrew answered i am her oldest friend and i have claims upon her which you never could have now that she is in this terrible trouble my place is by her side i  one moment andrew duncombe interrupted are you sure that it was guy poynton who was found in the seine the height was given as five feet nine and guy poynton was over six feet  you should read the papers andrew answered shortly he was identified by his sister  the papers said so duncombe answered hesitatingly but  look here andrew interrupted i have had enough of this playing with facts you have grown too complex about this business altogether duncombe give me phyllis poyntons address  you shall have it duncombe answered taking a leaf from his pocketbook and writing i dont think that it will be any good to you i think that it is more likely to lead you into trouble miss poynton is with the marquis and marquise de st ethol they are of the first nobility in france their position as people of honor and circumstance appears undoubted but nevertheless if you are allowed to see her i shall be surprised  the hallporter approached them hat in hand  a lady to see monsieur he announced to andrew  andrew rose and took his companions arm he scarcely glanced again towards duncombe who followed them out of the room and there in the hall awaiting them was the young lady from vienna quietly dressed in black but unmistakable with her pretty hair and perfumes duncombe watched them shake hands and move away before he could recover sufficiently from his first fit of surprise to intervene then a realization of what had happened rushed in upon him they too then had been to the café montmartre with their obvious anglicisms their clumsy inquiriesto make of themselves without doubt the jest of that little nest of intriguers and afterwards their tool duncombe thought of the fruits of his own inquiries there and shivered he hurried after the little party who were apparently on their way to the café  andrew he said grasping him by the arm i must speak with you aloneat once  i see no object in any further discussion between us andrew said calmly  dont be a fool duncombe answered that woman you are with is a spy if you have anything to do with her you are injuring phyllis poynton she is not here to give you information she is at work for her own ends  you are becoming more communicative my friend andrew said with something which was almost a sneer you did not talk so freely a few minutes back it seems as though we were on the eve of a discovery  you are on the brink of making an idiot of yourself duncombe answered quickly you were mad to bring that blundering english detective over here what the french police cannot or do not choose to discover do you suppose that they would allow an englishman to find outa stranger to paris and with an accent like that if i cannot keep you from folly by any other means i must break my word to others come back into the smokingroom with me and i will tell you why you are mad to have anything to do with that woman  thank you andrew answered i think not i have confidence in mr lloyd my friend here and i have none in you  andrew  i speak as i feel  leave me out of the question it is phyllis poynton you will harm i see that your friend is listening and mademoiselle is impatient make your excuses for ten minutes andrew you will never regret it  the detective who had evidently overheard everything stepped back to them  you will excuse my interfering sir he said but if this case is to remain in my hands at all it is necessary for me to hear all that sir george duncombe has to say the young lady will wait for a moment this case is difficult enough as it is what with the jealousy of the french police who naturally dont want us to find out what they cant if sir george duncombe has any information to give now the man added with emphasis which he withheld a few minutes ago i think that i ought to hear it from his own lips  i agree entirely with what mr lloyd has said andrew declared  duncombe shrugged his shoulders he looked around him cautiously but they were in a corner of the entresol and no one was within hearing distance  very well he said to save you from danger and miss poynton from further trouble i am going to break a confidence which has been reposed in me and to give you the benefit of my own surmises in the first place mr lloyd is mistaken in supposing that the french police have been in the least puzzled by this double disappearance on the contrary they are perfectly well aware of all the facts of the case and could have produced miss poynton or her brother at any moment they are working not for us but against us  indeed mr lloyd said in a tone of disbelief and their object  here is as much of the truth as i dare tell you duncombe said guy poynton whilst on the continent became the chance possessor of an important state secret he was followed to france by spies from that countrywe will call it germanyand the young lady who awaits you so impatiently is if not one of them at least one of their friends at the café montmartre he gave his secret away to people who are in some measure allied with the secret service police of france he was kidnapped by them and induced to remain hidden by a trick meanwhile diplomacy makes use of his information and foreign spies look for him in vain his sister when she came to search for him was simply an inconvenience which these people had not contemplated she was worked upon by fears concerning her brothers safety to go into hiding both have been well cared for and the report of guys death is i firmly believe nothing but an attempt to lull the anxieties of the spies who are searching for him this young woman here may be able to tell you into whose hands he has fallen but you may take my word for it that she is in greater need of information than you are and that she is an exceedingly dangerous person for you to discuss the poyntons with there are the crude facts i have only known them a few hours myself and there is a good deal which i cannot explain but this i honestly and firmly believe neither you nor i nor mr lloyd here can do the slightest good by interfering in this matter for myself i am leaving for england tonight  duncombe like most honest men expected to be believed if he had entertained the slightest doubt about it he would not have dared to open his mouth the silence that followed he could understand no doubt they were as amazed as he had been but it was a different thing when he saw the expression on andrews face as he turned to his companion  what do you think of this lloyd he asked  i am afraid sir the man answered that some of the clever ones have been imposing upon sir george it generally turns out so when amateurs tackle a job like this  duncombe looked at him in astonishment  do you mean to say that you dont believe me he exclaimed  i wouldnt put it like that sir the man answered with a deprecating smile i think you have been misled by those who did not wish you to discover the truth  duncombe turned sharply on his heel  and you andrew  i wish to do you justice andrew answered coldly and i am willing to believe that you have faith yourself in the extraordinary story you have just told us but frankly i think that you have been too credulous  duncombe lost his temper he turned on his heel and walked back into the hotel  you can go to the devil your own way he declared     chapter vii  spencer gets his chance   spencer tried to rise from the sofa but the effort was too much for him pale and thin with black lines under his eyes and bloodless lips he seemed scarcely more than the wreck of his former self  his visitor laid his stick and hat upon the table then he bowed once more to spencer and stood looking at him leaning slightly against the table  i am permitted he asked gently to introduce myself  quite unnecessary spencer answered  the baron shrugged his shoulders  you know me he asked  the shadow of a smile flitted across spencers face  by many names monsieur louis he answered  his visitor smiled debonair in dress and deportment there seemed nothing to inspire alarm in the air of gentle concern with which he regarded the man whom he had come to visit yet spencer cursed the languor which had kept him from recovering the revolver which an hour or more before had slipped from underneath his cushion  it saves trouble monsieur louis said i come to you monsieur spencer as a friend  you alarm me spencer murmured  monsieur louis shrugged his shoulders  you are pleased to be witty he answered but indeed i am no such terrible person it is permitted that i smoke  certainly spencer answered if you care for wine or liqueurs pray ring for my servant i can assure you that it is not by my own will that you find me so indifferent a host  i thank you monsieur louis answered i think that we will not ring the bell it would be a pity to disturb an interview to which i have looked forward with so much pleasure  laffaire poynton spencer suggested  precisely  you have perhaps come to complete the little affair in which so far you have succeeded so admirably  pray do not suggest such a thing monsieur louis answered deprecatingly for one thing i should not personally run the risk and for another have i not already assured you that i come as a friend  it was then spencer answered that i began to be frightened  monsieur louis smiled he drew a gold cigarette case from his pocket and calmly lit a cigarette  since you permit mon ami he said good i speak better when i smoke you are not so ill i see but that you retain that charming sense of humor your readers have learnt so well how to appreciate  the dose was scarcely strong enough spencer answered or perhaps by good fortune i stumbled upon the proper antidote  i see that you like plain speaking monsieur louis continued with a gentle smile permit me to assure you then that the dose was quite as strong as we wished extremes are sometimes necessary but we avoid them whenever possible  i wonder where it happened spencer said reflectively i have been on my guard all the time i have watched my wine and coffee at the cafés and i have eaten only in the restaurants that i know  monsieur louis did not seem to think the matter important  it was bound to happen he said if you had been like your friendsthe english baronet and the last two who are even more amusingperhaps it would not have been necessary but you understandyou were beginning to discover things  yes spencer admitted i was beginning to get interested  exactly we were forced to act i can assure you monsieur spencer that it was with reluctance the others of whom i have spokensir george duncombe monsieur pelham and his toy detectiveforgive me that i smilewalk all the time in the palm of our hand but they remain unharmed if by any chance they should blunder into the knowledge of things which might cause us annoyance why thenthere would be more invalids in paris indeed monsieur we do not seek to abuse our power my errand to you today is one of mercy  you make me ashamed spencer said with a sarcasm which he took no pains to conceal of my unworthy suspicions to proceed  you have sent for sir george duncombe to come and see you  spencer was silent for a moment his own servant unfaithful it was not possible  well  even you the baron continued have not yet solved the mystery of laffaire poynton but you know more than sir george let me recommend that you do not share your knowledge with him  why not  if you do sir george will at once share your indisposition  i begin to understand spencer said  how otherwise send sir george home you see the delicacy of our position it is not so much that we fear sir george duncombes interference but he again is followed and watched over by our enemies who would easily possess themselves of any information which he might gain  spencer nodded  it is good reasoning he admitted  listen monsieur louis continued i speak now on behalf of my friends you know whom i mean you have solved the mystery of our existence we are omnipotent the police and the secret service police and the government itself are with us we have license throughout the city we may do what others may not for us there is no crime i kill you now perhaps the police arrive i am before the commissioner i give him the signit is laffaire poynton i go free it is a certain thing  granted spencer said proceed with your killing or your argument  with the latter if you please monsieur louis answered i do not choose to kill laffaire poynton then harm is not meant to either of these young people that i assure you upon my honor in three weeks or say a month we have finished they may return to their homes if they will we have no further interest in them for those three weeks you must remain as you areyou and if you have influence over him sir george duncombe the other two fools we have no care for if they blundered into knowledgewell they must pay they are not our concern yours and mine for you i bring you an offer monsieur spencer  timeo danaos et dona ferentes spencer murmured  monsieur louis smiled  my gift he answered will not terrify you you are a journalist i offer to make the fortune of your paper you shall be the first to announce an affair of the greatest international importance since the war between russia and japan was declared no i will go further than that it is the greatest event since waterloo  laffaire poynton strikes so deep spencer remarked  so deep the baron answered it is the fools who grope their way into great places so did the boy poynton you my friend shall be the one brilliant exception you shall make yourself the king of journalists and you shall be quoted down the century as having achieved the greatest journalistic feat of modern days  spencer turned his drawn haggard face towards his visitor a slight flush of color stained his cheek  you fascinate me he said slowly i admit it you have found the weak spot in my armor proceed for whom do you speak  monsieur louis abandoned his somewhat lounging attitude he stood by spencers side and leaning down whispered in his ear spencers eyes grew bright  monsieur louis he said you play at a great game  the baron shrugged his shoulders  me he answered i am but a pawn i do what i am told  to return for a moment to laffaire poynton spencer said i am in the humor to trust you have i then your assurance that the boy and girl do not suffer  upon my own honor and the honor of the company to whom i belong he answered with some show of dignity it is a pledge which i have never yet broken  i am a bribed man spencer answered  monsieur louis threw away his second cigarette he cast a look almost of admiration upon the man who still lay stretched upon the couch  you are the only englishman i ever met monsieur spencer he said who was not pigheaded you have the tenacity of your countrymen but you have the genius to pick out the right thread from the tangle to know truth when you meet it even in unlikely places i doff my hat to you monsieur spencer if you permit i will send my own physician to you you will be yourself in a week  you know the antidote spencer remarked grimly  naturally accidents will happen you wish that i should send him  without doubt spencer answered i am weary of this couch  you shall leave it in a week monsieur promised as he left the room  spencer closed his eyes already he felt coming on the daily headache which with the terrible weakness was a part of his symptoms but there was no rest for him yet monsieur louis had scarcely been gone five minutes when duncombe arrived  duncombe had had no word of his friends illness he stood over his couch in shocked surprise  my dear fellow he exclaimed i had no idea that you were ill this is why i have not heard from you then  spencer smiled as he held out his hand and duncombe who seemed to catch some meaning in the upraised eyebrows of his friend was shocked  you mean he exclaimed  spencer nodded  laffaire poynton he said gently a very subtle dose of poison indeed my friend i shall not die but i have had my little lesson here the individual has little chance we fight against forces that are too many for us i told you so at the start  yet i duncombe answered have not suffered  my friend spencer answered it is because i am the more dangerous  you have discovered something duncombe exclaimed  i came near discovering a great deal spencer answered perhaps it would have been better for my system if i had discovered a little less as it is i have finished with laffaire poynton for the present you see how very nearly laffaire poynton finished me  it is not like you duncombe said thoughtfully to give anything up  we come face to face sometimes with unique experiences which destroy precedent spencer answered this is one of them  and what duncombe asked do you advise me to do  always the same advice spencer answered leave paris today go straight back to norfolk read the newspapers and await events  well i think that i shall do so duncombe answered slowly i have found out where miss poynton is but she will not see me i have made an enemy of my dearest friend and i have at any rate interrupted your career and endangered your life yes i will go back home  you may yet save your friend someinconvenience spencer suggested try to persuade him to go back with you  he will not listen to me duncombe answered he has brought an english detective with him and he is as obstinate as a mule for myself i leave at nine oclock  you are well advised exceedingly well advised spencer said mind i do not take the responsibility of sending you away without serious reasons i honestly believe that miss poynton is safe whatever may have happened to her brother and i believe that you will serve her best by your temporary absence  duncombe stood for a moment wrapped in thought the last few months had aged him strangely the strenuous days and nights of anxious thought had left their mark in deep lines upon his face he looked out of the window of spencers room and his eyes saw little of the busy street below he was alone once more with this strange terrified girl upon the hillside with the wind in their faces and making wild havoc in her hair he was with her in different moods in the little room behind his library when the natural joy of her young life had for the moment reasserted itself he was with her at their parting he saw half the fearful regret with which she had left his care and accepted the intervention of the marquise stirring times these had been for a man of his quiet temperament whom matters of sentiment and romance had passed lightly by and whose passions had never before been touched by the finger of fire and now he was going back to an empty lifea life at least empty of joy save the hope of seeing her again for good or for evil the great thing had found its way into his life his days of calm animal enjoyment were over sorrow or joy was to be his he had passed into the shadows of the complex life  he remembered where he was at last and turned to spencer  about yourself spencer he said have you seen a doctor  yes i am not seriously ill his friend answered the worst is over now and duncombe its hard for you to go i knowbut look here i believe that you will be back in a month and taking miss poynton to lunch chez ritz i never felt so sure of it as i do today  duncombe remembered the answer to his note and found it hard to share his friends cheerfulness     chapter viii  a political interlude   duncombe laid down his cue and strolled towards the sideboard where his guest was already mixing himself a whisky and soda  by the by runton he said have you seen anything of our friend von rothe since that little affair at your place  lord runton shook his head  not once he answered he behaved very decently about it on the whole treated it quite lightlybut he wouldnt let me go near the police it was a long way the most unpleasant thing that ever happened in my house  never any further light upon it i suppose duncombe asked  lord runton shook his head  none of course we could have traced them both without a doubt if we had put it in the hands of the police but von rothe wouldnt hear of it he tried to treat it lightly but i know that he was very much worried  do you yourself believe duncombe asked that it was a political affair or an ordinary robbery  i think that it was the former lord runton answered those people were not common adventurers by the by george have you got over your little weakness yet he added with a smile  duncombe shrugged his shoulders  nearly made a fool of myself didnt i he remarked with a levity which did not sound altogether natural  she was an uncommonly fascinating young woman lord runton said but she didnt seem to me very old at the game she was clever enough to fool von rothe though he admits that he told her that he was expecting a special messenger from berlin  duncombe seemed to have had enough of the subject he got up and filled his pipe  is jack coming down this week he asked  no he wired this morning that he cant get away sefton isnt coming either between ourselves george something seems to be going on at the foreign office which i dont understand  what do you mean duncombe asked there has been no hint at any sort of trouble in the papers  thats just what i dont understand lord runton continued it is certain that there is an extraordinary amount of activity at portsmouth and woolwich but even the little halfpenny sensational papers make no more than a passing allusion to it then look at the movements of our fleet the whole of the mediterranean fleet is at gibraltar and the channel squadron is moving up the north sea as though to join the home division all these movements are quite unusual  what do you make of them then duncombe asked  i scarcely know lord runton answered but i can tell you this there have been three cabinet councils this week and there is a curious air of apprehension in official circles in town as though something were about to happen the service clubs are almost deserted and i know for a fact that all leave in the navy has been suspended what i dont understand is the silence everywhere it looks to me as though there were really going to be trouble the baltic fleet sailed this morning you know  duncombe nodded  but he said even if they were ill disposed to us as no doubt russia is just now what could they do one squadron of our fleet could send them to the bottom  no doubt lord runton answered but supposing they found an ally  france will never go to war with us for russias benefit duncombe declared  granted lord runton answered but have you watched germanys attitude lately  i cant say that i have duncombe admitted but i should never look upon germany as a warseeking nation  no i dare say not lord runton answered nor would a great many other people every one is willing to admit that she would like our colonies but no one will believe that she has the courage to strike a blow for them i will tell you what i believe duncombe i believe that no great power has ever before been in so dangerous a position as we are in today  duncombe sat up in his chair the weariness passed from his face and he was distinctly interested lord runton without being an ardent politician was a man of commonsense and was closely connected with more than one member of the cabinet  are you serious runton he asked  absolutely remember i was in berlin for two years and i had many opportunities of gaining an insight into affairs there what i can see coming now i have expected for years there are two great factors which make for war one is the character of the emperor himself and the other the inevitable rot which must creep like a disease into a great army kept always upon a war footing through a decade or more of inactivity the emperor is shrewd enough to see this nothing can possibly exist at its best which is not used for the purpose to which it owes its existence that is why we have this flood of literature just now telling us of the gross abuses and general rottenness of the german army another five years of idleness and germanys position as the first military nation will have passed away like every other great power it is rusting for want of use the emperor knows this  duncombe for many reasons was fascinated by his friends quiet words apart from their obvious plausibility they brought with them many startling suggestions had chance he wondered really made phyllis poynton and her brother pawns in the great game he felt himself stirred to a rare emotion by the flood of possibilities which swept in suddenly upon him lord runton noted with surprise the signs of growing excitement in his listener  go on runton anything else  lord runton helped himself to a cigarette and leaned across to light it  of course he continued i know that there are a great many people who firmly believe that for commercial reasons germany would never seek a quarrel with us i will agree with them so far as to say that i do not believe that a war with england would be popular amongst the bourgeois of germany on the other hand they would be quite powerless to prevent it the emperor and his ministers have the affair in their own hands a slight break in our diplomatic relations some trifle seized hold of by the press and magnified at once into an insult and the war torch is kindled today war does not come about by the slowly growing desire of nations the threads of fate are in the hands of a few diplomatists at berlin and londona turn of the wrist and there is tension which a breath can turn either way you ask me why the emperor should choose england for attack there are many reasons first because england alone could repay him for the struggle secondly because he is intensely and miserably jealous of our own king who has avoided all his own hotheaded errors and has yet played a great and individual part in the worlds affairs thirdly because england is most easily attacked i could give you other reasons if you wanted them  quite enough duncombe answered what do you suppose would be the casus belli  the progress of the russian fleet through english waters lord runton answered promptly russias interest in such a misunderstanding would be of course immense she has only to fire on an english ship by mistake of course and the whole fat would be in the fire england probably would insist upon the squadron being detained germany would protest against any such action we might very well be at war with russia and germany within ten days russia would immediately either make terms with japan or abandon any active operations in manchuria and move upon india germany would come for us  is this all purely imagination duncombe asked or have you anything to go on  so far as i am concerned lord runton said slowly i of course know nothing but i have a strong idea that the government have at least a suspicion of some secret understanding between russia and germany their preparations seem almost to suggest it of course we outsiders can only guess after all at what is going on but it seems to me that there is a chance today for our government to achieve a diplomatic coup  in what direction  an alliance with france mind i am afraid that there are insurmountable obstacles but if it were possible it would be checkmate to our friend the emperor and he would have nothing left but to climb down the trouble is that in the absence of any definite proof of an understanding between russia and germany france could not break away from her alliance with the former our present arrangement would ensure i believe a benevolent neutrality but an alliance if only it could be compassed would be the greatest diplomatic triumph of our days hullo visitors at this hour wasnt that your frontdoor bell duncombe  it sounded like it duncombe answered perhaps it is your man  like his cheek if it is lord runton answered rising to his feet and strolling towards the sideboard i told him i would telephone round to the stables when i was ready i suppose it is rather late though i shant apologize for keeping you up  i hope you wont duncombe answered i have never been more interested in my lifefor many reasons dont bother about your man groves will see to him help yourself to another whisky and soda and come and sit down  there was a knock at the door and the butler appeared  there are three gentlemen outside sir who wish to see you he announced to duncombe they will not give their names but they say that their business is important or they would not have troubled you so late  duncombe glanced at the clock it was past midnight  three gentlemen he repeated at this time of night but where on earth have they come from groves  they did not say sir the man answered one of them i should judge to be a foreigner they have a motor car outside  lord runton held out his hand  well its time i was off anyhow he remarked come over and have lunch tomorrow dont bother about me ill stroll round to the stables and start from there good night  duncombe hesitated he was on the point of asking his friend to stay but before he could make up his mind runton had lit a cigarette and strolled away  you can show the gentlemen in here groves duncombe said  very good sir  the man disappeared duncombe after a moments hesitation crossed the room and opening an oak cupboard slipped a small revolver into his pocket     chapter ix  arrested   one of his three visitors duncombe recognized immediately it was monsieur louis of the other two one was a frenchman a somewhat sombrelooking person in a black beard and goldrimmed eyeglasses the other as unmistakably an englishman of the lower middle class his broad shoulders and somewhat stiff bearing seemed to suggest some sort of drill looking them over duncombe found himself instinctively wondering whether the personal strength of these two which was obvious might become a factor in the coming interview  the baron naturally was spokesman he bowed very gravely to duncombe and did not offer his hand  i must apologize sir george he said for disturbing you at such an inopportune hour our business however made it necessary for us to reach you with as little delay as possible  perhaps you will be good enough to explain duncombe answered what that business is  the baron raised his hands with a little protesting gesture  i regret to tell you sir george he announced that it is of a most unpleasant nature i could wish that its execution had fallen into other hands my companions are monsieur ridalle of the french detective service and our other friend here whom i do not know is a constable from the norwich police court my own connections with the police service of my country you have already without doubt surmised  go on duncombe said  i regret to say monsieur louis continued that my friends here are in charge of a warrant for your arrest you will find them possessed of all the legal documents french and english we shall have to ask you to come to norwich with us tonight  arrest duncombe repeated on what charge  an extremely serious one the baron answered gravely the charge of murder  duncombe stared at him in amazement  murder he repeated what rubbish  the murder of mademoiselle de mermillon in her lodging on the night of the seventh of june last the baron said gravely please do not make any remarks before these men the evidence against you is already sufficiently strong  duncombe laughed derisively  what sort of a puppet show is this he exclaimed you know as well as any man living how that poor girl came to her end this is a cover for something else of course what do you want of me lets get at it without wasting time  what we want of you is i am afraid only too simple the baron answered shrugging his shoulders we must ask you to accompany us at once to norwich castle you will have to appear before the magistrates in the morning when they will sign the extradition warrant our friend here monsieur ridalle will then take charge of you perhaps you would like to look through the documents you will find them all in perfect order  duncombe mechanically glanced through the french and english papers which were spread out before him they had certainly a most uncomfortable appearance of being genuine he began to feel a little bewildered  you mean to say that you have come here to arrest me on this charge that you want me to go away with you tonight he asked  it is not a matter of wanting you to come the baron answered coldly it is a matter of necessity  duncombe moved towards the fireplace  will you allow me the privilege of a few moments conversation with you in private he said to the baron your companions will perhaps excuse you for a moment  the baron followed without remark they stood facing one another upon the hearthrug duncombe leaned one elbow upon the mantlepiece and turned towards his companion  look here he said those papers seem genuine enough and if you insist upon it i will go with you to norwich i shall take care not to let you out of my sight and if when we get there i find that this is any part of one of your confounded conspiracies you will find that the penalties for this sort of thing in england are pretty severe however no doubt you are well aware of that the question is this what do you really want from me  monsieur louis who had lit a cigarette withdrew it from his mouth and examined the lighted end for a moment in silence  the documents he said are genuine you are arraigned in perfectly legal fashion upon the affidavits there the magistrates must grant the extradition warrant without hesitation we have nothing to fear in that direction  the police duncombe remarked are perfectly aware of my innocence  monsieur shrugged his shoulders  the evidence he said is remarkably convincing  policeconcocted evidence duncombe remarked would necessarily be so i admit that you hold a strong card against me i dont believe however that you have gone to all this trouble without some ulterior motive what is it what can i offer you in exchange for these documents  monsieur louis smiled  you are a man of commonsense sir george he said i will speak to you without reserve it is possible that you might be able to offer the government department of my country to which i am attached an inducement to interest themselves in your behalf mind i am not sure but if my information is correct there is certainly a possibility  the government department of your country to which you are attached duncombe repeated thoughtfully let me understand you you mean the secret service police  monsieur louis glanced a little nervously over his shoulder  never mind what i mean sir george he said quickly there are things which we do not speak of openly this much is sufficient i represent a power which can influence and direct even the criminal courts of justice of france  what bribe have i to offer you duncombe asked information you know more than i do i am afraid you have been misled  i think not monsieur louis said quickly i will tell you what we want a paper was left in your charge by miss phyllis poynton at the time she was visiting at runton place  what of it duncombe asked  the frenchmans face was suddenly tense with excitement he recovered himself almost at once but his voice shook and a new earnestness found its way into his manner  miss poynton and her brother are with us he said it is we who have been their benefactors you know a good deal of their peculiar circumstances a sudden need has arisen for the production of that paper within twentyfour hours give it to me now and i will run the greatest risk i have ever run in my career i will tear those warrants through  have you any authority from miss poynton duncombe asked  there was no time to procure it monsieur louis explained events march rapidly today to be effective that paper must be in paris tomorrow the necessity for its production arose only a few hours ago  you ask me then duncombe said slowly to hand over to you a paper which was placed in my charge by miss poynton  in effectyes  i cannot do it  monsieur louis shrugged his shoulders  i do not insist he remarked i may be permitted to remind you however that i have offered a great price  perhaps duncombe answered quietly  monsieur louis turned to his assistants  sir george duncombe will accompany us he said i can give you ten minutes sir george he added in case you care to change your clothes  and supposing i refuse to come duncombe asked  monsieur louis smiled  you would scarcely be so foolish he remarked in that case i should send the policeman here to the nearest station with the warrants and a demand for help our documents are in perfect order and our case complete you would scarcely be so foolish i think as to set yourself in direct opposition to the law  duncombe was silent for several moments then he rang the bell monsieur louis looked at him inquiringly but before he could frame a question the butler was in the room  pack my things for a week groves duncombe ordered i am going away tonight  the man bowed and withdrew monsieur louis merely shrugged his shoulders  a week he remarked you will be fortunate if you ever see your home again come sir george be reasonable i give you my word of honor that it is altogether to the interest of miss poynton that those papers be immediately produced if she were here herself she would place them in my hands without a moments hesitation  possibly duncombe answered suppositions however do not interest me i undertook the charge of what she gave me and i shall fulfil my trust  monsieur louis turned to the policeman  officer he said this is sir george duncombe do your duty  the man stepped forward and laid his hand upon sir georges shoulder  very sorry sir he said i am forced to arrest you on this warrant for the murder of florence mermillon on the night of the seventh of june you will be brought before the magistrates at norwich tomorrow  duncombe waved his hand towards the sideboard  if you gentlemen he remarked would care for a little refreshment before you start  it is against the rules sir thank you the man answered i should be glad to get away as soon as possible  duncombe filled both his pockets with cigars and cigarettes then he turned towards the door  i am quite ready he said  they followed him out there was a few minutes delay waiting for duncombes bag  your address sir george groves inquired as he brought it down  a little doubtful duncombe answered i will wire  in front please sir george monsieur louis insisted  so they drove off duncombe in the front seat the other three behind the car gathered speed rapidly in less than an hour they were halfway to norwich then suddenly the driver took a sharp corner and turned down a long desolate lane  youre off the main road duncombe explained you should have kept straight on for norwich  the man took no notice he even increased his speed duncombe was in the act of turning round when he felt the sudden swish of a wet cloth upon his face he tried to break away but he was held from behind as in a vise then his head fell back and he remembered no more     chapter x  the checkmating of monsieur louis   at three oclock in the morning groves in a discarded dressinggown of his masters opened the front door and peered cautiously out into the darkness monsieur louis who was standing upon the doorstep pushed past him into the hall  your master has sent me back to fetch some papers he announced displaying a bunch of keys i am sorry to disturb you like this but the matter is important please bring me a cup of coffee into the library in half an hour  groves who was sorely perplexed stood with his back to the door which monsieur louis had approached  really sir he answered i scarcely know what to say i am afraid that i cannot allow you to interfere with any of my masters property in his absence  monsieur louis held out the keys  quite right he said it is an awkward situation of course your master did not tell you the reason of his sudden departure i suppose  not a word sir  there can be no harm in telling you this much at any rate monsieur louis continued smoothly your master through no fault of his own got mixed up in a very unpleasant affair in paris and he will have to appear in the courts there i am his friend and wish to do all that i can to help him we have been talking the matter over and i have strongly advised him to produce some papers which i think will help him materially the police officer in whose charge he is would not allow him to return so he handed me his keys and asked me to fetch them i can assure you that i am your masters friend and wish to do all that i can to help him if he had not trusted me he would not have given me his keys which no doubt you recognize  groves reluctantly stood on one side  i suppose i must let you in sir he said but i wish that the master had sent me a line  we had neither pencil nor paper monsieur louis said and the affair was urgent i must be back in norwich by eight oclock  i will prepare the coffee sir groves said turning away if you require more light the switches are behind the door  very good monsieur louis said you need not have the slightest anxiety i am here on your masters behalf  groves hesitated and looked for a moment curiously around the room he seemed as though he had something else to say but checked himself at the last moment and withdrew monsieur louis drew a little breath of relief  he did not immediately proceed to work he threw off his overcoat and lit a cigarette his fingers were steady enough but he was conscious of an unwonted sense of excitement he was face to face with destiny he had played before for great stakes but never such as these a single false step an evil turn in the wheel of fortune spelt deathand he was afraid to die he moved to the sideboard everything there was as they had left it he poured out some brandy and drank it off  with fresh courage he moved to the safe which stood in the corner of the room it must be there if anywhere that this precious document lay he tried his keys one by one at last he found the right one the great door swung slowly open  he was spared all anxiety there on the top of a pile of legallooking documents leases titledeeds and the like was a long envelope and across it in duncombes sprawling writing these few words       entrusted to me by miss poyntonsept 4th  he grasped it in his fingers and tore open the envelope as he read the single page of closely written writing his eyes seemed almost to protrude he gave a little gasp no wonder there were those who reckoned this single page of manuscript worth a great fortune every sentence every word told its own story it was a page of the worlds history  then a strange thing happened some part of him rebelled against the instinct which prompted him carefully to fold and place in his breastpocket this wonderful find of his his nerves seemed suddenly frozen in his body there was a curious numb sensation at the back of his neck which forbade him to turn round his hands shook his teeth chattered the sweat of death was upon his forehead and despair in his heart he had heard nothing seen nothing yet he knew that he was no longer alone  when at last he turned round he turned his whole body the muscles of his neck were numbed still his knees shook and his face was ghastly monsieur louis of the café montmartre brave of tongue and gallant of bearing had suddenly collapsed monsieur louis the drugsodden degenerate of a family whose nobles had made gay the scaffolds of the place de la république cowered in his place  it was the worst upon which he looked with chattering teeth but without surprise the door of the inner room was open and upon the threshold stood toquet small dark and saturninetoquet with something which glittered in his hand so that monsieur louis already the prey of a diseased and ghastly imagination felt the pain of the bullet in his heart on an easychair by the fireside henri de bergillac was lounging with a queer smile upon his lips  my friend he said quietly though the scorn which underlay his words seemed to bite the air you have solved for us a double problem first how to account for the absence of our host and secondly how to open that very formidablelooking safe you will be so good as to place upon the table that document which you hold in your hands  for a single second monsieur louis hesitated some lingering vestige of a courage purely hereditary showed him in one lightninglike flash how at least he might carry with him to a swift grave some vestige of his ruined selfrespect a traitor to his old friends he might keep faith with the new he had time to destroy even the agonies of death might last long enough to complete the task but the impulse was only momentary he shuddered afresh at the thought that he might have yielded to it he threw it upon the table  the vicomte rose to his feet glanced through the closely written page with something of the same excitement which had inspired its recent possessor and carefully buttoned it up in his breastpocket then he turned once more to the man who stood before them broken and trembling  louis he said you are the first traitor whom our society has hatched i look upon you with curiosity as a thing i once called my friend what imbecility prompted you to this  monsieur louis found nerve to shrug his shoulders  a million francs he answered  heavens but what folly the vicomte murmured did we not all know that a german was in paris who offered a million or two million francs for the missing page of that treaty do you think that he was not watched day and night bah i have no patience to talk of this what have you done with our host  arrested him forflossie he is in a ditch halfway to norwich  hurt  no chloroformed  how did you get here  in an automobile from lynn  good it waits for you  yes  we will take it my good friend here toquet is familiar with the neighborhood as mr fielding the american millionaire you learned the excellence of these roads for quick travelling did you not mon ami so  you leave me here monsieur louis faltered  ay to rot if you will the vicomte answered with sudden harshness  i will atone monsieur louis faltered it was a single false step  de bergillac looked down upon him with unspeakable contempt  atone listen louis in this country you are safe crawl away into some hidingplace and make what you will of the rest of your days but i will promise you this if ever you set your feet upon one inch of france you shall meet with your deserts there are many things which those who play the great game must pardon but there is one crime for which no atonement is possible and you have committed it you are a traitor  de bergillac turned away the effeminacy of his manner seemed to have disappeared under the strain of his extreme anger it was his race after all which had asserted itself and then the door was thrown suddenly open and a wildlooking figure confronted them  it was duncombe muddy from head to foot pale and with a slight wound upon the temple from which the blood had trickled down his face he saw the open safe and monsieur louis a pitiful figure and he did not hesitate he scarcely glanced at the others he strode forward and seized the baron by the collar  give me back what you have stolen you blackguard he exclaimed  monsieur louis was breathless it was the young vicomte who interposed  our friend he remarked suavely has not been successful in his little effort the document he came to purloin is in my pocket and here sir george is my warrant for retaining possession of it  he held out a note which duncombe took and read with a little sigh of relief  good he exclaimed you have the document  de bergillac tapped his breastpocket  it is here he said  duncombe turned to monsieur louis  my arrest then he remarked was part of the game  exactly de bergillac answered this little document entrusted to your care by the young english lady was worth one million francs to the man who suborned our friend here it was worth whilethis little enterprise the pity of it is that it has failed sir george i go to paris tonight i offer you a safe conduct if you care to accompany me laffaire poynton does not exist any more  can you give me ten minutes to change my clothes duncombe asked eagerly  no more de bergillac answered i will get rid of our friend here  there was a knock at the door groves entered with coffee at the sight of his master he nearly dropped the tray  its all right duncombe said smiling we had a little spill and ive lost my bag pack me some more things quickly  very good sir groves answered and withdrew precipitately  de bergillac laid his hand upon duncombes arm  there is only one thing my friend he said i trust that it is mr guy poynton who is your friend and not his beautiful sister eh i am answered the misfortune never mind i will drink my coffee to les beaux yeux des autres     chapter xi  the making of history   three men were the sole occupants of the great room whose windows looked out upon the louvre  the table around which they were seated was strewn with papers and maps the door of the room was locked and a sentry stood outside in the passage the three men were busy making history  the man who occupied the seat at the head of the table was the monsieur grisson to whom guy poynton at the instigation of the duc de bergillac had told his story it was he who was spokesman  the situation he said is one which bristles with difficulties we will assume for a moment the truth of what we have certainly reasonable ground to believe russia has shown every sign of disappointment with us for our general attitude during the war our understanding with england has provoked a vigorous though unofficial protest from her representatives here since then our relations have become to a certain extent strained germany ever on the lookout for complications which might lead to her own advantage steps in her attitude towards russia is changed to one of open and profound sympathy russia in her desperate straits rises like a starving fish to a fat fly here it is that our secret service steps in  our secret serviceand her allies one of the other men murmured  exactly we pass now to the consideration of facts which need one thing only to justify our course of action evidence is brought to us that a secret meeting took place between the czar of russia and the emperor of germany from all the information which we have collected that meeting was possible i personally believe that it took place a treaty is said to have been drawn up between them having for its object the embroilment of england with russia and an alliance of germany with russia so far as regards her quarrel with england we know that germany is secretly mobilizing men and ships we know that the ambition of the emperor is to possess himself of the colonies of great britain if not actually to hold his court in london we know that his jealousy of king edward amounts to a disease we know that he is a man of daring and violent temper with an indomitable will and an unflinching belief in his own infallibility and the infallibility of his army and navy we know that he has at least a dozen schemes for a sudden attack upon england and mighty though the navy of great britain is it is not in our opinion strong enough to protect her shore from the combined baltic and german fleets and also protect her colonies england through our friendship has been warned she proposes with most flattering alacrity the only possible counterstrokean alliance with ourselves we must decide within twelve hours the treaty lies upon my desk there upon us must rest the most momentous decision which any frenchman within our recollection has been called upon to make what have you to say gentlemen  there was a short silence then the man who sat at monsieur grissons right hand spoke  the issues before us he said slowly are appalling every frenchmans blood must boil at the thought of germany greedily helping herself to the mighty wealth and power of great britainbecoming by this single masterstroke the strongest nation on earth able to dictate even to us and to send her word unchallenged throughout the world it is a hideous picture it must mean the abandonment forever of the hope of every true frenchman every minute will become a menace to us wilhelm the arrogant with british gold and british ships at his back will never forget to flaunt himself before us to our eternal humiliation  you are taking it for granted his neighbor remarked that germany will be successful  the odds are in her favor was the quiet reply the navy of great britain is immense but her sea front so to speak is enormous she is open to be the prey of a sudden swift attack and the moment has never been more favorable  let all these things be granted the third man said even then are we free to enter into this alliance with england our treaty with russia remains we have no proof that she has broken faith with us if this secret treaty between russia and germany really exists it is of course another matter but does it we have nothing but the word of an english boy the rest is all assumption the whole affair might be a nightmare we might sign this treaty with england and find afterwards that we had been the victim of a trick we should be perjured before the face of all europe and our great financial interest in russia would at once be placed in a perilous position  a telephone upon the table rang softly monsieur grisson held the receiver to his ear and listened then he rose to his feet  count von munchen desires a word with me he announced he pledges himself not to keep me more than five minutes i had better receive him excuse me gentlemen  the two men were left alone the elder and stouter of the two busied himself with an inch rule and an atlas he seemed to be making calculations as to the distance between cherbourg and a certain spot in the north sea  what is the chiefs own mind his companion asked does any one know  the other shook his head  who can say our ties of friendship with england are too recent to make this a matter of sentiment i believe that without proof he fears to accept this statement and yet above all things he fears germany there was some talk of a missing page of the actual treaty between russia and germany if this could be found i believe that he would sign the draft treaty  i myself the other said do not believe that england would be so easily overpowered  it is the suddenness and treachery of the attack which counts so greatly in its favor his companion said it might be all over in two days before she could assemble a fifth part of her forces if our information is correct germany has men enough mobilized to run huge risks besides you know how lafarges report ran and what he said the german army is beginning to suffer from a sort of dry rot as must all institutions which fulfil a different purpose than that for which they exist the emperor knows it if war does not come germany will have to face severe military troubles  i myself am for the alliance  and i the other replied if proof of this germanorussian understanding could be produced  monsieur grisson returned he carefully closed and locked the door behind him  gentlemen he said the german ambassador has just left me his mission in every way confirms our secret information he has been instructed to inquire as to our attitude in the event of any british interference with the baltic fleet while in home waters  the two men looked up expectantly monsieur grisson continued  i replied that it was a contingency which we scarcely thought it worth while to consider i expressed my firm belief that england would observe all the conventions written and understood of international law  and he  he was not satisfied of course he declared that he had certain information that england was making definite plans with a view to ensure the delay of the fleet he went on to say that germany was determined not to tolerate any such thing and he concludes that we as russias ally would at any rate remain neutral should germany think it her duty to interfere  and your reply  i answered that in the event of untoward happenings france would act as her honor dictatedremaining always mindful of the obligations of her alliance he was quite satisfied  he had no suspicion of this the young man asked touching the treaty with his forefinger  none it is believed in germany that the young englishman was really found drowned in the seine after a short career of dissipation our friends served us well here now gentlemen the english ambassador will be here in twenty minutes what am i to say to him do we sign this draft agreement or do we not  there was a silence which lasted nearly a minute then the younger of the two men spoke  sir he said respectfully without some proof of russias falsity i cannot see how in honor we can depart from our treaty obligations with her to the extent of signing an agreement with her putative enemy england must fight her own battle and god help her  and you monsieur grisson asked turning to the third man  i agree was the regretful answer if this treacherous scheme is carried out i believe that france will be face to face with the greatest crisis she has known in history even then i dare not suggest that we court dishonor by breaking an alliance with a friend in distress  you are right gentlemen monsieur grisson said with a sigh we must tell lord fothergill that our relations with his country must remain unfettered i  again the telephone bell rang monsieur grisson listened and replied with a sudden return to his old briskness of manner  it is young de bergillac he announced he has been in england in search of that missing page of the treaty i have told them to show him in  the vicomte entered paler than ever from recent travel and deeply humiliated from the fact that there was a smut upon his collar which he had had no time to remove he presented a paper to monsieur grisson and bowed the president spread it out upon the table and the faces of the three men as they read became a study monsieur grisson rang the bell  monsieur le duc de bergillac and a young english gentleman he told the attendant are in my private retiringroom desire their presence  the servant withdrew the three men looked at one another  if this is genuine the younger murmured  it is the russian official paper his visàvis declared holding it up to the light  then the duc de bergillac and guy poynton were ushered in monsieur grisson rose to his feet  monsieur poynton he said we have all three heard your story as to what you witnessed in the forest of pozen it is part of your allegation that a page of writing from the private car which you were watching was blown to your feet and that you picked it up and brought it to paris with you look at this sheet of paper carefully tell me if it is the one  guy glanced at it for a moment and handed it back  it is certainly the one he answered if you look at the back you will see my initials there and the date  monsieur grisson turned it over quickly the two other men looked over his shoulder and one of them gave a little exclamation the initials and date were there  then monsieur grisson turned once more to guy he was not a tall man but he had dignity and his presence was impressive he spoke very slowly  monsieur guy poynton he said it is not often that so great an issuethat the very destinies of two great countries must rest upon the simple and uncorroborated story of one man yet that is the position in which we stand today do not think that you are being treated with distrust i speak to you not on behalf of myself but for the millions of human beings whose welfare is my care and for those other millions of your own countrymen whose interests must be yours i ask you solemnlyis this story of yours word for word a true one  guy looked him in the face resolutely and answered without hesitation  on my honor as an englishman he declared it is true  monsieur grisson held out his hand  thank you he said  the three men were again alone the man who controlled the destinies of france dipped his pen in the ink  gentlemen he said do you agree with me that i shall sign this draft  we do they both answered  the president signed his name then he turned the handle of the telephone  you may show lord fothergill in he ordered     chapter xii  an old friend   it was perhaps as well for andrew pelham that he could not see phyllis look as she entered the room an english gentleman she had been told was waiting to see her and she had thought of no one but duncombe it was true that she had sent him away but only an hour ago the marquise had told her that her emancipation was close at hand he too might have had a hint the little smile however died away from her lips as she saw who was waiting for her with such manifest impatience  you andrew she exclaimed in amazement why however did you find me out  he took both her hands in his the look upon his face was transfiguring  at last at last he exclaimed never mind how i found you tell me what does it all mean are you here of your own free will  absolutely she answered  it was you at runton  yes  under a false namewith a man who committed robbery  she shrugged her shoulders a little wearily  my dear andrew she said i will admit that i have been doing all manner of incomprehensible things i couldnt explain everything it would take too long what i did i did for guys sake and of my own free will it will be all over in a day or two now and we shall be coming back to raynesworth then i will tell you tales of our adventures which will make your hair stand on end  it isnt true about guy then he exclaimed  she hesitated for a moment  andrew she said i cannot tell you anything it must sound rather horrid of me but i cannot help it i want you to go away in a day or two i will write  he looked at her in pained bewilderment  but phyllis he protested i am one of your oldest friends you ask me to go away and leave you here with strangers without a word of explanation why i have been weeks searching for you  andrew she said i know it i dont want to be unkind i dont want you to think that i have forgotten that you are as you say one of my oldest friends but there are times when ones friends are a source of danger rather than pleasure frankly this is one of them  his face darkened he looked slowly around the magnificent room he saw little but what he could distinguish was impressive  your riddles he said gravely are hard to read you want me to go away and leave you here  you must she said firmly  did you treat duncombe like this he asked in a blind fit of jealousy  you have not the right to ask me such a question she answered coldly  not the right not the right he repeated who else has then havent i watched you grow from a beautiful capricious child into the woman you are havent i taught you played with you done your bidding blindly ever since you came into your kingdom havent i felt the pain and the joy of you in my heart who else has a better right then duncombe who came here a stranger to youor is it one of your new friends  she came close to him and laid her hand upon his shoulder  dont be foolish andrew she said softly  his whole expression changed the bitterness left his tone  ah phyllis he said that is more like yourself  and i want you she said to be like your old self you have always been my best friend andrew i hope you will always be that  he tried to look into her face it seemed to him that there was a little unnecessary emphasis in her words  i am not a child now you know she continued i am quite old enough to take care of myself you must believe that andrew you must go away and not worry about me you will do this please because i ask you  if i must he said reluctantly i will go away but not to worry about youthat is impossible you seem to be surrounded by all the mediæval terrors which confronted the emancipation of princesses in our fairy books only a short time ago duncombe implored me to follow his example and leave you and paris alone the detective whom i brought with me has been shadowed ever since we left paris last night he left me for a few hours and this morning comes a note from the hospital he is lying there with the back of his head beaten ingarotters of course the police say looking for plunder how can you ask me to be easy in my mind about you  she smiled reassuringly  no harm will come to me here i can promise you she said it is you who run the most risk if you only knew it sir george duncombe gave you the best advice when he tried to get you to return to england  i cannot leave lloyd now until he has recovered andrew answered tell me phyllis has duncombe found you out has he been here  yes she answered i sent him awayas i am sending you  has he ever told you andrew asked why he was willing in the first instance to come to paris in search of you  no she answered wasnt it because he was your friend  he shook his head  it is his affair not mine he said with a sigh ask him some day  you wont tell me andrew  no i will go now you know where to send for me if you should need help i can find my way down thank you i have a guide from the hotel outside  the marquise swept into the room as he passed out an impression of ermine and laces and perfume  another of your english lovers ma belle she asked  scarcely that phyllis answered he is a very old friend and he was rather hard to get rid of  i think the marquise said you would get rid of all very willingly for the sake of one eh  the marquise stared insolently into the girls face phyllis only laughed  one is usually considered the ideal numberin our country she remarked demurely  but the one the marquise continued he would not be one of these cold heavy countrymen of yours no you have learnt better perhaps over here  it was a crossexamination but phyllis could not imagine its drift  i have not had very much opportunity over here have i to amend my ideals she asked i think the only two frenchmen i have met are the marquis and that languid young man with the green tie the vicomte de bergillac wasnt it  the marquise watched her charge closely  well she said he is comme il faut is he not you find him more elegant more chic than your englishmen eh  phyllis shook her head regretfully  to me she admitted he seemed like an exceedingly precocious spoilt child  he is twentythree the marquise declared  phyllis laughed softly  well she said i do not think that i shall amend my ideals for the sake of the vicomte de bergillac  the marquise looked at her doubtfully  tell me child she said you mean then that of the twoyour english sir george duncombe and henriyou would prefer sir george  phyllis looked at her with twinkling eyes  you would really like to know she asked  yes  sir george duncombeinfinitely  the marquise seemed to have recovered her good spirits  come little one she said you lose color in the house i will take you for a drive                                       andrew conscious that he was being followed sat down outside a café on his way homewards and bade his guide leave him for a little time instantly there was the soft rustle of feminine skirts by his side and a woman seated herself on the next chair  monsieur has not been up to the café montmartre lately  pelham turned his head it was the young lady from vienna  no he answered i have not been there since i had the pleasure of seeing mademoiselle  monsieur has discovered all that he wanted to know  he nodded a little wearily  yes i think so  she drew her chair quite close to his the sable of her turban hat almost brushed his cheek and the perfume of the violets at her bosom was strong in his nostrils  monsieur has seen the young lady  i have seen her he answered  monsieur is indebted to me she said softly for some information let me ask him one question is it true this story in the newspapers of the finding of this young mans body is monsieur guy poynton really dead  i know no more than we all read in the newspapers he answered  his sister spoke of him as dead she asked  i cannot discuss this matter with you mademoiselle he answered  monsieur is ungrateful she declared with a little grimace it is only that which i desire to know he was such a beau garçon that young englishman you will tell me that she whispered  he shook his head  mademoiselle will excuse me he said i am going to take a carriage to my hotel  it is on the way to leave me at my rooms if you will be so kind she suggested laying her hand upon his arm  mademoiselle will excuse me he answered turning away good afternoon  mademoiselle also took a carriage and drove to a large house at the top of the champs Élysées she was at once admitted and passed with the air of one familiar with the place into a small room at the back of the house where a man was sitting at a table writing he looked up as she entered  well  she threw herself into a chair  i have been following the englishman pelham all day she said in german he has seen miss poynton i have talked with him since at a café but he would tell me nothing he has evidently been warned  the man grumbled as he resumed his writing  that fact alone should be enough for us he remarked if there is anything to conceal we can guess what it is these amateurs who are in league with the secret service are the devil i would as soon resign what with them and the regular secret service paris is an impossible city for us where we would watch we are watched ourselves the streets and cafés bristle with spies i do not wonder that you find success so difficult mademoiselle  i havent done so badly she protested  no for you have not been set easy tasks can you tell me though where that young englishman disappeared to when he left the café montmartre before your very eyes can you tell me whether the secret service got hold of his story how much the french government believed of it whether they have communicated with the english government and how much they know beyond these things it is not your province to see or mine mademoiselle and it is not for us to guess at or inquire into the meaning of things tell me is it worth while to have this man pelham put out of the way for a time  she shook her head  i do not think so she answered he is quite stupid the other sir george duncombe he was different if he had stayed in paris he would have been worth watching  a bell rang the man rose  the chief he said be at the café tonight  mademoiselle went away thoughtfully  it is over this affair she said to herself carl knows everything     chapter xiii  a newspaper sensation   spencer whose recovery during the last few days had been as rapid as the first development of his indisposition had just changed for dinner and was lighting a cigarette dappertit when without waiting to be announced the vicomte de bergillac entered the room spencer with lightninglike intuition knew that his time was come  off with your coat man and get your code books out i am going to give you the most sensational story which has ever appeared in your paper he exclaimed only remember this it must appear tomorrow morning i am arranging for the french papers to have it yours shall be the only english journal glance through these sheets they contain the story of laffaire poynton  spencer was master of the gist of the thing in a very few moments his eyes were bright with excitement  who guarantees this he asked quickly  my uncle has signed it henri de bergillac answered and at the bottom of the page there you will see a still more distinguished signature you understand laffaire poynton now it is very simple that english boy actually witnessed a meeting between the czar and the emperor and turns up in paris with a loose sheet of a treaty between the two relative to an attack upon england our people got hold of him at the café montmartre and we have hidden him away ever since our friends the germans who seem to have had some suspicions about him have filled the city with spies but from the first we have kept them off the scent we had a little difficulty in convincing our friends your countrypeople but we managed to borrow a few papers from the german ambassador whilst he was staying at a countryhouse in england which were sufficient  spencer was already writing his coat lay on the floor where he had thrown it  dont go for a moment de bergillac he said i want to ask you a few things i can talk and code at the same time what about miss poynton  well we had to take care of her too de bergillac said of course all her inquiries over here would have led to nothing but they knew her at the english embassy so we walked her off from the café montmartre one night and took her to a friend of mine the marquise de st ethol we told her a little of the truth and a little im afraid which was an exaggeration anyhow we kept her quiet and we got her to go to england for us with toquet they had a very narrow shave down at runton by the by  after this spencer said with a smile the secret service people proper will have to look to their laurels it is a triumph for the amateurs  the vicomte twirled his tiny black moustache  yes he said we have justified ourselves it has cost us something though  you mean  louis  spencer stopped writing  it was an affair of a million francs the vicomte said i hope he has got the money  spencer resumed his work  the baron a traitor he exclaimed where is he  in england we are not vindictive if the germans paid him a million francs they got nothing for it he has been watched from the first we knew of it the moment he came to terms with them he only knows bare facts nothing beyond he is going to brazil i think we shall not interfere  tell me why spencer said you were so down on all of us who joined in the search for the poyntons  we could not afford to run any risks of your discovering a clue de bergillac answered because you in your turn were closely watched by german spies hoping to discover them through you that is why we had to strike hard at all of you who interfered i was sorry for little flossiebut she knew the risk she ran we had to stop you induce duncombe to leave paris and knock on the head a fool of an english detective for fear he might discover something monsieur pelham was getting into danger but of course it is all over now tomorrow we are bringing guy into paris  spencer nodded  where is duncombe he asked  back in paris de bergillac answered arrived here with me today he is much in love with the beautiful sister alas it was to him that she entrusted the missing page of that treaty which she found in her brothers luggage some day i must tell you of my adventures in england last night when i went over to get it and found louis a little ahead of me  some day spencer murmured writing for dear life with the perspiration streaming down his forehead my dear vicomte do you mind ringing the bell i want my servant i must telegraph my paper to warn them of this they must clear two columns of type for me  the vicomte did as he was asked then he turned towards the door  i will leave you he said the dust of england is still in my throat absinthe a bath and dinner au revoir mon ami confess that i have kept the promise which louis made you it is what you call a coup this eh  out on the boulevards the papers were selling like wildfire the vicomte bought one and sitting down outside a café ordered absinthe the great headlines attracted him at once he sipped his absinthe and smiled to himself  the play commences he murmured i must return to monsieur spencer  spencer was still working like a madman  i must interrupt you for a moment de bergillac said i have brought you an evening paper the baltic fleet has sunk half a dozen english fishingboats and the whole country is in a frenzy it is the beginning  spencer nodded  leave the paper theres a good fellow he said i will look it through presently if there is timeif there is only time this will be the greatest night of my life no other paper has a hint you say  not one  if i could put back the clock a single hour spencer muttered never mind williams more sheets  de bergillac took his leave he had telephoned for his motor which was waiting outside he gave the order to drive to his rooms on the way he passed the great pile of buildings in the louvre in a room at the extreme end of the pile a light was burning de bergillac looked at it curiously a small brougham which he recognized stood outside  if one could see inside he muttered it should be interesting                                       in a sense it was interesting monsieur grisson sat there in front of his open table his secretarys place by his side was vacant opposite sat a tall man with gray hair and dark moustache he was dressed for the evening and his breast glittered with stars and orders  it is exceedingly kind of you monsieur he said to grant me this interview at so short notice i was most anxious to apprise you of news which as yet i believe has not found its way into your papers you have read accounts of a russian attack upon an english fishingfleet but you have not yet been informed of the presencethe undoubted presenceof japanese torpedoboats concealed amongst them  monsieur grisson raised his eyebrows  indeed no he answered we have not even heard a rumor of anything of the sort  nevertheless their presence was indubitable the prince declared in those circumstances monsieur you can doubtless understand that our reply to any protests on the part of england will be of an unpacific nature we should not for a moment allow ourselves to be dictated to by the allies of our enemy  naturally monsieur grisson answered on the other hand you surely do not wish to embroil yourself in a quarrel with england at the present moment  we wish to quarrel with no one the prince answered haughtily at the same time we are not afraid of england we recognize the fact that if war should come it is an independent affair and does not come under the obligations of our alliance we ask therefore for your neutrality alone  monsieur grisson bowed  but prince he said gravely you speak lightly enough of the possibilities of war but surely you must know that the english fleet in the channel and at gibraltar altogether outmatches the baltic fleet  a russian the prince answered grandly is not afraid of great odds  monsieur grisson bowed  for the sake of humanity he said i trust most sincerely that the affair may be peaceably arranged if the contrary should turn out to be the case i can only say that in a quarrel which concerns russia and england alone france would remain benevolently neutral as you have remarked the obligations of our treaty do not apply to such a case  the prince played nervously with the star at his chest both men were well aware that up to now they had been merely playing with words  there is another contingency the russian remarked which now we are upon the subject it would perhaps be as well to allude to the relations between germany and england as you know just now are very sorely strained if germany should take advantage of the present situation to make a demonstration against england that of course would not from your point of view affect the situation  monsieur grisson looked like a man who sees before him amazing things  my dear prince he said do not let us misunderstand one another you cannot by any possibility be suggesting that germany might associate herself with you in your resistance to possible english demands  the russian leaned back in his chair  germany is on the spot he remarked and knows the fact of the case she has proofs of the presence of japanese torpedoboats amongst the english fishingfleet her natural love of fair play might possibly lead her to espouse our cause in this particular instance this of course would make for peace if germany commands england will obey she could not do otherwise  you have introduced my dear prince monsieur grisson said an altogether new phase of this question and one which merits the most grave consideration am i to understand that there is any arrangement between germany and yourself with respect to this question  scarcely anything so definite as an arrangement the prince answered merely an understanding  monsieur grisson had the air of a man who had just received grave tidings of his dearest friend  is this monsieur le prince he said entirely in accord with our own treaty obligations  we do not consider it to be in contravention to them the prince answered  the gravity of monsieur grissons manner grew even more pronounced  my dear prince he said you are doubtless aware that during the last few weeks there have been some very strange rumors about as to a meeting between your master and the emperor of germany and an agreement which was forthwith signed between them i need not remark that all such rumors were entirely discredited here such a meeting kept secret from us would of course be very seriously considered here  the prince smiled he remained admirably selfpossessed though the very veins in his forehead were swollen with anger  a canard of the sort has reached my ears he remarked some english boy i believe imagined or dreamed that he saw some such meeting we scarcely need i think to discuss this seriously  personally i agree with you monsieur grisson said smoothly my ministry however seem to have been a little impressed by the boys story an autograph letter from the czar denying it would perhaps make our negotiations more easy  it shall be forthcoming the prince remarked rising by the by i hear reports of great activity from cherbourg more manoeuvres eh  monsieur grisson shrugged his shoulders  our new naval chief he remarked is a marvel of industry you know the english proverb about the new broom eh  the prince bowed  during the next few hours he remarked many things may happen you will be always accessible  i shall not leave my post prince monsieur grisson answered you will find me here at any time     chapter xiv  the man who saved his country   on the following morning the inhabitants of london paris berlin and st petersburg for a sum varying from a halfpenny to a penny were treated to sensationalism as thrilling as any sixshilling shocker hot from the press and assured of its halfmillion circulation one english and one french newspaper outdid their competitors by publishing side by side with their account of the exploits of the russian fleet a marvellous but circumstantial story of a meeting and alliance between the rulers of germany and russia the eyes of the whole world were turned towards kiel and more wonderful rumors still flashed backwards and forwards along the wires throughout europe a great mobilization can be kept secret up to a certain point but when men and ships are collected and ready the truth must out  at an unusually early hour monsieur grisson supported now by two members of his ministry received a visit from the russian and german ambassadors prince korndoff and count von munchen the usual compliments were quickly exchanged  i have asked my friend count von munchen to accompany me prince korndoff explained because we are here to speak with you on a matter concerning which our interests are identical you have read the demands which england has dared to lay before my master with reference to the encounter in the north sea  monsieur grisson bowed  i have studied them with great interest he admitted  i do not need tell you then that they are scouted with indignation by my master and his advisers the prince answered neither shall we permit for a single moment the detention of our fleet upon its mission  that means then war with england monsieur grisson remarked quietly  unless they instantly withdraw their insolent demandsundoubtedly the prince answered  monsieur grisson turned to the german  and you count he asked how does this concern you  we also the count answered consider the demands of england unwarrantable we believe that there were undoubtedly japanese torpedo boats concealed amongst the english fishing fleet and we consider that the action of the admiral in command of the russian fleet was fully justified  you are prepared then to give russia your moral support the president asked  we are prepared to do more the count answered boldly if england persists in her demands we are prepared to demonstrate against her  monsieur grisson assumed a very grave expression  i too he said have lost no time in endeavoring to solve the mystery of this north sea incident i have been in communication with the english ambassador and i have collected all the evidence possible there is absolutely no proof obtainable of the presence of any japanese craft amongst the english fishing fleet i submit therefore that this is a case for arbitration i consider that up to the present our friends on the other side of the channel have displayed commendable moderation in a time of great excitement and i am happy to say that i have the authority of lord fothergill himself for saying that they will consent to submitting the affair to a commission of arbitration  the presidents words were received with chilling silence it was the prince who after a short silence replied  arbitration he said coldly does not commend itself to us we have been insulted our country and our gallant fleet have been held up to ridicule throughout the whole english press we are tired of being dictated to and bullied by a weaker powerthe openly declared ally of our enemy england has long been seeking for a casus belli with us at last she has found it  monsieur grisson whispered for a moment to one of his colleagues then he turned once more to the prince  let us understand one another monsieur le prince he said and you count von munchen you have come to announce to me your intention to jointly make war upon england st petersburg is to refuse her demands england will naturally strike at the baltic fleet and germany will send her fleet to the rescue and at the same time land troops somewhere in the north of england russia i presume will withdraw her troops from manchuria and strike at india  no no count von munchen protested i can assure you monsieur it is not our intention to land a single german soldier in england we are interested only to see fair play to russia we require that the baltic fleet shall be allowed to go on its way without molestation  the president faced the last speaker his gray bushy eyebrows met in a frown  then what count he asked is the meaning of the mobilization of two hundred thousand men at kiel what is the meaning of your state railroads running west being closed last night to all public traffic why have you cabled huge orders for government supplies why were you running trains all last night to the coast do you suppose that our secret service slumbersthat we are a nation of babies  the count made an effort to retain his composure  monsieur le président he said the reports which have reached you have been much exaggerated it is necessary for us to back up our protests to england by a show of force  monsieur grisson smiled  enough of this gentlemen he said we will now talk to one another as men who have weighty affairs to deal with simply and directly the story of the meeting between your two rulers which you prince korndoff have alluded to as a fairy tale was a perfectly true one i have known of that meeting some time and i have certain proof of what transpired at it the north sea incident was no chance affair it was a deliberately and skilfully arranged casus belli although your admiral prince korndoff had to go one hundred miles out of his way to find the dogger bank fishingfleet you spoke to me last night of cherbourg prince i think that after all your secret service is scarcely so successful as mine for i can assure you that you will find there all that is to be found today at kiel  the prince was amazed  but monsieur le président he exclaimed you cannot meanyou our ally  the president extended a forefinger  it was no part of our alliance he said sternly that you should make a secret treaty with another power and keep hidden from us no less a scheme than the invasion of england my cabinet have dealt with this matter on its own merits i have the honor to tell you gentlemen that i have concluded an alliance with england to come into effect in the case of your carrying out your present intention for every army corps you succeed in landing in england i too shall land one only i think with less difficulty and for every german ship which clears for action in the north sea two french ones will be prepared to meet her  i think monsieur le président he said stiffly that this discussion had better be postponed until after i have had an opportunity of communicating with my imperial master i must confess sir that your attitude is a complete surprise to me  as you will sir the president answered i am perhaps more a man of affairs than a diplomatist and i have spoken to you with less reserve than is altogether customary but i shall never believe that diplomacy which chooses the dark and tortuous ways of intrigue and misrepresentation is best calculated to uphold and strengthen the destinies of a great nation i wish you good morning gentlemen                                       for fortyeight hours the war fever raged and the pendulum swung backwards and forwards the cables between berlin and st petersburg were never idle there was a rumor amongst those behind the scenes of an enormous bribe offered to france in return for her neutrality alone its instantaneous and scornful refusal practically brought the crisis to an end the german hosts melted away and the baltic fleet passed on st petersburg accepted the british demands and a commission of arbitration was appointed henri de bergillac read out the news from the morning paper and yawned  cest finilaffaire poynton he remarked you can get ready as soon as you like guy i am going to take you into paris to your sister  guy looked up eagerly  my pardon he asked  the vicomte made a wry face  heavens he exclaimed i forgot that there were still explanations to make fill your abominable pipe mon ami and think that tomorrow or the next day you may be in your beloved england think how well we have guarded you here when a dozen men were loose in paris who would have killed you on sight remember that in the underground history of england you will be known always as the man who saved his country i shouldnt wonder in the least if you werent decorated when you get home think of all these thingshard  all right guy answered go ahead  you never killed any one the duel was a fake you werenot exactly sober that was entirely our fault and we had to invent some plan to induce you to come into hiding peacefully voilà tout it is forgiven  guy laughed a great laugh of relief  rather he exclaimed what an ass i must have seemed asking that old johnny for a pardon  the vicomte smiled  the old johnny guy was the president of france he wanted to know afterwards what the devil you meant  guy rose to his feet  if you tell me anything else he said i shall want to punch your head  the vicomte laughed  come he said i will return you to your adorable sister     chapter xv  a merry meeting   monsieur albert was not often surprised and still less often did he show it the party however who trooped cheerily into his little restaurant at something after midnight on this particular morning succeeded in placing him at a disadvantage  first there was the vicomte de bergillac one of his most important and influential patrons for many reasons whose presence alone was more than sufficient guarantee for whoever might follow then there was the marquise de st ethol one of the haute noblesse to welcome whom was a surpassing honor  and then monsieur guy poynton the young english gentleman whose single appearance here a few weeks back had started all the undercurrents of political intrigue and who for the justification of french journalism should at that moment have been slowly dying at the morgue  and with him the beautiful young english lady who had come in search of him and who as she had left the place in the small hours of the morning with monsieur louis should certainly not now have reappeared as charming and as brilliant as ever her eyes soft with happiness and her laugh making music more wonderful than the violins of his little orchestra  and following her the broadshouldered young englishman sir george duncombe who had once entertained a very dangerous little party in his private room upstairs and against whom the dictum had gone forth  and following him the englishman with the heavy glasses whom laffaire poynton had also brought before to his café and with whom mademoiselle from austria had talked long and earnestly  and lastly monsieur spencer the english journalist also with a black cross after his name but seemingly altogether unconscious of it  monsieur albert was not altogether at his best such a mixture of sheep and goats confused him it was the vicomte who together with the head waiter arranged a redistribution of tables so that the whole party could sit together it was the vicomte who constituted himself host he summoned monsieur albert to him  albert he said with a little wave of the hand these ladies and gentlemen are my friends to quote the words of my charming young companion here monsieur guy poynton whom you may possibly remembermonsieur albert bowedwe are on the bust i do not know the precise significance of the phrase any more than i suppose you do but it means amongst other things a desire for the best you have to eat and to drink bring pomeroy 92 albert and send word to your chef that we desire to eat without being hungry  monsieur albert hurried away glad of the opportunity to escape guy leaned back in his chair and looked around with interest  same old place he remarked and by jove theres the young lady from austria  the young lady from austria paid her bill and departed somewhat hastily the vicomte smiled  i think we shall frighten a few of them away tonight he remarked the wine good we shall need magnums to drown our regrets if indeed our english friends desert us tomorrow monsieur guy poynton unconscious maker of history and savior of your country i congratulate you upon your whole skin and i drink your health  guy drank and laughing refilled his glass  and to you the best of amateur conspirators and most charming of hosts he said come soon to england and bring your automobile and we will conspire against you with a policeman and a stopwatch  the vicomte sighed and glanced towards phyllis  in happier circumstances he murmured and then catching the marquises eye he was silent  the band played english music and the chef sent them up a wonderful omelette mademoiselle ermine from the folies bergères danced in the small space between the tables and the vicomte buying a cluster of pink roses from the flowergirl sent them across to her with a diamond pin in the ribbon the marquise rebuked him half seriously but he only laughed  tonight he said is the end of a great adventure we amateurs have justified our existence tonight i give away all that i choose ah angèle he murmured in her dainty little ear if i had but a heart to give  she flashed a quick smile into his face but her forehead was wrinkled  you have lost it to the young english miss she is beautiful but so cold  do you think so he whispered look  phyllis was seated next duncombe and he too was whispering something in her ear the look with which she answered him told all that there was to know the marquise who had intercepted it shrugged her shoulders  it is not worth while my friend that you break your heart she murmured for that one can see is an affair arranged  he nodded  after all he said the true frenchman loves only in his own country  or in any other where he may chance to be she answered drily never mind henri i shall not let you wander very far your supperparty has been delightfulbut you see the time  they trooped down the narrow stairs laughing and talking duncombe and phyllis came last and their hands met for an instant behind the burly commissionaire  until tomorrow  until tomorrow she echoed softly as he handed her into the electric coupé  andrew and he drove down the hill together duncombe was a little ill at ease  there is one thing andrew he said which i should like to say to you i want you to remember the night in your garden when you asked me to come to paris for you  yes  i warned you didnt i i knew that it would come and it has  andrew smiled in gentle scorn  my dear duncombe he said why do you think it necessary to tell me a thing so glaringly apparent i have nothing to blame you for it was a foolish dream of mine which i shall easily outlive for george this has been a great day for me i believe that my time for dreams has gone by  duncombe turned towards him with interest  what do you mean andrew  i have been to see foudroye the great oculist he has examined my eyes carefully and he assures me positively that my eyesight is completely sound in two months time i shall see as well as any one  duncombes voice shook with emotion he grasped his friends hand  that is goodmagnificent andrew he declared  their carriage rattled over the cobbled stones as they crossed the square the white mysterious dawn was breaking over paris andrew threw his head back with a laugh  back into the world george where dreams are only the cobwebs of time and a mans work grows beneath his hands like a living statue to the immortals i feel my hands upon it and the great winds blowing thank god   the end                                          transcribers note  the following typographical error was corrected in the text
