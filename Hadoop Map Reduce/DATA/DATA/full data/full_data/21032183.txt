prickly bushes full of stumps odd rootends and spikes but since they were strictly forbidden palaces of delight and for the fifth summer in succession stalky mcturk and beetle this was before they reached the dignity of a study had built like beavers a place of retreat and meditation where they smoked  now there was nothing in their characters as known to mr prout their housemaster at all commanding respect nor did foxy the subtle redhaired school sergeant trust them his business was to wear tennisshoes carry binoculars and swoop hawklike upon evil boys had he taken the field alone that hut would have been raided for foxy knew the manners of his quarry but providence moved mr prout whose schoolname derived from the size of his feet was hoofer to investigate on his own account and it was the cautious stalky who found the track of his pugs on the very floor of their lair one peaceful afternoon when stalky would fain have forgotten prout and his works in a volume of surtees and a new briarwood pipe crusoe at sight of the footprint did not act more swiftly than stalky he removed the pipes swept up all loose matchends and departed to warn beetle and mcturk  but it was characteristic of the boy that he did not approach his allies till he had met and conferred with little hartopp president of the natural history society an institution which stalky held in contempt hartopp was more than surprised when the boy meekly as he knew how begged to propose himself beetle and mcturk as candidates confessed to a longsmothered interest in firstflowerings early butterflies and new arrivals and volunteered if mr hartopp saw fit to enter on the new life at once being a master hartopp was suspicious but he was also an enthusiast and his gentle little soul had been galled by chanceheard remarks from the three and specially beetle so he was gracious to that repentant sinner and entered the three names in his book  then and not till then did stalky seek beetle and mcturk in their house formroom they were stowing away books for a quiet afternoon in the furze which they called the wuzzy  all up said stalky serenely i spotted heffys fairy feet round our hut after dinner blessing theyre so big  confound did you hide our pipes said beetle  oh no left em in the middle of the hut of course what a blind ass you are beetle dyou think nobody thinks but yourself well we cant use the hut any more hoofer will be watchin it  bother likewise blow said mcturk thoughtfully unpacking the volumes with which his chest was cased the boys carried their libraries between their belt and their collar nice job this means were under suspicion for the rest of the term  why all that heffy has found is a hut he and foxy will watch it its nothing to do with us only we mustnt be seen that way for a bit  yes and where else are we to go said beetle you chose that place tooanan i wanted to read this afternoon  stalky sat on a desk drumming his heels on the form  youre a despondin brute beetle sometimes i think i shall have to drop you altogether did you ever know your uncle stalky forget you yet his rebus infectisafter id seen heffys mantracks marchin round our hut i found little hartoppdestricto ensewavin a butterflynet i conciliated hartopp told him that youd read papers to the bughunters if hed let you join beetle told him you liked butterflies turkey anyhow i soothed the hartoffles and were bughunters now  whats the good of that said beetle  oh turkey kick him  in the interests of science bounds were largely relaxed for the members of the natural history society they could wander if they kept clear of all houses practically where they chose mr hartopp holding himself responsible for their good conduct  beetle began to see this as mcturk began the kicking  im an ass stalky he said guarding the afflicted part pax turkey im an ass  dont stop turkey isnt your uncle stalky a great man  great man said beetle  all the same bughuntins a filthy business said mcturk how the deuce does one begin  this way said stalky turning to some fags lockers behind him fags are dabs at natural history heres young braybrookes botanycase he flung out a tangle of decayed roots and adjusted the slide gives one no end of a professional air i think heres clay minors geological hammer beetle can carry that turkey youd better covet a butterflynet from somewhere  im blowed if i do said mcturk simply with immense feeling beetle give me the hammer  all right im not proud chuck us down that net on top of the lockers stalky  thats all right its a collapsible jamboree too beastly luxurious dogs these fags are built like a fishinrod pon my sainted sam but we look the complete bughunters now listen to your uncle stalky were goin along the cliffs after butterflies very few chaps come there were goin to leg it too youd better leave your book behind  not much said beetle firmly im not goin to be done out of my fun for a lot of filthy butterflies  then youll sweat horrid youd better carry my jorrocks twont make you any hotter  they all sweated for stalky led them at a smart trot west away along the cliffs under the furzehills crossing combe after gorzy combe they took no heed to flying rabbits or fluttering fritillaries and all that turkey said of geology was utterly unquotable  are we going to clovelly he puffed at last and they flung themselves down on the short springy turf between the drone of the sea below and the light summer wind among the inland trees they were looking into a combe half full of old high furze in gay bloom that ran up to a fringe of brambles and a dense wood of mixed timber and hollies it was as though onehalf the combe were filled with golden fire to the cliffs edge the side nearest to them was open grass and fairly bristled with noticeboards  feerocious old cove this said stalky reading the nearest prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law g m dabney col jp an all the rest of it dont seem to me that any chap in his senses would trespass here does it  youve got to prove damage fore you can prosecute for anything cant prosecute for trespass said mcturk whose father held many acres in ireland thats all rot  glad of that cause this looks like what we wanted not straight across beetle you blind lunatic anyone could spot us half a mile off this way and furl up your beastly butterflynet  beetle disconnected the ring thrust the net into a pocket shut up the handle to a twofoot stave and slid the canering round his waist stalky led inland to the wood which was perhaps a quarter of a mile from the sea and reached the fringe of the brambles  now we can get straight down through the furze and never show up at all said the tactician beetle go ahead and explore snf snf beastly stink of fox somewhere  on all fours save when he clung to his spectacles beetle wormed into the gorse and presently announced between grunts of pain that he had found a very fair foxtrack this was well for beetle since stalky pinched him a tergo down that tunnel they crawled it was evidently a highway for the inhabitants of the combe and to their inexpressible joy ended at the very edge of the cliff in a few square feet of dry turf walled and roofed with impenetrable gorse  by gum there isnt a single thing to do except lie down said stalky returning a knife to his pocket look here  he parted the tough stems before him and it was as a window opened on a far view of lundy and the deep sea sluggishly nosing the pebbles a couple of hundred feet below they could hear young jackdaws squawking on the ledges the hiss and jabber of a nest of hawks somewhere out of sight and with great deliberation stalky spat on to the back of a young rabbit sunning himself far down where only a cliffrabbit could have found foothold great gray and black gulls screamed against the jackdaws the heavyscented acres of bloom round them were alive with lownesting birds singing or silent as the shadow of the wheeling hawks passed and returned and on the naked turf across the combe rabbits thumped and frolicked  whew what a place talk of natural history this is it said stalky filling himself a pipe isnt it scrumptious good old sea he spat again approvingly and was silent  mcturk and beetle had taken out their books and were lying on their stomachs chin in hand the sea snored and gurgled the birds scattered for the moment by these new animals returned to their businesses and the boys read on in the rich warm sleepy silence  hullo heres a keeper said stalky shutting handley cross cautiously and peering through the jungle a man with a gun appeared on the skyline to the east confound him hes going to sit down  hed swear we were poachin too said beetle whats the good of pheasants eggs theyre always addled too  might as well get up to the wood i think said stalky we dont want g m dabney col jp to be bothered about us so soon up the wuzzy and keep quiet he may have followed us you know  beetle was already far up the tunnel they heard him gasp indescribably there was the crash of a heavy body leaping through the furze  aie yeou little red rascal i see yeou the keeper threw the gun to his shoulder and fired both barrels in their direction the pellets dusted the dry stems round them as a big fox plunged between stalkys legs and ran over the cliffedge  they said nothing till they reached the wood torn disheveled hot but unseen  narrow squeak said stalky ill swear some of the pellets went through my hair  did you see him said beetle i almost put my hand on him wasnt he a wopper didnt he stink hullo turkey whats the matter are you hit  mcturks lean face had turned pearly white his mouth generally half open was tight shut and his eyes blazed they had never seen him like this save once in a sad time of civil war  do you know that that was just as bad as murder he said in a grating voice as he brushed prickles from his head  well he didnt hit us said stalky i think it was rather a lark here where are you going  im going up to the house if there is one said mcturk pushing through the hollies i am going to tell this colonel dabney  are you crazy hell swear it served us jolly well right hell report us itll be a public lickin oh turkey dont be an ass think of us  you fool said mcturk turning savagely dyou suppose im thinkin of us its the keeper  hes cracked said beetle miserably as they followed indeed this was a new turkeya haughty angular noselifted turkeywhom they accompanied through a shrubbery on to a lawn where a whitewhiskered old gentleman with a cleek was alternately putting and blaspheming vigorously  are you colonel dabney mcturk began in this new creaking voice of his  ii am and his eyes traveled up and down the boywhowhat the devil dyou want yeve been disturbing my pheasants dont attempt to deny it ye neednt laugh at it mcturks not too lovely features had twisted themselves into a horrible sneer at the word pheasant youve been birdsnesting you neednt hide your hat i can see that you belong to the college dont attempt to deny it ye do your name and number at once sir ye want to speak to meeh you saw my noticeboards must have dont attempt to deny it ye did damnable oh damnable  he choked with emotion mcturks heel tapped the lawn and he stuttered a littletwo sure signs that he was losing his temper but why should he the offender be angry  lolook here sir dodo you shoot foxes because if you dont your keeper does weve seen him i dodont care what you call usbut its an awful thing its the ruin of good feelin among neighbors a maman ought to say once and for all how he stands about preservin its worse than murder because theres no legal remedy mcturk was quoting confusedly from his father while the old gentleman made noises in his throat  do you know who i am he gurgled at last stalky and beetle quaking  no sorr nor do i care if ye belonged to the castle itself answer me now as one gentleman to another do ye shoot foxes or do ye not  and four years before stalky and beetle had carefully kicked mcturk out of his irish dialect assuredly he had gone mad or taken a sunstroke and as assuredly he would be slainonce by the old gentleman and once by the head a public licking for the three was the least they could expect yetif their eyes and ears were to be trustedthe old gentleman had collapsed it might be a lull before the storm but  i do not he was still gurgling  then you must sack your keeper hes not fit to live in the same county with a godfearin fox an a vixen tooat this time o year  did ye come up on purpose to tell me this  of course i did ye silly man with a stamp of the foot would you not have done as much for me if youd seen that thing happen on my land now  forgottenforgotten was the college and the decency due to elders mcturk was treading again the barren purple mountains of the rainy west coast where in his holidays he was viceroy of four thousand naked acres only son of a threehundredyearold house lord of a crazy fishingboat and the idol of his fathers shiftless tenantry it was the landed man speaking to his equaldeep calling to deepand the old gentleman acknowledged the cry  i apologize said he i apologize unreservedlyto you and to the old country now will you be good enough to tell me your story  we were in your combe mcturk began and he told his tale alternately as a schoolboy and when the iniquity of the thing overcame him as an indignant squire concluding so you see he must be in the habit of it iweone never wants to accuse a neighbors man but i took the liberty in this case  i see quite so for a reason ye had infamousoh infamous  the two had fallen into step beside each other on the lawn and colonel dabney was talking as one man to another this comes of promoting a fishermana fishermanfrom his lobsterpots its enough to ruin the reputation of an archangel dont attempt to deny it it is your father has brought you up well he has id much like the pleasure of his acquaintance very much indeed and these young gentlemen english they are dont attempt to deny it they came up with you too extraordinary extraordinary now in the present state of education i shouldnt have thought any three boys would be well enough grounded but out of the mouths ofnono not that by any odds dont attempt to deny it yere not sherry always catches me under the liver butbeer now eh what dyou say to beer and something to eat its long since i was a boyabominable nuisances but exceptions prove the rule and a vixen too they were fed on the terrace by a grayhaired housekeeper stalky and beetle merely ate but mcturk with bright eyes continued a free and lofty discourse and ever the old gentleman treated him as a brother  my dear man of course ye can come again did i not say exceptions prove the rule the lower combe man dear anywhere ye please so long as you do not disturb my pheasants the two are not incompatible dont attempt to deny it theyre not ill never allow another gun though come and go as ye please ill not see you and ye neednt see me yeve been well brought up another glass of beer now i tell you a fisherman he was and a fisherman he shall be tonight again he shall wish i could drown him ill convoy you to the lodge my people are not preciselyahbroke to boy but theyll know you again  he dismissed them with many compliments by the high lodgegate in the splitoak park palings and they stood still even stalky who had played second not to say a dumb fiddle regarding mcturk as one from another world the two glasses of strong homebrewed had brought a melancholy upon the boy for slowly strolling with his hands in his pockets he croonedoh paddy dear and did ye hear the news thats goin round  under other circumstances stalky and beetle would have fallen upon him for that song was barred utterlyanathemathe sin of witchcraft but seeing what he had wrought they danced round him in silence waiting till it pleased him to touch earth  the teabell rang when they were still half a mile from college mcturk shivered and came out of dreams the glory of his holiday estate had left him he was a colleger of the college speaking english once more  turkey it was immense said stalky generously i didnt know you had it in you youve got us a hut for the rest of the term where we simply cant be collared fids fids oh fids i gloat hear me gloat  they spun wildly on their heels jodeling after the accepted manner of a gloat which is not unremotely allied to the primitive mans song of triumph and dropped down the hill by the path from the gasometer just in time to meet their housemaster who had spent the afternoon watching their abandoned hut in the wuzzy  unluckily all mr prouts imagination leaned to the darker side of life and he looked on those youngeyed cherubims most sourly boys that he understood attended housematches and could be accounted for at any moment but he had heard mcturk openly deride cricketeven housematches beetles views on the honor of the house he knew were incendiary and he could never tell when the soft and smiling stalky was laughing at him consequentlysince human nature is what it isthose boys had been doing wrong somewhere he hoped it was nothing very serious but  tiraralaitu i gloat hear me stalky still on his heels whirled like a dancing dervish to the dininghall  tiralalaitu i gloat hear me beetle spun behind him with outstretched arms  tiralalaitu i gloat hear me mcturks voice cracked  now was there or was there not a distinct flavor of beer as they shot past mr prout  he was unlucky in that his conscience as a housemaster impelled him to consult his associates had he taken his pipe and his troubles to little hartopps rooms he would perhaps have been saved confusion for hartopp believed in boys and knew something about them his fate led him to king a fellow housemaster no friend of his but a zealous hater of stalky  co  ahhaa said king rubbing his hands when the tale was told curious now my house never dream of doing these things  but you see ive no proof exactly  proof with the egregious beetle as if one wanted it i suppose it is not impossible for the sergeant to supply it foxy is considered at least a match for any evasive boy in my house of course they were smoking and drinking somewhere that type of boy always does they think it manly  but theyve no following in the school and they are distinctlyer brutal to their juniors said prout who had from a distance seen beetle return with interest his butterflynet to a tearful fag  ah they consider themselves superior to ordinary delights selfsufficient little animals theres something in mcturks hibernian sneer that would make me a little annoyed and they are so careful to avoid all overt acts too its sheer calculated insolence i am strongly opposed as you know to interfering with another mans house but they need a lesson prout they need a sharp lesson if only to bring down their overweening selfconceit were i you i should devote myself for a week to their little performances boys of that orderand i may flatter myself but i think i know boysdont join the bughunters for love tell the sergeant to keep his eye open and of course in my peregrinations i may casually keep mine open too  tiralalaitu i gloat hear me far down the corridor  disgusting said king where do they pick up these obscene noises one sharp lesson is what they want  the boys did not concern themselves with lessons for the next few days they had all colonel dabneys estate to play with and they explored it with the stealth of red indians and the accuracy of burglars they could enter either by the lodgegates on the upper roadthey were careful to ingratiate themselves with the lodgekeeper and his wifedrop down into the combe and return along the cliffs or they could begin at the combe and climb up into the road  they were careful not to cross the colonels pathhe had served his turn and they would not outwear their welcomenor did they show up on the skyline when they could move in cover the shelter of the gorze by the cliffedge was their chosen retreat beetle christened it the pleasant isle of aves for the peace and the shelter of it and here the pipes and tobacco once cached in a convenient ledge an arms length down the cliff their position was legally unassailable  for observe colonel dabney had not invited them to enter his house therefore they did not need to ask specific leave to go visiting and school rules were strict on that point he had merely thrown open his grounds to them and since they were lawful bughunters their extended bounds ran up to his noticeboards in the combe and his lodgegates on the hill  they were amazed at their own virtue  and even if it wasnt said stalky flat on his back staring into the blue even suppose we were miles out of bounds no one could get at us through this wuzzy unless he knew the tunnel isnt this better than lyin up just behind the collin a blue funk every time we had a smoke isnt your uncle stalky  no said beetlehe was stretched at the edge of the cliff spitting thoughtfully weve got to thank turkey for this turkey is the great man turkey dear youre distressing heffles  gloomy old ass said mcturk deep in a book  theyve got us under suspicion said stalky hoophats is so suspicious somehow and foxy always makes every stalk he does a sort ofsort of  scalp said beetle foxys a giddy chingangook  poor foxy said stalky hes goin to catch us one of these days said to me in the gym last night ive got my eye on you mister corkran im only warning you for your good then i said well you jolly well take it off again or youll get into trouble im only warnin you for your good foxy was wrath  yes but its only fair sport for foxy said beetle its hefflelinga that has the evil mind shouldnt wonder if he thought we got tight  i never got squiffy but oncethat was in the holidays said stalky reflectively an it made me horrid sick pon my sacred sam though its enough to drive a man to drink havin an animal like hoof for housemaster  if we attended the matches an yelled well hit sir an stood on one leg an grinned every time heffy said so ho my sons is it thus an said yes sir an no sir an o sir an please sir like a lot o filthy faags heffy ud think no end of us said mcturk with a sneer  too late to begin that  its all right the hefflelinga means well but he is an ass and we show him that we think hes an ass an so heffy dont love us told me last night after prayers that he was in loco parentis beetle grunted  the deuce he did cried stalky that means hes maturin something unusual dam mean last time he told me that he gave me three hundred lines for dancin the cachuca in number ten dormitory loco parentis by gum but whats the odds as long as youre appy were all right  they were and their very rightness puzzled prout king and the sergeant boys with bad consciences show it they slink out past the fives court in haste and smile nervously when questioned they return disordered in bare time to save a callover they nod and wink and giggle one to the other scattering at the approach of a master but stalky and his allies had long outlived these manifestations of youth they strolled forth unconcernedly and returned in excellent shape after a light refreshment of strawberries and cream at the lodge  the lodgekeeper had been promoted to keeper vice the murderous fisherman and his wife made much of the boys the man too gave them a squirrel which they presented to the natural history society thereby checkmating little hartopp who wished to know what they were doing for science foxy faithfully worked some deep devon lanes behind a lonely crossroads inn and it was curious that prout and king members of commonroom seldom friendly walked together in the same directionthat is to say northeast  now the pleasant isle of aves lay due southwest theyre deepdayvilish deep said stalky why are they drawin those covers  me said beetle sweetly i asked foxy if he had ever tasted the beer there that was enough for foxy and it cheered him up a little he and heffy were sniffin round our old hut so long i thought theyd like a change  well it cant last forever said stalky heffys bankin up like a thundercloud an king goes rubbin his beastly hands an grinnin like a hyena its shockin demoralizin for king hell burst some day  that day came a little sooner than they expectedcame when the sergeant whose duty it was to collect defaulters did not attend an afternoon callover  tired of pubs eh hes gone up to the top of the bill with his binoculars to spot us said stalky wonder he didnt think of that before did you see old heffy cock his eye at us when we answered our names heffys in it too tiralalaitu i gloat hear me come on  aves said beetle  of course but im not smokin aujourdhui parceque je jolly well pense that well be suivi well go along the cliffs slow an give foxy lots of time to parallel us up above  they strolled towards the swimmingbaths and presently overtook king oh dont let me interrupt you he said engaged in scientific pursuits of course i trust you will enjoy yourselves my young friends  you see said stalky when they were out of earshot he cant keep a secret hes followin to cut off our line of retreat hell wait at the baths till heffy comes along theyve tried every blessed place except along the cliffs and now they think theyve bottled us no need to hurry  they walked leisurely over the combes till they reached the line of noticeboards  listen a shake foxys up wind comin down hill like beans when you hear him move in the bushes go straight across to aves they want to catch us flagrante delicto  they dived into the gorse at right angles to the tunnel openly crossing the grass and lay still in aves  what did i tell you stalky carefully put away the pipes and tobacco the sergeant out of breath was leaning against the fence raking the furze with his binoculars but he might as well have tried to see through a sandbag anon prout and king appeared behind him they conferred  aha foxy dont like the noticeboards and he dont like the prickles either now well cut up the tunnel and go to the lodge hullo theyve sent foxy into cover  the sergeant was waistdeep in crackling swaying furze his ears filled with the noise of his own progress the boys reached the shelter of the wood and looked down through a belt of hollies  hellish noise said stalky critically dont think colonel dabney will like it i move we go into the lodge and get something to eat we might as well see the fun out  suddenly the keeper passed them at a trot whom they to combebottom for lards sake masterll be crazy he said  poachers simly stalky replied in the broad devon that was the boys langue de guerre  ill poach em to raights he dropped into the funnellike combe which presently began to fill with noises notably kings voice crying go on sergeant leave him alone you sir he is executing my orders  whom yeou to give arders here gingy whiskers yeou come up to the master come out o that wuzzy this is to the sergeant yiss i reckon us knows the boys yeoum after theyve tu long ears an vuzzy bellies an you nippies they in yeour pockets when theym dead come on up to master hell boy yeou all youre a mind to yeou other folk bide your side fence  explain to the proprietor you can explain sergeant shouted king evidently the sergeant had surrendered to the major force  beetle lay at full length on the turf behind the lodge literally biting the earth in spasms of joy stalky kicked him upright there was nothing of levity about stalky or mcturk save a stray muscle twitching on the cheek  they tapped at the lodge door where they were always welcome come yeou right in an set down my little dearrs said the woman theyll niver touch my man hell poach em to rights iss fai fresh berries an cream us dartymoor folk niver forgit their friends but them bidevor poachers theyve no hem to their garments sugar

wem no company to make all vitty for never yeou mind us yiss theres plenty cream  the woman withdrew wiping her pink hands on her apron and left them in the parlor there was a scuffle of feet on the gravel outside the heavilyleaded diamond panes and then the voice of colonel dabney something clearer than a bugle  ye can read youve eyes in your head dont attempt to deny it ye have  beetle snatched a crochetwork antimacassar from the shiny horsehair sofa stuffed it into his mouth and rolled out of sight  you saw my noticeboards your duty curse your impudence sir your duty was to keep off my grounds talk of duty to me whywhywhy ye misbegotten poacher yell be teaching me my a b c next roarin like a bull in the bushes down there boys boys boys keep your boys at home then im not responsible for your boys but i dont believe iti dont believe a word of it yeve a furtive look in your eyea furtive sneakin poachin look in your eye that ud ruin the reputation of an archangel dont attempt to

he obeyed  now march the high lodge gate shut with a clang my duty a sergeant to tell me my duty puffed colonel dabney good lard more sergeants  its king its king gulped stalky his head on the horsehair pillow mcturk was eating the ragcarpet before the speckless hearth and the sofa heaved to the emotions of beetle through the thick glass the figures without showed blue distorted and menacing  ii protest against this outrage king had evidently been running up hill the man was entirely within his duty letlet me give you my card  hes in flannels stalky buried his head again  unfortunatelymost unfortunatelyi have not one with me but my name is king sir a housemaster of the college and you will find me preparedfully preparedto answer for this mans action weve seen three  did ye see my noticeboards  i admit we did but under the circumstances  i stand in loco parentis prouts deep voice was added to the discussion they could hear him pant  fwhat colonel dabney was growing more and more irish  im responsible for the boys under my charge  ye are are ye then all i can say is that ye set them a very bad examplea dam bad example if i may say so i do not own your boys ive not seen your boys an i tell you that if there was a boy grinnin in every bush on the place still yeve no shadow of a right here comin up from the combe that way an frightenin everything in

private with you ye can be as private as ye please on the other side o that gate ani wish ye a very good afternoon  a second time the gate clanged they waited till colonel dabney had returned to the house and fell into one anothers arms crowing for breath  oh my soul oh my king oh my heffy oh my foxy zeal all zeal mr simple stalky wiped his eyes oh oh i ohi did boil the exciseman we must get out of this or well be late for tea  gegeget the badger and make little hartopp happy mamamake em all happy sobbed mcturk groping for the door and kicking the prostrate beetle before him  they found the beast in an evilsmelling box left two halfcrowns for payment and staggered home only the badger grunted most marvelous like colonel dabney and they dropped him twice or thrice with shrieks of helpless laughter they were but imperfectly recovered when foxy met them by the fives court with word that they were to go up to their dormitory and wait till sent for  well take this box to mr hartopps rooms then weve done something for the natural history society at any rate said beetle  fraid that wont save you young genelmen foxy answered in an awful voice he was sorely ruffled in his mind  all sereno foxibus stalky had reached the extreme stage of hiccups wewell never desert you foxy hounds choppin foxes in cover is more a proof of vice aint it no youre right imim not quite well  theyve gone a bit too far this time foxy thought to himself very far gone id say excep there was no smell of liquor an yet it isnt like emsomehow king and prout they ad their dressindown same as me thats one comfort  now we must pull up said stalky rising from the bed on which he had thrown himself were injured innocenceas usual we dont know what weve been sent up here for do we  no explanation deprived of tea public disgrace before the house said mcturk whose eyes were running over its dam serious  well hold on till king loses his temper said beetle hes a libelous old rip an hell be in a ravin paddywack prouts too beastly cautious keep your eye on king and if he gives us a chance appeal to the head that always makes em sick  they were summoned to their housemasters study king and foxy supporting prout and foxy had three canes under his arm king leered triumphantly for there were tears undried tears of mirth on the boys cheeks then the examination began  yes they had walked along the cliffs yes they had entered colonel dabneys grounds yes they had seen the noticeboards at this point beetle sputtered hysterically for what purpose had they entered colonel dabneys grounds well sir there was a badger  here king who loathed the natural history society because he did not like hartopp could no longer be restrained he begged them not to add mendacity to open insolence but the badger was in mr hartopps rooms sir the sergeant had kindly taken it up for them that disposed of the badger and the temporary check brought kings temper to boilingpoint they could hear his foot on the floor while prout prepared his lumbering inquiries they had settled into their stride now their eyes ceased to sparkle their faces were blank their hands hung beside them without a twitch they were learning at the expense of a fellowcountryman the lesson of their race which is to put away all emotion and entrap the alien at the proper time  so far good king was importing himself more freely into the trial being vengeful where prout was grieved they knew the penalties of trespassing with a fine show of irresolution stalky admitted that he had gathered some information vaguely bearing on this head but he thoughtthe sentence was dragged out to the uttermost stalky did not wish to play his trump with such an opponent mr king desired no buts nor was he interested in stalkys evasions they on the other hand might be interested in his poor views boys who creptwho sneakedwho lurkedout of bounds even the generous bounds of the natural history society which they had falsely joined as a cloak for their misdeedstheir vicestheir villainiestheir immoralities  hell break cover in a minute said stalky to himself then well run into him before he gets away  such boys scabrous boys moral lepersthe current of his words was carrying king off his feetevilspeakers liars slowbelliesyea incipient drunkards  he was merely working up to a peroration and the boys knew it but mcturk cut through the frothing sentence the others echoing  i appeal to the head sir  i appeal to the head sir  i appeal to the head sir  it was their unquestioned right drunkenness meant expulsion after a public flogging they had been accused of it the case was the heads and the heads alone  thou hast appealed unto caesar unto caesar shalt thou go they had heard that sentence once or twice before in their careers none the less said king uneasily you would be better advised to abide by our decision my young friends  are we allowed to associate with the rest of the school till we see the head sir said mcturk to his housemaster disregarding king this at once lifted the situation to its loftiest plane moreover it meant no work for moral leprosy was strictly quarantined and the head never executed judgment till twentyfour cold hours later  wellerif you persist in your defiant attitude said king with a loving look at the canes under foxys arm there is no alternative  ten minutes later the news was over the whole school stalky and co had fallen at lastfallen by drink they had been drinking they had returned blinddrunk from a hut they were even now lying hopelessly intoxicated on the dormitory floor a few bold spirits crept up to look and received boots about the head from the criminals  weve got himgot him on the caudine toastingfork said stalky after those hints were taken kingll have to prove his charges up to the giddy hilt  too much ticklee him bust beetle quoted from a book of his reading didnt i say hed go pop if we lat un bide  no prep either o ye incipient drunkards said mcturk and its trig night too hullo heres our dear friend foxy more tortures foxibus  ive brought you something to eat young gentlemen said the sergeant from behind a crowded tray their wars had ever been waged without malice and a suspicion floated in foxys mind that boys who allowed themselves to be tracked so easily might perhaps hold something in reserve foxy had served through the mutiny when early and accurate information was worth much  ii noticed you adnt ad anything to eat an i spoke to gumbly an he said you wasnt exactly cut off from supplies so i brought up this its your potted am tin aint it

teathings knowin what i know o the young devgentlemen of the college im very glad to ear it but what am i to tell the ead  anything you jolly well please foxy we arent the criminals  to say that the head was annoyed when the sergeant appeared after dinner with the days crimesheet would be putting it mildly  corkran mcturk and co i see bounds as usual hullo what the deuce is this suspicion of drinking whose charge  mr kings sir i caught em out of bounds sir at least that was ow it looked but theres a lot beind sir the sergeant was evidently troubled  go on said the head let us have your version he and the sergeant had dealt with one another for some seven years and the head knew that mr kings statements depended very largely on mr kings temper  i thought they were out of bounds along the cliffs but it come out they wasnt sir i saw them go into colonel dabneys woods andmr king and mr prout come alongand the fact was sir we was mistook for poachers by colonel dabneys peoplemr king and mr prout and me there were some words sir on both sides the young gentlemen slipped ome somehow and they seemed ighly humorous sir mr king was mistook by colonel dabney himselfcolonel dabney bein strict then they preferred to come straight to you sir on account of whatwhat mr king may ave said about their abits afterwards in mr prouts study i only said they was ighly humorous laughin an gigglin an a bit above emselves theyve since told me sir in a humorous way that they was invited by colonel dabney to go into is woods  i see they didnt tell their housemaster that of course  they took up mr king on appeal just as soon as he spoke about theirabits put in the appeal at once sir an asked to be sent to the dormitory waitin for you ive since gathered sir in their humorous way sir that someow or other theyve eard about every word colonel dabney said to mr king and mr prout when he mistook em for poachers ii might ha known when they led me on so that they eld the inner line of communications itsits a plain do sir if you ask me an theyre gloatin over it in the dormitory  the head sawsaw even to the uttermost farthingand his mouth twitched a little under his mustache  send them to me at once sergeant this case neednt wait over  good evening said he when the three appeared under escort i want your undivided attention for a few minutes youve known me for five years and ive known you fortwentyfive i think we understand one another perfectly i am now going to pay you a tremendous compliment the brown one please sergeant thanks you neednt wait im going to execute you without rhyme beetle or reason i know you went to colonel dabneys covers because you were invited im not even going to send the sergeant with a note to ask if your statement is true because i am convinced that on this occasion you have adhered strictly to the truth i know too that you were not drinking you can take off that virtuous expression mcturk or i shall begin to fear you dont understand me there is not a flaw in any of your characters and that is why i am going to perpetrate a howling injustice your reputations have been injured havent they you have been disgraced before the house havent you you have a peculiarly keen regard for the honor of your house havent you well now i am going to lick you  six apiece was their portion upon that word  and this i thinkthe head replaced the cane and flung the written charge into the wastepaper basketcovers the situation when you find a variation from the normalthis will be useful to you in later lifealways meet him in an abnormal way and that reminds me there are a pile of paperbacks on that shelf you can borrow them if you put them back i dont think theyll take any harm from being read in the open they smell of tobacco rather you will go to prep this evening as usual goodnight said that amazing man  goodnight and thank you sir  i swear ill pray for the head tonight said beetle those last two cuts were just flicks on my collar theres a monte cristo in that lower shelf i saw it bags i next time we go to aves  dearr man said mcturk no gating no impots no beastly questions all settled hullo whats king goin in to him forking and prout  whatever the nature of that interview it did not improve either kings or prouts ruffled plumes for when they came out of the heads house eyes noted that the one was red and blue with emotion as to his nose and that the other was sweating profusely that sight compensated them amply for the imperial jaw with which they were favored by the two it seemsand who so astonished as theythat they had held back material facts were guilty both of suppressio veri and suggestio falsi wellknown gods against whom they often offended further that they were malignant in their dispositions untrustworthy in their characters pernicious and revolutionary in their influences abandoned to the devils of wilfulness pride and a most intolerable conceit ninthly and lastly they were to have a care and to be very careful  they were careful as only boys can be when there is a hurt to be inflicted they waited through one suffocating week till prout and king were their royal selves again waited till there was a housematchtheir own house tooin which prout was taking part waited further till he had his pads in the pavilion and stood ready to go forth king was scoring at the window and the three sat on a bench without  said stalky to beetle i say beetlequis custodet ipsos custodes  dont ask me said beetle ill have nothin private with you ye can be as private as ye please the other end of the bench and i wish ye a very good afternoon  mcturk yawned  well ye should ha come up to the lodge like christians instead o chasin yourahemboys through the length an breadth of my covers i think these housematches are all rot lets go over to colonel dabneys an see if hes collared any more poachers  that afternoon there was joy in aves     slaves of the lamp   the musicroom on the top floor of number five was filled with the aladdin company at rehearsal dickson quartus commonly known as dick four was aladdin stagemanager balletmaster half the orchestra and largely librettist for the book had been rewritten and filled with local allusions the pantomime was to be given next week in the downstairs study occupied by aladdin abanazar and the emperor of china the slave of the lamp with the princess badroulbadour and the widow twankay owned number five study across the same landing so that the company could be easily assembled the floor shook to the stampandgo of the ballet while aladdin in pink cotton tights a blue and tinsel jacket and a plumed hat banged alternately on the piano and his banjo he was the moving spirit of the game as befitted a senior who had passed his army preliminary and hoped to enter sandhurst next spring  aladdin came to his own at last abanazar lay poisoned on the floor the widow twankay danced her dance and the company decided it would come all right on the night  what about the last song though said the emperor a tallish fairheaded boy with a ghost of a mustache at which he pulled manfully we need a rousing old tune  john peel drink puppy drink suggested abanazar smoothing his baggy lilac pajamas pussy abanazar never looked more than onehalf awake but he owned a soft slow smile which well suited the part of the wicked uncle  stale said aladdin might as well have grandfathers clock whats that thing you were humming at prep last night stalky  stalky the slave of the lamp in black tights and doublet a black silk halfmask on his forehead whistled lazily where he lay on the top of the piano it was a catchy musichall tune  dick four cocked his head critically and squinted down a large red nose  once more and i can pick it up he said strumming sing the words  arrah patsy mind the baby arrah patsy mind the child wrap him in an overcoat hes surely going wild arrah patsy mind the baby just you mind the child awhile hell kick and bite and cry all night arrah patsy mind the child  rippin oh rippin said dick four only we shant have any piano on the night we must work it with the banjoesplay an dance at the same time you try tertius  the emperor pushed aside his peagreen sleeves of state and followed dick four on a heavy nickel plated banjo  yes but im dead all this time bung in the middle of the stage too said abanazar  oh thats beetles biznai said dick four vamp it up beetle dont keep us waiting all night youve got to get pussy out of the light somehow and bring us all in dancin at the end  all right you two play it again said beetle who in a gray skirt and a wig of chestnut sausagecurls set slantwise above a pair of spectacles mended with an old bootlace represented the widow twankay he waved one leg in time to the hammered refrain and the banjoes grew louder  um ah eraladdin now has won his wife he sang and dick four repeated it  your emperor is appeased tertius flung out his chest as he delivered his line  now jump up pussy say i think id better come to life then we all take hands and come forward we hope youve all been pleased twiggezvous  nous twiggons good enough whats the chorus for the final ballet its four kicks and a turn said dick four  oh er     john short will ring the curtain down    and ring the prompters bell    we hope you know before you go    that we all wish you well  rippin rippin now for the widows scene with the princess hurry up turkey  mcturk in a violet silk skirt and a coquettish blue turban slouched forward as one thoroughly ashamed of himself the slave of the lamp climbed down from the piano and dispassionately kicked him play up turkey he said this is serious but there fell on the door the knock of authority it happened to be king in gown and mortarboard enjoying a saturday evening prowl before dinner  locked doors locked doors he snapped with a scowl whats the meaning of this and what may i ask is the intention of thisthis epicene attire  pantomime sir the head gave us leave said abanazar as the only member of the sixth concerned dick four stood firm in the confidence born of wellfitting tights but beetle strove to efface himself behind the piano a gray princessskirt borrowed from a dayboys mother and a spotted cotton bodice unsystematically padded with impositionpaper make one ridiculous and in other regards beetle had a bad conscience  as usual sneered king futile foolery just when your careers such as they may be are hanging in the balance i see ah i see the old gang of criminalsallied forces of disordercorkranthe slave of the lamp smiled politelymcturkthe irishman scowledand of course the unspeakable beetle our friend gigadibs abanazar the emperor and aladdin had more or less of characters and king passed them over come forth my inky buffoon from behind yonder instrument of music you supply i presume the doggerel for this entertainment esteem yourself to be as it were a poet  hes found one of em thought beetle noting the flush on kings cheekbone  i have just had the pleasure of reading an effusion of yours to my address i believean effusion intended to rhyme soso you despise me master gigadibs do you i am quite awareyou need not explainthat it was ostensibly not intended for my edification i read it with laughteryes with laughter these paper pellets of inky boysstill a boy we are master gigadibsdo not disturb my equanimity  wonder which it was thought beetle he had launched many lampoons on an appreciative public ever since he discovered that it was possible to convey reproof in rhyme  in sign of his unruffled calm king proceeded to tear beetle whom he called gigadibs slowly asunder from his untied shoestrings to his mended spectacles the life of a poet at a big school is hard he held him up to the derision of his associateswith the usual result his wild flowers of speechking had an unpleasant tonguerestored him to good humor at the last he drew a lurid picture of beetles latter end as a scurrilous pamphleteer dying in an attic scattered a few compliments over mcturk and corkran and reminding beetle that he must come up for judgment when called upon went to commonroom where he triumphed anew over his victims  and the worst of it he explained in a loud voice over his soup is that i waste such gems of sarcasm on their thick heads its miles above them im certain  weell said the school chaplain slowly i dont know what corkrans appreciation of your style may be but young mcturk reads ruskin for his amusement  nonsense he does it to show off i mistrust the dark celt  he does nothing of the kind i went into their study the other night unofficially and mcturk was gluing up the back of four odd numbers of fors clavigera  i dont know anything about their private lives said a mathematical master hotly but ive learned by bitter experience that number five study are best left alone they are utterly soulless young devils  he blushed as the others laughed  but in the musicroom there were wrath and bad language only stalky slave of the lamp lay on the piano unmoved  that little swine manders miner must have shown him your stuff hes always suckin up to king go and kill him he drawled which one was it beetle  dunno said beetle struggling out of the skirt there was one about his hunting for popularity with the small boys and the other one was one about him in hell tellin the devil he was a balliol man i swear both of em rhymed all right by gum praps manders minor showed him both ill correct his caesuras for him  he disappeared down two flights of stairs flushed a small pink and white boy in a formroom next door to kings study which again was immediately below his own and chased him up the corridor into a formroom sacred to the revels of the lower third thence he came back greatly disordered to find mcturk stalky and the others of the company in his study enjoying an unlimited brewcoffee cocoa buns new bread hot and steaming sardine sausage hamandtongue paste pilchards three jams and at least as many pounds of devonshire cream  my hat said he throwing himself upon the banquet who stumped up for this stalky it was within a month of term end and blank starvation had reigned in the studies for weeks  you said stalky serenely  confound you you havent been popping my sunday bags then  keep your hair on its only your watch  watch i lost itweeks ago out on the burrows when we tried to shoot the old ramthe day our pistol burst  it dropped out of your pocket youre so beastly careless beetle and mcturk and i kept it for you ive been wearing it for a week and you never noticed took it into bideford after dinner today got thirteen and sevenpence heres the ticket  well thats pretty average cool said abanazar behind a slab of cream and jam as beetle reassured upon the safety of his sunday trousers showed not even surprise much less resentment indeed it was mcturk who grew angry saying  you gave him the ticket stalky you pawned it you unmitigated beast why last month you and beetle sold mine never got a sniff of any ticket  ah that was because you locked your trunk and we wasted half the afternoon hammering it open we might have pawned it if youd behaved like a christian turkey  my aunt said abanazar you chaps are communists vote of thanks to beetle though  thats beastly unfair said stalky when i took all the trouble to pawn it beetle never knew he had a watch oh i say rabbitseggs gave me a lift into bideford this afternoon  rabbitseggs was the local carrieran outcrop of the early devonian formation it was stalky who had invented his unlovely name he was pretty average drunk or he wouldnt have done it rabbitseggs is a little shy of me somehow but i swore it was pax between us and gave him a bob he stopped at two pubs on the way in so hell be howling drunk tonight oh dont begin reading beetle theres a council of war on what the deuce is the matter with your collar  chivied manders minor into the lower third boxroom had all his beastly little friends on top of me said beetle from behind a jar of pilchards and a book  you ass any fool could have told you where manders would bunk to said mcturk  i didnt think said beetle meekly scooping out pilchards with a spoon  course you didnt you never do mcturk adjusted beetles collar with a savage tug dont drop oil all over my fors or ill scrag you  shut up youyou irish biddy tisnt your beastly fors its one of mine  the book was a fat brownbacked volume of the later sixties which king had once thrown at beetles head that beetle might see whence the name gigadibs came beetle had quietly annexed the book and had seenseveral things the quartercomprehended verses lived and ate with him as the bedropped pages showed he removed himself from all that world drifting at large with wondrous men and women till mcturk hammered the pilchard spoon on his head and he snarled  beetle youre oppressed and insulted and bullied by king dont you feel it  let me alone i can write some more poetry about him if i am i suppose  mad quite mad said stalky to the visitors as one exhibiting strange beasts beetle reads an ass called brownin and mcturk reads an ass called ruskin and  ruskin isnt an ass said mcturk hes almost as good as the opium eater he says were children of noble races trained by surrounding art that means me and the way i decorated the study when you two badgers would have stuck up brackets and christmas cards child of a noble race trained by surrounding art stop reading or ill shove a pilchard down your neck  its two to one said stalky warningly and beetle closed the book in obedience to the law under which he and his companions had lived for six checkered years  the visitors looked on delighted number five study had a reputation for more variegated insanity than the rest of the school put together and so far as its code allowed friendship with outsiders it was polite and openhearted to its neighbors on the same landing  what rot do you want now said beetle  king war said mcturk jerking his head toward the wall where hung a small wooden westafrican wardrum a gift to mcturk from a naval uncle  then we shall be turned out of the study again said beetle who loved his fleshpots mason turned us out forjust warbling on it mason was the mathematical master who had testified in commonroom  warblingo lord said abanazar we couldnt hear ourselves speak in our study when you played the infernal thing whats the good of getting turned out of your study anyhow  we lived in the formrooms for a week too said beetle tragically and it was beastly cold  yees but masons rooms were filled with rats every day we were out it took him a week to draw the inference said mcturk he loathes rats minute he let us go back the rats stopped masons a little shy of us now but there was no evidence  jolly well there wasnt said stalky when i got out on the roof and dropped the beastly things down his chimney but look herequestion is are our characters good enough just now to stand a study row  never mind mine said beetle king swears i havent any  im not thinking of you stalky returned scornfully you arent going up for the army you old bat i dont want to be expelledand the heads getting rather shy of us too  rot said mcturk the head never expels except for beastliness or stealing but i forgot you and stalky are thievesregular burglars  the visitors gasped but stalky interpreted the parable with large grins  well you know that little beast manders minor saw beetle and me hammerin mcturks trunk open in the dormitory when we took his watch last month of course manders sneaked to mason and mason solemnly took it up as a case of theft to get even with us about the rats  that just put mason into our giddy hands said mcturk blandly we were nice to him because he was a new master and wanted to win the confidence of the boys pity he draws inferences though stalky went to his study and pretended to blub and told mason hed lead a new life if mason would let him off this time but mason wouldnt said it was his duty to report him to the head  vindictive swine said beetle it was all those rats then i blubbed too and stalky confessed that hed been a thief in regular practice for six years ever since he came to the school and that id taught hima la fagin mason turned white with joy he thought he had us on toast  gorgeous gorgeous said dick four we never heard of this  course not mason kept it jolly quiet he wrote down all our statements on impotpaper there wasnt anything he wouldnt believe said stalky  and handed it all up to the head with an extempore prayer it took about forty pages said beetle i helped him a lot  and then you crazy idiots said abanazar  oh we were sent for and stalky asked to have the depositions read out and the head knocked him spinning into a wastepaper basket then he gave us eight cuts apieceweltersforfortakin unheardof liberties with a new master i saw his shoulders shaking when we went out do you know said beetle pensively that mason cant look at us now in second lesson without blushing we three stare at him sometimes till he regularly trickles hes an awfully sensitive beast  he read eric or little by little said mcturk so we gave him st winifreds or the world of school they spent all their spare time stealing at st winifreds when they werent praying or getting drunk at pubs well that was only a week ago and the heads a little bit shy of us he called it constructive deviltry stalky invented it all  not the least good having a row with a master unless you can make an ass of him said stalky extended at ease on the hearthrug if mason didnt know number fivewell hes learnt thats all now my dearly beloved earersstalky curled his legs under him and addressed the companyweve got that strong perseverin man king on our hands he went miles out of his way to provoke a conflict here stalky snapped down the black silk domino and assumed the air of a judge he has oppressed beetle mcturk and me privatim et seriatim one by one as he could catch us but now he has insulted number five up in the musicroom and in the presence of thesethese ossifers of the ninetythird wot look like hairdressers binjimin we must make him cry capivi  stalkys reading did not include browning or ruskin  and besides said mcturk hes a philistine a baskethanger he wears a tartan tie ruskin says that any man who wears a tartan tie will without doubt be damned everlastingly  bravo mcturk said tertius i thought he was only a beast  hes that too of course but hes worse he has a china basket with blue ribbons and a pink kitten on it hung up in his window to grow musk in you know when i got all that old oak carvin out of bideford church when they were restoring it ruskin says that any man wholl restore a church is an unmitigated sweep and stuck it up here with glue well king came in and wanted to know whether wed done it with a fretsaw yah he is the king of baskethangers  down went mcturks inky thumb over an imaginary arena full of bleeding kings placete child of a generous race he cried to beetle  well began beetle doubtfully he comes from balliol but im going to give the beast a chance you see i can always make him hop with some more poetry he cant report me to the head because it makes him ridiculous stalkys quite right but he shall have his chance  beetle opened the book on the table ran his finger down a page and began at random     or who in moscow toward the czar    with the demurest of footfalls    over the kremlins pavement white    with serpentine and syenite    steps with five other generals  thats no good try another said stalky  hold on a shake i know whats coming mcturk was reading over beetles shoulder     that simultaneously take snuff    for each to have pretext enough    and kerchiefwise unfold his sash    whichsoftness selfis yet the stuff  gummy what a sentence     to hold fast where a steel chain snaps    and leave the grand white neck no gash  full stop  dont understand a word of it said stalky  more fool you construe said mcturk those six bargees scragged the czar and left no evidence actum est with king  he gave me that book too said beetle licking his lips     theres a great text in galatians    once you trip on it entails    twentynine distinct damnations    one sure if another fails  then irrelevantly     setebos setebos and setebos    thinketh he liveth in the cold of the moon  hes just come in from dinner said dick four looking through the window manders minor is with him  safest place for manders minor just now said beetle  then you chaps had better clear out said stalky politely to the visitors tisnt fair to mix you up in a study row besides we cant afford to have evidence  are you going to begin at once said aladdin  immediately if not sooner said stalky and turned out the gas strong perseverin manking make him cry capivi gway binjimin  the company retreated to their own neat and spacious study with expectant souls  when stalky blows out his nostrils like a horse said aladdin to the emperor of china hes on the warpath wonder what king will get  beans said the emperor number five generally pays in full  wonder if i ought to take any notice of it officially said abanazar who had just remembered he was a prefect  its none of your business pussy besides if you did wed have them hostile to us and we shouldnt be able to do any work said aladdin theyve begun already  now that westafrican wardrum had been made to signal across estuaries and deltas number five was forbidden to wake the engine within earshot of the school but a deep devastating drone filled the passages as mcturk and beetle scientifically rubbed its top anon it changed to the blare of trumpetsof savage pursuing trumpets then as mcturk slapped one side smooth with the blood of ancient sacrifice the roar broke into short coughing howls such as the wounded gorilla throws in his native forest these were followed by the wrath of kingthree steps at a time up the staircase with a dry whir of the gown aladdin and company listening squeaked with excitement as the door crashed open king stumbled into the darkness and cursed those performers by the gods of balliol and quiet repose  turned out for a week said aladdin holding the study door on the crack key to be brought down to his study in five minutes brutes barbarians savages children hes rather agitated arrah patsy mind the baby he sang in a whisper as he clung to the doorknob dancing a noiseless wardance  king went downstairs again and beetle and mcturk lit the gas to confer with stalky but stalky had vanished  looks like no end of a mess said beetle collecting his books and mathematical instrument case a week in the formrooms isnt any advantage to us  yes but dont you see that stalky isnt here you owl said mcturk take down the key and look sorrowful kingll only jaw you for half an hour im going to read in the lower formroom  but its always me mourned beetle  wait till we see said mcturk hopefully i dont know any more than you do what stalky means but its something go down and draw kings fire youre used to it  no sooner had the key turned in the door than the lid of the coalbox which was also the windowseat lifted cautiously it had been a tight fit even for the lithe stalky his head between his knees and his stomach under his right ear from a drawer in the table he took a wellworn catapult a handful of buckshot and a duplicate key of the study noiselessly he raised the window and kneeled by it his face turned to the road the windsloped trees the dark levels of the burrows and the white line of breakers falling ninedeep along the pebbleridge far down the steepbanked devonshire lane he heard the husky hoot of the carriers horn there was a ghost of melody in it as it might have been the wind in a ginbottle essaying to sing its a way we have in the army  stalky smiled a tightlipped smile and at extreme range opened fire the old horse half wheeled in the shafts  where he gwaine tu hiccoughed rabbitseggs another buckshot tore through the rotten canvas tilt with a vicious zipp  habet murmured stalky as rabbitseggs swore into the patient night protesting that he saw the dommed colleger who was assaulting him  and so king was saying in a high head voice to beetle whom he had kept to play with before manders minor well knowing that it hurts a fifthform boy to be held up to a fags derision and so master beetle in spite of all our verses which we are so proud of when we presume to come into direct conflict with even so humble a representative of authority as myself for instance we are turned out of our studies are we not  yes sir said beetle with a sheepish grin on his lips and murder in his heart hope had nearly left him but he clung to a wellestablished faith that never was stalky so dangerous as when he was invisible  you are not required to criticise thank you turned out of our studies we are just as if we were no better than little manders minor only inky schoolboys we are and must be treated as such  beetle pricked up his ears for rabbitseggs was swearing savagely on the road and some of the language entered at the upper sash king believed in ventilation he strode to the window gowned and majestic very visible in the gaslight  i zee un i zee un roared rabbitseggs now that he had found a visible foeanother shot from the darkness above yiss yeou yeou longnosed fowereyed gingywhiskered beggar yeum tu old for such goins on aie poultice yeour nose i tall ee poultice yeour long nose  beetles heart leaped up within him somewhere somehow he knew stalky moved behind these manifestations there were hope and the prospect of revenge he would embody the suggestion about the nose in deathless verse king threw up the window and sternly rebuked rabbitseggs but the carrier was beyond fear or fawning he had descended from the cart and was stooping by the roadside  it all fell swiftly as a dream manders minor raised his hand to his head with a cry as a jagged flint cannoned on to some rich treecalf bindings in the bookshelf another quoited along the writingtable beetle made zealous feint to stop it and in that endeavor overturned a students lamp which dripped via kings papers and some choice books greasily on to a persian rug there was much broken glass on the windowseat the china basketmcturks aversioncracked to flinders had dropped her musk plant and its earth over the red rep cushions manders minor was bleeding profusely from a cut on the cheekbone and king using strange words every one of which beetle treasured ran forth to find the schoolsergeant that rabbitseggs might be instantly cast into jail  poor chap said beetle with a false feigned sympathy let it bleed a little thatll prevent apoplexy and he held the blind head skilfully over the table and the papers on the table as he guided the howling manders to the door  then did beetle alone with the wreckage return good for evil how in that office a complete set of gibbon was scarred all along the back as by a flint how so much black and copying ink came to be mingled with manderss gore on the tablecloth why the big gumbottle unstoppered had rolled semicircularly across the floor and in what manner the white china doorknob grew to be painted with yet more of manderss young blood were matters which beetle did not explain when the rabid king returned to find him standing politely over the reeking hearthrug  you never told me to go sir he said with the air of casabianca and king consigned him to the outer darkness  but it was to a bootcupboard under the staircase on the ground floor that he hastened to loose the mirth that was destroying him he had not drawn breath for a first whoop of triumph when two hands choked him dumb  go to the dormitory and get me my things bring em to number five lavatory im still in tights hissed stalky sitting on his head dont run walk  but beetle staggered into the formroom next door and delegated his duty to the yet unenlightened mcturk with an hysterical precis of the campaign thus far so it was mcturk of the wooden visage who brought the clothes from the dormitory while beetle panted on a form then the three buried themselves in number five lavatory turned on all the taps filled the place with steam and dropped weeping into the baths where they pieced out the war  moi je ich ego gasped stalky i waited till i couldnt hear myself think while you played the drum hid in the coallockerand tweaked rabbitseggsand rabbitseggs rocked king wasnt it beautiful did you hear the glass  why hehehe shrieked mcturk one trembling finger pointed at beetle  why iii was through it all beetle howled in his study being jawed  oh my soul said stalky with a yell disappearing under water  thethe glass was nothing manders minors heads cut open lalalamp upset all over the rug blood on the books and papers the gum the gum the gum the ink the ink the ink oh lord  then stalky leaped out all pink as he was and shook beetle into some sort of coherence but his tale prostrated them afresh  i bunked for the bootcupboard the second i heard king go downstairs beetle tumbled in on top of me the spare keys hid behind the loose board there isnt a shadow of evidence said stalky they were all chanting together  and he turned us out himselfhimselfhimself this from mcturk he cant begin to suspect us oh stalky its the loveliest thing weve ever done  gum gum dollops of gum shouted beetle his spectacles gleaming through a sea of lather ink and blood all mixed i held the little beasts head all over the latin proses for monday golly how the oil stunk and rabbitseggs told king to poultice his nose did you hit rabbitseggs stalky  did i jolly well not tweaked him all over did you hear him curse oh i shall be sick in a minute if i dont stop  but dressing was a slow process because mcturk was obliged to dance when he heard that the musk basket was broken and moreover beetle retailed all kings language with emendations and purple insets  shockin said stalky collapsing in a helpless welter of halfhitched trousers so dam bad too for innocent boys like us wonder what theyd say at st winifreds or the world of schoolby gum that reminds me we owe the lower third one for assaultin beetle when he chivied manders minor come on its an alibi samivel and besides if we let em off theyll be worse next time  the lower third had set a guard upon their formroom for the space of a full hour which to a boy is a lifetime now they were busy with their saturday evening businessescooking sparrows over the gas with rusty nibs brewing unholy drinks in gallipots skinning moles with pocketknives attending to paper trays full of silkworms or discussing the iniquities of their elders with a freedom fluency and point that would have amazed their parents the blow fell without warning stalky upset a form crowded with small boys among their own cooking utensils mcturk raided the untidy lockers as a terrier digs at a rabbithole while beetle poured ink upon such heads as he could not appeal to with a smiths classical dictionary three brisk minutes accounted for many silkworms pet larvae french exercises school caps halfprepared bones and skulls and a dozen pots of homemade sloe jam it was a great wreckage and the formroom looked as though three conflicting tempests had smitten it  phew said stalky drawing breath outside the door amid groans of oh you beastly caads you think yourselves awful funny and so forth thats all right never let the sun go down upon your wrath rummy little devils fags got no notion o combinin  six of em sat on my head when i went in after manders minor said beetle i warned em what theyd get though  everybody paid in fullbeautiful feelin said mcturk absently as they strolled along the corridor dont think wed better say much about king though do you stalky  not much our line is injured innocence of coursesame as when the sergeant reported us on suspicion of smoking in the bunkers if i hadnt thought of buyin the pepper and spillin it all over our clothes hed have smelt us king was ghaastly facetious about that called us birdstuffers in form for a week  ah king hates the natural history society because little hartopp is president mustnt do anything in the coll without glorifyin king said mcturk but he must be a putrid ass know to suppose at our time o life wed go and stuff birds like fags  poor old king said beetle hes unpopular in commonroom and theyll chaff his head off about rabbitseggs golly how lovely how beautiful how holy but you should have seen his face when the first rock came in and the earth from the basket  so they were all stricken helpless for five minutes  they repaired at last to abanazars study and were received reverently  whats the matter said stalky quick to realize new atmospheres  you know jolly well said abanazar youll be expelled if you get caught king is a gibbering maniac  who which what expelled for how we only played the wardrum weve got turned out for that already  do you chaps mean to say you didnt make rabbitseggs drunk and bribe him to rock kings rooms  bribe him no that ill swear we didnt said stalky with a relieved heart for he loved not to tell lies what a low mind youve got pussy weve been down having a bath did rabbitseggs rock king strong perseverin man king shockin  awfly kings frothing at the mouth theres bell for prayers come on  wait a sec said stalky continuing the conversation in a loud and cheerful voice as they descended the stairs what did rabbitseggs rock king for  i know said beetle as they passed kings open door i was in his study  hush you ass hissed the emperor of china oh hes gone down to prayers said beetle watching the shadow of the housemaster on the wall rabbitseggs was only a bit drunk swearin at his horse and king jawed him through the window and then of course he rocked king  do you mean to say said stalky that king began it  king was behind them and every wellweighed word went up the staircase like an arrow i can only swear said beetle that king cursed like a bargee simply disgustin im goin to write to my father about it  better report it to mason suggested stalky he knows our tender consciences hold on a shake ive got to tie my bootlace  the other study hurried forward they did not wish to be dragged into stage asides of this nature so it was left to mcturk to sum up the situation beneath the guns of the enemy  you see said the irishman hanging on the banister he begins by bullying little chaps then he bullies the big chaps then he bullies some one who isnt connected with the college and then catches it serves him jolly well right i beg your pardon sir i didnt see you were coming down the staircase  the black gown tore past like a thunderstorm and in its wake three abreast arms linked the aladdin company rolled up the big corridor to prayers singing with most innocent intention     arrah patsy mind the baby arrah patsy mind the child    wrap him up in an overcoat hes surely goin wild    arrah patsy mind the baby just ye mind the child awhile    hell kick an bite an cry all night arrah patsy mind      the child     an unsavory interlude   it was a maiden aunt of stalky who sent him both books with the inscription to dearest artie on his sixteenth birthday it was mcturk who ordered their hypothecation and it was beetle returned from bideford who flung them on the windowsill of number five study with news that bastable would advance but ninepence on the two eric or little by little being almost as great a drug as st winifreds an i dont think much of your aunt were nearly out of cartridges tooartie dear  whereupon stalky rose up to grapple with him but mcturk sat on stalkys head calling him a pureminded boy till peace was declared as they were grievously in arrears with a latin prose as it was a blazing july afternoon and as they ought to have been at a house cricketmatch they began to renew their acquaintance intimate and unholy with the volumes  here we are said mcturk corporal punishment produced on eric the worst effects he burned not with remorse or regretmake a note o that beetle but with shame and violent indignation he glaredoh naughty eric lets get to where he goes in for drink  hold on half a shake heres another sample the sixth he saysis the palladium of all public schools but this lot stalky rapped the gilded bookcant prevent fellows drinkin and stealin an lettin fags out of window at night anan doin what they please golly what weve missednot goin to st winifreds  im sorry to see any boys of my house taking so little interest in their matches  mr prout could move very silently if he pleased though that is no merit in a boys eyes he had flung open the studydoor without knockinganother sinand looked at them suspiciously very sorry indeed i am to see you frowsting in your studies  weve been out ever since dinner sir said mcturk wearily one housematch is just like another and their ploy of that week happened to be rabbitshooting with saloonpistols  i cant see a ball when its coming sir said beetle ive had my giglamps smashed at the nets till i got excused i wasnt any good even as a fag then sir  tuck is probably your form tuck and brewing why cant you three take any interest in the honor of your house  they had heard that phrase till they were wearied the honor of the house was prouts weak point and they knew well how to flick him on the raw  if you order us to go down sir of course well go said stalky with maddening politeness but prout knew better than that he had tried the experiment once at a big match when the three selfisolated stood to attention for half an hour in full view of all the visitors to whom fags subsidized for that end pointed them out as victims of prouts tyranny and prout was a sensitive man  in the infinitely petty confederacies of the commonroom king and macrea fellow housemasters had borne it in upon him that by games and games alone was salvation wrought boys neglected were boys lost they must be disciplined left to himself prout would have made a sympathetic housemaster but he was never so left and with the devilish insight of youth the boys knew to whom they were indebted for his zeal  must we go down sir said mcturk  i dont want to order you to do what a rightthinking boy should do gladly im sorry and he lurched out with some hazy impression that he had sown good seed on poor ground  now what does he suppose is the use of that said beetle  oh hes cracked king jaws him in commonroom about not keepin us up to the mark an macrea burbles about dithcipline an old heffy sits between em sweatin big drops i heard oke the commonroom butler talking to richards prouts houseservant about it down in the basement the other day when i went down to bag some bread said stalky  what did oke say demanded mcturk throwing eric into a corner  oh he said they make more nise nor a nest full o jackdaws an half of it like wed no ears to our heads that waited on em they talks over old proutwhat heve done an left undone about his boys an how their boys be fine boys an hisn be dom bad well oke talked like that you know and richards got awfly wrathy he has a down on king for something or other wonder why  why king talks about prout in formroommakes allusions an all thatonly half the chaps are such asses they cant see what hes drivin at and dyou remember what he said about the casual house last tuesday he meant us they say he says perfectly beastly things to his own house making fun of prouts said beetle  well we didnt come here to mix up in their rows mcturk said wrathfully wholl bathe after callover kings takin it in the cricketfield come on turkey seized his straw and led the way  they reached the sunblistered pavilion over against the gray pebbleridge just before rollcall and asking no questions gathered from kings voice and manner that his house was on the road to victory  ah ha said he turning to show the light of his countenance here we have the ornaments of the casual house at last you consider cricket beneath you i believe the crowd flannelled sniggered and from what i have seen this afternoon i fancy many others of your house hold the same view and may i ask what you purpose to do with your noble selves till teatime  going down to bathe sir said stalky  and whence this sudden zeal for cleanliness there is nothing about you that particularly suggests it indeed so far as i rememberi may be at faultbut a short time ago  five years sir said beetle hotly  king scowled one of you was that thing called a waterfunk yes a waterfunk so now you wish to wash it is well cleanliness never injured a boy ora house we will proceed to business and he addressed himself to the callover board  what the deuce did you say anything to him for beetle said mcturk angrily as they strolled towards the big open seabaths  twasnt fairremindin one of bein a waterfunk my first term too heaps of chaps arewhen they cant swim  yes you ass but he saw hed fetched you you ought never to answer king  but it wasnt fair stalky  my hat youve been here six years and you expect fairness well you are a dithering idiot  a knot of kings boys also bound for the baths hailed them beseeching them to washfor the honor of their house  thats what comes of kings jawin and messin those young animals wouldnt have thought of it unless hed put it into their heads now theyll be funny about it for weeks said stalky dont take any notice  the boys came nearer shouting an opprobrious word at last they moved to windward ostentatiously holding their noses  thats pretty said beetle theyll be sayin our house stinks next  when they returned from the baths dampheaded languid at peace with the world beetles forecast came only too true they were met in the corridor by a faga common lowersecond fagwho at arms length handed them a carefully wrapped piece of soap with the compliments of kings house  hold on said stalky checking immediate attack who put you up to this nixon rattray and white those were two leaders in kings house thank you theres no answer  oh its too sickening to have this kind o rot shoved on to a chap whats the sense of it whats the fun of it said mcturk  it will go on to the end of the term though beetle wagged his head sorrowfully he had worn many jests threadbare on his own account  in a few days it became an established legend of the school that prouts house did not wash and were therefore noisome mr king was pleased to smile succulently in form when one of his boys drew aside from beetle with certain gestures  there seems to be some disability attaching to you my beetle or else why should burton major withdraw so to speak the hem of his garments i confess i am still in the dark will some one be good enough to enlighten me  naturally he was enlightened by half the form  extraordinary most extraordinary however each house has its traditions with which i would not for the world interfere we have a prejudice in favor of washing go on beetlefrom jugurtha tamenand if you can avoid the more flagrant forms of guessing  prouts house was furious because macreas and hartopps houses joined kings to insult them they called a housemeeting after dinneran excited and angry meeting of all save the prefects whose dignity though they sympathized did not allow them to attend they read ungrammatical resolutions and made speeches beginning gentlemen we have met on this occasion and ending with its a beastly shame precisely as houses have done since time and schools began  number five study attended with its usual air of bland patronage at last mcturk of the lanthorn jaws delivered himself  you jabber and jaw and burble and thats about all you can do whats the good of it kings housell only gloat because theyve drawn you and king will gloat too besides that resolution of orrins is chockfull of bad grammar and kingll gloat over that  i thought you an beetle would put it right anan wed post it in the corridor said the composer meekly  par si je le connai im not goin to meddle with the biznai said beetle its a gloat for kings house turkeys quite right  well wont stalky then  but stalky puffed out his cheeks and squinted down his nose in the style of panurge and all he said was oh you abject burblers  youre three beastly scabs was the instant retort of the democracy and they went out amid execrations  this is piffling said mcturk lets get our sallies and go and shoot bunnies  three saloonpistols with a supply of bulleted breechcaps were stored in stalkys trunk and this trunk was in their dormitory and their dormitory was a threebed attic one opening out of a tenbed establishment which in turn communicated with the great range of dormitories that ran practically from one end of the college to the other macreas house lay next to prouts kings next to macreas and hartopps beyond that again carefully locked doors divided house from house but each house in its internal arrangementsthe college had originally been a terrace of twelve large houseswas a replica of the next one straight roof covering all  they found stalkys bed drawn out from the wall to the left of the dormer window and the latter end of richards protruding from a twofootsquare cupboard in the wall  whats all this ive never noticed it before what are you tryin to do fatty  fillin basins muster corkran richardss voice was hollow and muffled theyve been savin me trouble yiss  looks like it said mcturk hi youll stick if you dont take care  richards backed puffing  i cant rache un yiss tess a turncock muster mcturk theyve took an runned all the watterpipes a storey higher in the housesrunned em all along under the ang of the heaves like runned em in last holidays i cant rache the turncock  let me try said stalky diving into the aperture  slip ee to the left then muster corkran slip ee to the left an feel in the dark  to the left stalky wriggled and saw a long line of lead pipe disappearing up a triangular tunnel whose roof was the rafters and boarding of the college roof whose floor was sharpedged joists and whose side was the rough studding of the lath and plaster wall under the dormer  rummy show how far does it go  right along muster corkranright along from end to end her runs under the ang of the heaves have ee rached the stopcock yet mr king got un put in to save us carryin watter from downstairs to fill the basins no place for a lusty man like old richards im tu thickabout to go ferritin thank ee muster corkran  the water squirted through the tap just inside the cupboard and having filled the basins the grateful richards waddled away  the boys sat roundeyed on their beds considering the possibilities of this trove two floors below them they could hear the hum of the angry house for nothing is so still as a dormitory in midafternoon of a midsummer term  it has been papered over till now mcturk examined the little door if wed only known before  i vote we go down and explore no one will come up this time o day we neednt keep cave  they crawled in stalky leading drew the door behind them and on all fours embarked on a dark and dirty road full of plaster odd shavings and all the raffle that builders leave in the waste room of a house the passage was perhaps three feet wide and except for the struggling light round the edges of the cupboards there was one to each dormer almost pitchy dark  heres macreas house said stalky his eye at the crack of the third cupboard i can see barness name on his trunk dont make such a row beetle we can get right to the end of the coll come on were in kings house nowi can see a bit of rattrays trunk how these beastly boards hurt ones knees they heard his nails scraping on plaster  thats the ceiling below look out if we smashed that the plaster ud fall down in the lower dormitory said beetle  lets whispered mcturk  an be collared first thing not much why i can shove my hand ever so far up between these boards  stalky thrust an arm to the elbow between the joists  no good stayin here i vote we go back and talk it over its a crummy place must say im grateful to king for his waterworks  they crawled out brushed one another clean slid the saloonpistols down a trouserleg and hurried forth to a deep and solitary devonshire lane in whose flanks a boy might sometimes slay a young rabbit they threw themselves down under the rank elder bushes and began to think aloud  you know said stalky at last sighting at a distant sparrow we could hide our sallies in there like anything  huh beetle snorted choked and gurgled he had been silent since they left the dormitory did you ever read a book called the history of a house or something i got it out of the library the other day a french woman wrote itviolet somebody but its translated you know and its very interestin tells you how a house is built  well if youre in a sweat to find out that you can go down to the new cottages theyre building for the coastguard  my hat i will he felt in his pockets give me tuppence some one  rot stay here and dont mess about in the sun  gi me tuppence  i say beetle you arent stuffy about anything are you said mcturk handing over the coppers his tone was serious for though stalky often and mcturk occasionally manoeuvred on his own account beetle had never been known to do so in all the history of the confederacy  no im not im thinking  well well come too said stalky with a generals suspicion of his aides  dont want you  oh leave him alone hes been taken worse with a poem said mcturk hell go burbling down to the pebbleridge and spit it all up in the study when he comes back  then why did he want the tuppence turkey hes gettin too beastly independent hi theres a bunny no it aint its a cat by jove you plug first  twenty minutes later a boy with a straw hat at the back of his head and his hands in his pockets was staring at workmen as they moved about a halffinished cottage he produced some ferocious tobacco and was passed from the forecourt into the interior where he asked many questions  well lets have your beastly epic said turkey as they burst into the study to find beetle deep in violletleduc and some drawings weve had no end of a lark  epic what epic ive been down to the coastguard  no epic then we will slay you o beetle said stalky moving to the attack youve got something up your sleeve i know when you talk in that tone  your uncle beetlewith an attempt to imitate stalkys warvoiceis a great man  oh no he jolly well isnt anything of the kind you deceive yourself beetle scrag him turkey  a great man beetle gurgled from the floor you are futilelook out for my tiefutile burblers i am the great man i gloat ouch hear me  beetle deahstalky dropped unreservedly on beetles chestwe love you an youre a poet if i ever said you were a doggaroo i apologize but you know as well as we do that you cant do anything by yourself without mucking it  ive got a notion  and youll spoil the whole show if you dont tell your uncle stalky cough it up ducky and well see what we can do notion you fat impostori knew you had a notion when you went away turkey said it was a poem  ive found out how houses are built le me get up the floorjoists of one room are the ceilingjoists of the room below  dont be so filthy technical  well the man told me the floor is laid on top of those joiststhose boards on edge that we crawled overbut the floor stops at a partition well if you get behind a partition same as you did in the attic dont you see that you can shove anything you please under the floor between the floorboards and the lath and plaster of the ceiling below look here ive drawn it  he produced a rude sketch sufficient to enlighten the allies there is no part of the modern school curriculum that deals with architecture and none of them had yet reflected whether floors and ceilings were hollow or solid outside his own immediate interests the boy is as ignorant as the savage he so admires but he has also the savages resource  i see said stalky i shoved my hand there an then  an then theyve been calling us stinkers you know we might shove somethin undersulphur or something that stunk pretty badan stink em out i know it can be done somehow beetles eyes turned to stalky handling the diagrams  stinks said stalky interrogatively then his face grew luminous with delight by gum ive got it horrid stinks turkey he leaped at the irishman this afternoonjust after beetle went away shes the very thing  come to my arms my beamish boy caroled mcturk and they fell into each others arms dancing oh frabjous day calloo callay she will she will  hold on said beetle i dont understand  dearr man it shall though oh artie my puresouled youth let us tell our darling reggie about pestiferous stinkadores  not until after callover come on  i say said orrin stiffly as they fell into their places along the walls of the gymnasium the house are goin to hold another meeting  hold away then stalkys mind was elsewhere  its about you three this time  all right give em my love here sir and he tore down the corridor  gamboling like kids at play with bounds and sidestarts with caperings and curvetings they led the almost bursting beetle to the rabbitlane and from under a pile of stones drew forth the newslain corpse of a cat then did beetle see the inner meaning of what had gone before and lifted up his voice in thanksgiving for that the world held warriors so wise as stalky and mcturk  wellnourished old lady aint she said stalky how long dyou suppose itll take her to get a bit whiff in a confined space  bit whiff what a coarse brute you are said mcturk cant a poor pussycat get under kings dormitory floor to die without your pursuin her with your foul innuendoes  what did she die under the floor for said beetle looking to the future  oh they wont worry about that when they find her said stalky  a cat may look at a king mcturk rolled down the bank at his own jest pussy you dont know how useful youre goin to be to three puresouled highminded boys  theyll have to take up the floor for her same as they did in number nine when the rat croaked big medicineheap big medicine phew oh lord i wish i could stop laughin said beetle  stinks hi stinks clammy ones mcturk gasped as he regained his place andthe exquisite humor of it brought them sliding down together in a tangleits all for the honor of the house too  an theyre holdin another meetingon us stalky panted his knees in the ditch and his face in the long grass well lets get the bullet out of her and hurry up the sooner shes bedded out the better  between them they did some grisly work with a penknife between them ask not who buttoned her to his bosom they took up the corpse and hastened back stalky arranging their plan of action at the full trot  the afternoon sun lying in broad patches on the bedrugs saw three boys and an umbrella disappear into a dormitory wall in five minutes they emerged brushed themselves all over washed their hands combed their hair and descended  are you sure you shoved her far enough under said mcturk suddenly  hang it man i shoved her the full length of my arm and beetles brolly that must be about six feet shes bung in the middle of kings big upper tenbedder eligible central situation i call it shell stink out his chaps and hartopps and macreas when she really begins to fume i swear your uncle stalky is a great man do you realize what a great man he is beetle  well i had the notion first hadnt i only  you couldnt do it without your uncle stalky could you  theyve been calling us stinkers for a week now said mcturk oh wont they catch it  stinker yah stinkah rang down the corridor  and shes there said stalky a hand on either boys shoulder sheisthere gettin ready to surprise em presently shell begin to whisper to em in their dreams then shell whiff golly how shell whiff oblige me by thinkin of it for two minutes  they went to their study in more or less of silence there they began to laughlaugh as only boys can they laughed with their foreheads on the tables or on the floor laughed at length curled over the backs of chairs or clinging to a bookshelf laughed themselves limp  and in the middle of it orrin entered on behalf of the house dont mind us orrin sit down you dont know how we respect and admire you theres something about your pure high young forehead full of the dreams of innocent boyhood thats no end fetchin it is indeed  the house sent me to give you this he laid a folded sheet of paper on the table and retired with an awful front  its the resolution oh read it some one im too sillysick with laughin to see said beetle stalky jerked it open with a precautionary sniff phew phew listen the house notices with pain and contempt the attitude of indiference how many fs in indifference beetle  two for choice  only one hereadopted by the occupants of number five study in relation to the insults offered to mr prouts house at the recent meeting in number twelve formroom and the house hereby pass a vote of censure on the said study thats all  and she bled all down my shirt too said beetle  an im catty all over said mcturk though i washed twice  an i nearly broke beetles brolly plantin her where she would blossom  the situation was beyond speech but not laughter there was some attempt that night to demonstrate against the three in their dormitory so they came forth  you see beetle began suavely as he loosened his braces the trouble with you is that youre a set of unthinkin asses youve no more brains than spidgers weve told you that heaps of times havent we  well give the three of you a dormitory lickin you always jaw at us as if you were prefects cried one  oh no you wont said stalky because you know that if you did youd get the worst of it sooner or later we arent in any hurry we can afford to wait for our little revenges youve made howlin asses of yourselves and just as soon as king gets hold of your precious resolutions tomorrow youll find that out if you arent sick an sorry by tomorrow night illill eat my hat  but or ever the dinnerbell rang the next day prouts were sadly aware of their error king received stray members of that house with an exaggerated attitude of fear did they purpose to cause him to be dismissed from the college by unanimous resolution what were their views concerning the government of the school that he might hasten to give effect to them he would not offend them for worlds but he fearedhe sadly fearedthat his own house who did not pass resolutions but washed might somewhat deride  king was a happy man and his house basking in the favor of his smile made that afternoon a long penance to the misled prouts and prout himself with a dull and lowering visage tried to think out the rights and wrongs of it all only plunging deeper into bewilderment why should his house be called stinkers truly it was a small thing but he had been trained to believe that straws show which way the wind blows and that there is no smoke without fire he approached king in commonroom with a sense of injustice but king was pleased to be full of airy persiflage that tide and brilliantly danced dialectical rings round prout  now said stalky at bedtime making pilgrimage through the dormitories before the prefects came by now what have you got to say for yourselves foster carton finch longbridge marlin brett i heard you chaps catchin it from kinghe made hay of youan all you could do was to wriggle an grin an say yes sir an no sir an o sir an please sir you an your resolution urh  oh shut up stalky  not a bit of it youre a gaudy lot of resolutionists you are youve made a sweet mess of it perhaps youll have the decency to leave us alone next time  here the house grew angry and in many voices pointed out how this blunder would never have come to pass if number five study had helped them from the first  but you chaps are so beastly conceited anan you swaggered into the meetin as if we were a lot of idiots growled orrin of the resolution  thats precisely what you are thats what weve been tryin to hammer into your thick heads all this time said stalky never mind well forgive you cheer up you cant help bein asses you know and the enemys flank deftly turned stalky hopped into bed  that night was the first of sorrow among the jubilant kings by some accident of underfloor drafts the cat did not vex the dormitory beneath which she lay but the next one to the right stealing on the air rather as a paleblue sensation than as any poignant offense but the mere adumbration of an odor is enough for the sensitive nose and clean tongue of youth decency demands that we draw several carbolized sheets over what the dormitory said to mr king and what mr king replied he was genuinely proud of his house and fastidious in all that concerned their wellbeing he came he sniffed he said things next morning a boy in that dormitory confided to his bosom friend a fag of macreas that there was trouble in their midst which king would fain keep secret  but macreas boy had also a bosom friend in prouts a shockheaded fag of malignant disposition who when he had wormed out the secret toldtold it in a highpitched treble that rang along the corridor like a bats squeak  anan theyve been calling us stinkers all this week why harland minor says they simply cant sleep in his dormitory for the stink come on  with one shout and with one cry prouts juniors hurled themselves into the war and through the interval between first and second lesson some fifty twelveyearolds were embroiled on the gravel outside kings windows to a tune whose leitmotif was the word stinker  hark to the minutegun at sea said stalky they were in their study collecting books for second lessonlatin with king i thought his azure brow was a bit cloudy at prayers she is comin sister mary she is  if they make such a row now what will they do when she really begins to look up an take notice  well no vulgar repartee beetle all we want is to keep out of this row like gentlemen  tis but a little faded flower wheres my horace look here i dont understand what she means by stinkin out rattrays dormitory first we holed in under whites didnt we asked mcturk with a wrinkled brow  skittish little thing shes rompin about all over the place i suppose  my aunt kingll be a cheerful customer at second lesson i havent prepared my horace one little bit either said beetle come on  they were outside the formroom door now it was within five minutes of the bell and king might arrive at any moment  turkey elbowed into a cohort of scuffling fags cut out thornton tertius he that had been harlands bosom friend and bade him tell his tale  it was a simple one interrupted by tears many of kings house trod already battered him for libel  oh its nothing mcturk cried he says that kings house stinks thats all  stale stalky shouted we knew that years ago only we didnt choose to run about shoutin stinker weve got some manners ir they havent catch a fag turkey and make sure of it  turkeys long arm closed on a hurried and anxious ornament of the lower second  oh mcturk please let me go i dont stinki swear i dont  guilty conscience cried beetle who said you did  what dyou make of it stalky punted the small boy into beetles arms  snf snf he does though i think its leprosyor thrush praps its both take it away  indeed master beetleking generally came to the housedoor for a minute or two as the bell rangwe are vastly indebted to you for your diagnosis which seems to reflect almost as much credit on the natural unwholesomeness of your mind as it does upon your pitiful ignorance of the diseases of which you discourse so glibly we will however test your knowledge in other directions  that was a merry lesson but in his haste to scarify beetle king clean neglected to give him an imposition and since at the same time he supplied him with many priceless adjectives for later use beetle was well content and applied himself most seriously throughout third lesson algebra with little hartopp to composing a poem entitled the lazarhouse  after dinner king took his house to bathe in the sea off the pebbleridge it was an old promise but he wished he could have evaded it for all prouts lined up by the fives court and cheered with intention in his absence not less than half the school invaded the infected dormitory to draw their own conclusions the cat had gained in the last twelve hours but a battlefield of the fifth day could not have been so flamboyant as the spies reported  my word she is doin herself proud said stalky did you ever smell anything like it ah an she isnt under whites dormitory at all yet  but she will be give her time said beetle shell twine like a giddy honeysuckle what howlin lazarites they are no house is justified in makin itself a stench in the nostrils of decent  highminded puresouled boys do you burn with remorse and regret said mcturk as they hastened to meet the house coming up from the sea king had deserted it so speech was unfettered round its front played a crowd of skirmishersall houses mixedflying reforming shrieking insults on its tortured flanks marched the hoplites seniors hurling jests one after anothersimple and primitive jests of the stone age to these the three added themselves dispassionately with an air of aloofness almost sadly  and they look all right too said stalky it cant be rattray can it rattray  no answer  rattray dear he seems stuffy about something or other look here old man we dont bear any malice about your sending that soap to us last week do we be cheerful rat you can live this down all right i dare say its only a few fags your house is so beastly slack though  you arent going back to the house are you said mcturk the victims desired nothing better youve simply no conception of the reek up there of course frowzin as you do you wouldnt notice it but after this nice wash and the clean fresh air even youd be upset much better camp on the burrows well get you some straw shall we the house hurried in to the tune of john browns body sung by loving schoolmates and barricaded themselves in their formroom straightway stalky chalked a large cross with lord have mercy upon us on the door and left king to find it  the wind shifted that night and wafted a carrionreek into macreas dormitories so that boys in nightgowns pounded on the locked door between the houses entreating kings to wash number five study went to second lesson with not more than half a pound of camphor apiece in their clothing and king too wary to ask for explanations gibbered a while and hurled them forth so beetle finished yet another poem at peace in the study  theyre usin carbolic now malpas told me said stalky king thinks its the drains  shell need a lot o carbolic said mcturk no harm tryin i suppose it keeps king out of mischief  i swear i thought he was goin to kill me when i sniffed just now he didnt mind burton major sniffin at me the other day though he never stopped alexander howlin stinker into our formroom beforebefore we doctored em he just grinned said stalky what was he frothing over you for beetle  aha that was my subtle jape i had him on toast you know he always jaws about the learned lipsius  who at the age of fourthat chap said mcturk  yes whenever he hears ive written a poem well just as i was sittin down i whispered how is our learned lepsius to burton major old butt grinned like an owl he didnt know what i was drivin at but king jolly well did that was really why he hove us out aint you grateful now shut up im goin to write the ballad of the learned lipsius  keep clear of anything coarse then said stalky i shouldnt like to be coarse on this happy occasion  not for woorlds what rhymes to stenches someone  in commonroom at lunch king discoursed acridly to prout of boys with prurient minds who perverted their few and baleful talents to sap discipline and corrupt their equals to deal in foul imagery and destroy reverence  but you didnt seem to consider this when your house called usahstinkers if you hadnt assured me that you never interfere with another mans house i should almost believe that it was a few casual remarks of yours that started all this nonsense  prout had endured much for king always took his temper to meals  you spoke to beetle yourself didnt you something about not bathing and being a waterfunk the school chaplain put in i was scoring in the pavilion that day  i may havejestingly i really dont pretend to remember every remark i let fall among small boys and full well i know the beetle has no feelings to be hurt  may be but he or theyit comes to to same thinghave the fiends own knack of discovering a mans weak place i confess i rather go out of my way to conciliate number five study it may be soft but so far i believe i am the only man here whom they havent maddened by theirwellattentions  that is all beside the point i flatter myself i can deal with them alone as occasion arises but if they feel themselves morally supported by those who should wield an absolute and openhanded justice then i say that my lot is indeed a hard one of all things i detest i admit that anything verging on disloyalty among ourselves is the first  the commonroom looked at one another out of the corners of their eyes and prout blushed  i deny it absolutely he said erin fact i own that i personally object to all three of them it is not fair therefore to  how long do you propose to allow it said king  but surely said macrea deserting his usual ally the blame if there be any rests with you king you cant hold them responsible for theyou prefer the good old anglosaxon i believestink in your house my boys are complaining of it now  what can you expect you know what boys are naturally they take advantage of what to them is a heavensent opportunity said little hartopp what is the trouble in your dormitories king  mr king explained that as he had made it the one rule of his life never to interfere with another mans house so he expected not to be too patently interfered with they might be interested to learnhere the chaplain heaved a weary sighthat he had taken all steps that in his poor judgment would meet the needs of the case nay further he had himself expended with no thought of reimbursement sums the amount of which he would not specify on disinfectants this he had done because he knew by bitterby most bitterexperience that the management of the college was slack dilatory and inefficient he might even add almost as slack as the administration of certain houses which now thought fit to sit in judgment on his actions with a short summary of his scholastic career and a precis of his qualifications including his degrees he withdrew slamming the door  heigho said the chaplain ours is a dwarfing lifea belittling life my brethren god help all schoolmasters they need it  i dont like the boys i ownprout dug viciously with his fork into the tableclothand i dont pretend to be a strong man as you know but i confess i cant see any reason why i should take steps against stalky and the others because king happens to be annoyed byby  falling into the pit he has digged said little hartopp certainly not prout no one accuses you of setting one house against another through sheer idleness  a belittling lifea belittling life the chaplain rose i go to correct french exercises by dinner king will have scored off some unlucky child of thirteen he will repeat to us every word of his brilliant repartees and all will be well  but about those three are they so prurientminded  nonsense said little hartopp if you thought for a minute prout you would see that the precocious flow of fetid imagery that king complains of is borrowed wholesale from king he nursed the pinion that impelled the steel naturally he does not approve come into the smokingroom for a minute it isnt fair to listen to boys but they should be now rubbing it into kings house outside little things please little minds  the dingy den off the commonroom was never used for anything except gowns its windows were ground glass one could not see out of it but one could hear almost every word on the gravel outside a light and wary footstep came up from number five  rattray in a subdued voicerattrays study fronted that way dyou know if mr kings anywhere about ive got a mcturk discreetly left the end of the sentence open  no hes gone out said rattray unguardedly  ah the learned lipsius is airing himself is he his royal highness has gone to fumigate mcturk climbed on the railings where he held forth like the neverwearied rook  now in all the coll there was no stink like the stink of kings house for it stank vehemently and none knew what to make of it save king and he washed the fags privatim et seriatim in the fishpools of hesbon washed he them with an apron about his loins  shut up you mad irishman there was the sound of a golfball spurting up gravel  its no good getting wrathy rattray weve come to jape with you come on beetle theyre all at home you can wind em  wheres the pomposo stinkadore tisnt safe for a puresouled highminded boy to be seen round his house these days gone out has he never mind ill do the best i can rattray im in loco parentis just now  one for you prout whispered macrea for this was mr prouts pet phrase  i have a few words to impart to you my young friend we will discourse together a while  here the listening prout sputtered beetle in a strained voice had chosen a favorite gambit of kings  i repeat master rattray we will confer and the matter of our discourse shall not be stinks for that is a loathsome and obscene word we will with your good leavegranted i trust master rattray granted i truststudy thisthis scabrous upheaval of latent demoralization what impresses me most is not so much the blatant indecency with which you swagger abroad under your load of putrescence you must imagine this discourse punctuated with golfballs but old rattray was ever a bad shot as the cynical immorality with which you revel in your abhorrent aromas far be it from me to interfere with anothers house  good lord said prout but this is king  line for line letter for letter listen said little hartopp  but to say that you stink as certain lewd fellows of the baser sort aver is to say nothingless than nothing in the absence of your beloved housemaster for whom no one has a higher regard than myself i will if you will allow me explain the grossnessthe unparalleled enormitythe appalling fetor of the stenches i believe in the good old anglosaxon word stenches sir with which you have seen fit to infect your house oh bother ive forgotten the rest but it was very beautiful arent you grateful to us for laborin with you this way rattray lots of chaps ud never have taken the trouble but were grateful rattray  yes were horrid grateful grunted mcturk we dont forget that soap were polite why aint you polite rat  hallo stalky cantered up his cap over one eye exhortin the whiffers eh im afraid theyre too far gone to repent rattray white perowne malpas no answer this is distressin this is truly distressin bring out your dead you glandered lepers  you think yourself funny dont you said rattray stung from his dignity by this last its only a rat or something under the floor were going to have it up tomorrow  dont try to shuffle it off on a poor dumb animal and dead too i loathe prevarication pon my soul rattray  hold on the hartoffles never said pon my soul in all his little life said beetle critically  ah said prout to little hartopp  upon my word sir upon my word sir i expected better things of you rattray why can you not own up to your misdeeds like a man have i ever shown any lack of confidence in you  its not brutality murmured little hartopp as though answering a question no one had asked its boy only boy  and this was the house stalky changed from a pecking fluttering voice to tragic earnestness this was thetheopen cesspit that dared to call us stinkers and nowand now it tries to shelter itself behind a dead rat you annoy me rattray you disgust me you irritate me unspeakably thank heaven i am a man of equable temper  this is to your address macrea said prout  i fear so i fear so  or i should scarcely be able to contain myself before your mocking visage  cave in an undertone beetle had spied king sailing down the corridor  and what may you be doing here my little friends the housemaster began i had a fleeting notioncorrect me if i am wrong the listeners with one accord chokedthat if i found you outside my house i should visit you with dire pains and penalties  we were just goin for a walk sir said beetle  and you stopped to speak to rattray en route  yes sir weve been throwing golfballs said rattray coming out of the study  old rat is more of a diplomat than i thought so far he is strictly within the truth said little hartopp observe the ethics of it prout  oh you were sporting with them were you i must say i do not envy you your choice of associates i fancied they might have been engaged in some of the prurient discourse with which they have been so disgustingly free of late i should strongly advise you to direct your steps most carefully in the future pick up those golfballs he passed on   next day richards who had been a carpenter in the navy and to whom odd jobs were confided was ordered to take up a dormitory floor for mr king held that something must have died there  we need not neglect all our work for a trumpery incident of this nature though i am quite aware that little things please little minds yes i have decreed the boards to be taken up after lunch under richardss auspices i have no doubt it will be vastly interesting to a certain type of socalled intellect but any boy of my house or anothers found on the dormitory stairs will ipso facto render himself liable to three hundred lines  the boys did not collect on the stairs but most of them waited outside kings richards had been bound to cry the news from the attic window and if possible to exhibit the corpse  tis a cat a dead cat richardss face showed purple at the window he had been in the chamber of death and on his knees for some time  cat be blowed cried mcturk its a dead fag left over from last term three cheers for kings dead fag  they cheered lustily  show it show it lets have a squint at it yelled the juniors give her to the bughunters this was the natural history society the cat looked at the kingand died of it hoosh yai yaow maiow ftzz were some of the cries that followed  again richards appeared  sheve beenhe checked himself suddenlydead a long taime  the school roared  well come on out for a walk said stalky in a wellchosen pause its all very disgustin and i do hope the lazarhouse wont do it again  do what a kings boy cried furiously  kill a poor innocent cat every time you want to get off washing its awfully hard to distinguish between you as it is i prefer the cat i must say she isnt quite so whiff what are you goin to do beetle  je vais gloater je vais gloater tout le blessed afternoon jamais jai gloate comme je gloaterai aujourdhui nous bunkerons aux bunkers  and it seemed good to them so to do   down in the basement where the gas flickers and the boots stand in racks richards amid his blackingbrushes held forth to oke of the commonroom gumbly of the dininghalls and fair lena of the laundry  yiss her were in a shockin staate an condition her nigh made me sick i tal ee but i rowted un out and i rowted un out an i made all shipshape though her smelt like to bilges  her died mousin i reckon poor thing said lena  then her moused different to any made cat o gods world lena i up with the topboard an she were lying on her back an i turned un ovver with the brumehandle an twas her back was all covered with the plaster from twixt the lathin yiss i tal ee an under her head there lay like sos to say a little pillow o plaster druv up in front of her by raison of her slidin along on her back no cat niver went mousin on her back lena some one had shoved her along right underneath so far as they could shove un cats dont make theyselves pillows for to die on shoved along she were when she was settin for to be cold laike  oh yeoum too clever to live fatty yeou go get wed an taught some sense said lena the affianced of gumbly  larned a little fore iver some maidens was born sarved in the queens navy i have where yeoum taught to use your eyes yeou go tend your own business lena  do ee mean what youm been tellin us said oke  ask me no questions ill give ee no lies bullethole clane thru from side to side an tu heartribs broke like withies i seed un when i turned un ovver theyre clever oh theym clever but theym not too clever for old richards twas on the born tip o my tongue to tell tu but he said us niver washed he did let his dom boys call us stinkers he did sarve un dom well raight i say  richards spat on a fresh boot and fell to his work chuckling     the impressionists   they had dropped into the chaplains study for a saturday night smokeall four housemastersand the three briars and the one cigar reeking in amity proved the rev john gilletts good generalship since the discovery of the cat king had been too ready to see affront where none was meant and the reverend john bufferstate and general confidant had worked for a week to bring about a good understanding he was fat cleanshaven except for a big mustache of an imperturbable good temper and those who loved him least said a guileful jesuit he smiled benignantly upon his handiworkfour sorely tried men talking without very much malice  now remember he said when the conversation turned that way i impute nothing but every time that any one has taken direct steps against number five study the issue has been more or less humiliating to the taker  i cant admit that i pulverize the egregious beetle daily for his souls good and the others with him said king  well take your own case king and go back a couple of years do you remember when prout and you were on their track for hutting and trespass wasnt it have you forgotten colonel dabney  the others laughed king did not care to be reminded of his career as a poacher  that was one instance again when you had rooms below themi always said that that was entering the lions denyou turned them out  for making disgusting noises surely gillett you dont excuse  all i say is that you turned them out that same evening your study was wrecked  by rabbitseggsmost beastly drunkfrom the road said king what has that  the reverend john went on  lastly they conceive that aspersions are cast upon their personal cleanlinessa most delicate matter with all boys very good observe how in each case the punishment fits the crime a week after your house calls them stinkers king your house is not to put too fine a point on it stunk out by a dead cat who chooses to die in the one spot where she can annoy you most again the long arm of coincidence summa you accuse them of trespass through some absurd chain of circumstancesthey may or may not be at the other end of ityou and prout are made to appear as trespassers you evict them for a time your study is made untenable i have drawn the parallel in the last case well  she was under the centre of whites dormitory said king there are double floorboards there to deaden noise no boy even in my own house could possibly have pried up the boards without leaving some traceand rabbitseggs was phenomenally drunk that other night  they are singularly favored by fortune that is all i ever said personally i like them immensely and i believe i have a little of their confidence i confess i like being called padre they are at peace with me consequently i am not treated to bogus confessions of theft  you mean masons case said prout heavily that always struck me as peculiarly scandalous i thought the head should have taken up the matter more thoroughly mason may be misguided but at least he is thoroughly sincere and means well  i confess i cannot agree with you prout said the reverend john he jumped at some silly tale of theft on their part accepted another boys evidence without so far as i can see any inquiry andfrankly i think he deserved all he got  they deliberately outraged masons best feelings said prout a word to me on their part would have saved the whole thing but they preferred to lure him on to play on his ignorance of their characters  that may be said king but i dont like mason i dislike him for the very reason that prout advances to his credit he means well  our criminal tradition is not theftamong ourselves at least said little hartopp  for the head of a house that raided seven head of cattle from the innocent potwallopers of northam isnt that rather a sweeping statement said macrae  precisely so said hartopp unabashed that with gatelifting and a little poaching and hawkhunting on the cliffs is our salvation  it does us far more harm as a school prout began  than any hushedup scandal could quite so our reputation among the farmers is most unsavory but i would much sooner deal with any amount of ingenious crime of that nature thansome other offenses  they may be all right but they are unboylike abnormal and in my opinion unsound prout insisted the moral effect of their performances must pave the way for greater harm it makes me doubtful how to deal with them i might separate them  you might of course but they have gone up the school together for six years i shouldnt care to do it said macrae  they use the editorial we said king irrelevantly it annoys me wheres your prose corkran well sir we havent quite done it yet well bring it in a minute and so on and the same with the others  theres great virtue in that we said little hartopp you know i take them for trig mcturk may have some conception of the meaning of it but beetle is as the brutes that perish about sines and cosines he copies serenely from stalky who positively rejoices in mathematics  why dont you stop it said prout  it rights itself at the exams then beetle shows up blank sheets and trusts to his english to save him from a fall i fancy he spends most of his time with me in writing verse  i wish to heaven he would transfer a little of his energy in that direction to elegiaes king jerked himself upright he is with the single exception of stalky the very vilest manufacturer of barbarous hexameters that i have ever dealt with  the work is combined in that study said the chaplain stalky does the mathematics mcturk the latin and beetle attends to their english and french at least when he was in the sickhouse last month  malingering prout interjected  quite possibly i found a very distinct falling off in their roman dun jeune homme pauvre translations  i think it is profoundly immoral said prout ive always been opposed to the study system  it would be hard to find any study where the boys dont help each other but in number five the thing has probably been reduced to a system said little hartopp they have a system in most things  they confess as much said the reverend john ive seen mcturk being hounded up the stairs to elegise the elegy in a churchyard while beetle and stalky went to puntabout  it amounts to systematic cribbing said prout his voice growing deeper and deeper  no such thing little hartopp returned you cant teach a cow the violin  in intention it is cribbing  but we spoke under the seal of the confessional didnt we said the reverend john  you say youve heard them arranging their work in this way gillett prout persisted  good heavens dont make me queens evidence my dear fellow hartopp is equally incriminated if they ever found out that i had sneaked our relations would sufferand i value them  i think your attitude in this matter is weak said prout looking round for support it would be really better to break up the studyfor a whilewouldnt it  oh break it up by all means said macrae we shall see then if gilletts theory holds water  be wise prout leave them alone or calamity will overtake you and what is much more important they will be annoyed with me i am too fat alas to be worried by bad boys where are you going  nonsense they would not darebut i am going to think this out said prout it needs thought in intention they cribbed and i must think out my duty  hes perfectly capable of putting the boys on their honor its i that am a fool the reverend john looked round remorsefully never again will i forget that a master is not a man mark my words said the reverend john there will be trouble      but by the yellow tiber    was tumult and affright  out of the blue sky they were still rejoicing over the cat war mr prout had dropped into number five read them a lecture on the enormity of cribbing and bidden them return to the formrooms on monday they had raged solo and chorus all through the peaceful sabbath for their sin was more or less the daily practice of all the studies  whats the good of cursing said stalky at last were all in the same boat weve got to go back and consort with the house a locker in the formroom and a seat at prep in number twelve he looked regretfully round the cozy study which mcturk their leader in matters of art had decorated with a dado a stencil and cretonne hangings  yes heffy lurchin into the formrooms like a frowzy old retriever to see if we arent up to something you know he never leaves his house alone these days said mcturk oh it will be giddy  why arent you down watchin cricket i like a robust healthy boy you mustnt frowst in a formroom why dont you take an interest in your house yah quoted beetle  yes why dont we lets well take an interest in the house well take no end of interest in the house he hasnt had us in the formrooms for a year weve learned a lot since then oh well make it a beautiful house before weve done member that chap in eric or st winifredsbelial somebody im goin to be belial said stalky with an ensnaring grin  right o said beetle and ill be mammon ill lend money at usurythats what they do at all schools accordin to the bop penny a week on a shillin thatll startle heffys weak intellect you can be lucifer turkey  what have i got to do mcturk also smiled  head conspiraciesand cabalsand boycotts go in for that stealthy intrigue that heffy is always talkin about come on  the house received them on their fall with the mixture of jest and sympathy always extended to boys turned out of their study the known aloofness of the three made them more interesting  quite like old times aint it stalky selected a locker and flung in his books weve come to sport with you my young friends for a while because our beloved housemaster has hove us out of our diggins  serve you jolly well right said orrin you cribbers  this will never do said stalky we cant maintain our giddy prestige orrin deah if you make these remarks  they wrapped themselves lovingly about the boy thrust him to the opened window and drew down the sash to the nape of his neck with an equal swiftness they tied his thumbs together behind his back with a piece of twine and then because he kicked furiously removed his shoes there mr prout happened to find him a few minutes later guillotined and helpless surrounded by a convulsed crowd who would not assist  stalky in an upper formroom had gathered himself allies against vengeance orrin presently tore up at the head of a boarding party and the formroom grew one fog of dust through which boys wrestled stamped shouted and yelled a desk was carried away in the tumult a knot of warriors reeled into and split a doorpanel a window was broken and a gasjet fell under cover of the confusion the three escaped to the corridor whence they called in and sent up passersby to the fray  rescue kings kings kings number twelve formroom rescue proutsprouts rescue macraes rescue hartopps  the juniors hurried out like bees aswarm asking no questions clattered up the staircase and added themselves to the embroilment  not bad for the first evenings work said stalky rearranging his collar i fancy proutll be somewhat annoyed wed better establish an alibi so they sat on mr kings railings till prep  you see quoth stalky as they strolled up to prep with the ignoble herd if you get the houses well mixed up an scufflin its even bettin that some ass will start a real row hullo orrin you look rather metagrobolized  it was all your fault you beast you started it weve got two hundred lines apiece and heffys lookin for you just see what that swine malpas did to my eye  i like your saying we started it who called us cribbers cant your infant mind connect cause and effect yet some day youll find out that it dont pay to jest with number five  wheres that shillin you owe me said beetle suddenly  stalky could not see prout behind him but returned the lead without a quaver i only owed you ninepence you old usurer  youve forgotten the interest said mcturk a halfpenny a week per bob is beetles charge you must be beastly rich beetle  well beetle lent me sixpence stalky came to a full stop and made as to work it out on his fingers sixpence on the nineteenth didnt he  yes but youve forgotten you paid no interest on the other bobthe one i lent you before  but you took my watch as security the game was developing itself almost automatically  never mind pay me my interest or ill charge you interest on interest remember ive got your noteofhand shouted beetle  you are a coldblooded jew stalky groaned  hush said mcturk very loudly indeed and started as prout came upon them  i didnt see you in that disgraceful affair in the formroom just now said he  what sir were just come up from mr kings said stalky please sir what am i to do about prep theyve broken the desk you told me to sit at and the forms just swimming with ink  find another seatfind another seat dyou expect me to drynurse you i wish to know whether you are in the habit of advancing money to your associates beetle  no sir not as a general rule sir  it is a most reprehensible habit i thought that my house at least would be free from it even with my opinion of you i hardly thought it was one of your vices  theres no harm in lending money sir is there  i am not going to bandy words with you on your notions of morality how much have you lent corkran  ii dont quite know said beetle it is difficult to improvise a going concern on the spur of the minute  you seemed certain enough just now  i think its two and fourpence said mcturk with a glance of cold scorn at beetle in the hopelessly involved finances of the study there was just that sum to which both mcturk and beetle laid claim as their share in the pledging of stalkys secondbest sunday trousers but stalky had maintained for two terms that the money was his commission for effecting the pawn and had of course spent it on a study brew  understand this then you are not to continue your operations as a moneylender two and fourpence you said corkran  stalky had said nothing and continued so to do  your influence for evil is quite strong enough without buying a hold over your companions he felt in his pockets and oh joy produced a florin and fourpence bring me what you call corkrans noteofhand and be thankful that i do not carry the matter any further the money is stopped from your pocketmoney corkran the receipt to my study at once  little they cared two and fourpence in a lump is worth six weekly sixpences any hungry day of the week  but what the dooce is a noteofhand said beetle i only read about it in a book  now youve jolly well got to make one said stalky  yesbut our ink dont turn black till next day spose hell spot that  not him hes too worried said mcturk sign your name on a bit of impotpaper stalky and write i o u two and fourpence arent you grateful to me for getting that out of prout stalkyd never have paid why you ass  mechanically beetle had handed over the money to stalky as treasurer of the study the custom of years is not lightly broken in return for the document prout expounded to beetle the enormity of moneylending which like everything except compulsory cricket corrupted houses and destroyed good feeling among boys made youth cold and calculating and opened the door to all evil finally did beetle know of any other cases if so it was his duty as proof of repentance to let his housemaster know no names need be mentioned  beetle did not knowat least he was not quite sure sir how could he give evidence against his friends the house might of coursehere he feigned an anguished delicacybe full of it he was not in a position to say he had not met with any open competition in his trade but if mr prout considered it was a matter that affected the honor of the house mr prout did consider it precisely that perhaps the houseprefects would be better  he spun it out till halfway through prep  and said the amateur shylock returning to the formroom and dropping at stalkys side if he dont think the house is putrid with it im several dutchmenthats all ive been to mr prouts study sir this to the prepmaster he said i could sit where i liked sir oh he is just tricklin with emotion yes sir im only askin corkran to let me have a dip in his ink  after prayers on the road to the dormitories harrison and craye senior houseprefects zealous in their office waylaid them with great anger what have you been doing to heffy this time beetle hes been jawing us all the evening  what has his serene transparency been vexin you for said mcturk  about beetle lendin money to stalky began harrison and then beetle went and told him that there was any amount of moneylendin in the house  no you dont said beetle sitting on a bootbasket thats just what i didnt tell him i spoke the giddy truth he asked me if there was much of it in the house and i said i didnt know  he thinks youre a set of filthy shylocks said mcturk its just as well for you he dont think youre burglars you know he never gets a notion out of his conscientious old head  wellmeanin man did it all for the best stalky curled gracefully round the stairrail head in a drainpipe full confession in the left boot bad for the honor of the housevery  shut up said harrison you chaps always behave as if you were jawin us when we come to jaw you  youre a lot too cheeky said craye  i dont quite see where the cheek comes in except on your part in interferin with a private matter between me an beetle after it has been settled by prout stalky winked cheerfully at the others  thats the worst of clever little swots said mcturk addressing the gas they get made prefects before they have any tact and then they annoy chaps who could really help em to look after the honor of the house  we wont trouble you to do that said craye hotly  then what are you badgerin us for said beetle on your own showing youve been so beastly slack looking after the house that prout believes its a nest of moneylenders ive told him that ive lent money to stalky and no one else i dont know whether he believes me but that finishes my case the rest is your business  now we find out stalkys voice rose that there is apparently an organized conspiracy throughout the house for aught we know the fags may be lendin and borrowin far beyond their means we arent responsible for it were only the rank and file  are you surprised we dont wish to associate with the house said mcturk with dignity weve kept ourselves to ourselves in our study till we were turned out and now we find ourselves let in for for this sort of thing its simply disgraceful  then you hector and bullyrag us on the stairs said stalky about matters that are your business entirely you know we arent prefects  you threatened us with a prefects lickin just now said beetle boldly inventing as he saw the bewilderment in the faces of the enemy and if you expect youll gain anything from us by your way of approachin us youre jolly well mistaken thats all goodnight  they clattered upstairs injured virtue on every inch of their backs  butbut what the dickens have we done said harrison amazedly to craye  i dont know onlyit always happens that way when one has anything to do with them theyre so beastly plausible  and mr prout called the good boys into his study anew and succeeded in sinking both his and their innocent minds ten fathoms deeper in blindfolded bedazement he spoke of steps and measures of tone and loyalty in the house and to the house and urged them to take up the matter tactfully  so they demanded of beetle whether he had any connection with any other establishment beetle promptly went to his housemaster and wished to know by what right harrison and craye had reopened a matter already settled between him and his housemaster in injured innocence no boy excelled beetle  then it occurred to prout that he might have been unfair to the culprit who had not striven to deny or palliate his offense he sent for harrison and craye reprehending them very gently for the tone they had adopted to a repentant sinner and when they returned to their study they used the language of despair they then made headlong inquisition through the house driving the fags to the edge of hysterics and unearthing with tremendous pomp and parade the natural and inevitable system of small loans that prevails among small boys  you see harrison thornton minor lent me a penny last saturday because i was fined for breaking the window and i spent it at keytes i didnt know there was any harm in it and wray major borrowed twopence from me when my uncle sent me a postoffice orderi cashed it at keytesfor five bob but hell pay me back before the holidays we didnt know there was anything wrong in it  they waded through hours of this kind of thing but found no usury or anything approaching to beetles gorgeous scale of interest the seniorsfor the school had no tradition of deference to prefects outside compulsory gamestold them succinctly to go about their business they would not give evidence on any terms harrison was one idiot and craye was another but the greatest of all they said was their housemaster  when a house is thoroughly upset however good its conscience it breaks into knots and coteriessmall gatherings in the twilight boxroom committees and groups in the corridor and when from group to group with an immense affectation of secrecy three wicked boys steal crying cave when there is no need of caution and whispering dont tell on the heels of trumpery confidences that instant invented a very fine air of plot and intrigue can be woven round such a house  at the end of a few days it dawned on prout that he moved in an atmosphere of perpetual ambush mysteries hedged him on all sides warnings ran before his heavy feet and countersigns were muttered behind his attentive back mcturk and stalky invented many absurd and idle phrasescatchwords that swept through the house as fire through stubble it was a rare jest and the only practical outcome of the usury commission that one boy should say to a friend with awful gravity do you think theres much of it going on in the house the other would reply well one cant be too careful you know the effect on a housemaster of humane conscience and good intent may be imagined again a man who has sincerely devoted himself to gaining the esteem of his charges does not like to hear himself described even at a distance as popularity prout by a dark and scowling celt with a fluent tongue a rumor that storiesunusual storiesare told in the formrooms between the lights by a boy who does not command his confidence agitates such a man and even elaborate and tender politenessfor the courtesy wisegrown men offer to a bewildered child was the courtesy that stalky wrapped round proutrestores not his peace of mind  the tone of the house seems changedchanged for the worse said prout to harrison and craye have you noticed it i dont for an instant impute  he never imputed anything but on the other hand he never did anything else and with the best intentions in the world he had reduced the houseprefects to a state as nearly bordering on nervous irritation as healthy boys can know worst of all they began at times to wonder whether stalky  co had not some truth in their oftenrepeated assertions that prout was a gloomy ass  as you know i am not the kind of man who puts himself out for every little thing he hears i believe in letting the house work out their own salvationwith a light guiding hand on the reins of course but there is a perceptible lack of reverencea lower tone in matters that touch the honor of the house a sort of hardness     oh prout he is a nobleman a nobleman a nobleman        our heffy is a nobleman        he does an awful lot    because his popularity    oh popupopularity    his giddy popularity        would suffer did he not  the study door stood ajar and the song borne by twenty clear voices came faint from a formroom the fags rather liked the tune the words were beetles  thats a thing no sensible man objects to said prout with a lopsided smile but you know straws show which way the wind blows can you trace it to any direct influence i am speaking to you now as heads of the house  there isnt the least doubt of it said harrison angrily i know what you mean sir it all began when number five study came to the formrooms theres no use blinkin it craye you know that too  they make things rather difficult for us sometimes said craye its more their manner than anything else that harrison means  do they hamper you in the discharge of your duties then  well no sir they only look on and grinand turn up their noses generally  ah said prout sympathetically  i think sir said craye plunging into the business boldly it would be a great deal better if they wore sent back to their studybetter for the house they are rather old to be knocking about the formrooms  they are younger than orrin or flint and a dozen others that i can think of  yes sir but thats different somehow theyre rather influential they have a knack of upsettin things in a quiet way that one cant take hold of at least if one does  and you think they would be better in their own study again  emphatically harrison and craye were of that opinion as harrison said to craye afterwards theyve weakened our authority theyre too big to lick theyve made an exhibition of us over this usury business and were a laughingstock to the rest of the school im going up for sandhurst understood next term theyve managed to knock me out of half my work already with theirtheir lunacy if they go back to their study we may have a little peace  hullo harrison mcturk ambled round the corner with a roving eye on all possible horizons bearin up old man thats right live it down live it down  what dyou mean  you look a little pensive said mcturk exhaustin job superintendin the honor of the house aint it by the way how are you off for maresnests  look here said harrison hoping for instant reward weve recommended prout to let you go back to your study  the dooce you have and who under the sun are you to interfere between us and our housemaster upon my sam you two try us very hardyou do indeed of course we dont know how far you abuse your position to prejudice us with mr prout but when you deliberately stop me to tell me youve been makin arrangements behind our backin secretwith proutii dont know really what we ought to do  thats beastly unfair cried craye   it is mcturk had adopted a ghastly solemnity that sat well on his long lean face hang it all a prefects one thing and an ushers another but you seem to combine em you recommend thisyou recommend that you say how and when we go back to our study  butbutwe thought youd like it turkey we did indeed you know youll be ever so much more comfortable there harrisons voice was almost tearful  mcturk turned away as though to hide his emotions  theyre broke he hunted up stalky and beetle in a boxroom theyre sick theyve been beggin heffy to let us go back to number five poor devils poor little devils  its the olive branch was stalkys comment its the giddy white flag by gum come to think of it we have metagrobolized em  just after tea that day mr prout sent for them to say that if they chose to ruin their future by neglecting their work it was entirely their own affair he wished them however to understand that their presence in the formrooms could not be tolerated one hour longer he personally did not care to think of the time he must spend in eliminating the traces of their evil influences how far beetle had pandered to the baser side of youthful imagination he would ascertain later and beetle might be sure that if mr prout came across any soulcorrupting consequences  consequences of what sir said beetle genuinely bewildered this time and mcturk quietly kicked him on the ankle for being fetched by prout beetle the housemaster continued knew very well what was intended evil and brief had been their careers under his eye and as one standing in loco parentis to their yet uncontaminated associates he was bound to take his precautions the return of the study key closed the sermon  but what was the basersideofimagination business said beetle on the stairs  i never knew such an ass as you are for justifyin yourself said mcturk i hope i jolly well skinned your ankle why do you let yourself be drawn by everybody  draws be blowed i must have tickled him up in some way i didnt know about if id had a notion of that before of course i could have rubbed it in better its too late now what a pity baser side what was he drivin at  never mind said stalky i knew we could make it a happy little house i said so rememberbut i swear i didnt think wed do it so soon   no said prout most firmly in commonroom i maintain that gillett is wrong true i let them return to their study  with your known views on cribbing too purred little hartopp what an immoral compromise  one moment said the reverend john iweall of us have exercised an absolutely heartbreaking discretion for the last ten days now we want to know confesshave you known a happy minute since  as regards my house i have not said prout but you are entirely wrong in your estimate of those boys in justice to the othersin selfdefence  ha i said it would come to that murmured the reverend john  i was forced to send them back their moral influence was unspeakablesimply unspeakable  and bit by bit he told his tale beginning with beetles usury and ending with the houseprefects appeal   beetle in the role of shylock is new to me said king with twitching lips i heard rumors of it  before said prout  no after you had dealt with them but i was careful not to inquire i never interfere with  i myself said hartopp would cheerfully give him five shillings if he could work out one simple sum in compound interest without three gross errors  whywhywhy mason the mathematical master stuttered a fierce joy on his face youve been hadprecisely the same as me  and so you held an inquiry little hartopps voice drowned masons ere prout caught the import of the sentence  the boy himself hinted at the existence of a deal of it in the house said prout  he is past master in that line said the chaplain but as regards the honor of the house  they lowered it in a week i have striven to build it up for years my own houseprefectsand boys do not willingly complain of each otherbesought me to get rid of them you say you have their confidence gillett they may tell you another tale as far as i am concerned they may go to the devil in their own way im sick and tired of them said prout bitterly  but it was the reverend john with a smiling countenance who went to the devil just after number five had cleared away a very pleasant little brew it cost them two and fourpence and was settling down to prep  come in padre come in said stalky thrusting forward the best chair weve only met you officiallike these last ten days  you were under sentence said the reverend john i do not consort with malefactors  ah but were restored again said mcturk mr prout has relented  without a stain on our characters said beetle it was a painful episode padre most painful   now consider for a while and perpend mes enfants it is about your characters that ive called tonight in the language of the schools what the dooce have you been up to in mr prouts house it isnt anything to laugh over he says that you so lowered the tone of the house he had to pack you back to your studies is that true  every word of it padre  dont be flippant turkey listen to me ive told you very often that no boys in the school have a greater influence for good or evil than you have you know i dont talk about ethics and moral codes because i dont believe that the young of the human animal realizes what they mean for some years to come all the same i dont want to think youve been perverting the juniors dont interrupt beetle listen to me mr prout has a notion that you have been corrupting your associates somehow or other  mr prout has so many notions padre said beetle wearily which one is this  well he tells me that he heard you telling a story in the twilight in the formroom in a whisper and orrin said just as he opened the door shut up beetle its too beastly now then  you remember mrs oliphants beleaguered city that you lent me last term said beetle  the padre nodded  i got the notion out of that only instead of a city i made it the coll in a fogbesieged by ghosts of dead boys who hauled chaps out of their beds in the dormitory all the names are quite real you tell it in a whisper you know with the names orrin didnt like it one little bit none of em have ever let me finish it it gets just awful at the end part  but why in the world didnt you explain to mr prout instead of leaving him under the impression  padre sahib said mcturk it isnt the least good explainin to mr prout if he hasnt one impression hes bound to have another  hed do it with the best o motives hes in loco parentis purred stalky  you young demons the reverend john replied and am i to understand that thethe usury business was another of your housemasters impressions  wellwe helped a little in that said stalky i did owe beetle two and fourpence at least beetle says i did but i never intended to pay him then we started a bit of an argument on the stairs andand mr prout dropped into it accidental that was how it was padre he paid me cash down like a giddy dook stopped it out of my pocketmoney just the same and beetle gave him my noteofhand all correct i dont know what happened after that  i was too truthful said beetle i always am you see he was under an impression padre and i suppose i ought to have corrected that impression but of course i couldnt be quite certain that his house wasnt given over to moneylendin could i i thought the houseprefects might know more about it than i did they ought to theyre giddy palladiums of public schools  they did tooby the time theyd finished said mcturk as nice a pair of conscientious wellmeanin upright puresouled boys as youd ever want to meet padre they turned the house upside downharrison and crayewith the best motives in the world  they said so they said it very loud and clear they went and shouted in our ear said stalky  my own private impression is that all three of you will infallibly be hanged said the reverend john  why we didnt do anything mcturk replied it was all mr prout did you ever read a book about japanese wrestlers my unclehes in the navygave me a beauty once  dont try to change the subject turkey  im not sir im givin an illustrationsame as a sermon these wrestlerchaps have got sort sort of trick that lets the other chap do all the work than they give a little wriggle and he upsets himself its called shibbuwichee or tokonoma or somethin mr prouts a shibbuwicher it isnt our fault  did you suppose we went round corruptin the minds of the fags said beetle they havent any to begin with and if they had theyre corrupted long ago ive been a fag padre  well i fancied i knew the normal range of your iniquities but if you take so much trouble to pile up circumstantial evidence against yourselves you cant blame any one if  we dont blame any one padre we havent said a word against mr prout have we stalky looked at the others we love him he hasnt a notion how we love him  hm you dissemble your love very well have you ever thought who got you turned out of your study in the first place  it was mr prout turned us out said stalky with significance  well i was that man i didnt mean it but some words of mine im afraid gave mr prout the impression  number five laughed aloud  you see its just the same thing with you padre said mcturk he is quick to get an impression aint he but you mustnt think we dont love him cause we do there isnt an ounce of vice about him  a double knock fell on the door  the head to see number five study in his study at once said the voice of foxy the school sergeant  whew said the reverend john it seems to me that there is a great deal of trouble coming for some people  my word mr prouts gone and told the head said stalky hes a moral doubleender not fair luggin the head into a houserow  i should recommend a copybook on ahmsafe and certain part said the reverend john disinterestedly  huh he licks across the shoulders an it would slam like a beastly barndoor said beetle goodnight padre were in for it  once more they stood in the presence of the headbelial mammon and lucifer but they had to deal with a man more subtle than them all mr prout had talked to him heavily and sadly for half an hour and the head had seen all that was hidden from the housemaster  youve been bothering mr prout he said pensively housemasters arent here to be bothered by boys more than is necessary i dont like being bothered by these things you are bothering me that is a very serious offense you see it  yes sir  well now i purpose to bother you on personal and private grounds because you have broken into my time you are much too big to lick so i suppose i shall have to mark my displeasure in some other way say a thousand lines apiece a weeks gating and a few things of that kind much too big to lick arent you  oh no sir said stalky cheerfully for a weeks gating in the summer term is serious  very good then we will do what we can i wish you wouldnt bother me  it was a fair sustained equable stroke with a little draw to it but what they felt most was his unfairness in stopping to talk between executions thus among thelower classes this would lay me open to a charge ofassault you should be more grateful for yourprivileges than you are there is a limitone finds it by experience beetlebeyond which it is never safe to pursue private vendettas becausedont movesooner or later one comesinto collision with thehigher authority who has studied the animal et egomcturk pleasein arcadia vixi theres a certain flagrant injustice about this that ought to appeal toyour temperament and thats all you will tell your housemaster that you have been formally caned by me  my word said mcturk wriggling his shoulderblades all down the corridor that was business the prooshan bates has an infernal straight eye  wasnt it wily of me to ask for the lickin said stalky instead of those impots  rot we were in for it from the first i knew the look of his old eye said beetle i was within an inch of blubbing  well i didnt exactly smile stalky confessed  lets go down to the lavatory and have a look at the damage one of us can hold the glass and tothers can squint  they proceeded on these lines for some ten minutes the wales were very red and very level there was not a penny to choose between any of them for thoroughness efficiency and a certain clarity of outline that stamps the work of the artist  what are you doing down there mr prout was at the head of the lavatory stairs attracted by the noise of splashing  weve only been caned by the head sir and were washing off the blood the head said we were to tell you we were coming to report ourselves in a minute sir sotto voce thats a score for heffy  well he deserves to score something poor devil said mcturk putting on his shirt weve sweated a stone and a half off him since we began  but look here why arent we wrathy with the head he said it was a flagrant injustice so it is said beetle  dear man said mcturk and vouchsafed no further answer  it was stalky who laughed till he had to hold on by the edge of a basin  you are a funny ass whats that for said beetle  imim thinking of the flagrant injustice of it     the moral reformers   there was no disguising the defeat the victory was to prout but they grudged it not if he had broken the rules of the game by calling in the head they had had a good run for their money  the reverend john sought the earliest opportunity of talking things over members of a bachelor commonroom of a school where masters studies are designedly dotted among studies and formrooms can if they choose see a great deal of their charges number five had spent some cautious years in testing the reverend john he was emphatically a gentleman he knocked at a study door before entering he comported himself as a visitor and not a strayed lictor he never prosed and he never carried over into official life the confidences of idle hours prout was ever an unmitigated nuisance king came solely as an avenger of blood even little hartopp talking natural history seldom forgot his office but the reverend john was a guest desired and beloved by number five  behold him then in their only armchair a bent briar between his teeth chin down in three folds on his clerical collar and blowing like an amiable whale while number five discoursed of life as it appeared to them and specially of that last interview with the headin the matter of usury  one licking once a week would do you an immense amount of good he said twinkling and shaking all over and as you say you were entirely in the right  raather padre we could have proved it if hed let us talk said stalky but he didnt the heads a downy bird  he understands you perfectly ho ho well you worked hard enough for it  but hes awfully fair he doesnt lick a chap in the morning an preach at him in the afternoon said beetle  he cant he aint in orders thank goodness said mcturk number five held the very strongest views on clerical headmasters and were ever ready to meet their pastor in argument  almost all other schools have clerical heads said the reverend john gently  it isnt fair on the chaps stalky replied makes em sulky of course its different with you sir you belong to the schoolsame as we do i mean ordinary clergymen  well i am a most ordinary clergyman and mr hartopps in orders too  yees but he took em after he came to the coll we saw him go up for his exam thats all right said beetle but just think if the head went and got ordained  what would happen beetle  oh the coll ud go to pieces in a year sir theres no doubt o that  how dyou know the reverend john was smiling  weve been here nearly six years now there are precious few things about the coll we dont know stalky replied why even you came the term after i did sir i remember your asking our names in form your first lesson mr king mr prout and the head of course are the only masters senior to usin that way  yes weve changed a good dealin commonroom  huh said beetle with a grunt they came here an they went away to get married jolly good riddance too  doesnt our beetle hold with matrimony  no padre dont make fun of me ive met chaps in the holidays whove got married housemasters its perfectly awful they have babies and teething and measles and all that sort of thing right bung in the school and the masters wives give teapartiesteaparties padreand ask the chaps to breakfast  that dont matter so much said stalky but the housemasters let their houses alone and they leave everything to the prefects why in one school a chap told me there were big baize doors and a passage about a mile long between the house and the masters house they could do just what they pleased  satan rebuking sin with a vengeance  oh larks are right enough but you know what we mean padre after a bit it gets worse an worse then theres a big bustup and a row that gets into the papers and a lot of chaps are expelled you know  always the wrong uns dont forget that have a cup of cocoa padre said mcturk with the kettle  no thanks im smoking always the wrong uns proceed my stalky  and thenstalky warmed to the workeverybody says whod ha thought it shockin boys wicked little kids it all comes of havin married housemasters i think  a daniel come to judgment  but it does mcturk interrupted ive met chaps in the holidays an theyve told me the same thing it looks awfully pretty for ones people to seea nice separate house with a nice lady in charge an all that but it isnt it takes the housemasters off their work and it gives the prefects a heap too much power ananit rots up everything you see it isnt as if we were just an ordinary school we take crammers rejections as well as good little boys like stalky weve got to do that to make our name of course and we get em into sandhurst somehow or other dont we  true o turk like a book thou talkest turkey  and so we want rather different masters dont you think so to other places we arent like the rest of the schools  it leads to all sorts of bullyin too a chap told me said beetle  well you do need most of a single mans time i must say the reverend john considered his hosts critically but do you never feel that the worldthe commonroomis too much with you sometimes  not exactlyin summer anyhow stalkys eye roved contentedly to the window our bounds are pretty big too and they leave us to ourselves a good deal  for example here am i sitting in your study very much in your way eh  indeed you arent padre sit down dont go sir you know were glad whenever you come  there was no doubting the sincerity of the voices the reverend john flushed a little with pleasure and refilled his briar  and we generally know where the commonroom are said beetle triumphantly didnt you come through our lower dormitories last night after ten sir  i went to smoke a pipe with your housemaster no i didnt give him any impressions i took a short cut through your dormitories  i sniffed a whiff of baccy this mornin yours is stronger than mr prouts i knew said beetle wagging his head  good heavens said the reverend john absently it was some years before beetle perceived that this was rather a tribute to innocence than observation the long light blindless dormitories devoid of inner doors were crossed at all hours of the night by masters visiting one another for bachelors sit up later than married folk beetle had never dreamed that there might be a purpose in this steady policing  talking about bullying the reverend john resumed you all caught it pretty hot when you were fags didnt you  well we must have been rather awful little beasts said beetle looking serenely over the gulf between eleven and sixteen my hat what bullies they were thenfairburn gobby maunsell and all that gang  member when gobby called us the three blind mice and we had to get up on the lockers and sing while he buzzed inkpots at us said stalky they were bullies if you like  but there isnt any of it now said mcturk soothingly  thats where you make a mistake were all inclined to say that everything is all right as long we arent ourselves hurt i sometimes wonder if it is extinctbullying  fags bully each other horrid but the upper forms are supposed to be swottin for exams theyve got something else to think about said beetle  why what do you think stalky was watching the chaplains face  i have my doubts then explosively on my word for three moderately intelligent boys you arent very observant i suppose you were too busy making things warm for your housemaster to see what lay under your noses when you were in the formrooms last week  what sir ii swear we didnt see anything said beetle  then id advise you to look when a little chap is whimpering in a corner and wears his clothes like rags and never does any work and is notoriously the dirtiest little corridorcaution in the coll somethings wrong somewhere  thats clewer said mcturk under his breath  yes clewer he comes to me for his french its his first term and hes almost as complete a wreck as you were beetle hes not naturally clever but he has been hammered till hes nearly an idiot  oh no they sham silly to get off more tickings said beetle i know that  ive never actually seen him knocked about said the reverend john  the genuine article dont do that in public said beetle fairburn never touched me when any one was looking on  you neednt swagger about it beetle said mcturk we all caught it in our time  but i got it worse than any one said beetle if you want an authority on bullyin padre come to me corkscrewsbrushdrill keysheadknucklinarmtwistinrockinag agsand all the rest of it  yes i do want you as an authority or rather i want your authority to stop itall of you  what about abana and pharpar padreharrison and craye they are mr prouts pets said mcturk a little bitterly we arent even subprefects  ive considered that but on the other hand since most bullying is mere thoughtlessness  not one little bit of it padre said mcturk bullies like bullyin they mean it they think it up in lesson and practise it in the quarters  never mind if the thing goes up to the prefects it may make another houserow youve had one already dont laugh listen to me i ask youmy own tenth legionto take the thing up quietly i want little clewer made to look fairly clean and decent  blowed if i wash him whispered stalky  decent and selfrespecting as for the other boy whoever he is you can use your influencea purely secular light flickered in the chaplains eyein any way you please toto dissuade him thats all ill leave it to you goodnight mes enfants  well what are we goin to do number five stared at each other  young clewer

both heels with a crash on the table if we find the merry jester whos been bullyin him an make him happy thatll be all right why didnt we spot him when we were in the formrooms though  maybe a lot of fags have made a dead set at clewer they do that sometimes  then well have to kick the whole of the lower school in our houseon spec come on said mcturk  keep your hair on we mustnt make a fuss about the biznai whoever it is hes kept quiet or wed have seen him said stalky well walk round and sniff about till were sure  they drew the house formrooms accounting for every junior and senior against whom they had suspicions investigated at beetles suggestion the lavatories and boxrooms but without result everybody seemed to be present save clewer  rum said stalky pausing outside a study door golly  a thin piping mixed with tears came muffled through the panels    as beautiful kitty one morning was tripping  louder you young devil or ill buzz a book at you    with a pitcher of milk   oh campbell please dont   to the fair of  a book crashed on something soft and squeals arose  well i never thought it was a studychap anyhow that accounts for our not spotting him said beetle sefton and campbell are rather hefty chaps to tackle besides one cant go into their study like a formroom  what swine mcturk listened wheres the fun of it i suppose clewers faggin for them  they arent prefects thats one good job said stalky with his wargrin sefton and campbell um campbell and sefton ah one of ems a crammers pup  the two were precocious hairy youths between seventeen and eighteen sent to the school in despair by parents who hoped that six months steady cram might perhaps jockey them into sandhurst nominally they were in mr prouts house actually they were under the heads eye and since he was very careful never to promote strange new boys to prefectships they considered they had a grievance against the school sefton had spent three months with a london crammer and the tale of his adventures there lost nothing in the telling campbell who had a fine taste in clothes and a fluent vocabulary followed his lead in looking down loftily on the rest of the world this was only their second term and the school used to what it profanely called crammers pups had treated them with rather galling reserve but their whiskerssefton owned a real razorand their mustaches were beyond question impressive  shall we go in an dissuade em mcturk asked ive never had much to do with em but ill bet my hat campbells a funk  noo thats oratio directa said stalky shaking his head i like oratio obliqua sides whered our moral influence be then think o that  rot what are you goin to do beetle turned into lower number nine formroom next door to the study  me the lights of war flickered over stalkys face oh i want to jape with em shut up a bit  he drove his hands into his pockets and stared out of window at the sea whistling between his teeth then a foot tapped the floor one shoulder lifted he wheeled and began the short quick doubleshufflethe wardance of stalky in meditation thrice he crossed the empty formroom with compressed lips and expanded nostrils swaying to the quickstep then he halted before the dumb beetle and softly knuckled his bead beetle bowing to the strokes mcturk nursed one knee and rocked to and fro they could hear clewer howling as though his heart would break  beetle is the sacrifice stalky said at last im sorry for you beetle member galtons art of travel one of the forms had been studying that pleasant work an the kid whose bleatin excited the tiger  oh curse said beetle uneasily it was not his first season as a sacrifice cant you get on without me  fraid not beetle dear youve got to be bullied by turkey an me the more you howl o course the

was trussed for cockfighting but in addition to the transverse stump between elbow and knee his knees were bound with a boxrope in this posture at a push from stalky he rolled over sideways covering

entered to find beetle on his side his head against the fender weeping copiously while mcturk prodded him in the back with his toes  its only beetle stalky explained hes shammin hurt i cant get turkey to go for him properly sefton promptly kicked both boys and his face lighted all right ill attend to em get up an cockfight you two give me the stump ill tickle em heres a giddy jest come on campbell

winnerssing odes in honor of the conqueror you call yourself a beastly poet dont you beetle ill poet you  he wriggled into position by campbells side swiftly and scientifically the stumps were thrust through the natural crooks and the wrists tied with wellstretched boxropes to an accompaniment of insults from mcturk bound betrayed and voluble behind the chair stalky set away campbell and sefton and strode over to his allies locking the door on the way  and thats all right said he in a changed voice  what the devil sefton began beetles false tears had ceased mcturk smiling was on his feet together they bound the knees and ankles of the enemy even more straitly  stalky took the armchair and contemplated the scene with his blandest smile a man trussed for cockfighting is perhaps the most helpless thing in the world  the bleatin of the kid excites the tiger oh you frabjous asses he lay back and laughed till he could no more the victims took in the situation but slowly well give you the finest lickin you ever had in your young lives when we get up thundered sefton from the floor youll laugh the other side of your mouth before youve done what the deuce dyou mean by this  youll see in two shakes said mcturk dont swear like that what we want to know is why you two hulkin swine have been bullyin clewer  its none of your business  what did you bully clewer for the question was repeated with maddening iteration by each in turn they knew their work  because we jolly well chose was the answer at last lets get up even then they could not realize the game  well now were goin to bully you because we jolly well choose were goin to be just as fair to you as you were to clewer he couldnt do anything against you you cant do anything to us odd aint it  cant we you wait an see  ah said beetle reflectively that shows youve never been properly jested with a public lickin aint in it with a gentle jape bet a bob youll weep an promise anything  look here young beetle well half kill you when we get up ill promise you that at any rate  youre going to be half killed first though did you give clewer headknuckles  did you give clewer headknuckles mcturk echoed at the twentieth repetitionno boy can stand the torture of one unvarying query which is the essence of bullyingcame confession  we did confound you  then youll be knuckled and knuckled they were according to ancient experience headknuckling is no trifle molly fairburn of the old days could not have done better  did you give clewer brushdrill this time the question was answered sooner and brushdrill was dealt out for the space of five minutes by stalkys watch they could not even writhe in their bonds no brush is employed in brushdrill  did you give clewer the key  no we didnt i swear we didnt from campbell rolling in agony  then well give it to you so you can see what it would be like if you had  the torture of the keywhich has no key at allhurts excessively they endured several minutes of it and their language necessitated the gag  did you give clewer corkscrews  yes oh curse your silly souls let us alone you cads  they were corkscrewed and the torture of the corkscrewthis has nothing to do with corkscrewsis keener than the torture of the key  the method and silence of the attacks was breaking their nerves between each new torture came the pitiless dazing rain of questions and when they did not answer to the point isabellacolored handkerchiefs were thrust into their mouths  now are those all the things you did to clewer take out the gag turkey and let em answer  yes i swear that was all oh youre killing us stalky cried campbell  precisely what clewer said to you i heard him now were goin to show you what real bullyin is what i dont like about you sefton is you come to the coll with your stickup collars an patentleather boots an you think you can teach us something about bullying do you think you can teach us anything about bullying take out the gag and let him answer  noferociously  he says no rock him to sleep campbell can watch  it needs three boys and two boxinggloves to rock a boy to sleep again the operation has nothing to do with its name sefton was rocked till his eyes set in his head and he gasped and crowed for breath sick and dizzy  my aunt said campbell appalled from his corner and turned white  put him away said stalky bring on campbell now this is bullyin oh i forgot i say campbell what did you bully clewer for take out his gag and let him answer  ii dont know oh let me off i swear ill make it pax dont rock me  the bleatin of the kid excites the tiger he says he dont know set him up beetle give me the glove an put in the gag  in silence campbell was rocked sixtyfour times  i believe im goin to die he gasped he says he is goin to die put him away now sefton oh i forgot sefton what did you bully clewer for  the answer is unprintable but it brought not the faintest flush to stalkys downy cheek  make him an ag ag turkey  and an ag ag was he made forthwith the hardbought experience of nearly eighteen years was at his disposal but he did not seem to appreciate it  he says we are sweeps put him away now campbell oh i forgot i say campbell what did you bully clewer for  then came the tearsscalding tears appeals for mercy and abject promises of peace let them cease the tortures and campbell would never lift hand against them the questions began againto an accompaniment of small persuasions  you seem hurt campbell are you hurt  yes awfully  he says he is hurt are you broke  yes yes i swear i am oh stop  he says he is broke are you humble  yes  he says he is humble are you devilish humble  yes  he says he is devilish humble will you bully clewer any more  no noooh  he says he wont bully clewer or any one else  no i swear i

what did you bully clewer for  he wept anew his nerves being raw because i was a bully i suppose thats what you want me to say  he says he is a bully right he is put him in the corner no more japes for campbell now sefton  you devils you young devils this and much more as sefton was punted across the carpet by skilful knees  the bleatin of the kid excites the tiger were goin to make you beautiful where does he keep his shaving things campbell told beetle get some water turkey make the lather were goin to shave you seffy so youd better lie jolly still or youll get cut ive never shaved any one before  dont oh dont please dont  gettin polite eh im only goin to take off one ducky little whisker  illill make it pax if you dont i swear ill let you off your lickin when i get up  and half that mustache were so proud of he says hell let us off our lickin isnt he kind  mcturk laughed into the nickelplated shavingcup and settled seftons head between stalkys viselike knees  hold on a shake said beetle you cant shave long hairs youve got to cut all that mustache short first an then scrape him  well im not goin to hunt about for scissors wont a match do chuck us the matchbox he is a hog you know we might as well singe him lie still he lit a vesta but checked his hand i only want to take off half though  thats all right beetle waved the brush ill lather up to the middlesee and you can burn off the rest  the thinhaired first mustache of youth fluffed off in flame to the latherline in the centre of the lip and stalky rubbed away the burnt stumpage with his thumb it was not a very gentle shave but it abundantly accomplished its purpose  now the whisker on the other side turn him over between match and razor this too was removed give him his shavingglass take the gag out i want to hear what hell say  but there were no words sefton gazed at the lopsided wreck in horror and despair two fat tears rolled down his cheek  oh i forgot i say sefton what did you bully clewer for  leave me alone oh you infernal bullies leave me alone havent i had enough  he says we must leave him alone said mcturk  he says we are bullies an we havent even begun yet said beetle youre ungrateful seffy golly you do look an atrocity and a half  he says he has had enough said stalky he errs  well to work to work chanted mcturk waving a stump come on my giddy narcissus dont fall in love with your own reflection  oh let him off said campbell from his corner hes blubbing too  sefton cried like a twelveyearold with pain shame wounded vanity and utter helplessness  youll make it pax sefton wont you you cant stand up to those young devils  dont be rude campbell deah said mcturk or youll catch it again  you are devils you know said campbell  what for a little bullyinsame as youve been givin clewer how long have you been jestin with him said stalky all this term  we didnt always knock him about though  you did when you could catch him said beetle crosslegged on the floor dropping a stump from time to time across seftons instep dont i know it  iperhaps we did  and you went out of your way to catch him dont i know it because he was an awful little beast eh dont i know it now you see youre awful beasts and youre gettin what he gotfor bein a beast just because we choose  we never really bullied himlike youve done us  yah said beetle they never really bullymolly fairburn didnt only knock em about a little bit thats what they say only kick their souls out of em and they go and blub in the boxrooms shove their heads into the ulsters an blub write home three times a dayyes you brute ive done thataskin to be taken away youve never been bullied properly campbell im sorry you made pax  im not said campbell who was a humorist in a way look out youre slaying sefton  in his excitement beetle had used the stump unreflectingly and sefton was now shouting for mercy  an you he cried wheeling where he sat youve never been bullied either where were you before you came here  ii had a tutor  yah you would you never blubbed in your life but youre blubbin now by gum arent you blubbin  cant you see you blind beast sefton fell over sideways teartracks furrowing the dried lather crack came the cricketstump on the curved latterend of him  blind am i said beetle and a beast shut up stalky im goin to jape a bit with our friend a la molly fairburn i think i can see cant i see sefton  the point is well taken said mcturk watching the strap at work youd better say that he sees seffy  you doyou can i swear you do yelled sefton for strong arguments were coercing him  arent my eyes lovely the stump rose and fell steadily throughout this catechism  yes  a gentle hazel arent they  yesoh yes  what a liar you are theyre skyblue aint they skyblue  yesoh yes  you dont know your mind from one minute to another you must learnyou must learn  what a bait youre in said stalky keep your hair on beetle  ive had it done to me said beetle nowabout my being a beast  paxoh pax cried sefton make it pax ill give up let me off im broke i cant stand it  ugh just when we were gettin our hand in grunted mcturk  they didnt let clewer off ill swear  confessapologizequick said stalky  from the floor sefton made unconditional surrender more abjectly even than campbell he would never touch any one again he would go softly all the days of his life  weve got to take it i suppose said stalky all right sefton youre broke very good shut up beetle but before we let you up you an campbell will kindly oblige us with kitty of colerainea la clewer  thats not fair said campbell weve surrendered  course you have now youre goin to do what we tell yousame as clewer would if you hadnt surrendered youd ha been really bullied havin surrendereddo you follow seffyyou sing odes in honor of the conquerors hurry up  they dropped into chairs luxuriously campbell and sefton looked at each other and neither taking comfort from that view struck up kitty of coleraine  vile bad said stalky as the miserable wailing ended if you hadnt surrendered it would have been our painful duty to buzz books at you for singin out o tune now then  he freed them from their bonds but for several minutes they could not rise campbell was first on his feet smiling uneasily sefton staggered to the table buried his head in his arms and shook with sobs there was no shadow of fight in eitheronly amazement distress and shame  cacant he shave clean before tea please said campbell its ten minutes to bell  stalky shook his head he meant to escort the halfshaved one to the meal  mcturk yawned in his chair and beetle mopped his face they were all dripping with excitement and exertion  if i knew anything about it i swear id give you a moral lecture said stalky severely  dont jaw theyve surrendered said mcturk this moral suasion biznai takes it out of a chap  dont you see how gentle weve been we might have called clewer in to look at you said stalky the bleatin of the tiger excites the kid but we didnt weve only got to tell a few chaps in coll about this and youd be hooted all over the shop your life wouldnt be worth havin but we arent goin to do that either were strictly moral suasers campbell so unless you or seffy split about this no one will  i swear youre a brick said campbell i suppose i was rather a brute to clewer  it looked like it said stalky but i dont think seffy need come into hall with cockeye whiskers horrid bad for the fags if they saw him he can shave aint you grateful sefton  the head did not lift sefton was deeply asleep  thats rummy said mcturk as a snore mixed with a sob cheek i think or else hes shammin  no tisnt said beetle when molly fairburn had attended to me for an hour or so i used to go bung off to sleep on a form sometimes poor devil but he called me a beastly poet though  well come on stalky lowered his voice goodby campbell member if you dont talk nobody will  there should have been a wardance but that all three were so utterly tired that they almost went to sleep above the teacups in their study and slept till prep   a most extraordinary letter are all parents incurably mad what do you make of it said the head handing a closely written eight pages to the reverend john  the only son of his mother and she a widow that is the least reasonable sort the chaplain read with pursed lips if half those charges are true he should be in the sickhouse whereas he is disgustingly well certainly he has shaved i noticed that  under compulsion as his mother points out how delicious how salutary  you havent to answer her it isnt often i dont know what has happened in the school but this is beyond me  if you asked me i should say seek not to propitiate when one is forced to take crammers pups  he was perfectly well at extratuitionwith methis morning said the head absently unusually well behaved too  they either educate the school or the school as in this case educates them i prefer our own methods the chaplain concluded  you think it was that a lift of the heads eyebrow  im sure of it and nothing excuses his trying to give the college a bad name  thats the line i mean to take with him the head answered  the augurs winked   a few days later the reverend john called on number five why havent we seen you before padre said they  ive been watching times and seasons and events and menand boys he replied i am pleased with my tenth legion i make them my compliments clewer was throwing inkballs in form this morning instead of doing his work he is now doing fifty lines forunheardof audacity  you cant blame us sir said beetle you told us to remove theerpressure thats the worst of a fag  ive known boys five years his senior throw inkballs beetle to such an one have i given two hundred linesnot so long ago and now i come to think of it were those lines ever shown up  were they turkey said beetle unblushingly  dont you think clewer looks a little cleaner padre stalky interrupted  were no end of moral reformers said mcturk  it was all stalky but it was a lark said beetle  i have noticed the moral reform in several quarters didnt i tell you you had more influence than any boys in the coll if you cared to use it  its a trifle exhaustin to use frequentour kind of moral suasion besides you see it only makes clewer cheeky  i wasnt thinking of clewer i was thinking ofthe other people stalky  oh we didnt bother much about the other people said mcturk did we  but i didfrom the beginning  then you knew sir  a downward puff of smoke boys educate each other they say more than we can or dare if i had used one half of the moral suasion you may or may not have employed  with the best motives in the world dont forget our pious motives padre said mcturk  i suppose i should be now languishing in bideford jail shouldnt i well to quote the head in a little business which we have agreed to forget that strikes me as flagrant injustice what are you laughing at you young sinners isnt it true i will not stay to be shouted at what i looked into this den of iniquity for was to find out if any one cared to come down for a bathe off the ridge but i see you wont  wont we though half a shake padre sahib till we get our towels and nous sommes avec vous     a little prep   easter term was but a month old when stettson major a dayboy contracted diphtheria and the head was very angry he decreed a new and narrower set of boundsthe infection had been traced to an outlying farmhouseurged the prefects severely to lick all trespassers and promised extra attentions from his own hand there were no words bad enough for stettson major quarantined at his mothers house who had lowered the schoolaverage of health this he said in the gymnasium after prayers then he wrote some two hundred letters to as many anxious parents and guardians and bade the school carry on the trouble did not spread but one night a dogcart drove to the heads door and in the morning the head had gone leaving all things in charge of mr king senior housemaster the head often ran up to town where the school devoutly believed he bribed officials for early proofs of the army examination papers but this absence was unusually prolonged  downy old bird said stalky to the allies one wet afternoon in the study he must have gone on a bend and been locked up under a false name  what for beetle entered joyously into the libel  forty shillins or a month for hackin the chuckerout of the pavvy on the shins bates always has a spree when he goes to town wish he was back though im about sick o kings whips an scorpions an lectures on publicschool spirityahand scholarship  crass an materialized brutality of the middleclassesreadin solely for marks not a scholar in the whole school mcturk quoted pensively boring holes in the mantelpiece with a hot poker  thats rather a sickly way of spending an afternoon stinks too lets come out an smoke heres a treat stalky held up a long indian cheroot bagged it from my pater last holidays im a bit shy of it though its heftier than a pipe well smoke it palaverfashion hand it round eh lets lie up behind the old harrow on the monkeyfarm road  out of bounds bounds beastly strict these days too besides we shall cat beetle sniffed the cheroot critically its a regular pomposo stinkadore  you can i shant what dyou say turkey  oh mays well i spose  chuck on your cap then its two to one beetle out you come  they saw a group of boys by the noticeboard in the corridor little foxy the school sergeant among them  more bounds i expect said stalky hullo foxibus who are you in mournin for there was a broad band of crape round foxys arm  he was in my old regiment said foxy jerking his head towards the notices where a newspaper cutting was thumbtacked between callover lists  by gum quoth stalky uncovering as he read its old duncanfatsow duncankilled on duty at something or other kotal rallyin his men with conspicuous gallantry he would of course the body was recovered thats all right they cut em up sometimes dont they foxy  horrid said the sergeant briefly  poor old fatsow i was a fag when he left how many does that make to us foxy  mr duncan he is the ninth he come here when he was no bigger than little grey tertius my old regiment too yiss nine to us mr corkran up to date  the boys went out into the wet walking swiftly  wonder how it feelsto be shot and all that said stalky as they splashed down a lane where did it happen beetle  oh out in india somewhere were always rowin there but look here stalky what is the good o sittin under a hedge an cattin its beeastly cold its beeastly wet and well be collared as sure as a gun  shut up did you ever know your uncle stalky get you into a mess yet like many other leaders stalky did not dwell on past defeats they pushed through a dripping hedge landed among waterlogged clods and sat down on a rustcoated harrow the cheroot burned with sputterings of saltpetre they smoked it gingerly each passing to the other between dosed forefinger and thumb  good job we hadnt one apiece aint it said stalky shivering through set teeth to prove his words he immediately laid all before them and they followed his example  i told you moaned beetle sweating clammy drops oh stalky you are a fool  je cat tu cat il cat nous cattons mcturk handed up his contribution and lay hopelessly on the cold iron  somethings wrong with the beastly thing i say beetle have you been droppin ink on it  but beetle was in no case to answer limp and empty they sprawled across the harrow the rust marking their ulsters in red squares and the abandoned cherootend reeking under their very cold noses thenthey had heard nothingthe head himself stood before themthe head who should have been in town bribing examinersthe head fantastically attired in old tweeds and a deerstalker  ah he said fingering his mustache very good i might have guessed who it was you will go back to the college and give my compliments to mr king and ask him to give you an extraspecial licking you will then do me five hundred lines i shall be back tomorrow five hundred lines by five oclock tomorrow you are also gated for a week this is not exactly the time for breaking bounds extraspecial please  he disappeared over the hedge as lightly as he had come there was a murmur of womens voices in the deep lane  oh you prooshan brute said mcturk as the voices died away stalky its all your silly fault  kill him kill him gasped beetle  i caant im going to cat again i dont mind that but kingll gloat over us horrid extraspecial ooh  stalky made no answernot even a soft one they went to college and received that for which they had been sent king enjoyed himself most thoroughly for by virtue of their seniority the boys were exempt from his hand save under special order luckily he was no expert in the gentle art  strange how desire doth outrun performance said beetle irreverently quoting from some shakespeare play that they were cramming that term they regained their study and settled down to the imposition  youre quite right beetle stalky spoke in silky and propitiating tones now if the head had sent us up to a prefect wed have got something to remember  look here mcturk began with cold venom we arent goin to row you about this business because its too bad for a row but we want you to understand youre jolly well excommunicated stalky youre a plain ass  how was i to know that the head ud collar us what was he doin in those ghastly clothes too  dont try to raise a sideissue beetle grunted severely  well it was all stettson majors fault if he hadnt gone an got diphtheria twouldnt have happened but dont you think it rather rummythe head droppin on us that way  shut up youre dead said beetle weve chopped your spurs off your beastly heels weve cocked your shield upside down andand i dont think you ought to be allowed to brew for a month  oh stop jawin at me i want  stop whywhy were gated for a week mcturk almost howled as the agony of the situation overcame him a lickin from king five hundred lines and a gatin dyou expect us to kiss you stalky you beast  drop rottin for a minute i want to find out about the head bein where he was  well you have you found him quite well and fit found him makin love to stettson majors mother that was her in the lanei heard her and so we were ordered a lickin before a dayboys mother bony old widow too said mcturk anything else youd like to find out  i dont care i swear ill get even with him some day stalky growled  looks like it said mcturk extraspecial weeks gatin and five hundred and now youre goin to row about it help scrag him beetle stalky had thrown his virgil at them  the head returned next day without explanation to find the lines waiting for him and the school a little relaxed under mr kings viceroyalty mr king had been talking at and round and over the boys heads in a lofty and promiscuous style of publicschool spirit and the traditions of ancient seats for he always improved an occasion beyond waking in two hundred and fifty young hearts a lively hatred of all other foundations he accomplished littleso little indeed that when two days after the heads return he chanced to come across stalky  co gated but ever resourceful playing marbles in the corridor he said that he was not surprisednot in the least surprised this was what he had expected from persons of their morale  but there isnt any rule against marbles sir very interestin game said beetle his knees white with chalk and dust then he received two hundred lines for insolence besides an order to go to the nearest prefect for judgment and slaughter  this is what happened behind the closed doors of flints study and flint was then head of the games  oh i say flint king has sent me to you for playin marbles in the corridor an shoutin alley tor an knuckle down  what does he suppose i have to do with that was the answer  dunno well beetle grinned wickedly what am i to tell him hes rather wrathy about it  if the head chooses to put a notice in the corridor forbiddin marbles i can do something but i cant move on a housemasters report he knows that as well as i do  the sense of this oracle beetle conveyed all unsweetened to king who hastened to interview flint  now flint had been seven and a half years at the college counting six months with a london crammer from whose roof he had returned homesick to the head for the final army polish there were four or five other seniors who had gone through much the same mill not to mention boys rejected by other establishments on account of a certain overwhelmingness whom the head had wrought into very fair shape it was not a sixth to be handled without gloves as king found  am i to understand it is your intention to allow boardschool games under your study windows flint if so i can only say he said much and flint listened politely  well sir if the head sees fit to call a prefects meeting we are bound to take the matter up but the tradition of the school is that the prefects cant move in any matter affecting the whole school without the heads direct order  much more was then delivered both sides a little losing their temper  after tea at an informal gathering of prefects in his study flint related the adventure  hes been playin for this for a week and now hes got it you know as well as i do that if he hadnt been gassing at us the way he has that young devil beetle wouldnt have dreamed of marbles  we know that said perowne but that isnt the question on flints showin king has called the prefects names enough to justify a firstclass row crammers rejections illregulated hobbledehoys wasnt it now its impossible for prefects  rot said flint kings the best classical cram weve got and tisnt fair to bother the head with a row hes up to his eyes with extratu and army work as it is besides as i told king we arent a public school were a limited liability company payin four per cent my fathers a shareholder too  whats that got to do with it said venner a redheaded boy of nineteen  well seems to me that we should be interferin with ourselves weve got to get into the army orget out havent we kings hired by the council to teach us all the rests gumdiddle cant you see  it might have been because he felt the air was a little thunderous that the head took his afterdinner cheroot to flints study but he so often began an evening in a prefects room that nobody suspected when he drifted in pensively after the knocks that etiquette demanded  prefects meeting a cock of one wise eyebrow  not exactly sir were just talking things over wont you take the easy chair  thanks luxurious infants you are he dropped into flints big halfcouch and puffed for a while in silence well since youre all here i may confess that im the mute with the bowstring  the young faces grew serious the phrase meant that certain of their number would be withdrawn from all further games for extratuition it might also mean future success at sandhurst but it was present ruin for the first fifteen  yes ive come for my pound of flesh i ought to have had you out before the exeter match but its our sacred duty to beat exeter  isnt the old boys match sacred too sir said perowne the old boys match was the event of the easter term  well hope they arent in training now for the list first i want flint its the euclid that does it you must work deductions with me perowne extra mechanical drawing dawson goes to mr king for extra latin and venner to me for german have i damaged the first fifteen much he smiled sweetly  ruined it im afraid sir said flint cant you let us off till the end of the term  impossible it will be a tight squeeze for sandhurst this year  and all to be cut up by those vile afghans too said dawson wouldnt think thered be so much competition would you  oh that reminds me crandall is coming down with the old boysive asked twenty of them but we shant get more than a weak team i dont know whether hell be much use though he was rather knocked about recovering poor old duncans body  crandall majorthe gunner perowne asked  no the minortoffee crandallin a native infantry regiment he was almost before your time perowne  the papers didnt say anything about him we read about fatsow of course whats crandall done sir  ive brought over an indian paper that his mother sent me it was rather ahefty i think you saypiece of work shall i read it the head knew how to read when he had finished the quartercolumn of close type everybody thanked him politely  good for the old coll said perowne pity he wasnt in time to save fatsow though thats nine to us isnt it in the last three years  yes and i took old duncan off all games for extratu five years ago this term said the head by the way who do you hand over the games to flint  havent thought yet whod you recommend sir  no thank you ive heard it casually hinted behind my back that the prooshan bates is a downy bird but he isnt going to make himself responsible for a new head of the games settle it among yourselves goodnight  and thats the man said flint when the door shut that you want to bother with a dames school row  i was only pullin your fat leg perowne returned hastily youre so easy to draw flint  well never mind that the heads knocked the first fifteen to bits and weve got to pick up the pieces or the old boys will have a walkover lets promote all the second fifteen and make big side play up theres heaps of talent somewhere that we can polish up between now and the match  the case was represented so urgently to the school that even stalky and mcturk who affected to despise football played one bigside game seriously they were forthwith promoted ere their ardor had time to cool and the dignity of their caps demanded that they should keep some show of virtue the matchteam was worked at least four days out of seven and the school saw hope ahead  with the last week of the term the old boys began to arrive and their welcome was nicely proportioned to their worth gentlemen cadets from sandhurst and woolwich who had only left a year ago but who carried enormous side were greeted with a cheerful hullo whats the shop like from those who had shared their studies militia subalterns had more consideration but it was understood they were not precisely of the true metal recreants who failing for the army had gone into business or banks were received for old sakes sake but in no way made too much of but when the real subalterns officers and gentlemen fullblownwho had been to the ends of the earth and back again and so carried no sidecame on the scene strolling about with the head the school divided right and left in admiring silence and when one laid hands on flint even upon the head of the games crying good heavens what do you mean by growing in this way you were a beastly little fag when i left visible haloes encircled flint they would walk to and fro in the corridor with the little red schoolsergeant telling news of old regiments they would burst into formrooms sniffing the wellremembered smells of ink and whitewash they would find nephews and cousins in the lower forms and present them with enormous wealth or they would invade the gymnasium and make foxy show off the new stock on the bars  chiefly though they talked with the head who was fatherconfessor and agentgeneral to them all for what they shouted in their unthinking youth they proved in their thoughtless manhoodto wit that the prooshan bates was a downy bird young blood who had stumbled into an entanglement with a pastrycooks daughter at plymouth experience who had come into a small legacy but mistrusted lawyers ambition halting at crossroads anxious to take the one that would lead him farthest extravagance pursued by the moneylender arrogance in the thick of a regimental roweach carried his trouble to the head and chiron showed him in language quite unfit for little boys a quiet and safe way round out or under so they overflowed his house smoked his cigars and drank his health as they had drunk it all the earth over when two or three of the old school had foregathered  dont stop smoking for a minute said the head the more youre out of training the better for us ive demoralized the first fifteen with extratu  ah but were a scratch lot have you told em we shall need a substitute even if crandall can play said a lieutenant of engineers with a dso to his credit  he wrote me hed play so he cant have been much hurt hes coming down tomorrow morning  crandall minor that was and brought off poor duncans body the head nodded where are you going to put him weve turned you out of house and home already head sahib this was a squadron commander of bengal lancers home on leave  im afraid hell have to go up to his old dormitory you know old boys can claim that privilege yes i think little crandall minor must bed down there once more  bates sahib a gunner flung a heavy arm round the heads neckyouve got something up your sleeve confess i know that twinkle  cant you see you cuckoo a submarine miner interrupted crandall goes up to the dormitory as an objectlesson for moral effect and so forth isnt that true head sahib  it is you know too much purvis i licked you for that in 79  you did sir and its my private belief you chalked the cane  nno but ive a very straight eye perhaps that misled you  that opened the floodgates of fresh memories and they all told tales out of school  when crandall minor that waslieutenant r crandall of an ordinary indian regimentarrived from exeter on the morning of the match he was cheered along the whole front of the college for the prefects had repeated the sense of that which the head had read them in flints study when prouts house understood that he would claim his old boys right to a bed for one night beetle ran into kings house next door and executed a public gloat up and down the enemys big formroom departing in a haze of inkpots  what dyou take any notice of those rotters for said stalky playing substitute for the old boys magnificent in black jersey white knickers and black stockings i talked to him up in the dormitory when he was changin pulled his sweater down for him hes cut about all over the armshorrid purply ones hes goin to tell us about it tonight i asked him to when i was lacin his boots  well you have got cheek said beetle enviously  slipped out before i thought but he wasnt a bit angry hes no end of a chap i swear im goin to play up like beans tell turkey  the technique of that match belongs to a bygone age scrimmages were tight and enduring hacking was direct and to the purpose and around the scrimmage stood the school crying put down your heads and shove toward the end everybody lost all sense of decency and mothers of dayboys too close to the touchline heard language not included in the bills no one was actually carried off the field but both sides felt happier when time was called and beetle helped stalky and mcturk into their overcoats the two had met in the manylegged heart of things and as stalky said had done each other proud as they swaggered woodenly behind the teamssubstitutes do not rank as equals of hairy menthey passed a ponycarriage near the wall and a husky voice cried well played oh played indeed it was stettson major whitechecked and holloweyed who had fought his way to the ground under escort of an impatient coachman  hullo stettson said stalky checking is it safe to come near you yet  oh yes im all right they wouldnt let me out before but i had to come to the match your mouth looks pretty plummy  turkey trod on it accidentaldoneapurpose well im glad youre better because we owe you something you and your membranes got us into a sweet mess young man  i heard of that said the boy giggling the head told me  dooce he did when  oh come on up to coll my shinll stiffen if we stay jawin here  shut up turkey i want to find out about this well  he was stayin at our house all the time i was ill  what for neglectin the coll that way thought he was in town  i was off my head you know and they said i kept on callin for him  cheek youre only a dayboy  he came just the same and he about saved my life i was all bunged up one nightjust goin to croak the doctor saidand they stuck a tube or somethin in my throat and the head sucked out the stuff  ugh shot if i would  he ought to have got diphtheria himself the doctor said so he stayed on at our house instead of going back id ha croaked in another twenty minutes the doctor says  here the coachman being under orders whipped up and nearly ran over the three  my hat said beetle thats pretty average heroic  pretty average mcturks knee in the small of his back cannoned him into stalky who punted him back you ought to be hung  and the head ought to get the vc said stalky why he might have been dead and buried by now but he wasnt but he didnt ho ho he just nipped through the hedge like a lusty old blackbird extraspecial five hundred lines an gated for a weekall sereno  ive read o somethin like that in a book said beetle gummy what a chap just think of it  im thinking said mcturk and he delivered a wild irish yell that made the team turn round  shut your fat mouth said stalky dancing with impatience leave it to your uncle stalky and hell have the head on toast if you say a word beetle till i give you leave i swear ill slay you habeo capitem crinibus minimis ive got him by the short hairs now look as if nothing had happened  there was no need of guile the school was too busy cheering the drawn match it hung round the lavatories regardless of muddy boots while the team washed it cheered crandall minor whenever it caught sight of him and it cheered more wildly than ever after prayers because the old boys in evening dress openly twirling their mustaches attended and instead of standing with the masters ranged themselves along the wall immediately before the prefects and the head called them over toomajors minors and tertiuses after their old names  yes its all very fine he said to his guests after dinner but the boys are getting a little out of hand there will be trouble and sorrow later im afraid youd better turn in early crandall the dormitory will be sitting up for you i dont know to what dizzy heights you may climb in your profession but i do know youll never get such absolute adoration as youre getting now  confound the adoration i want to finish my cigar sir  its all pure gold go where glory waits crandallminor  the setting of that apotheosis was a tenbed attic dormitory communicating through doorless openings with three others the gas flickered over the raw pine washstands there was an incessant whistling of drafts and outside the naked windows the sea beat on the pebbleridge  same old bedsame old mattress i believe said crandall yawning same old everything oh but im lame id no notion you chaps could play like this he caressed a battered shin youve given us all something to remember you by  it needed a few minutes to put them at their ease and in some way they could not understand they were more easy when crandall turned round and said his prayersa ceremony he had neglected for some years  oh i am sorry ive forgotten to put out the gas  please dont bother said the prefect of the dormitory worthington does that  a nightgowned twelveyearold who had been waiting to show off leaped from his bed to the bracket and back again by way of a washstand  how dyou manage when hes asleep said crandall chuckling  shove a cold cleek down his neck  it was a wet sponge when i was junior in the dormitory hullo whats happening  the darkness had filled with whispers the sound of trailing rugs bare feet on bare boards protests giggles and threats such as  be quiet you ass squattezvous on the floor then i swear you arent going to sit on my bed mind the toothglass etc  stacorkran said the prefect began his tone showing his sense of stalkys insolence that perhaps youd tell us about that business with duncans body  yesyesyes ran the keen whispers tell us  theres nothing to tell what on earth are you chaps hoppin about in the cold for  never mind us said the voices tell about fatsow  so crandall turned on his pillow and spoke to the generation he could not see  well about three months ago he was commanding a treasureguarda cart full of rupees to pay troops withfive thousand rupees in silver he was comin to a place called fort pearson near kalabagh  i was born there squeaked a small fag it was called after my uncle  shut upyou and your uncle never mind him crandall  well neer mind the afridis found out that this treasure was on the move and they ambushed the whole show a couple of miles before he got to the fort and cut up the escort duncan was wounded and the escort hooked it there werent more than twenty sepoys all told and there were any amount of afridis as things turned out i was in charge at fort pearson fact was id heard the firing and was just going to see about it when duncans men came up so we all turned back together they told me something about an officer but i couldnt get the hang of things till i saw a chap under the wheels of the cart out in the open propped up on one arm blazing away with a revolver you see the escort had abandoned the cart and the afridistheyre an awfully suspicious gangthought the retreat was a trapsort of draw you knowand the cart was the bait so they had left poor old duncan alone minute they spotted how few we were it was a race across the flat who should reach old duncan first we ran and they ran and we won and after a little hackin about they pulled off i never knew it was one of us till i was right on top of him there are heaps of duncans in the service and of course the name didnt remind me he wasnt changed at all hardly hed been shot through the lungs poor old man and he was pretty thirsty i gave him a drink and sat down beside him andfunny thing toohe said hullo toffee and i said hullo fatsow hope you arent hurt or something of the kind but he died in a minute or twonever lifted his head off my knees i say you chaps out there will get your death of cold better go to bed  all right in a minute but your cutsyour cuts how did you get wounded  that was when we were taking the body back to the fort they came on again and there was a bit of a scrimmage  did you kill any one  yes shouldnt wonder goodnight  goodnight thank you crandall thanks awfly crandall goodnight  the unseen crowds withdrew his own dormitory rustled into bed and lay silent for a while  i say crandallstalkys voice was tuned to a wholly foreign reverence  well what  suppose a chap found another chap croaking with diphtheriaall bunged up with itand they stuck a tube in his throat and the chap sucked the stuff out what would you say  um said crandall reflectively ive only heard of one case and that was a doctor he did it for a woman  oh this wasnt a woman it was just a boy  makes it all the finer then its about the bravest thing a man can do why  oh i heard of a chap doin it thats all  then hes a brave man  would you funk it  raather anybody would fancy dying of diphtheria in cold blood  wellah er look here the sentence ended in a grunt for stalky had leaped out of bed and with mcturk was sitting on the head of beetle who would have sprung the mine there and then  next day which was the last of the term and given up to a few wholly unimportant examinations began with wrath and war mr king had discovered that nearly all his houseit lay as you know next door but one to prouts in the long range of buildingshad unlocked the doors between the dormitories and had gone in to listen to a story told by crandall he went to the head clamorous injured appealing for he never approved of allowing socalled young men of the world to contaminate the morals of boyhood very good said the head he would attend to it  well im awfly sorry said crandall guiltily i dont think i told em anything they oughtnt to hear dont let them get into trouble on my account  tck the head answered with the ghost of a wink it isnt the boys that make trouble its the masters however prout and king dont approve of dormitory gatherings on this scale and one must back up the housemasters moreover its hopeless to punish two houses only so late in the term we must be fair and include everybody lets see they have a holiday task for the easters which of course none of them will ever look at we will give the whole school except prefects and studyboys regular prep tonight and the commonroom will have to supply a master to take it we must be fair to all  prep on the last night of the term whew said crandall thinking of his own wild youth i fancy there will be larks  the school frolicking among packed trunks whooping down the corridor and gloating in formrooms received the news with amazement and rage no school in the world did prep on the last night of the term this thing was monstrous tyrannical subversive of law religion and morality they would go into the formrooms and they would take their degraded holiday task with them buthere they smiled and speculated what manner of man the commonroom would send up against them the lot fell on mason credulous and enthusiastic who loved youth no other master was anxious to take that prep for the school lacked the steadying influence of tradition and men accustomed to the ordered routine of ancient foundations found it occasionally insubordinate the four long formrooms in which all below the rank of studyboys worked received him with thunders of applause ere he had coughed twice they favored him with a metrical summary of the marriage laws of great britain as recorded by the high priest of the israelites and commented on by the leader of the host the lower forms reminded him that it was the last day and that therefore he must take it all in play when he dashed off to rebuke them the lower fourth and upper third began with one accord to be sick loudly and realistically mr mason tried of all vain things under heaven to argue with them and a bold soul at a back desk bade him take fifty lines for not olding up is and before speaking as one who prided himself upon the perfection of his english this cut mason to the quick and while he was trying to discover the offender the upper and lower second three formrooms away turned out the gas and threw inkpots it was a pleasant and stimulating prep the studyboys and prefects heard the echoes of it far off and the commonroom at dessert smiled  stalky waited watch in hand till halfpast eight if it goes on much longer the head will come up said he well tell the studies first and then the dormrooms look sharp  he allowed no time for beetle to be dramatic or mcturk to drawl they poured into study after study told their tale and went again so soon as they saw they were understood waiting for no comment while the noise of that unholy prep grew and deepened by the door of flints study they met mason flying towards the corridorhes gone to fetch the head hurry up come on they broke into number twelve formroom abreast and panting  the head the head the head that call stilled the tumult for a minute and stalky leaping to a desk shouted he went and sucked the diphtheria stuff out of stettson majors throat when we thought he was in town stop rotting you asses stettson major would have croaked if the head hadnt done it the head might have died himself crandall says its the bravest thing any livin man can do and ihis voice crackedthe head dont know we know  mcturk and beetle jumping from desk to desk drove the news home among the junior forms there was a pause and then mason behind him the head entered it was in the established order of things that no boy should speak or move under his eye he expected the hush of awe he was received with cheerssteady ceaseless cheering being a wise man he went away and the forms were silent and a little frightened  its all right said stalky he cant do much tisnt as if youd pulled the desks up like we did when old carleton took prep once keep it up hear em cheering in the studies he rocketed out with a yell to find flint and the prefects lifting the roof off the corridor  when the head of a limited liability company paying four per cent is cheered on his saintly way to prayers not only by four formrooms of boys waiting punishment but by his trusted prefects he can either ask for an explanation or go his road with dignity while the senior housemaster glares like an excited cat and points out to a white and trembling mathematical master that certain methodsnot his thank godusually produce certain results out of delicacy the old boys did not attend that callover and it was to the school drawn up in the gymnasium that the head spoke icily  it is not often that i do not understand you but i confess i do not tonight some of you after your idiotic performances at prep seem to think me a fit person to cheer i am going to show you that i am not  crashcrashcrashcame the triple cheer that disproved it and the head glowered under the gas that is enough you will gain nothing the little boys the lower school did not like that form of address will do me three hundred lines apiece in the holidays i shall take no further notice of them the upper school will do me one thousand lines apiece in the holidays to be shown up the evening of the day they come back and further  gummy what a glutton stalky whispered  for your behavior towards mr mason i intend to lick the whole of the upper school tomorrow when i give you your journeymoney this will include the three studyboys i found dancing on the formroom desks when i came up prefects will stay after callover  the school filed out in silence but gathered in groups by the gymnasium door waiting what might befall  and now flint said the head will you be good enough to give me some explanation of your conduct  well sir said flint desperately if you save a chaps life at the risk of your own when hes dyin of diphtheria and the coll finds it out whawhat can you expect sir  um i see then that noise was not meant forah cheek i can connive at immorality but i cannot stand impudence however it does not excuse their insolence to mr mason ill forego the lines this once remember but the lickings hold good  when this news was made public the school lost in wonder and admiration gasped at the head as he went to his house here was a man to be reverenced on the rare occasions when he caned he did it very scientifically and the execution of a hundred boys would be epicimmense  its all right head sahib we know said crandall as the head slipped off his gown with a grunt in his smokingroom i found out just now from our substitute he was gettin my opinion of your performance last night in the dormitory i didnt know then that it was you he was talkin about crafty young animal freckled chap with eyescorkran i think his name is  oh i know him thank you said the head and reflectively yees i should have included them even if i hadnt seen em  if the old coll werent a little above themselves already wed chair you down the corridor said the engineer oh bates how could you you might have caught it yourself and where would we have been then  i always knew you were worth twenty of us any day now im sure of it said the squadron commander looking round for contradictions  he isnt fit to manage a school though promise youll never do it again bates sahib wewe cant go away comfy in our minds if you take these risks said the gunner  bates sahib you arent ever goin to cane the whole upper school are you said crandall  i can connive at immorality as i said but i cant stand impudence masons lot is quite hard enough even when i back him besides the men at the golfclub heard them singing aaron and moses i shall have complaints about that from the parents of dayboys decency must be preserved  were coming to help said all the guests   the upper school were caned one after the other their overcoats over their arms the brakes waiting in the road below to take them to the station their journeymoney on the table the head began with stalky mcturk and beetle he dealt faithfully by them  and heres your journeymoney goodby and pleasant holidays  goodby thank you sir goodby  they shook hands desire dont outrun performancemuchthis mornin we got the cream of it said stalky now wait till a few chaps come out and well really cheer him  dont wait on our account please said crandall speaking for the old boys were going to begin now  it was very well so long as the cheering was confined to the corridor but when it spread to the gymnasium when the boys awaiting their turn cheered the head gave it up in despair and the remnant flung themselves upon him to shake hands then they seriously devoted themselves to cheering till the brakes were hustled off the premises in dumbshow  didnt i say id get even with him said stalky on the boxseat as they swung into the narrow northam street now all togethertakin time from your uncle stalky   its a way we have in the army    its a way we have in the navy    its a way we have at the public schools    which nobody can deny     the flag of their country   it was winter and bitter cold of mornings consequently stalky and beetlemcturk being of the offensive type that makes ornate toilet under all circumstancesdrowsed till the last moment before turning out to callover in the gaslit gymnasium it followed that they were often late and since every unpunctuality earned them a black mark and since three black marks a week meant defaulters drill equally it followed that they spent hours under the sergeants hand foxy drilled the defaulters with all the pomp of his old paradeground dont think its any pleasure to me his introduction never varied id much sooner be smoking a quiet pipe in my own quartersbut i see we ave the old brigade on our ands this afternoon if i only ad you regular muster corkran said he dressing the line  youve had me for nearly six weeks you old glutton number off from the right  not quite so previous please im taking this drill left halfturn slowmarch twentyfive sluggards all old offenders filed into the gymnasium quietly provide yourselves with the requisite dumbbells returnin quietly to your place number off from the right in a low voice odd numbers one pace to the front even numbers stand fast now leanin forward from the ips takin your time from me  the dumbbells rose and fell clashed and were returned as one the boys were experts at the weary game  very good i shall be sorry when any of you resume your abits of punctuality quietly return dumbbells we will now try some simple drill  ugh i know that simple drill  it would he ighly to your discredit if you did not muster corkran at the same time it is not so easy as it looks  bet you a bob i can drill as well as you foxy  well see later now try to imagine you aint defaulters at all but an arf company on parade me bein your commandin officer theres no call to laugh if youre lucky most of you will ave to take drills arf your life do me a little credit youve been at it long enough goodness knows  they were formed into fours marched wheeled and countermarched the spell of ordered motion strong on them as foxy said they had been at it a long time  the gymnasium door opened revealing mcturk in charge of an old gentleman  the sergeant leading a wheel did not see not so bad he murmured not arf so bad the pivotman of the wheel honly marks time muster swayne now muster corkran you say you know the drill oblige me by takin over the command and reversin my words step by step relegate them to their previous formation  whats this whats this cried the visitor authoritatively  aa little drill sir stammered foxy saying nothing of first causes  excellentexcellent i only wish there were more of it he chirruped dont let me interrupt you were just going to hand over to someone werent you  he sat down breathing frostily in the chill air i shall muck it i know i shall whispered stalky uneasily and his discomfort was not lightened by a murmur from the rear rank that the old gentleman was general collinson a member of the college board of council  ehwhat said foxy  collinson kcbhe commanded the pompadoursmy fathers old regiment hissed swayne major  take your time said the visitor i know how it feels your first drilleh  yes sir he drew an unhappy breath tention dress the echo of his own voice restored his confidence  the wheel was faced about flung back broken into fours and restored to line without a falter the official hour of punishment was long passed but no one thought of that they were backing up stalkystalky in deadly fear lest his voice should crack  he does you credit sergeant was the visitors comment a good drilland good material to drill now its an extraordinary thing ive been lunching with your headmaster and he never told me you had a cadetcorps in the college  we avent sir this is only a little drill said the sergeant  but arent they keen on it said mcturk speaking for the first time with a twinkle in his deepset eyes  why arent you in it though willy  oh im not punctual enough said mcturk the sergeant only takes the pick of us  dismiss break off cried foxy fearing an explosion in the ranks ii ought to have told you sir that  but you should have a cadetcorps the general pursued his own line of thought you shall have a cadetcorps too if my recommendation in council is any use i dont know when ive been so pleased boys animated by a spirit like yours should set an example to the whole school  they do said mcturk  bless my soul can it be so late ive kept my fly waiting half an hoar well i must run away nothing like seeing things for ones self which end of the buildings does one get out at will you show me willy who was that boy who took the drill  corkran i think his name is  you ought to know him thats the kind of boy you should cultivate evidently an unusual sort a wonderful sight five and twenty boys who i dare say would much sooner be playing cricketit was the depth of winter but grown people especially those who have lived long in foreign parts make these little errors and mcturk did not correct himdrilling for the sheer love of it a shame to waste so much good stuff but i think i can carry my point  an whos your friend with the white whiskers demanded stalky on mcturks return to the study  general collinson he comes over to shoot with my father sometimes rather a decent old bargee too he said i ought to cultivate your acquaintance stalky  did he tip you mcturk exhibited a blessed whole sovereign  ah said stalky annexing it for he was treasurer well have a hefty brew youd pretty average cool cheek turkey to jaw about our keenness an punctuality  didnt the old boy know we were defaulters said beetle  not him he came down to lunch with the head i found him pokin about the place on his own hook afterwards an i thought id show him the giddy drill when i found he was so pleased i wasnt goin to damp his giddy ardor he mightnt ha given me the quid if i had  wasnt old foxy pleased did you see him get pink behind the ears said beetle it was an awful score for him didnt we back him up beautifully lets go down to keytes and get some cocoa and sassingers  they overtook foxy speeding down to retail the adventure to keyte who in his time had been troop sergeantmajor in a cavalry regiment and now warworn veteran was local postmaster and confectioner  you owe us something said stalky with meaning  im ighly grateful muster corkran ive ad to run against you pretty hard in the way o business now and then but i will say that outside o businessbounds an smokin an such likei dont wish to have a more trustworthy young gentleman to elp me out of a hole the way you andled the drill was beautiful though i say it now if you come regular henceforward  but hell have to be late three times a week said beetle you cant expect a chap to do thatjust to please you foxy  ah thats true still if you could manage itand you muster beetleit would give you a big start when the cadetcorps is formed i expect the general will recommend it  they raided keytes very much at their own sweet will for the old man who knew them well was deep in talk with foxy i make what weve taken seven and six stalky called at last over the counter but youd better count for yourself  nono id take your word any day muster corkranin the pompadours was he sergeant we lay with them once at umballa i think it was  i dont know whether this hamandtongue tin is eighteen pence or one an four  say one an fourpence muster corkran of course sergeant if it was any use to give my time id be pleased to do it but im too old id like to see a drill again  oh come on stalky cried mcturk he isnt listenin to you chuck over the money  i want the quid changed you ass keyte private keyte corporal keyte terroopsergeantmajor keyte will you give me change for a quid  yesyes of course seven an six he stared abstractedly pushed the silver over and melted away into the darkness of the back room  now those twoll jaw about the mutiny till teatime said beetle  old keyte was at sobraon said stalky hear him talk about that sometimes beats foxy hollow   the heads face inscrutable as ever was bent over a pile of letters  what do you think he said at last to the reverend john gillett  its a good idea theres no denying thatan estimable idea  we concede that much well  i have my doubts about itthats all the more i know of boys the less do i profess myself capable of following their moods but i own i shall be very much surprised if the scheme takes itit isnt the temper of the school we prepare for the army  my businessin this matteris to carry out the wishes of the council they demand a volunteer cadetcorps a volunteer cadetcorps will be furnished i have suggested however that we need not embark upon the expense of uniforms till we are drilled general collinson is sending us fifty lethal weaponscutdown sniders he calls themall carefully plugged  yes

creamy complexion mcturk asked with a villainous sneer  shut up turkey you arent goin up for the army  no but im goin to send a substitute hi morrell an wake you two fags by the armrack youve got to volunteer  blushing deeplythey had been too shy to apply beforethe youngsters sidled towards the sergeant  but i dont want the little chapsnot at first said the sergeant disgustedly i wantid like some of the old brigade the defaultersto stiffen em a bit  dont be ungrateful sergeant theyre nearly as big as you get em in the army now mcturk read the papers of those years and could be trusted for general information which he used as he used his tweaker yet he did not know that wake minor would be a bimbashi of the egyptian army ere his thirtieth year  hogan swayne stalky perowne and ansell were deep in consultation by the vaultinghorse stalky as usual laying down the law the sergeant watched them uneasily knowing that many waited on their lead  foxy dont like my recruits said mcturk in a pained tone to beetle you get him some  nothing loath beetle pinioned two more fagseach no taller than a carbine here you are foxy heres food for powder strike for your hearths an homes you young brutesan be jolly quick about it  still he isnt happy said mcturk     for the way we have with our army    is the way we have with our navy  here beetle joined in they had found the poem in an old volume of punch and it seemed to cover the situation     an both of em led to adversity    which nobody can deny  you be quiet young gentlemen if you cant elpdont inder foxys eye was still on the council by the horse carter white and tyrrell all boys of influence had joined it the rest fingered the rifles irresolutely wait a shake cried stalky cant we turn out those rotters before we get to work  certainly said foxy any one wishful to join will stay ere those who do not so intend will go out quietly closin the door beind em  half a dozen of the earnestminded rushed at them and they had just time to escape into the corridor  well why dont you join beetle asked resettling his collar  why didnt you  whats the good we arent goin up for the army besides i know the drillall except the manual of course wonder what theyre doin inside  makin a treaty with foxy didnt you hear stalky say thats what well doan if he dont like it he can lump it theyll use foxy for a cram cant you see you idiot theyre goin up for sandhurst or the shop in less than a year theyll learn their drill an then theyll drop it like a shot dyou suppose chaps with their amount of extratu are takin up volunteerin for fun  well i dont know i thought of doin a poem about itrottin em you knowthe ballad of the dogshooterseh  i dont think you can because kingll be down on the corps like a cartload o bricks he hasnt been consulted hes sniffin round the noticeboard now lets lure him they strolled up carelessly towards the honsemastera most meek couple  hows this said king with a start of feigned surprise methought you would be learning to fight for your country  i think the companys full sir said mcturk  its a great pity sighed beetle  forty valiant defenders have we then how noble what devotion i presume that it is possible that a desire to evade their normal responsibilities may be at the bottom of this zeal doubtless they will be accorded special privileges like the choir and the natural history societyone must not say bughunters  oh i suppose so sir said mcturk cheerily the head hasnt said anything about it yet but he will of course  oh sure to  it is just possible my beetle king wheeled on the last speaker that the housemastersa necessary but somewhat neglected factor in our humble scheme of existencemay have a word to say on the matter life for the young at least is not all weapons and munitions of war education is incidentally one of our aims  what a consistent pig he is cooed mcturk when they were out of earshot one always knows where to have him did you see how he rose to that draw about the head and special privileges  confound him he might have had the decency to have backed the scheme i could do such a lovely ballad rottin it and now ill have to be a giddy enthusiast it dont bar our pulling stalkys leg in the study does it  oh no but in the coll we must be procadetcorps like anything cant you make up a giddy epigram a la catullus about king objectin to it beetle was at this noble task when stalky returned all hot from his first drill  hullo my ramrodbunger began mcturk wheres your dead dog is it defence or defiance  defiance said stalky and leaped on him at that word look here turkey you mustnt rot the corps weve arranged it beautifully foxy swears he wont take us out into the open till we say we want to go  disgustin exhibition of immature infants apin the idiosyncrasies of their elders snff  have you drawn king beetle stalky asked in a pause of the scuffle  not exactly but thats his genial style  well listen to your uncle stalkywho is a great man moreover and subsequently foxys goin to let us drill the corps in turnprivatim et seriatimso that well all know how to handle a half company anyhow ergo an propter hoc when we go to the shop we shall be dismissed drill early thus my beloved earers combinin education with wholesome amusement  i knew youd make a sort of extratu of it you coldblooded brute said mcturk dont you want to die for your giddy country  not if i can jolly well avoid it so you mustnt rot the corps  wed decided on that years ago said beetle scornfully kingll do the rottin  then youve got to rot king my giddy poet make up a good catchy limerick and let the fags sing it  look here you stick to volunteerin and dont jog the table  he wont have anything to take hold of said stalky with dark significance  they did not know what that meant till a few days later they proposed to watch the corps at drill they found the gymnasium door locked and a fag on guard this is sweet cheek said mcturk stooping  mustnt look through the keyhole said the sentry  i like that why wake you little beast i made you a volunteer  cant help it my orders are not to allow any one to look  spose we do said mcturk spose we jolly well slay you  my orders are i am to give the name of anybody who interfered with me on my post to the corps an theyd deal with him after drill accordin to martial law  what a brute stalky is said beetle they never doubted for a moment who had devised that scheme  you esteem yourself a giddy centurion dont you said beetle listening to the crash and rattle of grounded arms within  my ordcrs are not to talk except to explain my orderstheyll lick me if i do  mcturk looked at beetle the two shook their heads and turned away  i swear stalky is a great man said beetle after a long pause one consolation is that this sort of secretsociety biznai will drive king wild  it troubled many more than king but the members of the corps were muter than oysters foxy being bound by no vow carried his woes to keyte  i never come across such nonsense in my life theyve tiled the lodge inner and outer guard all complete and then they get to work keen as mustard  but whats it all for asked the extroop sergeantmajor  to learn their drill you never saw anything like it they begin after ive dismissed empractisin tricks but out into the open they will not comenot for ever so the ole thing is preposterous if youre a cadetcorps i say be a cadetcorps instead o hidin beind locked doors  and what do the authorities say about it  that beats me again the sergeant spoke fretfully i go to the ead an e gives me no help theres times when i think hes makin fun o me ive never been a volunteersergeant thank godbut ive always had the consideration to pity em im glad o that  id like to see em said keyte from your statements sergeant i cant get at what theyre after  dont ask me major ask that frecklefaced young corkran hes their generalissimo  one does not refuse a warrior of sobraon or deny the only pastrycook within bounds so keyte came by invitation leaning upon a stick tremulous with old age to sit in a corner and watch  they shape well they shape uncommon well he whispered between evolutions  oh this isnt what theyre after wait till i dismiss em  at the breakoff the ranks stood fast perowne fell out faced them and refreshing his memory by glimpses at a redbound metalclasped book drilled them for ten minutes this is that perowne who was shot in equatorial africa by his own men ansell followed him and hogan followed ansell all three were implicitly obeyed then stalky laid aside his snider and drawing a long breath favored the company with a blast of withering invective  old ard muster corkran that aint in any drill cried foxy  all right sergeant you never know what you may have to say to your menfor pitys sake try to stand up without leanin against each other you bleareyed herringutted guttersnipes its no pleasure to me to comb you out that ought to have been done before you came here youyou militia broomstealers  the old touchthe old touch we know it said keyte wiping his rheumy eyes but where did he pick it up  from his fatheror his uncle dont ask me half of em must have been born within earshot o the barracks foxy was not far wrong in his guess ive heard more backtalk since this volunteerin nonsense began than ive heard in a year in the service  theres a rearrank man lookin as though his belly were in the pawnshop yes you private ansell and stalky tonguelashed the victim for three minutes in gross and in detail  hullo he returned to his normal tone first blood to me you flushed ansell you wriggled  couldnt help flushing was the answer dont think i wriggled though  well its your turn now stalky resumed his place in the ranks  lord lord its as good as a play chuckled the attentive keyte ansell too had been blessed with relatives in the service and slowly in a lazy drawlhis style was more reflective than stalkysdescended the abysmal depths of personality  blood to me he shouted triumphantly you couldnt stand it either stalky was a rich red and his snider shook visibly  i didnt think i would he said struggling for composure but after a bit i got in no end of a bait curious aint it  good for the temper said the slowmoving hogan as they returned arms to the rack  did you ever said foxy hopelessly to keyte  i dont know much about volunteers but its the rummiest show i ever saw i can see what theyre gettin at though lord how often ive been told off an dressed down in my day they shape wellextremely well they shape  if i could get em out into the open theres nothing i couldnt do with em major perhaps when the uniforms come down theyll change their mind  indeed it was time that the corps made some concession to the curiosity of the school thrice had the guard been maltreated and thrice had the corps dealt out martial law to the offender the school raged what was the use they asked of a cadetcorps which none might see mr king congratulated them on their invisible defenders and they could not parry his thrusts foxy was growing sullen and restive a few of the corps expressed openly doubts as to the wisdom of their course and the question of uniforms loomed on the near horizon if these were issued they would be forced to wear them  but as so often happens in this life the matter was suddenly settled from without  the head had duly informed the council that their recommendation had been acted upon and that so far as he could learn the buys were drilling he said nothing of the terms on which they drilled naturally general collinson was delighted and told his friends one of his friends rejoiced in a friend a member of parliamenta zealous an intelligent and above all a patriotic person anxious to do the most good in the shortest possible time but we cannot answer alas for the friends of our friends if collinsons friend had introduced him to the general the latter would have taken his measure and saved much but the friend merely spoke of his friend and since no two people in the world see eye to eye the picture conveyed to collinson was inaccurate moreover the man was an mp an impeccable conservative and the general had the english soldiers lurking respect for any member of the court of last appeal he was going down into the west country to spread light in somebodys benighted constituency wouldnt it be a good idea if armed with the generals recommendation he taking the admirable and newly established cadetcorps for his text spoke a few wordsjust talked to the boys a littleeh you know the kind of thing that would be acceptable and hed be the very man to do it the sort of talk that boys understand you know  they didnt talk to em much in my time said the general suspiciously  ah but times changewith the spread of education and so on the boys of today are the men of tomorrow an impression in youth is likely to be permanent and in these times you know with the country going to the dogs  youre quite right the island was then entering on five years of mr gladstones rule and the general did not like what he had seen of it he would certainly write to the head for it was beyond question that the boys of today made the men of tomorrow that if he might say so was uncommonly well put  in reply the head stated that he should be delighted to welcome mr raymond martin mp of whom he had heard so much to put him up for the night and to allow him to address the school on any subject that he conceived would interest them if mr martin had not yet faced an audience of this particular class of british youth the head had no doubt that he would find it an interesting experience  and i dont think i am very far wrong in that last he confided to the reverend john do you happen to know anything of one raymond martin  i was at college with a man of that name the chaplain replied he was without form and void so far as i remember but desperately earnest  he will address the coll on patriotism next saturday  if there is one thing our boys detest more than another it is having their saturday evenings broken into patriotism has no chance beside brewing  nor art either dyou remember our evening with shakespeare the heads eyes twinkled or the humorous gentleman with the magic lantern   an who the dooce is this raymond martin mp demanded beetle when he read the notice of the lecture in the corridor why do the brutes always turn up on a saturday  ouh reomeo reomeo wherefore art thou reomeo said mcturk over his shoulder quoting the shakespeare artiste of last term well he wont be as bad as her i hope stalky are you properly patriotic because if you aint this chaps goin to make you  hope he wont take up the whole of the evening i suppose weve got to listen to him  wouldnt miss him for the world said mcturk a lot of chaps thought that romeoromeo woman was a bore i didnt i liked her member when she began to hiccough in the middle of it praps hell hiccough whoever gets into the gym first bags seats for the other two   there was no nervousness but a brisk and cheery affability about mr raymond martin mp as he drove up watched by many eyes to the heads house  looks a bit of a bargee was mcturks comment shouldnt be surprised if he was a radical he rowed the driver about the fare i heard him  that was his giddy patriotism beetle explained after tea they joined the rush for seats secured a private and invisible corner and began to criticise every gasjet was lit on the little dais at the far end stood the heads official desk whence mr martin would discourse and a ring of chairs for the masters  entered then foxy with official port and leaned something like a cloth rolled round a stick against the desk no one in authority was yet present so the school applauded crying whats that foxy what are you stealin the gentlemans brolly forwe dont birch here we cane take away that baublenumber off from the rightand so forth till the entry of the head and the masters ended all demonstrations  one good jobthe commonroom hate this as much as we do watch king wrigglin to get out of the draft  wheres the raymondiferous martin punctuality my beloved earers is the image o war  shut up heres the giddy dook golly what a dewlap mr martin in evening dress was undeniably throatya tall generously designed pinkandwhite man still beetle need not have been coarse  look at his back while hes talkin to the head vile bad form to turn your back on the audience hes a philistinea boppera jebusitean a hivite mcturk leaned back and sniffed contemptuously  in a few colorless words the head introduced the speaker and sat down amid applause when mr martin took the applause to himself they naturally applauded more than ever it was some time before he could begin he had no knowledge of the schoolits tradition or heritage he did not know that the last census showed that eighty per cent of the boys had been born abroadin camp cantonment or upon the high seas or that seventyfive per cent were sons of officers in one or other of the serviceswilloughbys paulets de castros maynes randalls after their kindlooking to follow their fathers profession the head might have told him this and much more but after an hourlong dinner in his company the head decided to say nothing whatever mr raymond martin seemed to know so much already  he plunged into his speech with a longdrawn rasping well boys that though they were not conscious of it set every young nerve ajar he supposed they knewheywhat he had come down for it was not often that he had an opportunity to talk to boys he supposed that boys were very much the same kind of personssome people thought them rather funny personsas they had been in his youth  this man said mcturk with conviction is the gadarene swine  but they must remember that they would not always be boys they would grow up into men because the boys of today made the men of tomorrow and upon the men of tomorrow the fair fame of their glorious native land depended  if this goes on my beloved earers it will be my painful duty to rot this bargee stalky drew a long breath through his nose  cant do that said mcturk he aint chargin anything for his romeo  and so they ought to think of the duties and responsibilities of the life that was opening before them life was not allhe enumerated a few games and that nothing might be lacking to the sweep and impact of his fall added marbles yes life was not he said all marbles  there was one tense gaspamong the juniors almost a shriekof quivering horror he was a heathenan outcastbeyond the extremest pale of tolerationselfdamned before all men stalky bowed his head in his hands mcturk with a bright and cheerful eye drank in every word and beetle nodded solemn approval  some of them doubtless expected in a few years to have the honor of a commission from the queen and to wear a sword now he himself had had some experience of these duties as a major in a volunteer regiment and he was glad to learn that they had established a volunteer corps in their midst the establishment of such an establishment conduced to a proper and healthy spirit which if fostered would be of great benefit to the land they loved and were so proud to belong to some of those now present expected he had no doubtsome of them anxiously looked forward to leading their men against the bullets of englands foes to confronting the stricken field in all the pride of their youthful manhood  now the reserve of a boy is tenfold deeper than the reserve of a maid she being made for one end only by blind nature but man for several with a large and healthy hand he tore down these veils and trampled them under the wellintentioned feet of eloquence in a raucous voice he cried aloud little matters like the hope of honor and the dream of glory that boys do not discuss even with their most intimate equals cheerfully assuming that till he spoke they had never considered these possibilities he pointed them to shining goals with fingers which smudged out all radiance on all horizons he profaned the most secret places of their souls with outcries and gesticulations he bade them consider the deeds of their ancestors in such a fashion that they were flushed to their tingling ears some of themthe rending voice cut a frozen stillnessmight have had relatives who perished in defence of their country they thought not a few of them of an old sword in a passage or above a breakfastroom table seen and fingered by stealth since they could walk he adjured them to emulate those illustrious examples and they looked all ways in their extreme discomfort  their years forbade them even to shape their thoughts clearly to themselves they felt savagely that they were being outraged by a fat man who considered marbles a game  and so he worked towards his perorationwhich by the way he used later with overwhelming success at a meeting of electorswhile they sat flushed and uneasy in sour disgust after many many words he reached for the clothwrapped stick and thrust one hand in his bosom thisthis was the concrete symbol of their landworthy of all honor and reverence let no boy look on this flag who did not purpose to worthily add to its imperishable lustre he shook it before thema large calico union jack staring in all three colors and waited for the thunder of applause that should crown his effort  they looked in silence they had certainly seen the thing beforedown at the coastguard station or through a telescope halfmast high when a brig went ashore on braunton sands above the roof of the golfclub and in keytes window where a certain kind of striped sweetmeat bore it in paper on each box but the college never displayed it it was no part of the scheme of their lives the head had never alluded to it their fathers had not declared it unto them it was a matter shut up sacred and apart what in the name of everything caddish was he driving at who waved that horror before their eyes happy thought perhaps he was drunk  the head saved the situation by rising swiftly to propose a vote of thanks and at his first motion the school clapped furiously from a sense of relief  and i am sure he concluded the gaslight full on his face that you will all join me in a very hearty vote of thanks to mr raymond martin for the most enjoyable address he has given us  to this day we shall never know the rights of the case the head vows that he did no such thing or that if he did it must have been something in his eye but those who were present are persuaded that he winked once openly and solemnly after the word enjoyable mr raymond martin got his applause full tale as he said without vanity i think my few words went to their hearts i never knew boys could cheer like that  he left as the prayerbell rang and the boys lined up against the wall the flag lay still unrolled on the desk foxy regarding it with pride for he had been touched to the quick by mr martins eloquence the head and the commonroom standing back on the dais could not see the glaring offence but a prefect left the line rolled it up swiftly and as swiftly tossed it into a glove and foil locker  then as though he had touched a spring broke out the low murmur of content changing to quickvolleyed handclapping  they discussed the speech in the dormitories there was not one dissentient voice mr raymond martin beyond question was born in a gutter and bred in a boardschool where they played marbles he was further i give the barest handful from great store a flopshus cad an outrageous stinker a jellybellied flagflapper this was stalkys contribution and several other things which it is not seemly to put down  the volunteer cadetcorps fell in next monday depressedly with a face of shame even then judicious silence might have turned the corner  said foxy after a fine speech like what you eard night before last you ought to take old of your drill with renewed activity i dont see how you can avoid comin out an marchin in the open now  cant we get out of it then foxy stalkys fine old silky tone should have warned him  no not with his giving the flag so generously he told me before he left this morning that there was no objection to the corps usin it as their own its a handsome flag  stalky returned his rifle to the rack in dead silence and fell out his example was followed by hogan and ansell perowne hesitated look here oughtnt we he began  ill get it out of the locker in a minute said the sergeant his back turned then we can  come on shouted stalky what the devil are you waiting for dismiss break off  whywhat thewhere the  the rattle of sniders slammed into the rack drowned his voice as boy after boy fell out  ii dont know that i shant have to report this to the head he stammered  report then and be damned to you cried stalky white to the lips and ran out   rummy thing said beetle to mcturk i was in the study doin a simply lovely poem about the jellybellied flagflapper an stalky came in an i said hullo an he cursed me like a bargee and then he began to blub like anything shoved his head on the table and howled hadnt we better do something  mcturk was troubled praps hes smashed himself up somehow  they found him with very bright eyes whistling between his teeth  did i take you in beetle i thought i would wasnt it a good draw didnt you think i was blubbin didnt i do it well oh you fat old ass and he began to pull beetles ears and checks in the fashion that was called milking  i knew you were blubbin beetle replied composedly why arent you at drill  drill what drill  dont try to be a clever fool drill in the gym  cause there isnt any the volunteer cadetcorps is broke updisbandeddeadputridcorruptstinkin an if you look at me like that beetle ill slay you too oh yes an im goin to be reported to the head for swearin     the last term   it was within a few days of the holidays the termend examinations and more important still the issue of the college paper which beetle edited he had been cajoled into that office by the blandishments of stalky and mcturk and the extreme rigor of study law once installed he discovered as others have done before him that his duty was to do the work while his friends criticized stalky christened it the swillingford patriot in pious memory of spongeand mcturk compared the output unfavorably with ruskin and de quincey only the head took an interest in the publication and his methods were peculiar he gave beetle the run of his brownbound tobaccoscented library prohibiting nothing recommending nothing there beetle found a fat armchair a silver inkstand and unlimited pens and paper there were scores and scores of ancient dramatists there were hakluyt his voyages french translations of muscovite authors called pushkin and lermontoff little tales of a heady and bewildering nature interspersed with unusual songspeacock was that writers name there was borrows lavengro an odd theme purporting to be a translation of something called a rubaiyat which the head said was a poem not yet come to its own there were hundreds of volumes of versecrashaw dryden alexander smith l e l lydia sigourney fletcher and a purple island donne marlowes faust  andthis made mcturk to whom beetle conveyed it sheer drunk for three daysossian the earthly paradise atalanta in calydon and rossettito name only a few then the head drifting in under pretense of playing censor to the paper would read here a verse and here another of these poets opening up avenues and slow breathing with halfshut eyes above his cigar would he speak of great men living and journals long dead founded in their riotous youth of years when all the planets were little newlit stars trying to find their places in the uncaring void and he the head knew them as young men know one another so the regular work went to the dogs beetle being full of other matters and meters hoarded in secret and only told to mcturk of an afternoon on the sands walking high and disposedly round the wreck of the armada galleons shouting and declaiming against the longridged seas  thanks in large part to their housemasters experienced distrust the three for three consecutive terms had been passed over for promotion to the rank of prefectan office that went by merit and carried with it the honor of the groundash and liberty under restrictions to use it  but said stalky come to think of it weve done more giddy jesting with the sixth since weve been passed over than any one else in the last seven years  he touched his neck proudly it was encircled by the stiffest of stickup collars which custom decreed could be worn only by the sixth and the sixth saw those collars and said no word pussy abanazar or dick four of a year ago would have seen them discarded in five minutes or but the sixth of that term was made up mostly of young but brilliantly clever boys pets of the housemasters too anxious for their dignity to care to come to open odds with the resourceful three so they crammed their caps at the extreme back of their heads instead of a trifle over one eye as the fifth should and rejoiced in patentleather boots on weekdays and marvellous madeup ties on sundaysno man rebuking mcturk was going up for coopers hill and stalky for sandhurst in the spring and the head had told them both that unless they absolutely collapsed during the holidays they were safe as a trainer of colts the head seldom erred in an estimate of form  he had taken beetle aside that day and given him much good advice not one word of which did beetle remember when he dashed up to the study white with excitement and poured out the wondrous tale it demanded a great belief  you begin on a hundred a year said mcturk unsympathetically rot  and my passage out its all settled the head says hes been breaking me in for this for ever so long and i never knewi never knew one dont begin with writing straight off yknow begin by filling in telegrams and cutting things out o papers with scissors  oh scissors what an ungodly mess youll make of it said stalky but anyhow this will be your last term too seven years my dearly beloved earersthough not prefects  not half bad years either said mcturk i shall be sorry to leave the old coll shant you  they looked out over the sea creaming along the pebbleridge in the clear winter light wonder where we shall all be this time next year said stalky absently  this time five years said mcturk  oh said beetle my leavins between ourselves the head hasnt told any one i know he hasnt because prout grunted at me today that if i were more reasonableyahi might be a prefect next term i sppose hes hard up for his prefects  lets finish up with a row with the sixth suggested mcturk  dirty little schoolboys said stalky who already saw himself a sandhurst cadet whats the use  moral effect quoth mcturk leave an imperishable tradition and all the rest of it  better go into bideford an pay up our debts said stalky ive got three quid out of my fatherad hoc dont owe more than thirty bob either cut along beetle and ask the head for leave say you want to correct the swillingford patriot  well i do said beetle itll be my last issue and id like it to look decent ill catch him before he goes to his lunch  ten minutes later they wheeled out in line by grace released from five oclock callover and all the afternoon lay before them so also unluckily did king who never passed without witticisms but brigades of kings could not have ruffled beetle that day  aha enjoying the study of light literature my friends said he rubbing his hands common mathematics are not for such soaring minds as yours are they  one hundred a year thought beetle smiling into vacancy  our open incompetence takes refuge in the flowery paths of inaccurate fiction but a day of reckoning approaches beetle mine i myself have prepared a few trifling foolish questions in latin prose which can hardly be evaded even by your practised acts of deception yees latin prose i think if i may say sobut we shall see when the papers are setulpian serves your need aha elucescebat quoth our friend we shall see we shall see  still no sign from beetle he was on a steamer his passage paid into the wide and wonderful worlda thousand leagues beyond lundy island  king dropped him with a snarl  he doesnt know hell go on correctin exercises an jawin an showin off before the little boys next termand next beetle hurried after his companions up the steep path of the furzeclad hill behind the college  they were throwing pebbles on the top of the gasometer and the grimy gasman in change bade them desist they watched him oil a turncock sunk in the ground between two furzebushes  cokey whats that for said stalky  to turn the gas on to the kitchens said cokey if so be i didnt turn her on yeou young genlemen ud be larnin your book by candlelight  um said stalky and was silent for at least a minute  hullo where are you chaps going a bend of the lane brought them face to face with tulke senior prefect of kings housea smallish whitehaired boy of the type that must be promoted on account of its intellect and ever afterwards appeals to the head to support its authority when zeal has outrun discretion  the three took no sort of notice they were on lawful pass tulke repeated his question hotly for he had suffered many slights from number five study and fancied that he had at last caught them tripping  what the devil is that to you stalky replied with his sweetest smile  look here im not goinim not goin to be sworn at by the fifth sputtered tulke  then cut along and call a prefects meeting said mcturk knowing tulkes weakness  the prefect became inarticulate with rage  mustnt yell at the fifth that way said stalky its vile bad form  cough it up ducky mcturk said calmly  ii want to know what you chaps are doing out of bounds this with an important flourish of his groundash  ah said stalky now were gettin at it why didnt you ask that before  well i ask it now what are you doing  were admiring you tulke said stalky we think youre no end of a fine chap dont we  we do we do a dogcart with some girls in it swept round the corner and stalky promptly kneeled before tulke in the attitude of prayer so tulke turned a color  ive reason to believe he began  oyez oyez oyez shouted beetle after the manner of bidefords town crier tulke has reason

firmly against the inner door lest mother yeo should return inopportunely for marys face was set it was then that tulke found his way blocked by a tall daughter of devonthat county of easy kisses the pleasantest under the sun he dodged aside politely she reflected a moment and laid a vast hand upon his shoulder  where be ee gwaine tu my dearr said she  over the handkerchief he had crammed into his mouth stalky could see the boy turn scarlet  gie i a kiss dont they larn ee manners to college  tulke gasped and wheeled solemnly and conscientiously mary kissed him twice and the luckless prefect

don juan  course he kissed her said mcturk in the middle of the street with his housecap on  time 357 pm make a note o that what dyou mean beetle said stalky  well hes a truthful little beast he may say he was kissed  and then  why then beetle capered at the mere thought of it dont you see the corollary to the giddy proposition is that the sixth cant protect emselves from outrages an ravishins want nursemaids to look after em weve only got to whisper that to the coll jam for the sixth jam for us either way its jammy  by gum said stalky our last terms endin well now you cut along an finish up your old rag and turkey and me will help well go in the back way no need to bother randall  dont play the giddy gardengoat then beetle knew what help meant though he was by no means averse to showing his importance before his allies the little loft behind randalls printing office was his own territory where he saw himself already controlling the times here under the guidance of the inky apprentice he had learned to find his way more or less circuitously about the case and considered himself an expert compositor  the school paper in its locked formes lay on a stonetopped table a proof by the side but not for worlds would beetle have corrected from the mere proof with a mallet and a pair of tweezers he knocked out mysterious wedges of wood that released the forme picked a letter here and inserted a letter there reading as he went along and stopping much to chuckle over his own contributions  you wont show off like that said mcturk when youve got to do it for your living upside down and backwards isnt it lets see if i can read it  get out said beetle go and read those formes in the rack there if you think you know so much  formes in a rack whats that dont be so beastly professional  mcturk drew off with stalky to prowl about the office they left little unturned  come here a shake beetle whats this thing aid stalky in a few minutes looks familiar  said beetle after a glance its kings latin prose exam paper inin varrem actio prima what a lark  think o the puresouled highminded boys whod give their eyes for a squint at it said mcturk  no willie dear said stalky that would be wrong and painful to our kind teachers you wouldnt crib willie would you  cant read the beastly stuff anyhow was the reply besides were leavin at the end o the term so it makes no difference to us  member what the considerate bloomer did to spraggons account of the puffinton hounds we must sugar mr kings milk for him said stalky all lighted from within by a devilish joy lets see what beetle can do with those forceps hes so proud of  dont see now you can make latin prose much more cockeye than it is but well try said beetle transposing an aliud and asiae from two sentences lets see well put that fullstop a little further on and begin the sentence with the next capital hurrah heres three lines that can move up all in a lump  one of those scientific rests for which this eminent huntsman is so justly celebrated stalky knew the puffington run by heart  hold on heres a volvoluntate quidnam all by itself said mcturk  ill attend to her in a shake quidnam goes after

quis multa gracilis o course  bring it along weve sugared the milk here said stalky after a few minutes zealous toil never thrash your hounds unnecessarily  quis munditiis i swear thats not bad began beetle plying the tweezers dont that interrogation look pretty heu quoties fidem that sounds as if the chap were anxious an excited cui flavam religas in rosawhose flavor is relegated to a rose mutatosque deos flebit in antro  mute gods weepin in a cave suggested stalky pon my sam horace needs as much lookin after astulke  they edited him faithfully till it was too dark to see   aha elucescebat quoth our friend ulpian serves my need does it if king can make anything out of that im a blueeyed squatteroo said beetle as they slid out of the loft window into a back alley of old acquaintance and started on a threemile trot to the college but the revision of the classics had detained them too long they halted blown and breathless in the furze at the back of the gasometer the college lights twinkling below ten minutes at least late for tea and lockup  its no good puffed mcturk bet a bob foxy is waiting for defaulters under the lamp by the fives court its a nuisance too because the head gave us long leave and one doesnt like to break it  let me now from the bonded wareouse of my knowledge began stalky  oh rot dont jorrock can we make a run for it snapped mcturk  bishops boots mr radcliffe also condemned an spoke ighly in favor of tops cleaned with champagne an abricot jam wheres that thing cokey was twiddlin this afternoon  they heard him groping in the wet and presently beheld a great miracle the lights of the coastguard cottages near the sea went out the brilliantly illuminated windows of the golfclub disappeared and were followed by the frontages of the two hotels scattered villas dulled twinkled and vanished last of all the college lights died also they were left in the pitchy darkness of a windy winters night  blister my kidneys it is a frost the dahlias are dead said stalky bunk  they squattered through the dripping gorse as the college hummed like an angry hive and the diningrooms chorused gas gas gas till they came to the edge of the sunk path that divided them from their study dropping that haha like bullets and rebounding like boys they dashed to their study in less than two minutes had changed into dry trousers and coat and ostentatiously slippered joined the mob in the dininghall which resembled the stormcentre of a south american revolution  hellish dark and smells of cheese stalky elbowed his way into the press howling lustily for gas cokey must have gone for a walk foxyll have to find him  prout as the nearest housemaster was trying to restore order for rude boys were flicking butterpats across chaos and mcturk had turned on the fags teaurn so that many were parboiled and wept with an unfeigned dolor the fourth and upper third broke into the school song the vive la compagnie to the accompaniment of drumming knifehandles and the junior forms shrilled batlike shrieks and raided one anothers victuals two hundred and fifty boys in high condition seeking for more light are truly earnest inquirers  when a most vile smell of gas told them that supplies had been renewed stalky waistcoat unbuttoned sat gorgedly over what might have been his fourth cup of tea and thats all right he said hullo eres pomponius ego  it was carson the head of the school a simple straightminded soul and a pillar of the first fifteen who crossed over from the prefects table and in a husky official voice invited the three to attend in his study in half an hour prefects meetin prefects meetin hissed the tables and they imitated barbarically the actions and effects of the groundash  how are we goin to jest with em said stalky turning halfface to beetle its your play this time  look here was the answer all i want you to do is not to laugh im goin to take charge o young tulkes immoralitya la king and its goin to be serious if you cant help laughin dont look at me or ill go pop  i see all right said stalky  mcturks lank frame stiffened in every muscle and his eyelids dropped half over his eyes that last was a warsignal  the eight or nine seniors their faces very set and sober were ranged in chairs round carsons severely philistine study tulke was not popular among them and a few who had had experience of stalky and company doubted that he might perhaps have made an ass of himself but the dignity of the sixth was to be upheld so carson began hurriedly look here you chaps iveweve sent for you to tell you youre a good deal too cheeky to the sixthhave been for some timeandand weve stood about as much as were goin to and it seems youve been cursin and swearin at tulke on the bideford road this afternoon and were goin to show you you cant do it thats all  well thats awfully good of you said stalky but we happen to have a few rights of our own too you cant just because you happen to be made prefects haul up seniors and jaw em on spec like a housemaster we arent fags carson this kind of thing may do for davies tertius but it wont do for us  its only old prouts lunacy that we werent prefects long ago you know that said mcturk you havent any tact  hold on said beetle a prefects meetin has to be reported to the head i want to know if the head backs tulke in this business  wellwell it isnt exactly a prefects meeting said carson we only called you in to warn you  but all the prefects are here beetle insisted wheres the difference  my gum said stalky do you mean to say youve just called us in for a jawafter comin to us before the whole school at tea an givin em the impression it was a prefects meeting pon my sam carson youll get into trouble you will  holeancorner businessholeancorner business said mcturk wagging his head beastly suspicious  the sixth looked at each other uneasily tulke had called three prefects meetings in two terms till the head had informed the sixth that they were expected to maintain discipline without the recurrent menace of his authority now it seemed that they had made a blunder at the outset but any rightminded boy would have sunk the legality and been properly impressed by the court beetles protest was distinct cheek  well you chaps deserve a lickin cried one naughten incautiously then was beetle filled with a noble inspiration  for interferin with tulkes amours eh tulke turned a rich sloe color oh no you dont beetle went on youve had your innings weve been sent up for cursing and swearing at you and were goin to be let off with a warning are we now then youre going to catch it  iii tulke began dont let that young devil start jawing  if youve anything to say you must say it decently said carson  decently i will now look here when we went into bideford we met this ornament of the sixthis that decent enoughhanging about on the road with a nasty look in his eye we didnt know then why he was so anxious to stop us but at five minutes to four when we were in yeos shop we saw tulke in broad daylight with his housecap on kissin an huggin a woman on the pavement is that decent enough for you  i didnti wasnt  we saw you said beetle and nowill be decent carsonyou sneak back with her kisses not for nothing had beetle perused the later poets hot on your lips and call prefects meetings which arent prefects meetings to uphold the honor of the sixth a new and heavencleft path opened before him that instant and how do we know he shoutedhow do we know how many of the sixth are mixed up in this abominable affair  yes thats what we want to know said mcturk with simple dignity  we meant to come to you about it quietly carson but you would have the meeting said stalky sympathetically  the sixth were too taken aback to reply so carefully modelling his rhetoric on king beetle followed up the attack surpassing and surprising himself itit isnt so much the cynical immorality of the biznai as the blatant indecency of it thats so awful as far as we can see its impossible for us to go into bideford without runnin up against some prefects unwholesome amours theres nothing to snigger over naughten i dont pretend to know much about these thingsbut it seems to me a chap must be pretty far dead in sin that was a quotation from the school chaplain when he takes to embracing his paramours that was hakluyt before all the city a reminiscence of milton he might at least have the decencyyoure authorities on decency i believeto wait till dark but he didnt you didnt oh tulke youyou incontinent little animal  here shut up a minute whats all this about tulke said carson  ilook here im awfully sorry i never thought beetle would take this line  becauseyouveno decencyyouthoughti hadnt cried beetle all in one breath  tried to cover it all up with a conspiracy did you said stalky  direct insult to all three of us said mcturk a most filthy mind you have tulke  ill shove you fellows outside the door if you go on like this said carson angrily  that proves its a conspiracy said stalky with the air of a virgin martyr  ii was goin along the streeti swear i was cried tulke andand im awfully sorry about ita woman came up and kissed me i swear i didnt kiss her  there was a pause filled by stalkys long liquid whistle of contempt amazement and derision  on my honor gulped the persecuted one oh do stop him jawing  very good mcturk interjected we are compelled of course to accept your statement  confound it roared naughten you arent headprefect here mcturk  oh well returned the irishman you know tulke better than we do i am only speaking for ourselves we accept tulkes word but all i can say is that if id been collared in a similarly disgustin situation and had offered the same explanation tulke has ii wonder what youd have said however it seems on tulkes word of honor  and tulkusbeg pardonkiss of coursetulkiss is an honorable man put in stalky  that the sixth cant protect emselves from bein kissed when they go for a walk cried beetle taking up the running with a rush sweet business isnt it cheerful thing to tell the fags aint it we arent prefects of course but we arent kissed very much dont think that sort of thing ever enters our heads does it stalky  oh no said stalky turning aside to hide his emotions mcturks face merely expressed lofty contempt and a little weariness  well you seem to know a lot about it interposed a prefect  cant help itwhen you chaps shove it under our noses beetle dropped into a drawling parody of kings most biting colloquial stylethe gentle rain after the thunderstorm well its all very sufficiently vile and disgraceful isnt it i dont know who comes out of it worst tulke who happens to have been caught or the other fellows who havent and we here he wheeled fiercely on the other twoweve got to stand up and be jawed by them because weve disturbed their intrigues  hang it i only wanted to give you a word of warning said carson thereby handing himself bound to the enemy  warn you this with the air of one who finds loathsome gifts in his locker carson would you be good enough to tell us what conceivable thing there is that you are entitled to warn us about after this exposure warn oh its a little too much lets go somewhere where its clean  the door banged behind their outraged innocence  oh beetle beetle beetle golden beetle sobbed stalky hurling himself on beetles panting bosom as soon as they reached the study however did you do it  dearr man said mcturk embracing beetles head with both arms while he swayed it to and fro on the neck in time to this ancient burden     pretty lipssweeter thancherry or plum    always lookjolly andnever look glum    seem to saycome away kissycome come    yummyyum yummyyum yummyyumyum  look out youll smash my giglamps puffed beetle emerging wasnt it glorious didnt i eric em splendidly did you spot my cribs from king oh blow his countenance clouded theres one adjective i didnt useobscene dont know how i forgot that its one of kings pet ones too  never mind theyll be sendin ambassadors round in half a shake to beg us not to tell the school its a deuced serious business for them said mcturk poor sixthpoor old sixth  immoral young rips stalky snorted what an example to puresouled boys like you and me  and the sixth in carsons study sat aghast glowering at tulke who was on the edge of tears well said the headprefect acidly youve made a pretty average ghastly mess of it tulke  whywhy didnt you lick that young devil beetle before he began jawing tulke wailed  i knew thered be a row said a prefect of prouts house but you would insist on the meeting tulke  yes and a fat lot of good its done us said naughten they come in here and jaw our heads off when we ought to be jawin them beetle talks to us as if we were a lot of blackguards andand all that and when theyve hung us up to dry they go out and slam the door like a housemaster all your fault tulke  but i didnt kiss her  you ass if youd said you had and stuck to it it would have been ten times better than what you did naughten retorted now theyll tell the whole schooland beetlell make up a lot of beastly rhymes and nicknames  but hang it she kissed me outside of his work tulkes mind moved slowly  im not thinking of you im thinking of us ill go up to their study and see if i can make em keep quiet  tulkes awfly cut up about this business naughten began ingratiatingly when he found beetle  whos kissed him this time  and ive come to ask you chaps and especially you beetle not to let the thing be known all over the school of course fellows as senior as you are can easily see why  um said beetle with the cold reluctance of one who foresees an unpleasant public duty i suppose i must go and talk to the sixth again  not the least need my dear chap i assure you said naughten hastily ill take any message you care to send  but the chance of supplying the missing adjective was too tempting so naughten returned to that still undissolved meeting beetle white icy and aloof at his heels  there seems he began with laboriously crisp articulation there seems to be a certain amount of uneasiness among you as to the steps we may think fit to take in regard to this last revelation of theahobscene if it is any consolation to you to know that we have decidedfor the honor of the school you understandto keep our mouths shut as to theseahobscenities youahhave it  he wheeled his head among the stars and strode statelily back to his study where stalky and mcturk lay side by side upon the table wiping their tearful eyestoo weak to move   the latin prose paper was a success beyond their wildest dreams stalky and mcturk were of course out of all examinations they did extratuition with the head but beetle attended with zeal  this i presume is a parergon on your part said king as he dealt out the papers one final exhibition ere you are translated to loftier spheres a last attack on the classics it seems to confound you already  beetle studied the print with knit brows i cant make head or tail of it he murmured what does it mean  no no said king with scholastic coquetry we depend upon you to give us the meaning this is an examination beetle mine not a guessingcompetition you will find your associates have no difficulty in  tulke left his place and laid the paper on the desk king looked read and turned a ghastly green  stalkys missing a heap thought beetle wonder hew kingll get out of it  there seems king began with a gulp a certain modicum of truth in our beetles remark i amerinclined to believe that the worthy randall must have dropped this in feruleif you know what that means beetle you purport to be an editor perhaps you can enlighten the form as to formes  what sir whose form i dont see that theres any verb in this sentence at all ananthe ode is all different somehow  i was about to say before you volunteered your criticism that an accident must have befallen the paper in type and that the printer reset it by the light of nature no he held the thing at arms lengthour randall is not an authority on cicero or horace  rather mean to shove it off on randall whispered beetle to his neighbor king must ha been as screwed as an owl when he wrote it out  but we can amend the error by dictating it  no sir the answer came pat from a dozen throats at once that cuts the time for the exam only two hours allowed sir tisnt fair its a printedpaper exam howre we goin to be marked for it its all randalls fault it isnt our fault anyhow an exams an exam etc etc  naturally mr king considered this was an attempt to undermine his authority and instead of beginning dictation at once delivered a lecture on the spirit in which examinations should be approached as the storm subsided beetle fanned it afresh  eh what what was that you were saying to maclagan  i only said i thought the papers ought to have been looked at before they were given out sir  hear hear from a back bench mr king wished to know whether beetle took it upon himself personally to conduct the traditions of the school his zeal for knowledge ate up another fifteen minutes during which the prefects showed unmistakable signs of boredom  oh it was a giddy time said beetle afterwards in dismantled number five he gibbered a bit and i kept him on the gibber and then he dictated about a half of dolabella  co  good old dolabella friend of mine yes said stalky pensively  then we had to ask him how every other word was spelt of course and he gibbered a lot more he cursed me and maclagan mac played up like a trump and randall and the materialized ignorance of the unscholarly middle classes lust for mere marks and all the rest it was what you might call a final exhibitiona last attacka giddy parergon  but o course he was blind squiffy when he wrote the paper i hope you explained that said stalky  oh yes i told tulke so i said an immoral prefect an a drunken housemaster were legitimate inferences tulke nearly blubbed hes awfully shy of us since marys time  tulke preserved that modesty till the last momenttill the journeymoney had been paid and the boys were filling the brakes that took them to the station then the three tenderly constrained him to wait a while  you see tulke you may be a prefect said stalky but ive left the coll do you see tulke dear  yes i see dont bear malice stalky  stalky curse your impudence you young cub shouted stalky magnificent in tophat stiff collar spats and highwaisted snuffcolored ulster i want you to understand that im mister corkran an youre a dirty little schoolboy  besides bein frabjously immoral said mcturk wonder you arent ashamed to foist your company on pureminded boys like us  come on tulke cried naughten from the prefects brake  yes were comin shove up and make room you collegers youve all got to be back next term with your yes sir and oh sir an no sir an please sir but before we say goodby were going to tell you a little story go on dickie this to the driver were quite ready kick that hatbox under the seat an dont crowd your uncle stalky  as nice a lot of highminded youngsters as youd wish to see said mcturk gazing round with bland patronage a trifle immoral but thenboys will be boys its no good tryin to look stuffy carson mister corkran will now oblige with the story of tulke an mary yeo     slaves of the lamp  part ii   that very infant who told the story of the capture of boh na ghee a conference of the powers many inventions to eustace cleaver novelist inherited an estateful baronetcy with vast revenues resigned the service and became a landholder while his mother stood guard over him to see that he married the right girl but new to his position he presented the local volunteers with a fullsized magazinerifle range two miles long across the heart of his estate and the surrounding families who lived in savage seclusion among woods full of pheasants regarded him as an erring maniac the noise of the firing disturbed their poultry and infant was cast out from the society of jps and decent men till such time as a daughter of the county might lure him back to right thinking he took his revenge by filling the house with choice selections of old schoolmates home on leaveaffable detrimentals at whom the bicycleriding maidens of the surrounding families were allowed to look from afar i knew when a troopship was in port by the infants invitations sometimes he would produce old friends of equal seniority at others young and blushing giants whom i had left small fags far down in the lower second and to these infant and the elders expounded the whole duty of man in the army  ive had to cut the service said the infant but thats no reason why my vast stores of experience should be lost to posterity he was just thirty and in that same summer an imperious wire drew me to his baronial castle got good haul ex tamar come along  it was an unusually good haul arranged with a single eye to my benefit there was a baldish brokendown captain of native infantry shivering with ague behind an indomitable red noseand they called him captain dickson there was another captain also of native infantry with a fair mustache his face was like white glass and his hands were fragile but he answered joyfully to the cry of tertius there was an enormously big and wellkept man who had evidently not campaigned for years cleanshaved softvoiced and catlike but still abanazar for all that he adorned the indian political service and there was a lean irishman his face tanned blueblack with the suns of the telegraph department luckily the baize doors of the bachelors wing fitted tight for we dressed promiscuously in the corridor or in each others rooms talking calling shouting and anon waltzing by pairs to songs of dick fours own devising  there were sixty years of mixed work to be sifted out between us and since we had met one another from time to time in the quick sceneshifting of indiaa dinner camp or a racemeeting here a dakbungalow or railway station up country somewhere elsewe had never quite lost touch infant sat on the banisters hungrily and enviously drinking it in he enjoyed his baronetcy but his heart yearned for the old days  it was a cheerful babel of matters personal provincial and imperial pieces of old callover lists and new policies cut short by the roar of a burmese gong and we went down not less than a quarter of a mile of stairs to meet infants mother who had known us all in our schooldays and greeted us as if those had ended a week ago but it was fifteen years since with tears of laughter she had lent me a gray princessskirt for amateur theatricals  that was a dinner from the arabian nights served in an eightyfoot hall full of ancestors and pots of flowering roses and what was more impressive heated by steam when it was ended and the little mother had gone awayyou boys want to talk so i shall say goodnight nowwe gathered about an applewood fire in a gigantic polished steel grate under a mantelpiece ten feet high and the infant compassed us about with curious liqueurs and that kind of cigarette which serves best to introduce your own pipe  oh bliss grunted dick four from a sofa where he had been packed with a rug over him first time ive been warm since i came home  we were all nearly on top of the fire except infant who had been long enough at home to take exercise when he felt chilled this is a grisly diversion but much affected by the english of the island  if you say a word about cold tubs and brisk walks drawled mcturk ill kill you infant ive got a liver too member when we used to think it a treat to turn out of our beds on a sunday morningthermometer fiftyseven degrees if it was summerand bathe off the pebbleridge ugh  thing i dont understand said tertius was the way we chaps used to go down into the lavatories boil ourselves pink and then come up with all our pores open into a young snowstorm or a black frost yet none of our chaps died that i can remember  talkin of baths said mcturk with a chuckle member our bath in number five beetle the night rabbitseggs rocked king what wouldnt i give to see old stalky now he is the only one of the two studies not here  stalky is the great man of his century said dick four  how dyou know i asked  how do i know said dick four scornfully if youve ever been in a tight place with stalky you wouldnt ask  i havent seen him since the camp at pindi in 87 i said he was goin strong thenabout seven feet high and four feet through  adequate chap infernally adequate said tertius pulling his mustache and staring into the fire  got dam near courtmartialed and broke in egypt in 84 the infant volunteered i went out in the same trooper with himas raw as he was only i showed it and stalky didnt  what was the trouble said mcturk reaching forward absently to twitch my dresstie into position  oh nothing his colonel trusted him to take twenty tommies out to wash or groom camels or something at the back of suakin and stalky got embroiled with fuzzies five miles in the interior he conducted a masterly retreat and wiped up eight of em he knew jolly well hed no right to go out so far so he took the initiative and pitched in a letter to his colonel who was frothing at the mouth complaining of the paucity of support accorded to him in his operations gad it might have been one fat brigadier slangin another then he went into the staff corps  thatisentirelystalky said abanazar from his armchair  youve come across him too i said  oh yes he replied in his softest tones i was at the tail of thatthat epic dont you chaps know  we did notinfant mcturk and i and we called for information very politely  twasnt anything said tertius we got into a mess up in the khyekheen hills a couple o years ago and stalky pulled us through thats all  mcturk gazed at tertius with all an irishmans contempt for the tonguetied saxon  heavens he said and its you and your likes govern ireland tertius arent you ashamed  well i cant tell a yarn i can chip in when the other fellow starts bukhing ask him he pointed to dick four whose nose gleamed scornfully over the rug  i knew you wouldnt said dick four give me a whiskey and soda ive been drinking lemonsquash and ammoniated quinine while you chaps were bathin in champagne and my heads singin like a top  he wiped his ragged mustache above the drink and his teeth chattering in his head began you know the khyekheenmalot expedition when we scared the souls out of em with a field force they darent fight against well both tribesthere was a coalition against uscame in without firing a shot and a lot of hairy villains who had no more power over their men than i had promised and vowed all sorts of things on that very slender evidence pussy dear  i was at simla said abanazar hastily  never mind youre tarred with the same brush on the strength of those tuppennyhapenny treaties your asses of politicals reported the country as pacified and the government being a fool as usual began roadmakindependin on local supply for labor member that pussy rest of our chaps whod had no lookin during the campaign didnt think thered be any more of it and were anxious to get back to india but id been in two of these little rows before and i had my suspicions i engineered myself summa ingenio into command of a roadpatrolno shovellin only marching up and down genteelly with a guard theyd withdrawn all the troops they could but i nucleused about forty pathans recruits chiefly of my regiment and sat tight at the basecamp while the roadparties went to work as per political survey  had some rippin singsongs in camp too said tertius  my pupthus did dick four refer to his subalternwas a pious little beast he didnt like the singsongs and so he went down with pneumonia i rootled round the camp and found tertius gassing about as a daqmg which god knows he isnt cut out for there were six or eight of the old coll at basecamp were always in force for a frontier row but id heard of tertius as a steady old hack and i told him he had to shake off his daqmg breeches and help me tertius volunteered like a shot and we settled it with the authorities and out we wentforty pathans tertius and me looking up the roadparties macnamarasmember old mac the sapper who played the fiddle so damnably at umballamacs party was the last but one the last was stalkys he was at the head of the road with some of his pet sikhs mac said he believed he was all right  stalky is a sikh said tertius he takes his men to pray at the durbar sahib at amritzar regularly as clockwork when he can  dont interrupt tertius it was about forty miles beyond macs before i found him and my men pointed out gently but firmly that the country was risin what kind o country beetle well im no wordpainter thank goodness but you might call it a hellish country when we werent up to our necks in snow we were rolling down the khud the welldisposed inhabitants who were to supply labor for the roadmaking dont forget that pussy dear sat behind rocks and took potshots at us old old story we all legged it in search of stalky i had a feeling that hed be in good cover and about dusk we found him and his roadparty as snug as a bug in a rug in an old malot stone fort with a watchtower at one corner it overhung the road they had blasted out of the cliff fifty feet below and under the road things went down pretty sheer for five or six hundred feet into a gorge about half a mile wide and two or three miles long there were chaps on the other side of the gorge scientifically gettin our range so i hammered on the gate and nipped in and tripped over stalky in a greasy bloody old poshteen squatting on the ground eating with his men id only seen him for half a minute about three months before but i might have met him yesterday he waved his hand all sereno  hullo aladdin hullo emperor he said youre just in time for the performance  i saw his sikhs looked a bit battered wheres your command wheres your subaltern i said  hereall there is of it said stalky if you want young everett hes dead and his bodys in the watchtower they rushed our roadparty last week and got him and seven men weve been besieged for five days i suppose they let you through to make sure of you the whole countrys up strikes me youve walked into a firstclass trap he grinned but neither tertius nor i could see where the deuce the fun was we hadnt any grub for our men and stalky had only four days whack for his that came of dependin upon your asinine politicals pussy dear who told us that the inhabitants were friendly  to make us quite comfy stalky took us up to the watchtower to see poor everetts body lyin in a foot o drifted snow it looked like a girl of fifteennot a hair on the little fellows face hed been shot through the temple but the malots had left their mark on him stalky unbuttoned the tunic and showed it to usa rummy sickleshaped cut on the chest member the snow all white on his eyebrows tertius member when stalky moved the lamp and it looked as if he was alive  yees said tertius with a shudder member the beastly look on stalkys face though with his nostrils all blown out same as he used to look when he was bullyin a fag that was a lovely evening  we held a council of war up there over everetts body stalky said the malots and khyekheens were up together havin sunk their blood feuds to settle us the chaps wed seen across the gorge were khyekheens it was about half a mile from them to us as a bullet flies and theyd made a line of sungars under the brow of the hill to sleep in and starve us out the malots he said were in front of us promiscuous there wasnt good cover behind the fort or theyd have been there too stalky didnt mind the malots half as much as he did the khyekheens he said the malots were treacherous curs what i couldnt understand was why in the world the two gangs didnt join in and rush us there must have been at least five hundred of em stalky said they didnt trust each other very well because they were ancestral enemies when they were at home and the only time theyd tried a rush hed hove a couple of blastingcharges among em and that had sickened em a bit  it was dark by the time we finished and stalky always serene said you command now i dont suppose you mind my taking any action i may consider necessary to reprovision the fort i said of course not and then the lamp blew out so tertius and i had to climb down the tower steps we didnt want to stay with everett and got back to our men stalky had gone offto count the stores i supposed anyhow tertius and i sat up in case of a rush they were plugging at us pretty generally you know relieving each other till the mornin  mornin came no stalky not a sign of him i took counsel with his senior native officera grand whitewhiskered old chaprutton singh from jullunderway he only grinned and said it was all right stalky had been out of the fort twice before somewhere or other accordin to him he said stalky ud come back unchipped and gave me to understand that stalky was an invulnerable guru of sorts all the same i put the whole command on half rations and set em to pickin out loopholes  about noon there was no end of a snowstorm and the enemy stopped firing we replied gingerly because we were awfully short of ammunition dont suppose we fired five shots an hour but we generally got our man well while i was talking with rutton singh i saw stalky coming down from the watchtower rather puffy about the eyes his poshteen coated with claretcolored ice  no trustin these snowstorms he said nip out quick and snaffle what you can get theres a certain amount of friction between the khyekheens and the malots just now  i turned tertius out with twenty pathans and they bucked about in the snow for a bit till they came on to a sort of camp about eight hundred yards away with only a few men in charge and half a dozen sheep by the fire they finished off the men and snaffled the sheep and as much grain as they could carry and came back no one fired a shot at em there didnt seem to be anybody about but the snow was falling pretty thick  thats good enough said stalky when we got dinner ready and he was chewin muttonkababs off a cleanin rod theres no sense riskin men theyre holding a powwow between the khyekheens and the malots at the head of the gorge i dont think these socalled coalitions are much good  do you know what that maniac had done tertius and i shook it out of him by instalments there was an underground granary cellarroom below the watchtower and in blasting the road stalky had blown a hole into one side of it being no one else but stalky hed kept the hole open for his own ends and laid poor everetts body slap over the well of the stairs that led down to it from the watchtower hed had to move and replace the corpse every time he used the passage the sikhs wouldnt go near the place of course well hed got out of this hole and dropped on to the road then in the night and a howling snowstorm hed dropped over the edge of the khud made his way down to the bottom of the gorge forded the nullah which was half frozen climbed up on the other side along a track hed discovered and come out on the right flank of the khyekheens he had thenlisten to thiscrossed over a ridge that paralleled their rear walked half a mile behind that and come out on the left of their line where the gorge gets shallow and where there was a regular track between the malot and the khyekheen camps that was about two in the morning and as it turned out a man spotted hima khyekheen so stalky abolished him quietly and left himwith the malot mark on his chest same as everett had  i was just as economical as i could be stalky said to us if hed shouted i should have been slain id never had to do that kind of thing but once before and that was the first time i tried that path its perfectly practicable for infantry you know  what about your first man i said  oh that was the night after they killed everett and i went out lookin for a line of retreat for my men a man found me i abolished himprivatimscragged him but on thinkin it over it occurred to me that if i could find the body id hove it down some rocks i might decorate it with the malot mark and leave it to the khyekheens to draw inferences so i went out again the next night and did the khyekheens are shocked at the malots perpetratin these two dastardly outrages after theyd sworn to sink all bleed feuds i lay up behind their sungars early this morning and watched em they all went to confer about it at the head of the gorge awfly annoyed they are dont wonder you know the way stalky drops out his words one by one  my god said the infant explosively as the full depth of the strategy dawned on him  dearr man said mcturk purring rapturously  stalky stalked said tertius thats all there is to it  no he didnt said dick four dont you remember how he insisted that he had only applied his luck dont you remember how rutton singh grabbed his boots and grovelled in the snow and how our men shouted  none of our pathans believed that was luck said tertius they swore stalky ought to have been born a pathan andmember we nearly had a row in the fort when rutton singh said stalky was a pathan gad how furious the old chap was with my jemadar but stalky just waggled his finger and they shut up  old rutton singhs sword was half out though and he swore hed cremate every khyekheen and malot he killed that made the jemadar pretty wild because he didnt mind fighting against his own creed but he wasnt going to crab a fellow mussulmans chances of paradise then stalky jabbered pushtu and punjabi in alternate streaks where the deuce did he pick up his pushtu from beetle  never mind his language dick said i give us the gist of it  i flatter myself i can address the wily pathan on occasion but hang it all i cant make puns in pushtu or top off my arguments with a smutty story as he did he played on those two old dogs o war like alike a concertina stalky saidand the other two backed up his knowledge of oriental naturethat the khyekheens and the malots between em would organize a combined attack on us that night as a proof of good faith they wouldnt drive it home though because neither side would trust the other on account as rutton singh put it of the little accidents stalkys notion was to crawl out at dusk with his sikhs manoeuvre em along this ungodly goattrack that hed found to the back of the khyekheen position and then lob in a few long shots at the malots when the attack was well on thatll divert their minds and help to agitate em he said then you chaps can come out and sweep up the pieces and well rendezvous at the head of the gorge after that i move we get back to macs camp and have something to eat  you were commandin the infant suggested  i was about three months senior to stalky and two months tertiuss senior dick four replied but we were all from the same old coll i should say ours was the only little affair on record where some one wasnt jealous of some one else  we werent tertius broke in but there was another row between gul sher khan and rutton singh our jemadar saidhe was quite rightthat no sikh living could stalk worth a damn and that koran sahib had better take out the pathans who understood that kind of mountain work rutton singh said that koran sahib jolly well knew every pathan was a born deserter and every sikh was a gentleman even if he couldnt crawl on his belly stalky struck in with some womans proverb or other that had the effect of doublin both men up with a grin he said the sikhs and the pathans could settle their claims on the khyekheens and malots later on but he was going to take his sikhs along for this mountainclimbing job because sikhs could shoot they can too give em a muleload of ammunition apiece and theyre perfectly happy  and out he gat said dick four as soon as it was dark and hed had a bit of a snooze him and thirty sikhs went down through the staircase in the tower every mothers son of em salutin little everett where it stood propped up against the wall the last i heard him say was kubbadar tumbleinga look out youll fall and they tumbleingaed over the black edge of nothing close upon 9 pm the combined attack developed khyekheens across the valley and malots in front of us pluggin at long range and yellin to each other to come along and cut our infidel throats then they skirmished up to the gate and began the old game of calling our pathans renegades and invitin em to join the holy war one of our men a young fellow from dera ismail jumped on the wall to slang em back and jumped down blubbing like a child hed been hit smack in the middle of the hand never saw a man yet who could stand a hit in the hand without weepin bitterly it tickles up all the nerves so tertius took his rifle and smote the others on the head to keep them quiet at the loopholes the dear children wanted to open the gate and go in at em generally but that didnt suit our book  at last near midnight i heard the wop wop wop of stalkys martinis across the valley and some general cursing among the malots whose main body was hid from us by a fold in the hillside stalky was brownin em at a great rate and very naturally they turned half right and began to blaze at their faithless allies the khyekheensregular volley firin in less than ten minutes after stalky opened the diversion they were going it hammer and tongs both sides the valley when we could see the valley was rather a mixedup affair the khyekheens had streamed out of their sungars above the gorge to chastise the malots and stalkyi was watching him through my glasseshad slipped in behind em very good the khyekheens had to leg it along the hillside up to where the gorge got shallow and they could cross over to the malots who were awfully cheered to see the khyekheens taken in the rear  then it occurred to me to comfort the khyekheens so i turned out the whole command and we advanced a la pas de charge doublin up what for the sake of argument well call the malots left flank even then if theyd sunk their differences they could have eaten us alive but theyd been firin at each other half the night and they went on firin queerest thing you ever saw in your born days as soon as our men doubled up to the malots theyd blaze at the khyekheens more zealously than ever to show they were on our side run up the valley a few hundred yards and halt to fire again the moment stalky saw our game he duplicated it his side the gorge and by jove the khyekheens did just the same thing  yes but said tertius youve forgot him playin arrah patsy mind the baby on the bugle to hurry us up  did he roared mcturk somehow we all began to sing it and there was an interruption  rather said tertius when we were quiet no one of the aladdin company could forget that tune yes he played patsy go on dick  finally said dick four we drove both mobs into each others arms on a bit of level ground at the head of the valley and saw the whole crew whirl off fightin and stabbin and swearin in a blindin snowstorm they were a heavy hairy lot and we didnt follow em  stalky had captured one prisoneran old pensioned sepoy of twentyfive years service who produced his dischargean awfly sportin old card he had been tryin to make his men rush us early in the day he was sulkyangry with his own side for their cowardice and rutton singh wanted to bayonet himsikhs dont understand fightin against the government after youve served it honestlybut stalky rescued him and froze on to him tightwith ulterior motives i believe when we got back to the fort we buried young everettstalky wouldnt hear of blowin up the placeand bunked wed only lost ten men all told  only ten out of seventy how did you lose em i asked  oh there was a rush on the fort early in the night and a few malots got over the gate it was rather a tight thing for a minute or two but the recruits took it beautifully lucky job we hadnt any badly wounded men to carry because we had forty miles to macnamaras camp by jove how we legged it half way in old rutton singh collapsed so we slung him across four rifles and stalkys overcoat and stalky his prisoner and a couple of sikhs were his bearers after that i went to sleep you can you know on the march when your legs get properly numbed mac swears we all marched into his camp snoring and dropped where we halted his men lugged us into the tents like grambags i remember wakin up and seeing stalky asleep with his head on old rutton singhs chest he slept twentyfour hours i only slept seventeen but then i was coming down with dysentery  coming down what rot he had it on him before we joined stalky in the fort said tertius  well you neednt talk you hove your sword at macnamara and demanded a drumhead courtmartial every time you saw him the only thing that soothed you was putting you under arrest every half hour you were off your head for three days  dont remember a word of it said tertius placidly i remember my orderly giving me milk though  how did stalky come out mcturk demanded purling hard over his pipe  stalky like a serene brahmini bull poor old mac was at his royal engineers wits end to know what to do you see i was putrid with dysentery tertius was ravin half the men had frostbite and macnamaras orders were to break camp and come in before winter so stalky who hadnt turned a hair took half his supplies to save him the bother o luggin em back to the plains and all the ammunition he could get at and consilio et auxilio rutton singhi tramped back to his fort with all his sikhs and his precious prisoners and a lot of dissolute hangerson that he and the prisoner had seduced into service he had sixty men of sortsand his brazen cheek mac nearly wept with joy when he went you see there werent any explicit orders to stalky to come in before the passes were blocked mac is a great man for orders and stalkys a great man for orderswhen they suit his book  he told me he was goin to the engadine said tertius sat on my cot smokin a cigarette and makin me laugh till i cried macnamara bundled the whole lot of us down to the plains next day we were a walkin hospital  stalky told me that macnamara was a simple godsend to him said dick four i used to see him in macs tent listenin to mac playin the fiddle and between the pieces wheedlin mac out of picks and shovels and dynamite cartridges handoverfist well that was the last we saw of stalky a week or so later the passes were shut with snow and i dont think stalky wanted to be found particularly just then  he didnt said the fair and fat abanazar he didnt ho ho  dick four threw up his thin dry hand with the blue veins at the back of it hold on a minute pussy ill let you in at the proper time i went down to my regiment and that spring five mouths later i got off with a couple of companies on detachment nominally to look after some friends of ours across the border actually of course to recruit it was a bit unfortunate because an ass of a young naick carried a frivolous bloodfeud hed inherited from his aunt into those hills and the local gentry wouldnt volunteer into my corps of course the naick had taken short leave to manage the business that was all regular enough but hed stalked my pet orderlys uncle it was an infernal shame because i knew harris of the ghuznees would be covering that ground three months later and hed snaffle all the chaps i had my eyes on everybody was down on the naick because they felt he ought to have had the decency to postpone hishis disgustful amours till our companies were full strength  still the beast had a certain amount of professional feeling left he sent one of his aunts clan by night to tell me that if id take safeguard hed put me on to a batch of beauties i nipped over the border like a shot and about ten miles the other side in a nullah my rappareeincharge showed me about seventy men variously armed but standing up like a queens company then one of em stepped out and lugged round an old bugle just likewhos the manbancroft aint itfeeling for his eyeglass in a farce and played arrah patsy mind the baby arrah patsy mindthat was as for as he could get  that also was as far as dick four could get because we had to sing the old song through twice again and once more and subsequently in order to repeat it  he explained that if i knew the rest of the song he had a note for me from the man the song belonged to whereupon my children i finished that old tune on that bugle and this is what i got i knew youd like to look at it dont grab we were all struggling for a sight of the wellknown unformed handwriting ill read it aloud       fort everett february 19  dear dick or tertius the bearer of this is in charge of seventyfive recruits all pukka devils but desirous of leading new lives they have been slightly polished and after being boiled may shape well i want you to give thirty of them to my adjutant who though gods own ass will need men this spring the rest you can keep you will be interested to learn that i have extended my road to the end of the malot country all headmen and priests concerned in last septembers affair worked one month each supplying road metal from their own houses everetts grave is covered by a fortyfoot mound which should serve well as a base for future triangulations rutton singh sends his best salaams i am making some treaties and have given my prisonerwho also sends his salaamslocal rank of khan bahadur        a l cockran  well that was all said dick four when the roaring the shouting the laughter and i think the tears had subsided i chaperoned the gang across the border as quick as i could they were rather homesick but they cheered up when they recognized some of my chaps who had been in the khyekheen row and they made a rippin good lot its rather more than three hundred miles from fort everett to where i picked em up now pussy tell em the latter end o stalky as you saw it  abanazar laughed a little nervous misleading official laugh  oh it wasnt much i was at simla in the spring when our stalky out of his snows began corresponding direct with the government  after the manner of a king suggested dick four my turn now dick hed done a whole let of things he shouldnt have done and constructively pledged the government to all sorts of action  pledged the states ticker eh said mcturk with a nod to me  about that but the embarrassin part was that it was all so thunderin convenient so well reasoned dont you know came in as pat as if hed had access to all sorts of informationwhich he couldnt of course  pooh said tertius i back stalky against the foreign office any day  hed done pretty nearly everything he could think of except strikin coins in his own image and superscription all under cover of buildin this infernal road and bein blocked by the snow his report was simply amazin von lennaert tore his hair over it at first and then he gasped who the dooce is this unknown warren hastings he must be slain he must be slain officially the viceroyll never stand it its unheard of he must be slain by his excellency in person order him up here and pitch in a stinger well i sent him no end of an official stinger and i pitched in an unofficial telegram at the same time  you this with amazement from the infant for abanazar resembled nothing so much as a fluffy persian cat  yesme said abanazar twasnt much but after what youve said dicky it was rather a coincidence because i wired     aladdin now has got his wife    your emperor is appeased    i think youd better come to life    we hope youve all been pleased  funny how that old song came up in my head that was fairly noncommittal and encouragin the only flaw was that his emperor wasnt appeased by very long chalks stalky extricated himself from his mountain fastnesses and leafed up to simla at his leisure to be offered up on the horns of the altar  but i began surely the commanderinchief is the proper  his excellency had an idea that if he blew up one single junior captainsame as king used to blow us uphe was holdin the reins of empire and of course as long as he had that idea von lennaert encouraged him im not sure von lennaert didnt put that notion into his head  theyve changed the breed then since my time i said  praps stalky was sent up for his wiggin like a bad little boy ive reason to believe that his excellencys hair stood on end he walked into stalky for one hourstalky at attention in the middle of the floor and so he vowed von lennaert pretending to soothe down his excellencys topknot in dumb show in the background stalky didnt dare to look up or hed have laughed  now wherefore was stalky not broken publicly said the infant with a large and luminous leer  ah wherefore said abanazar to give him a chance to retrieve his blasted career and not to break his fathers heart stalky hadnt a father but that didnt matter he behaved like alike the sanawar orphan asylum and his excellency graciously spared him then he came round to my office and sat opposite me for ten minutes puffing out his nostrils then he said pussy if i thought that baskethanger  hah he remembered that said mcturk  that twoanna baskethanger governed india i swear id become a naturalized muscovite tomorrow im a femme incomprise this things broken my heart itll take six months shootinleave in india to mend it do you think i can get it pussy  he got it in about three minutes and a half and seventeen days later he was back in the arms of rutton singhhorrid disgracedwith orders to hand over his command etc to cathcart macmonnie  observe said dick four one colonel of the political department in charge of thirty sikhs on a hilltop observe my children  naturally cathcart not being a fool even if he is a political let stalky do his shooting within fifteen miles of fort everett for the next six months and i always understood they and rutton singh and the prisoner were as thick as thieves then stalky loafed back to his regiment i believe ive never seen him since  i have though said mcturk swelling with pride  we all turned as one man it was at the beginning of this hot weather i was in camp in the jullunder doab and stumbled slap on stalky in a sikh village sitting on the one chair of state with half the population grovellin before him a dozen sikh babies on his knees an old harridan clappin him on the shoulder and a garland o flowers round his neck told me he was recruitin we dined together that night but he never said a word of the business at the fort told me though that if i wanted any supplies id better say i was koran sahibs bhai and i did and the sikhs wouldnt take my money  ah that must have been one of rutton singhs villages said dick four and we smoked for some time in silence  i say said mcturk casting back through the years did stalky ever tell you how rabbitseggs came to rock king that night  no said dick four then mcturk told i see said dick four nodding practically he duplicated that trick over again theres nobody like stalky  thats just where you make the mistake i said indias full of stalkiescheltenham and haileybury and marlborough chapsthat we dont know anything about and the surprises will begin when there is really a big row on  who will be surprised said dick four  the other side the gentlemen who go to the front in firstclass carriages just imagine stalky let loose on the south side of europe with a sufficiency of sikhs and a reasonable prospect of loot consider it quietly  theres something in that but youre too much of an optimist beetle said the infant  well ive a right to be aint i responsible for the whole thing you neednt laugh who wrote aladdin now has got his wifeeh  whats that got to do with it said tertius  everything said i  prove it said the infant  and i have
