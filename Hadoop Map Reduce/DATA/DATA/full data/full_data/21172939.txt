21172939	the tale of timmy tiptoes  illustration  by beatrix potter  author of the tale of peter rabbit etc   illustration  frederick warne  co inc new york     1911 by frederick warne  co   printed in the usa by princeton polychrome press   binding by a horowitz  son     for  many unknown little friends  including monica   illustration   once upon a time there was a little fat comfortable grey squirrel called timmy tiptoes he had a nest thatched with leaves in the top of a tall tree and he had a little squirrel wife called goody  illustration  timmy tiptoes sat out enjoying the breeze he whisked his tail and chuckledlittle wife goody the nuts are ripe we must lay up a store for winter and spring goody tiptoes was busy pushing moss under the thatchthe nest is so snug we shall be sound asleep all winter then we shall wake up all the thinner when there is nothing to eat in springtime replied prudent timothy  illustration  when timmy and goody tiptoes came to the nut thicket they found other squirrels were there already  timmy took off his jacket and hung it on a twig they worked away quietly by themselves  illustration  every day they made several journeys and picked quantities of nuts they carried them away in bags and stored them in several hollow stumps near the tree where they had built their nest  illustration  when these stumps were full they began to empty the bags into a hole high up a tree that had belonged to a woodpecker the nuts rattled downdowndown inside  how shall you ever get them out again it is like a moneybox said goody  i shall be much thinner before springtime my love said timmy tiptoes peeping into the hole  illustration  they did collect quantitiesbecause they did not lose them squirrels who bury their nuts in the ground lose more than half because they cannot remember the place  the most forgetful squirrel in the wood was called silvertail he began to dig and he could not remember and then he dug again and found some nuts that did not belong to him and there was a fight and other squirrels began to digthe whole wood was in commotion  illustration  unfortunately just at this time a flock of little birds flew by from bush to bush searching for green caterpillars and spiders there were several sorts of little birds twittering different songs  the first one sangwhos bin diggingup my nuts whosbeendiggingup my nuts  and another sanglittle bita bread andnocheese little bitabread annocheese  illustration  the squirrels followed and listened the first little bird flew into the bush where timmy and goody tiptoes were quietly tying up their bags and it sangwhosbin diggingup my nuts whos been diggingup mynuts  timmy tiptoes went on with his work without replying indeed the little bird did not expect an answer it was only singing its natural song and it meant nothing at all  illustration  but when the other squirrels heard that song they rushed upon timmy tiptoes and cuffed and scratched him and upset his bag of nuts the innocent little bird which had caused all the mischief flew away in a fright  timmy rolled over and over and then turned tail and fled towards his nest followed by a crowd of squirrels shoutingwhosbeen diggingup mynuts  illustration  they caught him and dragged him up the very same tree where there was the little round hole and they pushed him in the hole was much too small for timmy tiptoes figure they squeezed him dreadfully it was a wonder they did not break his ribs we will leave him here till he confesses said silvertail squirrel and he shouted into the hole  whosbeendiggingup mynuts  illustration  timmy tiptoes made no reply he had tumbled down inside the tree upon half a peck of nuts belonging to himself he lay quite stunned and still  illustration  goody tiptoes picked up the nut bags and went home she made a cup of tea for timmy but he didnt come and didnt come  goody tiptoes passed a lonely and unhappy night next morning she ventured back to the nutbushes to look for him but the other unkind squirrels drove her away  she wandered all over the wood calling  timmy tiptoes timmy tiptoes oh where is timmy tiptoes  illustration  in the meantime timmy tiptoes came to his senses he found himself tucked up in a little moss bed very much in the dark feeling sore it seemed to be under ground timmy coughed and groaned because his ribs hurted him there was a chirpy noise and a small striped chipmunk appeared with a night light and hoped he felt better  it was most kind to timmy tiptoes it lent him its nightcap and the house was full of provisions  illustration  the chipmunk explained that it had rained nuts through the top of the treebesides i found a few buried it laughed and chuckled when it heard timmys story while timmy was confined to bed it ticed him to eat quantitiesbut how shall i ever get out through that hole unless i thin myself my wife will be anxious just another nutor two nuts let me crack them for you said the chipmunk timmy tiptoes grew fatter and fatter  illustration  now goody tiptoes had set to work again by herself she did not put any more nuts into the woodpeckers hole because she had always doubted how they could be got out again she hid them under a tree root they rattled down down down once when goody emptied an extra big bagful there was a decided squeak and next time goody brought another bagful a little striped chipmunk scrambled out in a hurry   illustration  it is getting perfectly fullup downstairs the sittingroom is full and they are rolling along the passage and my husband chippy hackee has run away and left me what is the explanation of these showers of nuts  i am sure i beg your pardon i did not know that anybody lived here said mrs goody tiptoes but where is chippy hackee my husband timmy tiptoes has run away too i know where chippy is a little bird told me said mrs chippy hackee  illustration  she led the way to the woodpeckers tree and they listened at the hole  down below there was a noise of nut crackers and a fat squirrel voice and a thin squirrel voice were singing together      my little old man and i fell out      how shall we bring this matter about      bring it about as well as you can      and get you gone you little old man  illustration  you could squeeze in through that little round hole said goody tiptoes yes i could said the chipmunk but my husband chippy hackee bites  down below there was a noise of cracking nuts and nibbling and then the fat squirrel voice and the thin squirrel voice sang      for the diddlum day      day diddle dum di      day diddle diddle dum day  illustration  then goody peeped in at the hole and called downtimmy tiptoes oh fie timmy tiptoes and timmy replied is that you goody tiptoes why certainly  he came up and kissed goody through the hole but he was so fat that he could not get out  chippy hackee was not too fat but he did not want to come he stayed down below and chuckled  illustration  and so it went on for a fortnight till a big wind blew off the top of the tree and opened up the hole and let in the rain  then timmy tiptoes came out and went home with an umbrella  illustration  but chippy hackee continued to camp out for another week although it was uncomfortable  illustration  at last a large bear came walking through the wood perhaps he also was looking for nuts he seemed to be sniffing around  illustration  chippy hackee went home in a hurry  illustration  and when chippy hackee got home he found he had caught a cold in his head and he was more uncomfortable still  illustration  and now timmy and goody tiptoes keep their nutstore fastened up with a little padlock  illustration  and whenever that little bird sees the chipmunks he singswhosbeendiggingup mynuts whos been diggingup mynuts but nobody ever answers   the end
