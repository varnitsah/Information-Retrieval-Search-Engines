threshold         24     seven poems and a fragment by william butler yeats     all souls night     tis all souls night and the great christ church bell   and many a lesser bell sound through the room   for it is now midnight   and two long glasses brimmed with muscatel   bubble upon the table a ghost may come   for it is a ghosts right   his element is so fine   being sharpened by his death   to drink from the winebreath   while our gross palates drink from the whole wine    i need some mind that if the cannon sound   from every quarter of the world can stay   wound in minds pondering   as mummies in the mummycloth are wound   because i have a marvellous thing to say   a certain marvellous thing   none but the living mock   though not for sober ear   it may be all that hear   should laugh and weep an hour upon the clock    hs the first i call he loved strange thought   and knew that sweet extremity of pride   thats called platonic love   and that to such a pitch of passion wrought   nothing could bring him when his lady died   anodyne for his love   words were but wasted breath   one dear hope had he   the inclemency   of that or the next winter would be death    two thoughts were so mixed up i could not tell   whether of her or god he thought the most   but think that his minds eye   when upward turned on one sole image fell   and that a slight companionable ghost   wild with divinity   had so lit up the whole   immense miraculous house   the bible promised us   it seemed a goldfish swimming in a bowl    on florence emery i call the next   who finding the first wrinkles on a face   admired and beautiful   and knowing that the future would be vexed   with minished beauty multiplied commonplace   preferred to teach a school   away from neighbour or friend   among dark skins and there   permit foul years to wear   hidden from eyesight to the unnoticed end    before that end much had she ravelled out   from a discourse in figurative speech   by some learned indian   on the souls journey how it is whirled about   wherever the orbit of the moon can reach   until it plunged into the sun   and there free and yet fast   being both chance and choice   forget its broken toys   and sink into its own delight at last    and i call up macgregor from the grave   for in my first hard springtime we were friends   although of late estranged   i thought him half a lunatic half knave   and told him so but friendship never ends   and what if mind seem changed   and it seem changed with the mind   when thoughts rise up unbid   on generous things that he did   and i grow half contented to be blind    he had much industry at setting out   much boisterous courage before loneliness   had driven him crazed   for meditations upon unknown thought   make human intercourse grow less and less   they are neither paid nor praised   but hed object to the host   the glass because my glass   a ghostlover he was   and may have grown more arrogant being a ghost    but names are nothing what matter who it be   so that his elements have grown so fine   the fume of muscatel   can give his sharpened palate ecstasy   no living man can drink from the whole wine   i have mummy truths to tell   whereat the living mock   though not for sober ear   for maybe all that hear   should laugh and weep an hour upon the clock    such thoughtsuch thought have i that hold it tight   till meditation master all its parts   nothing can stay my glance   until that glance run in the worlds despite   to where the damned have howled away their hearts   and where the blessed dance   such thought that in it bound   i need no other thing   wound in minds wandering   as mummies in the mummycloth are wound     suggested by a picture of a black centaur     your hooves have stamped at the black margin of the wood   even where the horrible green parrots call and swing   my works are all stamped down into the sultry mud   i knew that horse play knew it for a murderous thing   what wholesome sun has ripened is wholesome food to eat   and that alone yet i being driven half insane   because of some green wing gathered old mummy wheat   in the mad abstract dark and ground it grain by grain   and after baked it slowly in an oven but now   i bring full flavoured wine out of a barrel found   where seven ephesian topers slept and never knew   when alexanders empire past they slept so sound   stretch out your limbs and sleep a long saturnian sleep   i have loved you better than my soul for all my words   and there is none so fit to keep a watch and keep   unwearied eyes upon those horrible green birds     thoughts upon the present state of the world   i    many ingenious lovely things are gone   that seemed sheer miracle to the multitude   above the murderous treachery of the moon   or all that wayward ebb and flow there stood   amid the ornamental bronze and stone   an ancient image made of olive wood   and gone are phidias carven ivories   and all his golden grasshoppers and bees    we too had many pretty toys when young   a law indifferent to blame or praise   to bribe or threat habits that made old wrong   melt down as it were wax in the suns rays   public opinion ripening for so long   we thought it would outlive all future days   o what fine thought we had because we thought   that the worst rogues and rascals had died out    all teeth were drawn all ancient tricks unlearned   and a great army but a showy thing   what matter that no cannon had been turned   into a ploughshare parliament and king   thought that unless a little powder burned   the trumpeters might burst with trumpeting   and yet it lack all glory and perchance   the guardsmens drowsy chargers would not prance    now days are dragonridden the nightmare   rides upon sleep a drunken soldiery   can leave the mother murdered at her door   to crawl in her own blood and go scotfree   the night can sweat with terror as before   we pieced our thoughts into philosophy   and planned to bring the world under a rule   who are but weasels fighting in a hole    he who can read the signs nor sink unmanned   into the halfdeceit of some intoxicant   from shallow wits who knows no work can stand   whether health wealth or peace of mind were spent   on master work of intellect or hand   no honour leave its mighty monument   has but one comfort left all triumph would   but break upon his ghostly solitude    and other comfort were a bitter wound   to be in love and love what vanishes   greeks were but lovers all that country round   none dared admit if such a thought were his   incendiary or bigot could be found   to burn that stump on the acropolis   or break in bits the famous ivories   or traffic in the grasshoppers or bees   ii    when loie fullers chinese dancers enwound   a shining web a floating ribbon of cloth   it seemed that a dragon of air   had fallen among dancers had whirled them round   or hurried them off on its own furious path   so the platonic year   whirls out new right and wrong   whirls in the old instead   all men are dancers and their tread   goes to the barbarous clangour of gong   iii    some moralist or mythological poet   compares the solitary soul to a swan   i am content with that   contented that a troubled mirror show it   before that brief gleam of its life be gone   an image of its state   the wings half spread for flight   the breast thrust out in pride   whether to play or to ride   those winds that clamour of approaching night    a man in his own secret meditation   is lost amid the labyrinth that he has made   in art or politics   some platonist affirms that in the station   where we should cast off body and trade   the ancient habit sticks   and that if our works could   but vanish with our breath   that were a lucky death   for triumph can but mar our solitude    the swan has leaped into the desolate heaven   that image can bring wildness bring a rage   to end all things to end   what my laborious life imagined even   the half imagined the half written page   o but we dreamed to mend   whatever mischief seemed   to afflict mankind but now   that winds of winter blow   learn that we were crackpated when we dreamed   iv    we who seven years ago   talked of honour and of truth   shriek with pleasure if we show   the weasels twist the weasels tooth   v    come let us mock at the great   that had such burdens on the mind   and toiled so hard and late   to leave some monument behind   nor thought of the levelling wind    come let us mock at the wise   with all those calendars whereon   they fixed old aching eyes   they never saw how seasons run   and now but gape at the sun    come let us mock at the good   that fancied goodness might be gay   grown tired of their solitude   upon some brandnew happy day   wind shriekedand where are they    mock mockers after that   that would not lift a hand maybe   to help good wise or great   to bar that foul storm out for we   traffic in mockery   vi    violence upon the roads violence of horses   some few have handsome riders are garlanded   on delicate sensitive ear or tossing mane   but wearied running round and round in their courses   all break and vanish and evil gathers head   herodias daughters have returned again   a sudden blast of dusty wind and after   thunder of feet tumult of images   their purpose in the labyrinth of the wind    and should some crazy hand dare touch a daughter   all turn with amorous cries or angry cries   according to the wind for all are blind   but now wind drops dust settles thereupon   there lurches past his great eyes without thought   under the shadow of stupid strawpale locks   that insolent fiend robert artisson   to whom the lovelorn lady kyteler brought   bronzed peacock feathers red combs of her cocks     the new faces     if you that have grown old were the first dead   neither caltapa tree nor scented lime   should hear my living feet nor would i tread   where we wrought that shall break the teeth of time   let the new faces play what tricks they will   in the old rooms night can outbalance day   our shadows rove the garden gravel still   the living seem more shadowy than they     a prayer for my son     bid a strong ghost stand at the head   that my michael may sleep sound   nor cry nor turn in the bed   till his morning meal come round   and may departing twilight keep   all dread afar till mornings back   that his mother may not lack   her fill of sleep    bid the ghost have sword in hand   there are malicious things although   few dream that they exist   who have planned his murder for they know   of some most haughty deed or thought   that waits upon his future days   and would through hatred of the bays   bring that to nought    though you can fashion everything   from nothing every day and teach   the morning stars to sing   you have lacked articulate speech   to tell your simplest want and known   wailing upon a womans knee   all of that worst ignominy   of flesh and bone    and when through all the town there ran   the servants of your enemy   a woman and a man   unless the holy writings lie   have borne you through the smooth and rough   and through the fertile and waste   protecting till the danger past   with human love     cuchulain the girl and the fool       the girl    i am jealous of the looks men turn on you   for all men love your worth and i must rage   at my own image in the lookingglass   thats so unlike myself that when you praise it   it is as though you praise another or even   mock me with praise of my mere opposite   and when i wake towards morn i dread myself   for the heart cries that what deception wins   my cruelty must keep and so begone   if you have seen that image and not my worth       cuchulain    all men have praised my strength but not my worth       the girl    if you are no more strength than i am beauty   i will find out some cavern in the hills   and live among the ancient holy men   for they at least have all mens reverence   and have no need of cruelty to keep   what no deception won       cuchulain                       i have heard them say   that men have reverence for their holiness   and not their worth       the girl                  god loves us for our worth   but what care i that long for a mans love       the fool by the roadside    when my days that have   from cradle run to grave   from grave to cradle run instead   when thoughts that a fool   has wound upon a spool   are but loose thread are but loose thread    when cradle and spool are past   and i mere shade at last   coagulate of stuff   transparent like the wind   i think that i may find   a faithful love a faithful love     the wheel     through wintertime we call on spring   and through the spring on summer call   and when abounding hedges sing   declare that winters best of all   and after that theres nothing good   because the springtime has not come   nor know that what disturbs our blood   is but its longing for the tomb     a new end for the kings threshold       youngest pupil    die seanchan and proclaim the right of the poets       seanchan    come nearer me that i may know how face   differs from face and touch you with my hands   o more than kin o more than children could be   for children are but born out of our blood   and share our frailty o my chicks my chicks   that i have nourished underneath my wings   and fed upon my soul he stands up and begins to walk   down steps i need no help   he needs no help that joy has lifted up   like some miraculous beast out of ezekiel   the man that dies has the chief part in the story   and i will mock and mock and mock that image yonder   that evil picture in the skyno no   i have all my strength again i will outface it   o look upon the moon thats standing there   in the blue daylightnotice her complexion   because it is the white of leprosy   and the contagion that afflicts mankind   falls from the moon when i and these are dead   we should be carried to some windy hill   to lie there with uncovered face awhile   that mankind and that leper there may know   dead faces laugh   he falls and then half rises                   king king dead faces laugh   he dies       oldest pupil    king king he is dead some strange triumphant thought   so filled his heart with joy that it has burst   being grown too mighty for our frailty   and we who gaze grow like him and abhor   the moments that come between us and that death   you promised us       king                        take up his body   go where you please and lay it where you please   so that i cannot see his face or any   that cried him towards his death       youngest pupil                                            dead faces laugh   the ancient right is gone the new remains   and that is death   they go towards the king holding out their halters                                        we are impatient men   so gather up the halters in your hands       king    drive them away   he goes into the palace the soldiers block the way before   the pupils       soldier                                       here is no place for you   for he and his pretensions now are finished   begone before the men at arms are bidden   to hurl you from the door       oldest pupil                                            take up his body   and cry that driven from the populous door   he seeks high waters and the mountain birds   to claim a portion of their solitude   they make a litter with cloak and staffs and lay seanchan   on it       youngest pupil    and cry that when they took his ancient right   they took all common sleep therefore he claims   the mountain for his mattress and his pillow       oldest pupil    and there he can sleep on not noticing   although the world be changed from worse to worse   amid the changeless clamour of the curlew   they raise the litter on their shoulders and move a few steps       youngest pupil                                motioning to them to stop   yet make triumphant music sing aloud   for coming times will bless what he has blessed   and curse what he has cursed       oldest pupil                                               no no be still   or pluck a solemn music from the strings   you wrong his greatness speaking so of triumph       youngest pupil    o silver trumpets be you lifted up   and cry to the great race that is to come   longthroated swans upon the waves of time   sing loudly for beyond the wall of the world   that race may hear our music and awake       oldest pupil    motioning the musicians to lower their trumpets   not what it leaves behind it in the light   but what it carries with it to the dark   exalts the soul nor song nor trumpetblast   can call up races from the worsening world   to mend the wrong and mar the solitude   of the great shade we follow to the tomb   fedelm and the pupils go out carrying the litter some play   a mournful music     note on thoughts upon the present state of the world section six   the country people see at times certain apparitions whom they name now fallen angels now ancient inhabitants of the country and describe as riding at whiles with flowers upon the heads of the horses i have assumed in the sixth poem that these horsemen now that the times worsen give way to worse my last symbol robert artisson was an evil spirit much run after in kilkenny at the start of the fourteenth century are not those who travel in the whirling dust also in the platonic yearw b y     note on the new end to the kings threshold   upon the revival of this play at the abbey theatre a few weeks ago it was played with this new end there were a few other changes i had originally intended to end the play tragically and would have done so but for a friend who used to say o do write comedy  have a few happy moments in the theatre my unhappy moments were because a tragic effect is very fragile and a wrong intonation or even a wrong light or costume will spoil it all however the play remained always of the nature of tragedy and so subject to vicissitude   here ends seven poems and a fragment by william butler yeats with a decoration by t sturge moore five hundred copies of this book have been printed and published by elizabeth corbet yeats on paper made in ireland at the cuala press churchtown dundrum in the county of dublin ireland finished in the third week of april in the year nineteen hundred and twentytwo
