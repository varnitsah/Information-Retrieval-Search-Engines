95453485	whitefoot the wood mouse   by thornton w burgess     chapter i whitefoot spends a happy winter  in all his short life whitefoot the wood mouse never had spent such a happy winter whitefoot is one of those wise little people who never allow unpleasant things of the past to spoil their present happiness and who never borrow trouble from the future whitefoot believes in getting the most from the present the things which are past are past and that is all there is to it there is no use in thinking about them as for the things of the future it will be time enough to think about them when they happen  if you and i had as many things to worry about as does whitefoot the wood mouse we probably never would be happy at all but whitefoot is happy whenever he has a chance to be and in this he is wiser than most human beings you see there is not one of all the little people in the green forest who has so many enemies to watch out for as has whitefoot there are ever so many who would like nothing better than to dine on plump little whitefoot there are buster bear and billy mink and shadow the weasel and unc billy possum and hooty the owl and all the members of the hawk family not to mention blacky the crow in times when other food is scarce reddy and granny fox and old man coyote are always looking for him  so you see whitefoot never knows at what instant he may have to run for his life that is why he is such a timid little fellow and is always running away at the least little unexpected sound in spite of all this he is a happy little chap  it was early in the winter that whitefoot found a little hole in a corner of farmer browns sugarhouse and crept inside to see what it was like in there it didnt take him long to decide that it was the most delightful place he ever had found he promptly decided to move in and spend the winter in one end of the sugarhouse was a pile of wood down under this whitefoot made himself a warm comfortable nest it was a regular castle to whitefoot he moved over to it the store of seeds he had laid up for winter use  not one of his enemies ever thought of visiting the sugarhouse in search of whitefoot and they wouldnt have been able to get in if they had when rough brother north wind howled outside and sleet and snow were making other little people shiver whitefoot was warm and comfortable there was all the room he needed or wanted in which to run about and play he could go outside when he chose to but he didnt choose to very often for days at a time he didnt have a single fright yes indeed whitefoot spent a happy winter    chapter ii whitefoot sees queer things  whitefoot had spent the winter undisturbed in farmer browns sugarhouse he had almost forgotten the meaning of fear he had come to look on that sugarhouse as belonging to him it wasnt until farmer browns boy came over to prepare things for sugaring that whitefoot got a single real fright the instant farmer browns boy opened the door whitefoot scampered down under the pile of wood to his snug little nest and there he lay listening to the strange sounds at last he could stand it no longer and crept to a place where he could peep out and see what was going on it didnt take him long to discover that this great twolegged creature was not looking for him and right away he felt better after a while farmer browns boy went away and whitefoot had the little sugarhouse to himself again  but farmer browns boy had carelessly left the door wide open whitefoot didnt like that open door it made him nervous there was nothing to prevent those who hunt him from walking right in so the rest of that night whitefoot felt uncomfortable and anxious  he felt still more anxious when next day farmer browns boy returned and became very busy putting things to right then farmer brown himself came and strange things began to happen it became as warm as in summer you see farmer brown had built a fire under the evaporator whitefoots curiosity kept him at a place where he could peep out and watch all that was done he saw farmer brown and farmer browns boy pour pails of sap into a great pan by and by a delicious odor filled the sugarhouse it didnt take him a great while to discover that these twolegged creatures were so busy that he had nothing to fear from them and so he crept out to watch he saw them draw the golden syrup from one end of the evaporator and fill shining tin cans with it day after day they did the same thing at night when they had left and all was quiet inside the sugarhouse whitefoot stole out and found delicious crumbs where they had eaten their lunch he tasted that thick golden stuff and found it sweet and good later he watched them make sugar and nearly made himself sick that night when they had gone home for they had left some of that sugar where he could get at it he didnt understand these queer doings at all but he was no longer afraid    chapter iii farmer browns boy becomes acquainted  it didnt take farmer browns boy long to discover that whitefoot the wood mouse was living in the little sugarhouse he caught glimpses of whitefoot peeping out at him now farmer browns boy is wise in the ways of the little people of the green forest right away he made up his mind to get acquainted with whitefoot he knew that not in all the green forest is there a more timid little fellow than whitefoot and he thought it would be a fine thing to be able to win the confidence of such a shy little chap  so at first farmer browns boy paid no attention whatever to whitefoot he took care that whitefoot shouldnt even know that he had been seen every day when he ate his lunch farmer browns boy scattered a lot of crumbs close to the pile of wood under which whitefoot had made his home then he and farmer brown would go out to collect sap when they returned not a crumb would be left  one day farmer browns boy scattered some particularly delicious crumbs then instead of going out he sat down on a bench and kept perfectly still farmer brown and bowser the hound went out of course whitefoot heard them go out and right away he poked his little head out from under the pile of wood to see if the way was clear farmer browns boy sat there right in plain sight but whitefoot didnt see him that was because farmer browns boy didnt move the least bit whitefoot ran out and at once began to eat those delicious crumbs when he had filled his little stomach he began to carry the remainder back to his storehouse underneath the woodpile while he was gone on one of these trips farmer browns boy scattered more crumbs in a line that led right up to his foot right there he placed a big piece of bread crust  whitefoot was working so hard and so fast to get all those delicious bits of food that he took no notice of anything else until he reached that piece of crust then he happened to look up right into the eyes of farmer browns boy with a frightened little squeak whitefoot darted back and for a long time he was afraid to come out again  but farmer browns boy didnt move and at last whitefoot could stand the temptation no longer he darted out halfway scurried back came out again and at last ventured right up to the crust then he began to drag it back to the woodpile still farmer browns boy did not move  for two or three days the same thing happened by this time whitefoot had lost all fear he knew that farmer browns boy would not harm him and it was not long before he ventured to take a bit of food from farmer browns boys hand after that farmer browns boy took care that no crumbs should be scattered on the ground whitefoot had to come to him for his food and always farmer browns boy had something delicious for him    chapter iv whitefoot grows anxious     tis sad indeed to trust a friend    then have that trust abruptly end       whitefoot  i know of nothing that is more sad than to feel that a friend is no longer to be trusted there came a time when whitefoot the wood mouse almost had this feeling it was a very very anxious time for whitefoot  you see whitefoot and farmer browns boy had become the very best of friends there in the little sugarhouse they had become such good friends that whitefoot did not hesitate to take food from the hands of farmer browns boy never in all his life had he had so much to eat or such good things to eat he was getting so fat that his handsome little coat was uncomfortably tight he ran about fearlessly while farmer brown and farmer browns boy were making maple syrup and maple sugar he had even lost his fear of bowser the hound for bowser had paid no attention to him whatever  now you remember that whitefoot had made his home way down beneath the great pile of wood in the sugarhouse of course farmer brown and farmer browns boy used that wood for the fire to boil the sap to make the syrup and sugar whitefoot thought nothing of this until one day he discovered that his little home was no longer as dark as it had been a little ray of light crept down between the sticks presently another little ray of light crept down between the sticks  it was then that whitefoot began to grow anxious it was then he realized that that pile of wood was growing smaller and smaller and if it kept on growing smaller by and by there wouldnt be any pile of wood and his little home wouldnt be hidden at all of course whitefoot didnt understand why that wood was slipping away in spite of himself he began to grow suspicious he couldnt think of any reason why that wood should be taken away unless it was to look for his little home farmer browns boy was just as kind and friendly as ever but all the time more and more light crept in as the wood vanished  oh dear what does it mean cried whitefoot to himself they must be looking for my home yet they have been so good to me that it is hard to believe they mean any harm i do hope they will stop taking this wood away i wont have any hidingplace at all and then i will have to go outside back to my old home in the hollow stump i dont want to do that oh dear oh dear i was so happy and now i am so worried why cant happy times last always    chapter v the end of whitefoots worries     you never can tell  you never can tell    things going wrong will often end well       whitefoot  the next time you meet him just ask whitefoot if this isnt so things had been going very wrong for whitefoot it had begun to look to whitefoot as if he would no longer have a snug hidden little home in farmer browns sugarhouse the pile of wood under which he had made that snug little home was disappearing so fast that it began to look as if in a little while there would be no wood at all  whitefoot quite lost his appetite he no longer came out to take food from farmer browns boys hand he stayed right in his snug little home and worried  now farmer browns boy had not once thought of the trouble he was making he wondered what had become of whitefoot and in his turn he began to worry he was afraid that something had happened to his little friend he was thinking of this as he fed the sticks of wood to the fire for boiling the sap to make syrup and sugar finally as he pulled away two big sticks he saw something that made him whistle with surprise it was whitefoots nest which he had so cleverly hidden way down underneath that pile of wood when he had first moved into the sugarhouse with a frightened little squeak whitefoot ran out scurried across the little sugarhouse and out though the open door  farmer browns boy understood he understood perfectly that little people like whitefoot want their homes hidden away in the dark poor little chap said farmer browns boyhe had a regular castle here and we have destroyed it hes got the snuggest kind of a little nest here but he wont come back to it so long as it is right out in plain sight he probably thinks we have been hunting for this little home of his hello heres his storehouse ive often wondered how the little rascal could eat so much but now i understand he stored away here more than half of the good things i have given him i am glad he did if he hadnt he might not come back but i feel sure that tonight when all is quiet he will come back to take away all his food i must do something to keep him here  farmer browns boy sat down to think things over then he got an old box and made a little round hole in one end of it very carefully he took up whitefoots nest and placed it under the old box in the darkest corner of the sugarhouse then he carried all whitefoots supplies over there and put them under the box he went outside and got some branches of hemlock and threw these in a little pile over the box after this he scattered some crumbs just outside  late that night whitefoot did come back the crumbs led him to the old box he crept inside there was his snug little home all in a second whitefoot understood and trust and happiness returned    chapter vi a very careless jump  whitefoot once more was happy when he found his snug little nest and his store of food under that old box in the darkest corner of farmer browns sugarhouse he knew that farmer browns boy must have placed them there it was better than the old place under the woodpile it was the best place for a home whitefoot ever had had it didnt take him long to change his mind about leaving the little sugarhouse somehow he seemed to know right down inside that his home would not again be disturbed  so he proceeded to rearrange his nest and to put all his supplies of food in one corner of the old box when everything was placed to suit him he ventured out for now that he no longer feared farmer browns boy he wanted to see all that was going on he liked to jump up on the bench where farmer browns boy sometimes sat he would climb up to where farmer browns boys coat hung and explore the pockets of it once he stole farmer browns boys handkerchief he wanted it to add to the material his nest was made of farmer browns boy discovered it just as it was disappearing and how he laughed as he pulled it away  so what with eating and sleeping and playing about secure in the feeling that no harm could come to him whitefoot was happier than ever before in his little life he knew that farmer browns boy and farmer brown and bowser the hound were his friends he knew too that so long as they were about none of his enemies would dare come near this being so of course there was nothing to be afraid of no harm could possibly come to him at least that is what whitefoot thought  but you know enemies are not the only dangers to watch out for accidents will happen when they do happen it is very likely to be when the possibility of them is farthest from your thoughts almost always they are due to heedlessness or carelessness it was heedlessness that got whitefoot into one of the worst mishaps of his whole life  he had been running and jumping all around the inside of the little sugarhouse he loves to run and jump and he had been having just the best time ever finally whitefoot ran along the old bench and jumped from the end of it for a box standing on end which farmer browns boy sometimes used to sit on it wasnt a very long jump but somehow whitefoot misjudged it he was heedless and he didnt jump quite far enough right beside that box was a tin pail half filled with sap instead of landing on the box whitefoot landed with a splash in that pail of sap    chapter vii whitefoot gives up hope  whitefoot had been in many tight places yes indeed whitefoot had been in many tight places he had had narrow escapes of all kinds but never had he felt so utterly hopeless as now the moment he landed in that sap whitefoot began to swim frantically he isnt a particularly good swimmer but he could swim well enough to keep afloat for a while his first thought was to scramble up the side of the tin pail but when he reached it and tried to fasten his sharp little claws into it in order to climb he discovered that he couldnt sharp as they were his little claws just slipped and his struggles to get up only resulted in tiring him out and in plunging him wholly beneath the sap he came up choking and gasping then round and round inside that pail he paddled stopping every two or three seconds to try to climb up that hateful smooth shiny wall  the more he tried to climb out the more frightened he became  he was in a perfect panic of fear he quite lost his head did whitefoot the harder he struggled the more tired he became and the greater was his danger of drowning  whitefoot squeaked pitifully he didnt want to drown of course not he wanted to live but unless he could get out of that pail very soon he would drown he knew it he knew that he couldnt hold on much longer he knew that just as soon as he stopped paddling he would sink already he was so tired from his frantic efforts to escape that it seemed to him that he couldnt hold out any longer but somehow he kept his legs moving and so kept afloat  just why he kept struggling whitefoot couldnt have told it wasnt because he had any hope he didnt have the least bit of hope he knew now that he couldnt climb the sides of that pail and there was no other way of getting out still he kept on paddling it was the only way to keep from drowning and though he felt sure that he had got to drown at last he just wouldnt until he actually had to and all the time whitefoot squeaked hopelessly despairingly pitifully he did it without knowing that he did it just as he kept paddling round and round    chapter viii the rescue  when whitefoot made the heedless jump that landed him in a pail half filled with sap no one else was in the little sugarhouse whitefoot was quite alone you see farmer brown and farmer browns boy were out collecting sap from the trees and bowser the hound was with them  farmer browns boy was the first to return he came in just after whitefoot had given up all hope he went at once to the fire to put more wood on as he finished this job he heard the faintest of little squeaks it was a very pitiful little squeak farmer browns boy stood perfectly still and listened he heard it again he knew right away that it was the voice of whitefoot  hello exclaimed farmer browns boy that sounds as if whitefoot is in trouble of some kind i wonder where the little rascal is i wonder what can have happened to him i must look into this again farmer browns boy heard that faint little squeak it was so faint that he couldnt tell where it came from hurriedly and anxiously he looked all over the little sugarhouse stopping every few seconds to listen for that pitiful little squeak it seemed to come from nowhere in particular also it was growing fainter  at last farmer browns boy happened to stand still close to that tin pail half filled with sap he heard the faint little squeak again and with it a little splash it was the sound of the little splash that led him to look down in a flash he understood what had happened he saw poor little whitefoot struggling feebly and even as he looked whitefoots head went under he was very nearly drowned  stooping quickly farmer browns boy grabbed whitefoots long tail and pulled him out whitefoot was so nearly drowned that he didnt have strength enough to even kick a great pity filled the eyes of farmer browns boy as he held whitefoots head down and gently shook him he was trying to shake some of the sap out of whitefoot it ran out of whitefoots nose and out of his mouth whitefoot began to gasp then farmer browns boy spread his coat close by the fire rolled whitefoot up in his handkerchief and gently placed him on the coat for some time whitefoot lay just gasping but presently his breath came easier and after a while he was breathing naturally but he was too weak and tired to move so he just lay there while farmer browns boy gently stroked his head and told him how sorry he was  little by little whitefoot recovered his strength at last he could sit up and finally he began to move about a little although he was still wobbly on his legs farmer browns boy put some bits of food where whitefoot could get them and as he ate whitefoots beautiful soft eyes were filled with gratitude    chapter ix two timid persons meet     thus always you will meet lifes test    to do the thing you can do best       whitefoot  jumper the hare sat crouched at the foot of a tree in the green forest had you happened along there you would not have seen him at least i doubt if you would if you had seen him you probably wouldnt have known it you see in his white coat jumper was so exactly the color of the snow that he looked like nothing more than a little heap of snow  just in front of juniper was a little round hole he gave it no attention it didnt interest him in the least all through the green forest were little holes in the snow jumper was so used to them that he seldom noticed them so he took no notice of this one until something moved down in that hole jumpers eyes opened a little wider and he watched a sharp little face with very bright eyes filled that little round hole jumper moved just the tiniest bit and in a flash that sharp little face with the bright eyes disappeared jumper sat still and waited after a long wait the sharp little face with bright eyes appeared again dont be frightened whitefoot said jumper softly at the first word the sharp little face disappeared but in a moment it was back and the sharp little eyes were fixed on jumper suspiciously after a long stare the suspicion left them and out of the little round hole came trim little whitefoot in a soft brown coat with white waistcoat and with white feet and a long slim tail this winter he was not living in farmer browns sugarhouse  gracious jumper how you did scare me said he  jumper chuckled whitefoot i believe you are more timid than i am he replied  why shouldnt i be im ever so much smaller and i have more enemies retorted whitefoot  it is true you are smaller but i am not so sure that you have more enemies replied jumper thoughtfully it sometimes seems to me that i couldnt have more especially in winter  name them commanded whitefoot  hooty the great horned owl yowler the bob cat old man coyote reddy fox terror the goshawk shadow the weasel billy mink jumper paused  is that all demanded whitefoot  isnt that enough retorted jumper rather sharply  i have all of those and blacky the crow and butcher the shrike and sammy jay in winter and buster hear and jimmy skunk and several of the snake family in summer replied whitefoot it seems to me sometimes as if i need eyes and ears all over me night and day there is always some one hunting for poor little me and then some folks wonder why i am so timid if i were not as timid as i am i wouldnt be alive now i would have been caught long ago folks may laugh at me for being so easily frightened but i dont care that is what saves my life a dozen times a day  jumper looked interested i hadnt thought of that said he im a very timid person myself and sometimes i have been ashamed of being so easily frightened but come to think of it i guess you are right the more timid i am the longer i am likely to live whitefoot suddenly darted into his hole jumper didnt move but his eyes widened with fear a great white bird had just alighted on a stump a short distance away it was whitey the snowy owl down from the far north  there is another enemy we both forgot thought jumper and tried not to shiver    chapter x the white watchers     much may be gained by sitting still    if you but have the strength of will     whitefoot  jumper the hare crouched at the foot of a tree in the green forest and a little way from him on a stump sat whitey the snowy owl had you been there to see them both would have appeared as white as the snow around them unless you had looked very closely then you might have seen two narrow black lines back of jumpers head they were the tips of his ears for these remain black and near the upper part of the white mound which was whitey you might have seen two round yellow spots his eyes  there they were for all the world like two little heaps of snow jumper didnt move so much as a hair whitey didnt move so much as a feather both were waiting and watching jumper didnt move because he knew that whitey was there whitey didnt move because he didnt want any one to know he was there and didnt know that jumper was there jumper was sitting still because he was afraid whitey was sitting still because he was hungry  so there they sat each in plain sight of the other but only one seeing the other this was because juniper had been fortunate enough to see whitey alight on that stump jumper had been sitting still when whitey arrived and so those fierce yellow eyes had not yet seen him but had jumper so much as lifted one of those long ears whitey would have seen and his great claws would have been reaching for jumper  jumper didnt want to sit still no indeed he wanted to run you know it is on those long legs of his that jumper depends almost wholly for safety but there are times for running and times for sitting still and this was a time for sitting still he knew that whitey didnt know that he was anywhere near but just the same it was hard very hard to sit there with one he so greatly feared watching so near it seemed as if those fierce yellow eyes of whitey must see him they seemed to look right through him they made him shake inside  i want to run i want to run i want to run jumper kept saying to himself then he would say but i mustnt i mustnt i mustnt and so jumper did the hardest thing in the worldsat still and stared danger in the face he was sitting still to save his life  whitey the snowy owl was sitting still to catch a dinner i know that sounds queer but it was so he knew that so long as he sat still he was not likely to be seen it was for this purpose that old mother nature had given him that coat of white in the far north which was his real home everything is white for months and months and any one dressed in a dark suit can be seen a long distance so whitey had been given that white coat that he might have a better chance to catch food enough to keep him alive  and he had learned how to make the best use of it yes indeed he knew how to make the best use of it it was by doing just what he was doing nowsitting perfectly still just before he had alighted on that stump he had seen something move at the entrance to a little round hole in the snow he was sure of it  a mouse thought whitey and alighted on that stump he saw me flying but hell forget about it after a while and will come out again he wont see me then if i dont move and i wont move until he is far enough from that hole for me to catch him before he can get back to it  so the two watchers in white sat without moving for the longest time one watching for a dinner and the other watching the other watcher    chapter xi jumper is in doubt     when doubtful what course to pursue    tis sometimes best to nothing do      whitefoot  jumper the hare was beginning to feel easier in his mind he was no longer shaking inside in fact he was beginning to feel quite safe there he was in plain sight of whitey the snowy owl sitting motionless on a stump only a short distance away yet whitey hadnt seen him whitey had looked straight at him many times but because jumper had not moved so much as a hair whitey had mistaken him for a little heap of snow  all i have to do is to keep right on sitting perfectly still and ill be as safe as if whitey were nowhere about yes sir i will thought jumper by and by he will become tired and fly away i do hope hell do that before whitefoot comes out again if whitefoot should come out i couldnt warn him because that would draw whiteys attention to me and he wouldnt look twice at a wood mouse when there was a chance to get a hare for his dinner  this is a queer world it is so old mother nature does queer things here she has given me a white coat in winter so that i may not be easily seen when there is snow on the ground and at the same time she has given one of those i fear most a white coat so that he may not be easily seen either it certainly is a queer world  jumper forgot that whitey was only a chance visitor from the far north and that it was only once in a great while that he came down there while up in the far north where he belonged nearly everybody was dressed in white  jumper hadnt moved once but once in a while whitey turned his great round head for a look all about in every direction but it was done in such a way that only eyes watching him sharply would have noticed it most of the time he kept his fierce yellow eyes fixed on the little hole in the snow in which whitefoot had disappeared you know whitey can see by day quite as well as any other bird  jumper having stopped worrying about himself began to worry about whitefoot he knew that whitefoot had seen whitey arrive on that stump and that was why he had dodged back into his hole and since then had not even poked his nose out but that had been so long ago that by this time whitefoot must think that whitey had gone on about his business and jumper expected to see whitefoot appear any moment what jumper didnt know was that whitefoots bright little eyes had all the time been watching whitey from another little hole in the snow some distance away a tunnel led from this little hole to the first little hole  suddenly off among the trees something moved at least jumper thought he saw something move yes there it was a little black spot moving swiftly this way and that way over the snow jumper stared very hard and then his heart seemed to jump right up in his throat it did so he felt as if he would choke that black spot was the tip end of a tail the tail of a small very slim fellow dressed all in white the only other one in all the green forest who dresses all in white it was shadow the weasel in his white winter coat he is called ermine  he was running this way and that way back and forth with his nose to the snow he was hunting and jumper knew that sooner or later shadow would find him safety from shadow lay in making the best possible use of those long legs of his but to do that would bring whitey the owl swooping after him what to do jumper didnt know and so he did nothing it happened to be the wisest thing he could do    chapter xii whitey the owl saves jumper     it often happens in the end    an enemy may prove a friend       whitefoot  was ever any one in a worse position than jumper the hare to move would be to give himself away to whitey the snowy owl if he remained where he was very likely shadow the weasel would find him and the result would be the same as if he were caught by whitey the owl neither whitey nor shadow knew he was there but it would be only a few minutes before one of them knew it at least that is the way it looked to jumper  whitey wouldnt know it unless he moved but shadow the weasel would find his tracks and his nose would lead him straight there back and forth back and forth this way that way and the other way just a little distance off shadow was running with his nose to the snow he was huntinghunting for the scent of some one whom he could kill in a few minutes he would be sure to find where jumper had been and then his nose would lead him straight to that tree at the foot of which jumper was crouching  nearer and nearer came shadow he was slim and trim and didnt look at all terrible yet there was no one in all the green forest more feared by the little people in fur by jumper by peter rabbit by whitefoot even by chatterer the red squirrel  perhaps thought jumper he wont find my scent after all perhaps hell go in another direction but all the time jumper felt in his bones that shadow would find that scent when he does ill run said jumper to himself ill have at least a chance to dodge whitey i am afraid he will catch me but ill have a chance i wont have any chance at all if shadow finds me  suddenly shadow stopped running and sat up to look about with fierce little eyes all the time testing the air with his nose jumpers heart sank he knew that shadow had caught a faint scent of some one then shadow began to run back and forth once more but more carefully than before and then he started straight for where jumper was crouching jumper knew then that shadow had found his trail  jumper drew a long breath and settled his long hind feet for a great jump hoping to so take whitey the owl by surprise that he might be able to get away and as jumper did this he looked over to that stump where whitey had been sitting so long whitey was just leaving it on his great silent wings and his fierce yellow eyes were fixed in the direction of shadow the weasel he had seen that moving black spot which was the tip of shadows tail  jumper didnt have time to jump before whitey was swooping down at shadow so juniper just kept still and watched with eyes almost popping from his head with fear and excitement  shadow hadnt seen whitey until just as whitey was reaching for him with his great cruel claws now if there is any one who can move more quickly than shadow the weasel i dont know who it is whiteys claws closed on nothing but snow shadow had dodged then began a game whitey swooping and shadow dodging and all the time they were getting farther and farther from where jumper was  the instant it was safe to do so jumper took to his long heels and the way he disappeared lippertylippertylip was worth seeing whitey the snowy owl had saved him from shadow the weasel and didnt know it an enemy had proved to be a friend    chapter xiii whitefoot decides quickly     your mind made up a certain way    be swift to act do not delay       whitefoot  when whitefoot had discovered whitey the snowy owl he had dodged down in the little hole in the snow beside which he had been sitting he had not been badly frightened but he was somewhat upset yes sir he was somewhat upset you see he had so many enemies to watch out for and here was another  just as if i didnt have troubles enough without having this white robber to add to them grumbled whitefoot why doesnt he stay where he belongs way up in the far north it must be that food is scarce up there well now that i know he is here he will have to be smarter than i think he is to catch me i hope jumper the hare will have sense enough to keep perfectly still ive sometimes envied him his long legs but i guess i am better off than he is at that once he has been seen by an enemy only those long legs of his can save him but i have a hundred hidingplaces down under the snow whitey is watching the hole where i disappeared he thinks ill come out there again after a while ill fool him  whitefoot scampered along through a little tunnel and presently very cautiously peeped out of another little round hole in the snow sure enough there was whitey the snowy owl back to him on a stump watching the hole down which he had disappeared a few minutes before whitefoot grinned then he looked over to where he had last seen jumper jumper was still there it was clear that he hadnt moved and so whitey hadnt seen him again whitefoot grinned then he settled himself to watch patiently for whitey to become tired of watching that hole and fly away  so it was that whitefoot saw all that happened he saw whitey suddenly sail out on silent wings from that stump and swoop with great claws reaching for some one and then he saw who that some one wasshadow the weasel he saw shadow dodge in the very nick of time then he watched whitey swoop again and again as shadow dodged this way and that way finally both disappeared amongst the trees then he turned just in time to see jumper the hare bounding away with all the speed of his wonderful long legs  fear the greatest fear he had known for a long time took possession of whitefoot shadow the weasel he gasped and had such a thing been possible he certainly would have turned pale whitey wont catch him shadow is too quick for him and when whitey has given up and flown away shadow will come back he probably had found the tracks of jumper the hare and he will come back i know him hell come back jumper is safe enough from him now because he has such a long start but shadow will be sure to find one of my holes in the snow oh dear oh dear what shall i do  you see shadow the weasel is the one enemy that can follow whitefoot into most of his hidingplaces  for a minute or two whitefoot sat there shaking with fright then he made up his mind ill get away from here before he returns thought whitefoot ive got to ive spent a comfortable winter here so far but there will be no safety for me here any longer i dont know where to go but anywhere will be better than here now  without waiting another second whitefoot scampered away and how he did hope that his scent would have disappeared by the time shadow returned if it hadnt there would be little hope for him and he knew it    chapter xiv shadows return     he little gains and has no pride    who from his purpose turns aside      whitefoot  shadow the weasel believes in persistence when he sets out to do a thing he keeps at it until it is done or he knows for a certainty it cannot be done he is not easily discouraged this is one reason he is so feared by the little people he delights to hunt they know that once he gets on their trail they will be fortunate indeed if they escape him  when whitey the snowy owl swooped at him and so nearly caught him he was not afraid as he dodged this way and that way any other of the little people with the exception of his cousin billy mink would have been frightened half to death but shadow was simply angry he was angry that any one should try to catch him he was still more angry because his hunt for jumper the hare was interfered with you see he had just found jumpers trail when whitey swooped at him  so shadows little eyes grew red with rage as he dodged this way and that and was gradually driven away from the place where he had found the trail of jumper the hare at last he saw a hole in an old log and into this he darted whitey couldnt get him there whitey knew this and he knew too that waiting for shadow to come out again would be a waste of time so whitey promptly flew away  hardly had he disappeared when shadow popped out of that hole for he had been peeping out and watching whitey without a moments pause he turned straight back for the place where he had found the trail of jumper the hare he had no intention of giving up that hunt just because he had been driven away straight to the very spot where whitey had first swooped at him he ran and there once more his keen little nose took up the trail of jumper it led him straight to the foot of the tree where jumper had crouched so long  but as you know jumper wasnt there then shadow ran in a circle and presently he found where jumper had landed on the snow at the end of that first bound shadow snarled he understood exactly what had happened  jumper was under that tree when that white robber from the far north tried to catch me and he took that chance to leave in a hurry i can tell that by the length of this jump probably he is still going it is useless to follow him because he has too long a start said shadow and he snarled again in rage and disappointment  then for such is his way he wasted no more time or thought on jumper the hare instead he began to look for other trails so it was that he found one of the little holes of whitefoot the wood mouse  ha so this is where whitefoot has been living this winter he exclaimed once more his eyes glowed red but this time with eagerness and the joy of the hunt he plunged down into that little hole in the snow down there the scent of whitefoot was strong shadow followed it until it led out of another little hole in the snow but there he lost it you see it was so long since whitefoot had hurriedly left that the scent on the surface had disappeared  shadow ran swiftly this way and that way in a big circle but he couldnt find whitefoots trail again snarling with anger and disappointment he returned to the little hole in the snow and vanished then he followed all whitefoots little tunnels he found whitefoots nest he found his store of seeds but he didnt find whitefoot  hell come back muttered shadow and curled up in whitefoots nest to wait    chapter xv whitefoots dreadful journey     danger may be anywhere    so i expect it everywhere       whitefoot  whitefoot the wood mouse was terribly frightened yes sir he was terribly frightened it was a long long time since he had been as frightened as he now was he is used to frights is whitefoot he has them every day and every night but usually they are sudden frights quickly over and as quickly forgotten  this fright was different you see whitefoot had caught a glimpse of shadow the weasel and he knew that if shadow returned he would be sure to find the little round holes in the snow that led down to whitefoots private little tunnels underneath  the only thing for whitefoot to do was to get just as far from that place as he could before shadow should return and so poor little whitefoot started out on a journey that was to take him he knew not where all he could do was to go and go and go until he could find a safe hidingplace  my my but that was a dreadful journey every time a twig snapped whitefoots heart seemed to jump right up in his throat every time he saw a moving shadow and the branches of the trees moving in the wind were constantly making moving shadows on the snow he dodged behind a tree trunk or under a piece of bark or wherever he could find a hidingplace  you see whitefoot has so many enemies always looking for him that he hides whenever he sees anything moving when at home he is forever dodging in and out of his hidingplaces so because everything was strange to him and because of the great fear of shadow the weasel he suspected everything that moved and every sound he heard for a long way no one saw him for no one was about yet all that way whitefoot twisted and dodged and darted from place to place and was just as badly frightened as if there had been enemies all about  oh dear oh dear me he kept saying over and over to himself wherever shall i go whatever shall i do however shall i get enough to eat i wont dare go back to get food from my little storehouses and i shall have to live in a strange place where i wont know where to look for food i am getting tired my legs ache i m getting hungry i want my nice warm soft bed oh dear oh dear oh dear me  but in spite of his frights whitefoot kept on you see he was more afraid to stop than he was to go on he just had to get as far from shadow the weasel as he could being such a little fellow what would be a short distance for you or me is a long distance for whitefoot  and so that journey was to him very long indeed of course it seemed longer because of the constant frights which came one right after another it really was a terrible journey yet if he had only known it there wasnt a thing along the whole way to be afraid of you know it often happens that people are frightened more by what they dont know than by what they do know    chapter xvi whitefoot climbs a tree      id rather be frightened with no cause for fear     than fearful of nothing when danger is near       whitefoot  whitefoot kept on going and going every time he thought that he was so tired he must stop he would think of shadow the weasel and then go on again by and by he became so tired that not even the thought of shadow the weasel could make him go much farther so he began to look about for a safe hidingplace in which to rest  now the home which he had left had been a snug little room beneath the roots of a certain old stump there he had lived for a long time in the greatest comfort little tunnels led to his storehouses and up to the surface of the snow it had been a splendid place and one in which he had felt perfectly safe until shadow the weasel had appeared had you seen him playing about there you would have thought him one of the little people of the ground like his cousin danny meadow mouse  but whitefoot is quite as much at home in trees as on the ground in fact he is quite as much at home in trees as is chatterer the red squirrel and a lot more at home in trees than is striped chipmunk although striped chipmunk belongs to the squirrel family so now that he must find a hidingplace whitefoot decided that he would feel much safer in a tree than on the ground  if only i can find a hollow tree whimpered whitefoot i will feel ever so much safer in a tree than hiding in or near the ground in a strange place  so whitefoot began to look for a dead tree you see he knew that there was more likely to be a hollow in a dead tree than in a living tree by and by he came to a tall dead tree he knew it was a dead tree because there was no bark on it but of course he couldnt tell whether or not that tree was hollow i mean he couldnt tell from the ground  oh dear he whimpered again oh dear i suppose i will have to climb this and i am so tired it ought to be hollow there ought to be splendid holes in it it is just the kind of a tree that drummer the woodpecker likes to make his house in i shall be terribly disappointed if i dont find one of his houses somewhere in it but i wish i hadnt got to climb it to find out well here goes  he looked anxiously this way he looked anxiously that way he looked anxiously the other way in fact he looked anxiously every way  but he saw no one and nothing to be afraid of and so he started up the tree  he was halfway up when glancing down he saw a shadow moving across the snow once more whitefoots heart seemed to jump right up in his throat that shadow was the shadow of some one flying there couldnt be the least bit of doubt about it whitefoot flattened himself against the side of the tree and peeked around it he was just in time to see a gray and black and white bird almost the size of sammy jay alight in the very next tree he had come along near the ground and then risen sharply into the tree his bill was black and there was just a tiny hook on the end of it whitefoot knew who it was it was butcher the shrike whitefoot shivered    chapter xvii whitefoot finds a hole just in time     just in time not just too late    will make you master of your fate      whitefoot  whitefoot halfway up that dead tree flattened himself against the trunk and with his heart going pitapat pitapat with fright peered around the tree at an enemy he had not seen for so long that he had quite forgotten there was such a one it was butcher the shrike often he is called just butcher bird he did not look at all terrible he was not quite as big as sammy jay he had no terrible claws like the hawks and owls there was a tiny hook at the end of his black bill but it wasnt big enough to look very dreadful but you can not always judge a person by looks and whitefoot knew that butcher was one to be feared  so his heart went pitapat pitapat as he wondered if butcher had seen him he didnt have to wait long to find out butcher flew to a tree back of whitefoot and then straight at him whitefoot dodged around to the other side of the tree then began a dreadful game at least it was dreadful to whitefoot this way and that way around the trunk of that tree he dodged while butcher did his best to catch him  whitefoot would not have minded this so much had he not been so tired and had he known of a hidingplace close at hand but he was tired very tired for you remember he had had what was a very long and terrible journey to him he had felt almost too tired to climb that tree in the first place to see if it had any holes in it higher up now he didnt know whether to keep on going up or to go down two or three times he dodged around the tree without doing either then he decided to go up  now butcher was enjoying this game of dodge if he should catch whitefoot he would have a good dinner if he didnt catch whitefoot he would simply go hungry a little longer so you see there was a very big difference in the feelings of whitefoot and butcher whitefoot had his life to lose while butcher had only a dinner to lose  dodging this way and dodging that way whitefoot climbed higher and higher twice he whisked around that tree trunk barely in time all the time he was growing more and more tired and more and more discouraged supposing he should find no hole in that tree  there must be one there must be one he kept saying over and over to himself to keep his courage up i cant keep dodging much longer if i dont find a hole pretty soon butcher will surely catch me oh dear oh dear  just above whitefoot was a broken branch only the stub of it remained the next time he dodged around the trunk he found himself just below that stub oh joy there close under that stub was a round hole whitefoot didnt hesitate a second he didnt wait to find out whether or not any one was in that hole he didnt even think that there might be some one in there with a tiny little squeak of relief he darted in he was just in time he was just in the nick of time butcher struck at him and just missed him as he disappeared in that hole whitefoot had saved his life and butcher had missed a dinner    chapter xviii an unpleasant surprise     be careful never to be rude    enough to thoughtlessly intrude      whitefoot  if ever anybody in the great world felt relief and thankfulness it was whitefoot when he dodged into that hole in the dead tree just as butcher the shrike all but caught him for a few minutes he did nothing but pant for he was quite out of breath  i was right he said over and over to himself i was right i was sure there must be a hole in this tree it is one of the old houses of drummer the woodpecker now i am safe  presently he peeped out he wanted to see if butcher was watching outside he was just in time to see butchers gray and black and white coat disappearing among the trees butcher was not foolish enough to waste time watching for whitefoot to come out whitefoot sighed happily for the first time since he had started on his dreadful journey he felt safe nothing else mattered he was hungry but he didnt mind that he was willing to go hungry for the sake of being safe  whitefoot watched until butcher was out of sight then he turned to see what that house was like right away he discovered that there was a soft warm bed in it it was made of leaves grass moss and the lining of bark it was a very fine bed indeed  my my my but i am lucky said whitefoot to himself i wonder who could have made this fine bed i certainly shall sleep comfortably here goodness knows i need a rest if i can find food enough near here ill make this my home i couldnt ask for a better one  chuckling happily whitefoot began to pull away the top of that bed so as to get to the middle of it and then he got a surprise it was an unpleasant surprise it was a most unpleasant surprise there was some one in that bed yes sir there was some one curled up in a little round ball in the middle of that fine bed it was some one with a coat of the softest finest fur can you guess who it was it was timmy the flying squirrel  it seemed to whitefoot as if his heart flopped right over you see at first he didnt recognize timmy whitefoot is himself so very timid that his thought was to run to get out of there as quickly as possible but he had no place to run to so he hesitated never in all his life had whitefoot had a greater disappointment he knew now that this splendid house was not for him  timmy the flying squirrel didnt move he remained curled up in a soft little ball he was asleep whitefoot remembered that timmy sleeps during the day and seldom comes out until the black shadows come creeping out from the purple hills at the close of day whitefoot felt easier in his mind then timmy was so sound asleep that he knew nothing of his visitor and so whitefoot felt safe in staying long enough to get rested then he would go out and hunt for another home  so down in the middle of that soft warm bed timmy the flying squirrel curled up in a little round ball with his flat tail wrapped around him slept peacefully and on top of that soft bed whitefoot the wood mouse rested and wondered what he should do next not in all the green forest could two more timid little people be found than the two in that old home of drummer the woodpecker    chapter xix whitefoot finds a home at last     true independence he has known    whose home has been his very own      whitefoot  curled up in his splendid warm bed timmy the flying squirrel slept peacefully he didnt know he had a visitor he didnt know that on top of that same bed lay whitefoot the wood mouse whitefoot wasnt asleep no indeed whitefoot was too worried to sleep he knew he couldnt stay in that fine house because it belonged to timmy he knew that as soon as timmy awoke he whitefoot would have to get out where should he go he wished he knew how he did long for the old home he had left but when he thought of that he remembered shadow the weasel it was better to be homeless than to feel that at any minute shadow the weasel might appear  it was getting late in the afternoon before long jolly round red mr sun would go to bed behind the purple hills and the black shadows would come creeping through the green forest then timmy the flying squirrel would awake it wont do for me to be here then said whitefoot to himself i must find some other place before he wakes if only i knew this part of the green forest i might know where to go as it is i shall have to go hunt for a new home and trust to luck did ever a poor little mouse have so much trouble  after awhile whitefoot felt rested and peeped out of the doorway no enemy was to be seen anywhere whitefoot crept out and climbed a little higher up in the tree presently he found another hole he peeped inside and listened long and carefully he didnt intend to make the mistake of going into another house where some one might be living  at last sure that there was no one in there he crept in then he made a discovery there were beech nuts in there and there were seeds  it was a storehouse whitefoot knew at once that it must be timmys storehouse right away he realized how very very hungry he was of course he had no right to any of those seeds or nuts certainly not that is he wouldnt have had any right had he been a boy or girl but it is the law of the green forest that whatever any one finds he may help himself to if he can  so whitefoot began to fill his empty little stomach with some of those seeds he ate and ate and ate and quite forgot all his troubles just as he felt that he hadnt room for another seed he heard the sound of claws outside on the trunk of the tree in a flash he knew that timmy the flying squirrel was awake and that it wouldnt do to be found in there by him in a jiffy whitefoot was outside he was just in time timmy was almost up to the entrance  hi there cried timmy what were you doing in my storehouse  iii was looking for a new home stammered whitefoot  you mean you were stealing some of my food snapped timmy suspiciously  iii did take a few seeds because i was almost starved but truly i was looking for a new home replied whitefoot  what was the matter with your old home demanded timmy  then whitefoot told timmy all about how he had been obliged to leave his old home because of shadow the weasel of the terrible journey he had had and how he didnt know where to go or what to do timmy listened suspiciously at first but soon he made up his mind that whitefoot was telling the truth the mere mention of shadow the weasel made him very sober  he scratched his nose thoughtfully over in that tall dead stub you can see from here is an old home of mine said he no one lives in it now i guess you can live there until you can find a better home but remember to keep away from my storehouse  so it was that whitefoot found a new home    chapter xx whitefoot makes himself at home     look not too much on that behind    lest to the future you be blind      whitefoot  whitefoot didnt wait to be told twice of that empty house he thanked timmy and then scampered over to that stub as fast as his legs would take him up the stub he climbed and near the top he found a little round hole timmy had said no one was living there now and so whitefoot didnt hesitate to pop inside  there was even a bed in there it was an old bed but it was dry and soft it was quite clear that no one had been in there for a long time with a little sigh of pure happiness whitefoot curled up in that bed for the sleep he so much needed his stomach was full and once more he felt safe the very fact that this was an old house in which no one had lived for a long time made it safer whitefoot knew that those who lived in that part of the green forest probably knew that no one lived in that old stub and so no one was likely to visit it  he was so tired that he slept all night whitefoot is one of those who sleeps when he feels sleepy whether it be by day or night he prefers the night to be out and about in because he feels safer then but he often comes out by day so when he awoke in the early morning he promptly went out for a look about and to get acquainted with his new surroundings  just a little way off was the tall dead tree in which timmy the flying squirrel had his home timmy was nowhere to be seen you see he had been out most of the night and had gone to bed to sleep through the day whitefoot thought longingly of the good things in timmys storehouse in that same tree but decided that it would be wisest to keep away from there so he scurried about to see what he could find for a breakfast it didnt take him long to find some pine cones in which a few seeds were still clinging these would do nicely whitefoot ate what he wanted and then carried some of them back to his new home in the tall stub  then he went to work to tear to pieces the old bed in there and make it over to suit himself it was an old bed of timmy the flying squirrel for you know this was timmys old house  whitefoot soon had the bed made over to suit him and when this was done he felt quite at home then he started out to explore all about within a short distance of the old stub he wanted to know every hole and every possible hidingplace all around for it is on such knowledge that his life depends  when at last he returned home he was very well satisfied it is going to be a good place to live said he to himself there are plenty of hidingplaces and i am going to be able to find enough to eat it will be very nice to have timmy the flying squirrel for a neighbor i am sure he and i will get along together very nicely i dont believe shadow the weasel even if he should come around here would bother to climb up this old stub he probably would expect to find me living down in the ground or close to it anyway i certainly am glad that i am such a good climber now if buster bear doesnt come along in the spring and pull this old stub over ill have as fine a home as any one could ask for  and then because happily it is the way with the little people of the green forest and the green meadows whitefoot forgot all about his terrible journey and the dreadful time he had had in finding his new home    chapter xxi whitefoot envies timmy     a useless thing is envy       a foolish thing to boot    why should a fox who has a bark       want like an owl to hoot  whitefoot was beginning to feel quite at home he would have been wholly contented but for one thinghe had no wellfilled storehouse this meant that each day he must hunt for his food  it wasnt that whitefoot minded hunting for food he would have done that anyway even though he had had close at hand a storehouse with plenty in it but he would have felt easier in his mind he would have had the comfortable feeling that if the weather turned so bad that he could not easily get out and about he would not have to go hungry  but whitefoot is a happy little fellow and wisely made the best of things at first he came out very little by day he knew that there were many sharp eyes watching for him and that he was more likely to be seen in the light of day than when the black shadows had crept all through the green forest  he would peek out of his doorway and watch for chance visitors in the daytime twice he saw butcher the shrike alight a short distance from the tree in which timmy lived he knew butcher had not forgotten that he had chased a badly frightened mouse into a hole in that tree once he saw whitey the snowy owl and so knew that whitey had not yet returned to the far north once reddy fox trotted along right past the foot of the old stub in which whitefoot lived and didnt even suspect that he was anywhere near twice he saw old man coyote trotting past and once terror the goshawk alighted on that very stub and sat there for half an hour  so whitefoot formed the habit of doing just what timmy the flying squirrel did he remained in his house for most of the day and came out when the black shadows began to creep in among the trees timmy came out about the same time and they had become the best of friends  now whitefoot is not much given to envying others but as night after night he watched timmy a little envy crept into his heart in spite of all he could do timmy would nimbly climb to the top of a tree and then jump down he would come in a long beautiful glide for all the world as if he were sliding on the air  the first time whitefoot saw him do it he held his breath he really didnt know what to make of it the nearest tree to the one from which timmy had jumped was so far away that it didnt seem possible any one without wings could reach it without first going to the ground  oh squeaked whitefoot oh hell kill himself he surely will kill himself hell break his neck but timmy did nothing of the kind he sailed down down down and alighted on that distant tree a foot or two from the bottom and without stopping a second scampered up to the top of that tree and once more jumped whitefoot had hard work to believe his own eyes timmy seemed to be jumping just for the pleasure of it as a matter of fact he was he was getting his evening exercise  whitefoot sighed i wish i could jump like that said he to himself i wouldnt ever be afraid of anybody if i could jump like that i envy timmy i do so    chapter xxii timmy proves to be a true neighbor     he proves himself a neighbor true    who seeks a kindly deed to do      whitefoot  occasionally timmy the flying squirrel came over to visit whitefoot if whitefoot was in his house he always knew when timmy arrived he would hear a soft thump down near the bottom of the tall stub he would know instantly that thump was made by timmy striking the foot of the stub after a long jump from the top of a tree whitefoot would poke his head out of his doorway and there sure enough would be timmy scrambling up towards him  whitefoot had grown to admire timmy with all his might it seemed to him that timmy was the most wonderful of all the people he knew you see there was none of the others who could jump as timmy could timmy on his part enjoyed having whitefoot for a neighbor few of the little people of the green forest are more timid than timmy the flying squirrel but here was one beside whom timmy actually felt bold it was such a new feeling that timmy enjoyed it  so it was that in the dusk of early evening just after the black shadows had come creeping out from the purple hills across the green meadows and through the green forest these two little neighbors would start out to hunt for food whitefoot never went far from the tall dead stub in which he was now living he didnt dare to he wanted to be where at the first sign of danger he could scamper back there to safety timmy would go some distance but he was seldom gone long he liked to be where he could watch and talk with whitefoot you see timmy is very much like other peoplehe likes to gossip a little  one evening whitefoot had found it hard work to find enough food to fill his stomach he had kept going a little farther and a little farther from home finally he was farther from it than he had ever been before timmy had filled his stomach and from near the top of a tree was watching whitefoot suddenly what seemed like a great black shadow floated right over the tree in which timmy was sitting and stopped on the top of a tall dead tree it was hooty the owl and it was simply good fortune that timmy happened to see him timmy did not move he knew that he was safe so long as he kept perfectly still he knew that hooty didnt know he was there unless he moved those great eyes of hootys wonderful as they were would not see him  timmy looked over to where he had last seen whitefoot there he was picking out seeds from a pine cone on the ground the trunk of a tree was between him and hooty but timmy knew that whitefoot hadnt seen hooty and that any minute he might run out from behind that tree if he did hooty would see him and silently as a shadow would swoop down and catch him what was to be done  its no business of mine said timmy to himself whitefoot must look out for himself it is no business of mine at all perhaps hooty will fly away before whitefoot moves i dont want anything to happen to whitefoot but if something does it will be his own fault he should keep better watch  for a few minutes nothing happened then whitefoot finished the last seed in that cone and started to look for more timmy knew that in a moment hooty would see whitefoot what do you think timmy did he jumped yes sir he jumped down down down straight past the tree on which sat hooty the owl timmy sailed hooty saw him of course he couldnt help but see him he spread his great wings and was after timmy in an instant timmy struck near the foot of a tree and without wasting a second darted around to the other side he was just in time hooty was already reaching for him up the tree ran timmy and jumped again again hooty was too late and so timmy led hooty the owl away from whitefoot the wood mouse    chapter xxiii whitefoot spends a dreadful night     pity those who suffer fright    in the dark and stilly night      whitefoot  one night of his life whitefoot will never forget so long as he lives even now it makes him shiver just to think of it yes sir he shivers even now whenever he thinks of that night the black shadows had come early that evening so that it was quite dusk when whitefoot crept out of his snug little bed and climbed up to the round hole which was the doorway of his home he had just poked his nose out that little round doorway when there was the most terrible sound it seemed to him as if it was in his very ears so loud and terrible was it it frightened him so that he simply let go and tumbled backward down inside his house of course it didnt hurt him any for he landed on his soft bed  whooohoohoo whooohoo came that terrible sound again and whitefoot shook until his little teeth rattled at least that is the way it seemed to him it was the voice of hooty the owl and whitefoot knew that hooty was sitting on the top of that very stub he was so to speak on the roof of whitefoots house  now in all the green forest there is no sound that strikes terror to the hearts of the little people of feathers and fur equal to the hunting call of hooty the owl hooty knows this no one knows it better than he does that is why he uses it he knows that many of the little people are asleep safely hidden away he knows that it would be quite useless for him to simply look for them he would starve before he could find a dinner in that way but he knows that any one wakened from sleep in great fright is sure to move and if they do this they are almost equally sure to make some little sound his ears are so wonderful that they can catch the faintest sound and tell exactly where it comes from so he uses that terrible hunting cry to frighten the little people and make them move  now whitefoot knew that he was safe hooty couldnt possibly get at him even should he find out that he was in there there was nothing to fear but just the same whitefoot shivered and shook and jumped almost out of his skin every time that hooty hooted he just couldnt help it  he cant get me i know he cant get me im perfectly safe im just as safe as if he were miles away theres nothing to be afraid of it is silly to be afraid probably hooty doesnt even know i am inside here even if he does it doesnt really matter whitefoot said these things to himself over and over again then hooty would send out that fierce terrible hunting call and whitefoot would jump and shake just as before  after awhile all was still gradually whitefoot stopped trembling he guessed that hooty had flown away still he remained right where he was for a very long time he didnt intend to foolishly take any chances so he waited and waited and waited  at last he was sure that hooty had left once more he climbed up to his little round doorway and there he waited some time before poking even his nose outside then just as he had made up his mind to go out that terrible sound rang out again and just as before he tumbled heels over head down on his bed  whitefoot didnt go out that night at all it was a moonlight night and just the kind of a night to be out instead whitefoot lay in his little bed and shivered and shook for all through that long night every once in a while hooty the owl would hoot from the top of that stub    chapter xxiv whitefoot the wood mouse is unhappy     unhappiness without a cause you never never find    it may be in the stomach or it may be in the mind      whitefoot  whitefoot the wood mouse should have been happy but he wasnt winter had gone and sweet mistress spring had brought joy to all the green forest every one was happy whitefoot no less so than his neighbors at first up from the sunny south came the feathered friends and at once began planning new homes twitterings and songs filled the air joy was everywhere food became plentiful and whitefoot became sleek and fat that is he became as fat as a lively wood mouse ever does become none of his enemies had discovered his new home and he had little to worry about  but by and by whitefoot began to feel less joyous day by day he grew more and more unhappy he no longer took pleasure in his fine home he began to wander about for no particular reason he wandered much farther from home than he had ever been in the habit of doing at times he would sit and listen but what he was listening for he didnt know there is something the matter with me and i dont know what it is said whitefoot to himself forlornly it cant be anything i have eaten i have nothing to worry about yet there is something wrong with me im losing my appetite nothing tastes good any more i want something but i dont know what it is i want  he tried to tell his troubles to his nearest neighbor timmy the flying squirrel but timmy was too busy to listen when peter rabbit happened along whitefoot tried to tell him but peter himself was too happy and too eager to learn all the news in the green forest to listen no one had any interest in whitefoots troubles every one was too busy with his own affairs  so day by day whitefoot the wood mouse grew more and more unhappy and when the dusk of early evening came creeping through the green forest he sat about and moped instead of running about and playing as he had been in the habit of doing the beautiful song of melody the wood thrush somehow filled him with sadness instead of with the joy he had always felt before the very happiness of those about him seemed to make him more unhappy  once he almost decided to go hunt for another home but somehow he couldnt get interested even in this he did start out but he had not gone far before he had forgotten all about what he had started for always he had loved to run about and climb and jump for the pure pleasure of it but now he no longer did these things he was unhappy was whitefoot yes sir he was unhappy and for no cause at all so far as he could see    chapter xxv whitefoot finds out what the matter was     pity the lonely for deep in the heart    is an ache that no doctor can heal by his art     whitefoot  of all the little people of the green forest whitefoot seemed to be the only one who was unhappy and because he didnt know why he felt so he became day by day more unhappy perhaps i should say that night by night he became more unhappy for during the brightness of the day he slept most of the time  there is something wrong something wrong he would say over and over to himself  it must be with me because everybody else is happy and this is the happiest time of all the year i wish some one would tell me what ails me i want to be happy but somehow i just cant be  one evening he wandered a little farther from home than usual he wasnt going anywhere in particular he had nothing in particular to do he was just wandering about because somehow he couldnt remain at home not far away melody the wood thrush was pouring out his beautiful evening song whitefoot stopped to listen somehow it made him more unhappy than ever melody stopped singing for a few moments it was just then that whitefoot heard a faint sound it was a gentle drumming whitefoot pricked up his ears and listened there it was again he knew instantly how that sound was made it was made by dainty little feet beating very fast on an old log whitefoot had drummed that way himself many times it was soft but clear and it lasted only a moment  right then something very strange happened to whitefoot yes sir something very strange happened to whitefoot all in a flash he felt better at first he didnt know why he just did that was all without thinking what he was doing he began to drum himself then he listened at first he heard nothing then soft and low came that drumming sound again whitefoot replied to it all the time he kept feeling better he ran a little nearer to the place from which that drumming sound had come and then once more drummed at first he got no reply  then in a few minutes he heard it again only this time it came from a different place whitefoot became quite excited he knew that that drumming was done by another wood mouse and all in a flash it came over him what had been the matter with him  i have been lonely exclaimed whitefoot that is all that has been the trouble with me i have been lonely and didnt know it i wonder if that other wood mouse has felt the same way  again he drummed and again came that soft reply once more whitefoot hurried in the direction of it and once more he was disappointed when the next reply came from a different place by now he was getting quite excited he was bound to find that other wood mouse every time he heard that drumming funny little thrills ran all over him he didnt know why they just did that was all he simply must find that other wood mouse he forgot everything else he didnt even notice where he was going he would drum then wait for a reply as soon as he heard it he would scamper in the direction of it and then pause to drum again sometimes the reply would be very near then again it would be so far away that a great fear would fill whitefoots heart that the stranger was running away    chapter xxvi love fills the heart of whitefoot     joyous all the winds that blow    to the heart with love aglow     whitefoot  it was a wonderful game of hideandseek that whitefoot the wood mouse was playing in the dusk of early evening whitefoot was it all the time that is he was the one who had to do all the hunting just who he was hunting for he didnt know he knew it was another wood mouse but it was a stranger and do what he would he couldnt get so much as a glimpse of this little stranger he would drum with his feet and after a slight pause there would be an answering drum then whitefoot would run as fast as he could in that direction only to find no one at all then he would drum again and the reply would come from another direction  every moment whitefoot became more excited he forgot everything even danger in his desire to see that little drummer once or twice he actually lost his temper in his disappointment but this was only for a moment he was too eager to find that little drummer to be angry very long  at last there came a time when there was no reply to his drumming he drummed and listened then drummed again and listened nothing was to be heard there was no reply whitefoots heart sank  all the old lonesomeness crept over him again he didnt know which way to turn to look for that stranger when he had drummed until he was tired he sat on the end of an old log a perfect picture of disappointment he was so disappointed that he could have cried if it would have done any good  just as he had about made up his mind that there was nothing to do but to try to find his way home his keen little ears caught the faintest rustle of dry leaves instantly whitefoot was alert and watchful long ago he had learned to be suspicious of rustling leaves they might have been rustled by the feet of an enemy stealing up on him no wood mouse who wants to live long is ever heedless of rustling leaves as still as if he couldnt move whitefoot sat staring at the place from which that faint sound had seemed to come for two or three minutes he heard and saw nothing then another leaf rustled a little bit to one side whitefoot turned like a flash his feet gathered under him ready for a long jump for safety  at first he saw nothing then he became aware of two bright soft little eyes watching him he stared at them very hard and then all over him crept those funny thrills he had felt when he had first heard the drumming of the stranger he knew without being told that those eyes belonged to the little drummer with whom he had been playing hide and seek so long  whitefoot held his breath he was so afraid that those eyes would vanish finally he rather timidly jumped down from the log and started toward those two soft eyes they vanished whitefoots heart sank he was tempted to rush forward but he didnt he sat still there was a slight rustle off to the right a little ray of moonlight made its way down through the branches of the trees just there and in the middle of the light spot it made sat a timid little person it seemed to whitefoot that he was looking at the most beautiful wood mouse in all the great world suddenly he felt very shy and timid himself  whowhowho are you he stammered  i am little miss dainty replied the stranger bashfully  right then and there whitefoots heart was filled so full of something that it seemed as if it would burst it was love all in that instant he knew that he had found the most wonderful thing in all the great world which of course is love he knew that he just couldnt live without little miss dainty    chapter xxvii mr and mrs whitefoot     when all is said and all is done    tis only love of two makes one     whitefoot  little miss dainty the most beautiful and wonderful wood mouse in all the great world according to whitefoot was very shy and very timid it took whitefoot a long time to make her believe that he really couldnt live without her at least she pretended not to believe it if the truth were known little miss dainty felt just the same way about whitefoot but whitefoot didnt know this and i am afraid she teased him a great deal before she told him that she loved him just as he loved her  but at last little miss dainty shyly admitted that she loved whitefoot just as much as he loved her and was willing to become mrs whitefoot secretly she thought whitefoot the most wonderful wood mouse in the great world but she didnt tell him so the truth is she made him feel as if she were doing him a great favor  as for whitefoot he was so happy that he actually tried to sing yes sir whitefoot tried to sing and he really did very well for a mouse he was ready and eager to do anything that mrs whitefoot wanted to do together they scampered about in the moonlight hunting for good things to eat and poking their inquisitive little noses into every little place they could find whitefoot forgot that he had ever been sad and lonely he raced about and did all sorts of funny things from pure joy but he never once forgot to watch out for danger in fact he was more watchful than ever for now he was watching for mrs whitefoot as well as for himself  at last whitefoot rather timidly suggested that they should go see his fine home in a certain hollow stub mrs whitefoot insisted that they should go to her home whitefoot agreed on condition that she would afterwards visit his home so together they went back to mrs whitefoots home whitefoot pretended that he liked it very much but in his heart he thought his own home was very much better and he felt quite sure that mrs whitefoot would agree with him once she had seen it  but mrs whitefoot was very well satisfied with her old home and not at all anxious to leave it it was in an old hollow stump close to the ground it was just such a place as shadow the weasel would be sure to visit should he happen along that way it didnt seem at all safe to whitefoot in fact it worried him then too it was not in such a pleasant place as was his own home of course he didnt say this but pretended to admire everything  two days and nights they spent there then whitefoot suggested that they should visit his home of course my dear we will not have to live there unless you want to but i want you to see it said he  mrs whitefoot didnt appear at all anxious to go she began to make excuses for staying right where they were you see she had a great love for that old home they were sitting just outside the doorway talking about the matter when whitefoot caught a glimpse of a swiftly moving form not far off it was shadow the weasel neither of them breathed shadow passed without looking in their direction when he was out of sight mrs whitefoot shivered  lets go over to your home right away she whispered ive never seen shadow about here before but now that he has been here once he may come again  well start at once replied whitefoot and for once he was glad that shadow the weasel was about    chapter xviii mrs whitefoot decides on a home     when mrs mouse makes up her mind    then mr mouse best get behind     whitefoot  whitefoot the wood mouse was very proud of his home he showed it as he led mrs whitefoot there he felt sure that she would say at once that that would be the place for them to live you remember that it was high up in a tall dead stub and had once been the home of timmy the flying squirrel  there my dear what do you think of that said whitefoot proudly as they reached the little round doorway  mrs whitefoot said nothing but at once went inside she was gone what seemed a long time to whitefoot anxiously waiting outside you see mrs whitefoot is a very thorough small person and she was examining the inside of that house from top to bottom at last she appeared at the doorway  dont you think this is a splendid house asked whitefoot rather timidly  it is very good of its kind replied mrs whitefoot  whitefoots heart sank he didnt like the tone in which mrs whitefoot had said that  just what do you mean my dear whitefoot asked  i mean replied mrs whitefoot in a most decided way that it is a very good house for winter but it wont do at all for summer that is it wont do for me in the first place it is so high up that if we should have babies i would worry all the time for fear the darlings would have a bad fall besides i dont like an inside house for summer i think whitefoot we must look around and find a new home  as she spoke mrs whitefoot was already starting down the stub whitefoot followed  all right my dear all right said he meekly you know best this seems to me like a very fine home but of course if you dont like it well look for another  mrs whitefoot said nothing but led the way down the tree with whitefoot meekly following then began a patient search all about mrs whitefoot appeared to know just what she wanted and turned up her nose at several places whitefoot thought would make fine homes she hardly glanced at a fine hollow log whitefoot found she merely poked her nose in at a splendid hole beneath the roots of an old stump whitefoot began to grow tired from running about and climbing stumps and trees and bushes  he stopped to rest and lost sight of mrs whitefoot a moment later he heard her calling excitedly when he found her she was up in a small tree sitting on the edge of an old nest a few feet above the ground it was a nest that had once belonged to melody the wood thrush mrs whitefoot was sitting on the edge of it and her bright eyes snapped with excitement and pleasure  ive found it she cried ive found it it is just what i have been looking for  found what whitefoot asked i dont see anything but an old nest of melodys  ive found the home weve been looking for stupid retorted mrs whitefoot  still whitefoot stared i dont see any house said he  mrs whitefoot stamped her feet impatiently right here stupid said she this old nest will make us the finest and safest home that ever was no one will ever think of looking for us here we must get busy at once and fix it up  even then whitefoot didnt understand always he had lived either in a hole in the ground or in a hollow stump or tree how they were to live in that old nest he couldnt see at all    chapter xxix making over an old house     a home is always what you make it    with love there you will neer forsake it     whitefoot  whitefoot climbed up to the old nest of melody the wood thrush over the edge of which little mrs whitefoot was looking down at him it took whitefoot hardly a moment to get up there for the nest was only a few feet above the ground in a young tree and you know whitefoot is a very good climber  he found mrs whitefoot very much excited she was delighted with that old nest and she showed it for his part whitefoot couldnt see anything but a deserted old house of no use to any one to be sure it had been a very good home in its time it had been made of tiny twigs stalks of old weeds leaves little fine roots and mud it was still quite solid and was firmly fixed in a crotch of the young tree but whitefoot couldnt see how it could be turned into a home for a mouse he said as much  little mrs whitefoot became more excited than ever you dear old stupid said she whatever is the matter with you dont you see that all we need do is to put a roof on make an entrance on the under side and make a soft comfortable bed inside to make it a delightful home  i dont see why we dont make a new home altogether protested whitefoot it seems to me that hollow stub of mine is ever so much better than this that has good solid walls and we wont have to do a thing to it  i told you once before that it doesnt suit me for summer replied little mrs whitefoot rather sharply because she was beginning to lose patience it will be all right for winter but winter is a long way off it may suit you for summer but it doesnt suit me and this place does so this is where we are going to live  certainly my dear certainly replied whitefoot very meekly if you want to live here here we will live but i must confess it isnt clear to me yet how we are going to make a decent home out of this old nest  dont you worry about that replied mrs whitefoot you can get the material and ill attend to the rest let us waste no time about it i am anxious to get our home finished and to feel a little bit settled i have already planned just what has got to be done and how we will do it now you go look for some nice soft dry weed stalks and strips of soft bark and moss and any other soft tough material that you can find just get busy and dont stop to talk  of course whitefoot did as he was told he ran down to the ground and began to hunt for the things mrs whitefoot wanted he was very particular about it he still didnt think much of her idea of making over that old home of melodys but if she would do it he meant that she should have the very best of materials to do it with  so back and forth from the ground to the old nest in the tree whitefoot hurried and presently there was quite a pile of weed stalks and soft grass and strips of bark in the old nest mrs whitefoot joined whitefoot in hunting for just the right things but she spent more time in arranging the material over that old nest she made a fine high roof down through the lower side she cut a little round doorway just big enough for them to pass through unless you happened to be underneath looking up you never would have guessed there was an entrance at all inside was a snug round room and in this she made the softest and most comfortable of beds as it began to look more and more like a home whitefoot himself became as excited and eager as mrs whitefoot had been from the beginning it certainly is going to be a fine home said whitefoot  didnt i tell you it would be retorted mrs whitefoot    chapter xxx the whitefoots enjoy their new home     no home is ever mean or poor    where love awaits you at the door     whitefoot  there said mrs whitefoot as she worked a strip of white birch bark into the roof of the new home she and whitefoot had been building out of the old home of melody the wood thrush this finishes the roof i dont think any water will get through it even in the hardest rain  it is wonderful declared whitefoot admiringly wherever did you learn to build such a house as this  from my mother replied mrs whitefoot i was born in just such a home it makes the finest kind of a home for wood mouse babies  you dont think there is danger that the wind will blow it down do you ventured whitefoot  of course i dont retorted little mrs whitefoot scornfully hasnt this old nest remained right where it is for over a year do you suppose that if i had thought there was the least bit of danger that it would blow down i would have used it do credit me with a little sense my dear  yesm i do replied whitefoot meekly you are the most sensible person in all the great world i wasnt finding fault you see i have always lived in a hole in the ground or a hollow stump or a hole in a tree and i have not yet become used to a home that moves about and rocks as this one does when the wind blows but if you say it is all right why of course it is all right probably i will get used to it after awhile  whitefoot did get used to it after living in it for a few days it no longer seemed strange and he no longer minded its swaying when the wind blew the fact is he rather enjoyed it so whitefoot and mrs whitefoot settled down to enjoy their new home now and then they added a bit to it here and there  somehow whitefoot felt unusually safe safer than he had ever felt in any of his other homes you see he had seen several feathered folk alight close to it and not give it a second look he knew that they had seen that home but had mistaken it for what it had once been the deserted home of one of their own number  whitefoot had chuckled he had chuckled long and heartily if they make that mistake said he to himself everybody else is likely to make it that home of ours is right in plain sight yet i do believe it is safer than the best hidden home i ever had before shadow the weasel never will think of climbing up this little tree to look at an old nest and shadow is the one i am most afraid of  it was only a day or two later that buster bear happened along that way now buster is very fond of tender wood mouse more than once whitefoot had had a narrow escape from busters big claws as they tore open an old stump or dug into the ground after him he saw buster glance up at the new home without the slightest interest in those shrewd little eyes of his then buster shuffled on to roll over an old log and lick up the ants he found under it again whitefoot chuckled yes sir said he it is the safest home i ve ever had  so whitefoot and little mrs whitefoot were very happy in the home which they had built and for once in his life whitefoot did very little worrying life seemed more beautiful than it had ever been before and he almost forgot that there was such a thing as a hungry enemy    chapter xxxi whitefoot is hurt     the hurts that hardest are to bear    come from those for whom we care     whitefoot  whitefoot was hurt yes sir whitefoot was hurt he was very much hurt it wasnt a bodily hurt it was an inside hurt it was a hurt that made his heart ache and to make it worse he couldnt understand it at all one evening he had been met at the little round doorway by little mrs whitefoot  you cant come in said she  why cant i demanded whitefoot in the greatest surprise  never mind why you cant and that is all there is to it replied mrs whitefoot  you mean i cant ever come in any more asked whitefoot  i dont know about that replied mrs whitefoot but you cant come in now nor for some time i think the best thing you can do is to go back to your old home in the hollow stub  whitefoot stared at little mrs whitefoot quite as if he thought she had gone crazy then he lost his temper i guess ill come in if i want to said he this home is quite as much my home as it is yours you have no right to keep me out of it just you get out of my way  but little mrs whitefoot didnt get out of his way and do what he would whitefoot couldnt get in you see she quite filled that little round doorway finally he had to give up trying three times he came back and each time he found little mrs whitefoot in the doorway and each time she drove him away finally for lack of any other place to go to he returned to his old home in the old stub once he had thought this the finest home possible but now somehow it didnt suit him at all the truth is he missed little mrs whitefoot and so what had once been a home was now only a place in which to hide and sleep  whitefoots anger did not last long it was replaced by that hurt feeling he felt that he must have done something little mrs whitefoot did not like but though he thought and thought he couldnt remember a single thing several times he went back to see if mrs whitefoot felt any differently but found she didnt finally she told him rather sharply to go away and stay away after that whitefoot didnt venture over to the new home he would sometimes sit a short distance away and gaze at it longingly all the joy had gone out of the beautiful springtime for him he was quite as unhappy as he had been before he met little mrs whitefoot you see he was even more lonely than he had been then and added to this loneliness was that hurt feeling which made it ever and ever so much worse it was very hard to bear  if i could understand it it wouldnt be so bad he kept saying over and over again to himself but i dont understand it i dont understand why mrs whitefoot doesnt love me any more    chapter xxxii the surprise     surprises sometimes are so great    youre tempted to believe in fate     whitefoot  one nevertobe forgotten evening whitefoot met mrs whitefoot and she invited him to come back to their home of course whitefoot was delighted  shhh said little mrs whitefoot as whitefoot entered the snug little room of the house they had built in the old nest of melody the wood thrush whitefoot hesitated in the first place it was dark in there in the second place he had the feeling that somehow that little bedroom seemed crowded it hadnt been that way the last time he was there mrs whitefoot was right in front of him and she seemed very much excited about something  presently she crowded to one side come here and look said she  whitefoot looked in the middle of a soft bed of moss was a squirming mass of legs and funny little heads at first that was all whitefoot could make out  dont you think this is the most wonderful surprise that ever was whispered little mrs whitefoot arent they darlings arent you proud of them  by this time whitefoot had made out that that squirming mass of legs and heads was composed of baby mice he counted them there were four whose are they and what are they doing here whitefoot asked in a queer voice  why you old stupid they are yoursyours and mine declared little mrs whitefoot did you ever ever see such beautiful babies now i guess you understand why i kept you away from here  whitefoot shook his head no said he i dont understand at all i dont see yet what you drove me away for  why you blessed old dear there wasnt room for you when those babies came i had to have all the room there was it wouldnt have done to have had you running in and out and disturbing them when they were so tiny i had to be alone with them and that is why i made you go off and live by yourself i am so proud of them i dont know what to do arent you proud whitefoot arent you the proudest wood mouse in all the green forest  of course whitefoot should have promptly said that he was but the truth is whitefoot wasnt proud at all you see he was so surprised that he hadnt yet had time to feel that they were really his in fact just then he felt a wee bit jealous of them it came over him that they would take all the time and attention of little mrs whitefoot so whitefoot didnt answer that question he simply sat and stared at those four squirming babies  finally little mrs whitefoot gently pushed him out and followed him of course said she there isnt room for you to stay here now you will have to sleep in your old home because there isnt room in here for both of us and the babies too  whitefoots heart sank he had thought that he was to stay and that everything would be just as it had been before cant i come over here any more he asked rather timidly  what a foolish question cried little mrs whitefoot of course you can you will have to help take care of these babies just as soon as they are big enough you will have to help teach them how to hunt for food and how to watch out for danger and all the things that a wise wood mouse knows why they couldnt get along without you neither could i she added softly  at that whitefoot felt better and suddenly there was a queer swelling in his heart it was the beginning of pride pride in those wonderful babies  you have given me the best surprise that ever was my dear said whitefoot softly now i think i will go and look for some supper  so now we will leave whitefoot and his family you see there are two very lively little people of the green forest who demand attention and insist on having it they are buster bears twins and this is to be the title of the next book
