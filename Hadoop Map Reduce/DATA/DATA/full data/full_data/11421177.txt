11421177	twice told tales                        the seven vagabonds                       by nathaniel hawthorne    rambling on foot in the spring of my life and the summer of the year i came one afternoon to a point which gave me the choice of three directions  straight before me the main road extended its dusty length to boston on the left a branch went towards the sea and would have lengthened my journey a trifle of twenty or thirty miles while by the righthand path i might have gone over hills and lakes to canada visiting in my way the celebrated town of stamford  on a level spot of grass at the foot of the guidepost appeared an object which though locomotive on a different principle reminded me of gullivers portable mansion among the brobdignags  it was a huge covered wagon or more properly a small house on wheels with a door on one side and a window shaded by green blinds on the other  two horses munching provender out of the baskets which muzzled them were fastened near the vehicle a delectable sound of music proceeded from the interior and i immediately conjectured that this was some itinerant show halting at the confluence of the roads to intercept such idle travellers as myself  a shower had long been climbing up the western sky and now hung so blackly over my onward path that it was a point of wisdom to seek shelter here  halloo  who stands guard here  is the doorkeeper asleep cried i approaching a ladder of two or three steps which was let down from the wagon  the music ceased at my summons and there appeared at the door not the sort of figure that i had mentally assigned to the wandering showman but a most respectable old personage whom i was sorry to have addressed in so free a style  he wore a snuff colored coat and smallclothes with whitetop boots and exhibited the mild dignity of aspect and manner which may often be noticed in aged schoolmasters and sometimes in deacons selectmen or other potentates of that kind a small piece of silver was my passport within his premises where i found only one other person hereafter to be described  this is a dull day for business said the old gentleman as he ushered me in but i merely tarry here to refresh the cattle being bound for the campmeeting at stamford  perhaps the movable scene of this narrative is still peregrinating new england and may enable the reader to test the accuracy of my description  the spectaclefor i will not use the unworthy term of puppetshowconsisted of a multitude of little people assembled on a miniature stage  among them were artisans of every kind in the attitudes of their toil and a group of fair ladies and gay gentlemen standing ready for the dance a company of footsoldiers formed a line across the stage looking stern grim and terrible enough to make it a pleasant consideration that they were but three inches high and conspicuous above the whole was seen a merryandrew in the pointed cap and motley coat of his profession  all the inhabitants of this mimic world were motionless like the figures in a picture or like that people who one moment were alive in the midst of their business and delights and the next were transformed to statues preserving an eternal semblance of labor that was ended and pleasure that could be felt no more  anon however the old gentleman turned the handle of a barrelorgan the first note of which produced a most enlivening effect upon the figures and awoke them all to their proper occupations and amusements  by the selfsame impulse the tailor plied his needle the blacksmiths hammer descended upon the anvil and the dancers whirled away on feathery tiptoes the company of soldiers broke into platoons retreated from the stage and were succeeded by a troop of horse who came prancing onward with such a sound of trumpets and trampling of hoofs as might have startled don quixote himself while an old toper of inveterate ill habits uplifted his black bottle and took off a hearty swig  meantime the merryandrew began to caper and turn somersets shaking his sides nodding his head and winking his eyes in as lifelike a manner as if he were ridiculing the nonsense of all human affairs and making fun of the whole multitude beneath him  at length the old magician for i compared the showman to prospero entertaining his guests with a mask of shadows paused that i might give utterance to my wonder  what an admirable piece of work is this exclaimed i lifting up my bands in astonishment  indeed i liked the spectacle and was tickled with the old mans gravity as he presided at it for i had none of that foolish wisdom which reproves every occupation that is not useful in this world of vanities  if there be a faculty which i possess more perfectly than most men it is that of throwing myself mentally into situations foreign to my own and detecting with a cheerful eye the desirable circumstances of each  i could have envied the life of this grayheaded showman spent as it had been in a course of safe and pleasurable adventure in driving his huge vehicle sometimes through the sands of cape cod and sometimes over the rough forest roads of the north and east and halting now on the green before a village meetinghouse and now in a paved square of the metropolis  how often must his heart have been gladdened by the delight of children as they viewed these animated figures  or his pride indulged by haranguing learnedly to grown men on the mechanical powers which produced such wonderful effects or his gallantry brought into play for this is an attribute which such grave men do not lack by the visits of pretty maidens  and then with how fresh a feeling must he return at intervals to his own peculiar home  i would i were assured of as happy a life as his thought i though the showmans wagon might have accommodated fifteen or twenty spectators it now contained only himself and me and a third person at whom i threw a glance on entering  he was a neat and trim young man of two or three and twenty his drab hat and green frockcoat with velvet collar were smart though no longer new while a pair of green spectacles that seemed needless to his brisk little eyes gave him something of a scholarlike and literary air  after allowing me a sufficient time to inspect the puppets he advanced with a bow and drew my attention to some books in a corner of the wagon  these he forthwith began to extol with an amazing volubility of wellsounding words and an ingenuity of praise that won him my heart as being myself one of the most merciful of critics  indeed his stock required some considerable powers of commendation in the salesman there were several ancient friends of mine the novels of those happy days when my affections wavered between the scottish chiefs and thomas thumb besides a few of later date whose merits had not been acknowledged by the public  i was glad to find that dear little venerable volume the new england primer looking as antique as ever though in its thousandth new edition a bundle of superannuated gilt picturebooks made such a child of me that partly for the glittering covers and partly for the fairytales within i bought the whole and an assortment of ballads and popular theatrical songs drew largely on my purse  to balance these expenditures i meddled neither with sermons nor science nor morality though volumes of each were there nor with a life of franklin in the coarsest of paper but so showily bound that it was emblematical of the doctor himself in the court dress which he refused to wear at paris nor with websters spelling book nor some of byrons minor poems nor half a dozen little testaments at twentyfive cents each  thus far the collection might have been swept from some great bookstore or picked up at an evening auctionroom but there was one small bluecovered pamphlet which the peddler handed me with so peculiar an air that i purchased it immediately at his own price and then for the first time the thought struck me that i had spoken face to face with the veritable author of a printed book  the literary man now evinced a great kindness for me and i ventured to inquire which way he was travelling  o said he i keep company with this old gentleman here and we are moving now towards the campmeeting at stamford  he then explained to me that for the present season he had rented a corner of the wagon as a bookstore which as he wittily observed was a true circulating library since there were few parts of the country where it had not gone its rounds  i approved of the plan exceedingly and began to sum up within my mind the many uncommon felicities in the life of a bookpeddler especially when his character resembled that of the individual before me  at a high rate was to be reckoned the daily and hourly enjoyment of such interviews as the present in which he seized upon the admiration of a passing stranger and made him aware that a man of literary taste and even of literary achievement was travelling the country in a showmans wagon  a more valuable yet not infrequent triumph might be won in his conversation with some elderly clergyman long vegetating in a rocky woody watery back settlement of new england who as he recruited his library from the peddlers stock of sermons would exhort him to seek a college education and become the first scholar in his class  sweeter and prouder yet would be his sensations when talking poetry while he sold spellingbooks he should charm the mind and haply touch the heart of a fair country schoolmistress herself an unhonored poetess a wearer of blue stockings which none but himself took pains to look at  but the scene of his completest glory would be when the wagon had halted for the night and his stock of books was transferred to some crowded barroom then would he recommend to the multifarious company whether traveller from the city or teamster from the hills or neighboring squire or the landlord himself or his loutish hostler works suited to each particular taste and capacity proving all the while by acute criticism and profound remark that the lore in his books was even exceeded by that in his brain  thus happily would he traverse the land sometimes a herald before the march of mind sometimes walking arm in arm with awful literature and reaping everywhere a harvest of real and sensible popularity which the secluded bookworms by whose toil he lived could never hope for  if ever i meddle with literature thought i fixing myself in adamantine resolution it shall be as a travelling bookseller  though it was still midafternoon the air had now grown dark about us and a few drops of rain came down upon the roof of our vehicle pattering like the feet of birds that had flown thither to rest  a sound of pleasant voices made us listen and there soon appeared halfway up the ladder the pretty person of a young damsel whose rosy face was so cheerful that even amid the gloomy light it seemed as if the sunbeams were peeping under her bonnet  we next saw the dark and handsome features of a young man who with easier gallantry than might have been expected in the heart of yankeeland was assisting her into the wagon  it became immediately evident to us when the two strangers stood within the door that they were of a profession kindred to those of my companions and i was delighted with the more than hospitable the even paternal kindness of the old showmans manner as he welcomed them while the man of literature hastened to lead the merryeyed girl to a seat on the long bench  you are housed but just in time my young friends said the master of the wagon  the sky would have been down upon you within five minutes  the young mans reply marked him as a foreigner not by any variation from the idiom and accent of good english but because he spoke with more caution and accuracy than if perfectly familiar with the language  we knew that a shower was hanging over us said he and consulted whether it were best to enter the house on the top of yonder hill but seeing your wagon in the road  we agreed to come hither interrupted the girl with a smile because we should be more at home in a wandering house like this  i meanwhile with many a wild and undetermined fantasy was narrowly inspecting these two doves that had flown into our ark the young man tall agile and athletic wore a mass of black shining curls clustering round a dark and vivacious countenance which if it had not greater expression was at least more active and attracted readier notice than the quiet faces of our countrymen  at his first appearance he had been laden with a neat mahogany box of about two feet square but very light in proportion to its size which he had immediately unstrapped from his shoulders and deposited on the floor of the wagon  the girl had nearly as fair a complexion as our own beauties and a brighter one than most of them the lightness of her figure which seemed calculated to traverse the whole world without weariness suited well with the glowing cheerfulness of her face and her gay attire combining the rainbow hues of crimson green and a deep orange was as proper to her lightsome aspect as if she had been born in it  this gay stranger was appropriately burdened with that mirthinspiring instrument the fiddle which her companion took from her hands and shortly began the process of tuning  neither of usthe previous company of the wagonneeded to inquire their trade for this could be no mystery to frequenters of brigademusters ordinations cattleshows commencements and other festal meetings in our sober land and there is a dear friend of mine who will smile when this page recalls to his memory a chivalrous deed performed by us in rescuing the showbox of such a couple from a mob of great doublefisted countrymen  come said i to the damsel of gay attire shall we visit all the wonders of the world together  she understood the metaphor at once though indeed it would not much have troubled me if she had assented to the literal meaning of my words  the mahogany box was placed in a proper position and i peeped in through its small round magnifying window while the girl sat by my side and gave short descriptive sketches as one after another the pictures were unfolded to my view  we visited together at least our imaginations did full many a famous city in the streets of which i had long yearned to tread once i remember we were in the harbor of barcelona gazing townwards next she bore me through the air to sicily and bade me look up at blazing aetna then we took wing to venice and sat in a gondola beneath the arch of the rialto and anon she sat me down among the thronged spectators at the coronation of napoleon but there was one scene its locality she could not tell which charmed my attention longer than all those gorgeous palaces and churches because the fancy hammed me that i myself the preceding summer had beheld just such a humble meetinghouse in just such a pinesurrounded nook among our own green mountains all these pictures were tolerably executed though far inferior to the girls touches of description nor was it easy to comprehend how in so few sentences and these as i supposed in a language foreign to her she contrived to present an airy copy of each varied scene  when we had travelled through the vast extent of the mahogany box i looked into my guides face  where are you going my pretty maid  inquired i in the words of an old song  ah said the gay damsel you might as well ask where the summer wind is going  we are wanderers here and there and everywhere wherever there is mirth our merry hearts are drawn to it  today indeed the people have told us of a great frolic and festival in these parts so perhaps we may be needed at what you call the campmeeting at stamford  then in my happy youth and while her pleasant voice yet sounded in my ears i sighed for none but myself i thought should have been her companion in a life which seemed to realize my own wild fancies cherished all through visionary boyhood to that hour to these two strangers the world was in its golden age not that indeed it was less dark and sad than ever but because its weariness and sorrow had no community with their ethereal nature wherever they might appear in their pilgrimage of bliss youth would echo back their gladness carestricken maturity would rest a moment from its toil and age tottering among the graves would smile in withered joy for their sakes  the lonely cot the narrow and gloomy street the sombre shade would catch a passing gleam like that now shining on ourselves as these bright spirits wandered by  blessed pair whose happy home was throughout all the earth  i looked at my shoulders and thought them broad enough to sustain those pictured towns and mountains mine too was an elastic foot as tireless as the wing of the bird of paradise mine was then an untroubled heart that would have gone singing on its delightful way  o maiden said i aloud why did you not come hither alone  while the merry girl and myself were busy with the showbox the unceasing rain had driven another wayfarer into the wagon  he seemed pretty nearly of the old showmans age but much smaller leaner and more withered than he and less respectably clad in a patched suit of gray withal he had a thin shrewd countenance and a pair of diminutive gray eyes which peeped rather too keenly out of their puckered sockets  this old fellow had been joking with the showman in a manner which intimated previous acquaintance but perceiving that the damsel and i had terminated our affairs he drew forth a folded document and presented it to me  as i had anticipated it proved to be a circular written in a very fair and legible hand and signed by several distinguished gentlemen whom i had never heard of stating that the bearer had encountered every variety of misfortune and recommending him to the notice of all charitable people  previous disbursements had left me no more than a fivedollar bill out of which however i offered to make the beggar a donation provided he would give me change for it  the object of my beneficence looked keenly in my face and discerned that i had none of that abominable spirit characteristic though it be of a fullblooded yankee which takes pleasure in detecting every little harmless piece of knavery  why perhaps said the ragged old mendicant if the bank is in good standing i cant say but i may have enough about me to change your bill  it is a bill of the suffolk bank said i and better than the specie  as the beggar had nothing to object he now produced a small buffleather bag tied up carefully with a shoestring  when this was opened there appeared a very comfortable treasure of silver coins of all sorts and sizes and i even fancied that i saw gleaming among them the golden plumage of that rare bird in our currency the american eagle  in this precious heap was my bank note deposited the rate of exchange being considerably against me  his wants being thus relieved the destitute man pulled out of his pocket an old pack of greasy cards which had probably contributed to fill the buff leather bag in more ways than one  come said he i spy a rare fortune in your face and for twentyfive cents more ill tell you what it is  i never refuse to take a glimpse into futurity so after shuffling the cards and when the fair damsel had cut them i dealt a portion to the prophetic beggar  like others of his profession before predicting the shadowy events that were moving on to meet me he gave proof of his preternatural science by describing scenes through which i had already passed  here let me have credit for a sober fact  when the old man had read a page in his book of fate he bent his keen gray eyes on mine and proceeded to relate in all its minute particulars what was then the most singular event of my life  it was one which i had no purpose to disclose till the general unfolding of all secrets nor would it be a much stranger instance of inscrutable knowledge or fortunate conjecture if the beggar were to meet me in the street today and repeat word for word the page which i have here written the fortuneteller after predicting a destiny which time seems loath to make good put up his cards secreted his treasurebag and began to converse with the other occupants of the wagon  well old friend said the showman you have not yet told us which way your face is turned this afternoon  i am taking a trip northward this warm weather replied the conjurer across the connecticut first and then up through vermont and may be into canada before the fall  but i must stop and see the breaking up of the campmeeting at stamford  i began to think that all the vagrants in new england were converging to the campmeeting and had made this wagon their rendezvous by the way  the showman now proposed that when the shower was over they should pursue the road to stamford together it being sometimes the policy of these people to form a sort of league and confederacy  and the young lady too observed the gallant bibliopolist bowing to her profoundly and this foreign gentleman as i understand are on a jaunt of pleasure to the same spot  it would add incalculably to my own enjoyment and i presume to that of my colleague and his friend if they could be prevailed upon to join our party  this arrangement met with approbation on all hands nor were any of those concerned more sensible of its advantages than myself who had no title to be included in it  having already satisfied myself as to the several modes in which the four others attained felicity i next set my mind at work to discover what enjoyments were peculiar to the old   straggler as the people of the country would have termed the wandering mendicant and prophet as he pretended to familiarity with the devil so i fancied that he was fitted to pursue and take delight in his way of life by possessing some of the mental and moral characteristics the lighter and more comic ones of the devil in popular stories among them might be reckoned a love of deception for its own sake a shrewd eye and keen relish for human weakness and ridiculous infirmity and the talent of petty fraud  thus to this old man there would be pleasure even in the consciousness so insupportable to some minds that his whole life was a cheat upon the world and that so far as he was concerned with the public his little cunning had the upper hand of its united wisdom  every day would furnish him with a succession of minute and pungent triumphs as when for instance his importunity wrung a pittance out of the heart of a miser or when my silly goodnature transferred a part of my slender purse to his plump leather bag or when some ostentatious gentleman should throw a coin to the ragged beggar who was richer than himself or when though he would not always be so decidedly diabolical his pretended wants should make him a sharer in the scanty living of real indigence  and then what an inexhaustible field of enjoyment both as enabling him to discern so much folly and achieve such quantities of minor mischief was opened to his sneering spirit by his pretensions to prophetic knowledge  all this was a sort of happiness which i could conceive of though i had little sympathy with it  perhaps had i been then inclined to admit it i might have found that the roving life was more proper to him than to either of his companions for satan to whom i had compared the poor man has delighted ever since the time of job in wandering up and down upon the earth and indeed a crafty disposition which operates not in deeplaid plans but in disconnected tricks could not have an adequate scope unless naturally impelled to a continual change of scene and society  my reflections were here interrupted  another visitor exclaimed the old showman  the door of the wagon had been closed against the tempest which was roaring and blustering with prodigious fury and commotion and beating violently against our shelter as if it claimed all those homeless people for its lawful prey while we caring little for the displeasure of the elements sat comfortably talking  there was now an attempt to open the door succeeded by a voice uttering some strange unintelligible gibberish which my companions mistook for greek and i suspected to be thieves latin  however the showman stepped forward and gave admittance to a figure which made me imagine either that our wagon had rolled back two hundred years into past ages or that the forest and its old inhabitants had sprung up around us by enchantment  it was a red indian armed with his bow and arrow  his dress was a sort of cap adorned with a single feather of some wild bird and a frock of blue cotton girded tight about him on his breast like orders of knighthood hung a crescent and a circle and other ornaments of silver while a small crucifix betokened that our father the pope had interposed between the indian and the great spirit whom he had worshipped in his simplicity  this son of the wilderness and pilgrim of the storm took his place silently in the midst of us when the first surprise was over i rightly conjectured him to be one of the penobscot tribe parties of which i had often seen in their summer excursions down our eastern rivers  there they paddle their birch canoes among the coasting schooners and build their wigwam beside some roaring milldam and drive a little trade in basketwork where their fathers hunted deer  our new visitor was probably wandering through the country towards boston subsisting on the careless charity of the people while he turned his archery to profitable account by shooting at cents which were to be the prize of his successful aim  the indian had not long been seated ere our merry damsel sought to draw him into conversation  she indeed seemed all made up of sunshine in the mouth of may for there was nothing so dark and dismal that her pleasant mind could not cast a glow over it and the wild indian like a firtree in his native forest soon began to brighten into a sort of sombre cheerfulness  at length she inquired whether his journey had any particular end or purpose  i go shoot at the campmeeting at stamford replied the indian  and here are five more said the girl all aiming at the campmeeting too  you shall be one of us for we travel with light hearts and as for me i sing merry songs and tell merry tales and am full of merry thoughts and i dance merrily along the road so that there is never any sadness among them that keep me company  but o you would find it very dull indeed to go all the way to stamford alone  my ideas of the aboriginal character led me to fear that the indian would prefer his own solitary musings to the gay society thus offered him on the contrary the girls proposal met with immediate acceptance and seemed to animate him with a misty expectation of enjoyment  i now gave myself up to a course of thought which whether it flowed naturally from this combination of events or was drawn forth by a wayward fancy caused my mind to thrill as if i were listening to deep music  i saw mankind in this weary old age of the world either enduring a sluggish existence amid the smoke and dust of cities or if they breathed a purer air still lying down at night with no hope but to wear out tomorrow and all the tomorrows which make up life among the same dull scenes and in the same wretched toil that had darkened the sunshine of today  but there were some full of the primeval instinct who preserved the freshness of youth to their latest years by the continual excitement of new objects new pursuits and new associates and cared little though their birthplace might have been here in new england if the grave should close over them in central asia  fate was summoning a parliament of these free spirits unconscious of the impulse which directed them to a common centre they had come hither from far and near and last of all appeared the representative of those mighty vagrants who had chased the deer during thousands of years and were chasing it now in the spirit land  wandering down through the waste of ages the woods had vanished around his path his arm had lost somewhat of its strength his foot of its fleetness his mien of its wild regality his heart and mind of their savage virtue and uncultured force but here untamable to the routine of artificial life roving now along the dusty road as of old over the forest leaves here was the indian still  well said the old showman in the midst of my meditations here is an honest company of usone two three four five sixall going to the campmeeting at stamford  now hoping no offence i should like to know where this young gentleman may be going  i started  how came i among these wanderers  the free mind that preferred its own folly to anothers wisdom the open spirit that found companions everywhere above all the restless impulse that had so often made me wretched in the midst of enjoyments these were my claims to be of their society  my friends cried i stepping into the centre of the wagon i am going with you to the campmeeting at stamford  but in what capacity asked the old showman after a moments silence  all of us here can get our bread in some creditable way every honest man should have his livelihood  you sir as i take it are a mere strolling gentleman  i proceeded to inform the company that when nature gave me a propensity to their way of life she had not left me altogether destitute of qualifications for it though i could not deny that my talent was less respectable and might be less profitable than the meanest of theirs  my design in short was to imitate the storytellers of whom oriental travellers have told us and become an itinerant novelist reciting my own extemporaneous fictions to such audiences as i could collect  either this said i is my vocation or i have been born in vain  the fortuneteller with a sly wink to the company proposed to take me as an apprentice to one or other of his professions either of which undoubtedly would have given full scope to whatever inventive talent i might possess  the bibliopolist spoke a few words in opposition to my plan influenced partly i suspect by the jealousy of authorship and partly by an apprehension that the viva voce practice would become general among novelists to the infinite detriment of the booktrade dreading a rejection i solicited the interest of the merry damsel  mirth cried i most aptly appropriating the words of lallegro to thee i sue  mirth admit me of thy crew  let us indulge the poor youth said mirth with a kindness which made me love her dearly though i was no such coxcomb as to misinterpret her motives  i have espied much promise in him true a shadow sometimes flits across his brow but the sunshine is sure to follow in a moment  he is never guilty of a sad thought but a merry one is twin born with it  we will take him with us and you shall see that he will set us all alaughing before we reach the campmeeting at stamford  her voice silenced the scruples of the rest and gained me admittance into the league according to the terms of which without a community of goods or profits we were to lend each other all the aid and avert all the harm that might be in our power  this affair settled a marvellous jollity entered into the whole tribe of us manifesting itself characteristically in each individual  the old showman sitting down to his barrelorgan stirred up the souls of the pygmy people with one of the quickest tunes in the musicbook tailors blacksmiths gentlemen and ladies all seemed to share in the spirit of the occasion and the merryandrew played his part more facetiously than ever nodding and winking particularly at me  the young foreigner flourished his fiddlebow with a masters hand and gave an inspiring echo to the showmans melody  the bookish man and the merry damsel started up simultaneously to dance the former enacting the double shuffle in a style which everybody must have witnessed ere election week was blotted out of time while the girl setting her arms akimbo with both hands at her slim waist displayed such light rapidity of foot and harmony of varying attitude and motion that i could not conceive how she ever was to stop imagining at the moment that nature had made her as the old showman had made his puppets for no earthly purpose but to dance jigs  the indian bellowed forth a succession of most hideous outcries somewhat afrighting us till we interpreted them as the warsong with which in imitation of his ancestors he was prefacing the assault on stamford  the conjurer meanwhile sat demurely in a corner extracting a sly enjoyment from the whole scene and like the facetious merry andrew directing his queer glance particularly at me  as for myself with great exhilaration of fancy i began to arrange and color the incidents of a tale wherewith i proposed to amuse an audience that very evening for i saw that my associates were a little ashamed of me and that no time was to be lost in obtaining a public acknowledgment of my abilities  come fellowlaborers at last said the old showman whom we had elected president the shower is over and we must be doing our duty by these poor souls at stamford  well come among them in procession with music and dancing cried the merry damsel  accordinglyfor it must be understood that our pilgrimage was to be performed on footwe sallied joyously out of the wagon each of us even the old gentleman in his whitetop boots giving a great skip as we came down the ladder  above our heads there was such a glory of sunshine and splendor of clouds and such brightness of verdure below that as i modestly remarked at the time nature seemed to have washed her face and put on the best of her jewelry and a fresh green gown in honor of our confederation  casting our eyes northward we beheld a horseman approaching leisurely and splashing through the little puddles on the stamford road  onward he came sticking up in his saddle with rigid perpendicularity a tall thin figure in rusty black whom the showman and the conjurer shortly recognized to be what his aspect sufficiently indicated a travelling preacher of great fame among the methodists  what puzzled us was the fact that his face appeared turned from instead of to the campmeeting at stamford  however as this new votary of the wandering life drew near the little green space where the guidepost and our wagon were situated my six fellowvagabonds and myself rushed forward and surrounded him crying out with united voices  what news what news from the campmeeting at stamford  the missionary looked down in surprise at as singular a knot of people as could have been selected from all his heterogeneous auditors  indeed considering that we might all be classified under the general head of vagabond there was great diversity of character among the grave old showman the sly prophetic beggar the fiddling foreigner and his merry damsel the smart bibliopolist the sombre indian and myself the itinerant novelist a slender youth of eighteen  i even fancied that a smile was endeavoring to disturb the iron gravity of the preachers mouth  good people answered he the campmeeting is broke up  so saying the methodist minister switched his steed and rode westward  our union being thus nullified by the removal of its object we were sundered at once to the four winds of heaven the fortuneteller giving a nod to all and a peculiar wink to me departed on his northern tour chuckling within himself as he took the stamford road  the old showman and his literary coadjutor were already tackling their horses to the wagon with a design to peregrinate southwest along the seacoast  the foreigner and the merry damsel took their laughing leave and pursued the eastern road which i had that day trodden as they passed away the young man played a lively strain and the girls happy spirit broke into a dance and thus dissolving as it were into sunbeams and gay music that pleasant pair departed from my view  finally with a pensive shadow thrown across my mind yet emulous of the light philosophy of my late companions i joined myself to the penobscot indian and set forth towards the distant city
