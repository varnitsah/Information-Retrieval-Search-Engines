7390735	the american claimant  by mark twain    1892   explanatory  the colonel mulberry sellers here reintroduced to the public is the same person who appeared as eschol sellers in the first edition of the tale entitled the gilded age years ago and as beriah sellers in the subsequent editions of the same book and finally as mulberry sellers in the drama played afterward by john t raymond  the name was changed from eschol to beriah to accommodate an eschol sellers who rose up out of the vasty deeps of uncharted space and preferred his requestbacked by threat of a libel suitthen went his way appeased and came no more  in the play beriah had to be dropped to satisfy another member of the race and mulberry was substituted in the hope that the objectors would be tired by that time and let it pass unchallenged  so far it has occupied the field in peace therefore we chance it again feeling reasonably safe this time under shelter of the statute of limitations  mark twain hartford 1891       the weather in this book  no weather will be found in this book  this is an attempt to pull a book through without weather  it being the first attempt of the kind in fictitious literature it may prove a failure but it seemed worth the while of some daredevil person to try it and the author was in just the mood  many a reader who wanted to read a tale through was not able to do it because of delays on account of the weather  nothing breaks up an authors progress like having to stop every few pages to fussup the weather  thus it is plain that persistent intrusions of weather are bad for both reader and author  of course weather is necessary to a narrative of human experience that is conceded  but it ought to be put where it will not be in the way where it will not interrupt the flow of the narrative  and it ought to be the ablest weather that can be had not ignorant poorquality amateur weather  weather is a literary specialty and no untrained hand can turn out a good article of it  the present author can do only a few trifling ordinary kinds of weather and he cannot do those very good so it has seemed wisest to borrow such weather as is necessary for the book from qualified and recognized expertsgiving credit of course this weather will be found over in the back part of the book out of the way  see appendix  the reader is requested to turn over and help himself from time to time as he goes along     chapter i  it is a matchless morning in rural england  on a fair hill we see a majestic pile the ivied walls and towers of cholmondeley castle huge relic and witness of the baronial grandeurs of the middle ages  this is one of the seats of the earl of rossmore k g g c b k c m g etc etc etc etc etc who possesses twentytwo thousand acres of english land owns a parish in london with two thousand houses on its leaseroll and struggles comfortably along on an income of two hundred thousand pounds a year  the father and founder of this proud old line was william the conqueror his very self the mother of it was not inventoried in history by name she being merely a random episode and inconsequential like the tanners daughter of falaise  in a breakfast room of the castle on this breezy fine morning there are two persons and the cooling remains of a deserted meal  one of these persons is the old lord tall erect squareshouldered whitehaired sternbrowed a man who shows character in every feature attitude and movement and carries his seventy years as easily as most men carry fifty  the other person is his only son and heir a dreamyeyed young fellow who looks about twentysix but is nearer thirty  candor kindliness honesty sincerity simplicity modestyit is easy to see that these are cardinal traits of his character and so when you have clothed him in the formidable components of his name you somehow seem to be contemplating a lamb in armor his name and style being the honourable kirkcudbright llanover marjorihanks sellers viscountberkeley of cholmondeley castle warwickshire  pronounced kkoobry thlanover marshbanks sellers vycount barkly of chumly castle warrikshr he is standing by a great window in an attitude suggestive of respectful attention to what his father is saying and equally respectful dissent from the positions and arguments offered  the father walks the floor as he talks and his talk shows that his temper is away up toward summer heat  softspirited as you are berkeley i am quite aware that when you have once made up your mind to do a thing which your ideas of honor and justice require you to do argument and reason are for the time being wasted upon youyes and ridicule persuasion supplication and command as well  to my mind  father if you will look at it without prejudice without passion you must concede that i am not doing a rash thing a thoughtless wilful thing with nothing substantial behind it to justify it  i did not create the american claimant to the earldom of rossmore i did not hunt for him did not find him did not obtrude him upon your notice he found himself he injected himself into our lives  and has made mine a purgatory for ten years with his tiresome letters his wordy reasonings his acres of tedious evidence  which you would never read would never consent to read  yet in common fairness he was entitled to a hearing  that hearing would either prove he was the rightful earlin which case our course would be plainor it would prove that he wasntin which case our course would be equally plain  i have read his evidences my lord  i have conned them well studied them patiently and thoroughly  the chain seems to be complete no important link wanting  i believe he is the rightful earl  and i a usurperanameless pauper a tramp  consider what you are saying sir  father if he is the rightful earl would you could youthat fact being establishedconsent to keep his titles and his properties from him a day an hour a minute  you are talking nonsensenonsenselurid idiotcy  now listen to me i will make a confessionif you wish to call it by that name  i did not read those evidences because i had no occasion toi was made familiar with them in the time of this claimants father and of my own father forty years ago  this fellows predecessors have kept mine more or less familiar with them for close upon a hundred and fifty years  the truth is the rightful heir did go to america with the fairfax heir or about the same timebut disappearedsomewhere in the wilds of virginia got married end began to breed savages for the claimant market wrote no letters home was supposed to be dead his younger brother softly took possession presently the american did die and straightway his eldest product put in his claimby letterletter still in existenceand died before the uncle inpossession found timeor maybe inclinationto answer  the infant son of that eldest product grew uplong interval you seeand he took to writing letters and furnishing evidences  well successor after successor has done the same down to the present idiot it was a succession of paupers not one of them was ever able to pay his passage to england or institute suit  the fairfaxes kept their lordship alive and so they have never lost it to this day although they live in maryland their friend lost his by his own neglect  you perceive now that the facts in this case bring us to precisely this result morally the american tramp is rightful earl of rossmore legally he has no more right than his dog  there noware you satisfied  there was a pause then the son glanced at the crest carved in the great oaken mantel and said with a regretful note in his voice  since the introduction of heraldic symbolsthe motto of this house has been suum cuiqueto every man his own  by your own intrepidly frank confession my lord it is become a sarcasm if simon lathers  keep that exasperating name to yourself  for ten years it has pestered my eyeand tortured my ear till at last my very footfalls time themselves to the brainracking rhythm of simon latherssimon lathers simon lathers  and now to make its presence in my soul eternal immortal imperishable you have resolved totowhat is it you have resolved to do  to go to simon lathers in america and change places with him  what  deliver the reversion of the earldom into his hands  that is my purpose  make this tremendous surrender without even trying the fantastic case in the lords  yes with hesitation and some embarrassment  by all that is amazing i believe you are insane my son  see here have you been training with that ass againthat radical if you prefer the term though the words are synonymouslord tanzy of tollmache  the son did not reply and the old lord continued  yes you confess  that puppy that shame to his birth and caste who holds all hereditary lordships and privilege to be usurpation all nobility a tinsel sham all aristocratic institutions a fraud all inequalities in rank a legalized crime and an infamy and no bread honest bread that a man doesnt earn by his own workwork pahand the old patrician brushed imaginary labordirt from his white hands  you have come to hold just those opinions yourself supposehe added with a sneer  a faint flush in the younger mans cheek told that the shot had hit and hurt but he answered with dignity  i have  i say it without shamei feel none  and now my reason for resolving to renounce my heirship without resistance is explained i wish to retire from what to me is a false existence a false position and begin my life over againbegin it rightbegin it on the level of mere manhood unassisted by factitious aids and succeed or fail by pure merit or the want of it  i will go to america where all men are equal and all have an equal chance i will live or die sink or swim win or lose as just a manthat alone and not a single helping gaud or fiction back of it  hear hear  the two men looked each other steadily in the eye a moment or two then the elder one added musingly absolutely crazyabsolutely  after another silence he said as one who long troubled by clouds detects a ray of sunshine well there will be one satisfactionsimon lathets will come here to enter into his own and i will drown him in the horsepond  that poor devilalways so humble in his letters so pitiful so deferential so steeped in reverence for our great line and loftystation so anxious to placate us so prayerful for recognition as a relative a bearer in his veins of our sacred blood and withal so poor so needy so threadbare and paupershod as to raiment so despised so laughed at for his silly claimantship by the lewd american scum around himah the vulgar crawling insufferable tramp  to read one of his cringing nauseating letterswell  this to a splendid flunkey all in inflamed plush and buttons and kneebreeches as to his trunk and a glinting white frostwork of groundglass paste as to his head who stood with his heels together and the upper half of him bent forward a salver in his

fool but plainly this new ones a maniac  what a name  mulberry sellerstheres music for you simon lathersmulberry sellersmulberry sellerssimon lathers  sounds like machinery working and churning  simon lathers mulberry selare you going  if i have your leave father  the old gentleman stood musing some time after his son was gone  this was his thought  he is a good boy and lovable  let him take his own courseas it would profit nothing to oppose himmake things worse in fact  my arguments and his aunts persuasions have failed let us see what america can do for us  let us see what equality and hardtimes can effect for the mental health of a brainsick young british lord  going to renounce his lordship and be a man  yas     chapter ii  colonel mulberry sellersthis was some days before he wrote his letter to lord rossmorewas seated in his library which was also his drawingroom and was also his picture gallery and likewise his workshop  sometimes he called it by one of these names sometimes by another according to occasion and circumstance  he was constructing what seemed to be some kind of a frail mechanical toy and was apparently very much interested in his work  he was a whiteheaded man now but otherwise he was as young alert buoyant visionary and enterprising as ever  his loving old wife sat near by contentedly knitting and thinking with a cat asleep in her lap  the room was large light and had a comfortable look in fact a homelike look though the furniture was of a humble sort and not over abundant and the knickknacks and things that go to adorn a livingroom not plenty and not costly  but there were natural flowers and there was an abstract and unclassifiable something about the place which betrayed the presence in the house of somebody with a happy taste and an effective touch  even the deadly chromos on the walls were somehow without offence in fact they seemed to belong there and to add an attraction to the room a fascination anyway for whoever got his eye on one of them was like to gaze and suffer till he diedyou have seen that kind of pictures some of these terrors were landscapes some libeled the sea some were ostensible portraits all were crimes  all the portraits were recognizable as dead americans of distinction and yet through labeling added by a daring hand they were all doing duty here as earls of rossmore  the newest one had left the works as andrew jackson but was doing its best now as simon lathers lord rossmore present earl on one wall was a cheap old railroad map of warwickshire  this had been newly labeled the rossmore estates  on the opposite wall was another map and this was the most imposing decoration of the establishment and the first to catch a strangers attention because of its great size it had once borne simply the title siberia but now the word future had been written in front of that word  there were other additions in red inkmany cities with great populations set down scattered over the vastcountry at points where neither cities nor populations exist today one of these cities with population placed at 1500000 bore the name libertyorloffskoizalinski and there was a still more populous one centrally located and marked capital which bore the name freedomolovnaivanovich  the mansionthe colonels usual name for the housewas a rickety old twostory frame of considerable size which had been painted some time or other but had nearly forgotten it  it was away out in the ragged edge of washington and had once been somebodys country place  it had a neglected yard around it with a paling fence that needed straightening up in places and a gate that would stay shut  by the doorpost were several modest tin signs  col mulberry sellers attorney at law and claim agent was the principal one  one learned from the others that the colonel was a materializer a hypnotizer a mindcure dabbler and so on  for he was a man who could always find things to do  a whiteheaded negro man with spectacles and damaged white cotton gloves appeared in the presence made a stately obeisance and announced  marse washington hawkins suh  great scott  show him in danl show him in  the colonel and his wife were on their feet in a moment and the next moment were joyfully wringing the hands of a stoutish discouragedlooking man whose general aspect suggested that he was fifty years old but whose hair swore to a hundred  well well well washington my boy it is good to look at you again sit down sit down and make yourself at home  there nowwhy you look perfectly natural aging a little just a little but youd have known him anywhere wouldnt you polly  oh yes berry hes just like his pa would have looked if hed lived dear dear where have you dropped from  let me see how long is it since  i should say its all of fifteen years mrs  sellers  well well how time does get away with us  yes and oh the changes that  there was a sudden catch of her voice and a trembling of the lip the men waiting reverently for her to get command of herself and go on but after a little struggle she turned away with her apron to her eyes and softly disappeared  seeing you made her think of the children poor thingdear dear theyre all dead but the youngest  but banish care its no time for it nowon with the dance let joy be unconfined is my motto whether theres any dance to dance or any joy to unconfineyoull be the healthier for it every timeevery time washingtonits my experience and ive seen a good deal of this world comewhere have you disappeared to all these years and are you from there now or where are you from  i dont quite think you would ever guess colonel  cherokee strip  my land  sure as you live  you cant mean it  actually living out there  well yes if a body may call it that though its a pretty strong term for dobies and jackass rabbits boiled beans and slapjacks depression withered hopes poverty in all its varieties  louise out there  yes and the children  out there now  yes i couldnt afford to bring them with me  oh i seeyou had to comeclaim against the government  make yourself perfectly easyill take care of that  but it isnt a claim against the government  no  want to be postmaster  thats all right  leave it to me  ill fix it  but it isnt postmasteryoure all astray yet  well good gracious washington why dont you come out and tell me what it is  what do you want to be so reserved and distrustful with an old friend like me for  dont you reckon i can keep a se  theres no secret about ityou merely dont give me a chance to  now look here old friend i know the human race and i know that when a man comes to washington i dont care if its from heaven let alone cherokeestrip its because he wants something  and i know that as a rule hes not going to get it that hell stay and tryfor another thing and wont get that the same luck with the next and the next and the next and keeps on till he strikes bottom and is too poor and ashamed to go back even to cherokee strip and at last his heart breaksand they take up a collection and bury him  theredont interrupt me i know what im talking about  happy and prosperous in the far west wasnt i you know that  principal citizen of hawkeye looked up to by everybody kind of an autocrat actually a kind of an autocrat washington  well nothing would do but i must go minister to st james the governor and everybody insisting you know and so at last i consentedno getting out of it had to do it so here i came  a day too late washington  think of thatwhat little things change the worlds historyyes sir the place had been filled  well there i was you see  i offered to compromise and go to paris  the president was very sorry and all that but that place you see didnt belong to the west so there i was again there was no help for it so i had to stoop a littlewe all reach the day some time or other when weve got to do that washington and its not a bad thing for us either take it by and large and all around i had to stoop a little and offer to take constantinople  washington consider thisfor its perfectly truewithin a month i asked for china within another month i begged for japan one year later i was away down down down supplicating with tears and anguish for the bottom office in the gift of the government of the united statesflintpicker in the cellars of the war department  and by george i didnt get it  flintpicker  yes  office established in the time of the revolution last century the musketflints for the military posts were supplied from the capitol they do it yet for although the flintarm has gone out and the forts have tumbled down the decree hasnt been repealedbeen overlooked and forgotten you seeand so the vacancies where old ticonderoga and others used to stand still get their six quarts of gunflints a year just the same  washington said musingly after a pause  how strange it seemsto start for minister to england at twenty thousand a year and fail for flintpicker at  three dollars a week  its human life washingtonjust an epitome of human ambition and struggle and the outcome you aim for the palace and get drowned in the sewer  there was another meditative silence  then washington said with earnest compassion in his voice  and so after coming here against your inclination to satisfy your sense of patriotic duty and appease a selfish public clamor you get absolutely nothing for it  nothing  the colonel had to get up and stand to get room for his amazement to expand  nothing washington  i ask you this to be a perpetual member and the only perpetual member of a diplomatic body accredited to the greatest country on earth do you call that nothing  it was washingtons turn to be amazed  he was stricken dumb but the wideeyed wonder the reverent admiration expressed in his face were more eloquent than any words could have been  the colonels wounded spirit was healed and he resumed his seat pleased and content  he leaned forward and said impressively  what was due to a man who had become forever conspicuous by an experience without precedent in the history of the worlda man made permanently and diplomatically sacred so to speak by having been connected temporarily through solicitation with every single diplomatic post in the roster of this government from envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the court of st james all the way down to consul to a guano rock in the straits of sundasalary payable in guanowhich disappeared by volcanic convulsion the day before they got down to my name in the list of applicants  certainly something august enough to be answerable to the size of this unique and memorable experience was my due and i got it  by the common voice of this community by acclamation of the people that mighty utterance which brushes aside laws and legislation and from whose decrees there is no appeal i was named perpetual member of the diplomatic body representing the multifarious sovereignties and civilizations of the globe near the republican court of the united states of america  and they brought me home with a torchlight procession  it is wonderful colonel simply wonderful  its the loftiest official position in the whole earth  i should think soand the most commanding  you have named the word  think of it  i frown and there is war i smile and contending nations lay down their arms  it is awful  the responsibility i mean  it is nothing  responsibility is no burden to me i am used to it have always been used to it  and the workthe work  do you have to attend all the sittings  who i  does the emperor of russia attend the conclaves of the governors of the provinces  he sits at home and indicates his pleasure  washington was silent a moment then a deep sigh escaped him  how proud i was an hour ago how paltry seems my little promotion now colonel the reason i came to washington isi am congressional delegate from cherokee strip  the colonel sprang to his feet and broke out with prodigious enthusiasm  give me your hand my boythis is immense news  i congratulate you with all my heart  my prophecies stand confirmed  i always said it was in you  i always said you were born for high distinction and would achieve it  you ask polly if i didnt  washington was dazed by this most unexpected demonstration  why colonel theres nothing to it  that little narrow desolate unpeopled oblong streak of grass and gravel lost in the remote wastes of the vast continentwhy its like representing a billiard tablea discarded one  tuttut its a great its a staving preferment and just opulent with influence here  shucks colonel i havent even a vote  thats nothing you can make speeches  no i cant  the populations only two hundred  thats all right thats all right  and they hadnt any right to elect me were not even a territory theres no organic act the government hasnt any official knowledge of us whatever  never mind about that ill fix that  ill rush the thing through ill get you organized in no time  will you colonelits too good of you but its just your old sterling self the same old everfaithful friend and the grateful tears welled up in washingtons eyes  its just as good as done my boy just as good as done  shake hands well hitch teams together you and i and well make things hum    chapter iii  mrs sellers returned now with her composure restored and began to ask after hawkinss wife and about his children and the number of them and so on and her examination of the witness resulted in a circumstantial history of the familys ups and downs and driftings to and fro in the far west during the previous fifteen years  there was a message now from out back and colonel sellers went out there in answer to it  hawkins took this opportunity to ask how the world had been using the colonel during the past halfgeneration  oh its been using him just the same it couldnt change its way of using him if it wanted to for he wouldnt let it  i can easily believe that mrs  sellers  yes you see he doesnt change himselfnot the least little bit in the worldhes always mulberry sellers  i can see that plain enough  just the same old scheming generous goodhearted moonshiny hopeful noaccount failure he always was and still everybody likes him just as well as if he was the shiningest success  they always did and it was natural because he was so obliging and accommodating and had something about him that made it kind of easy to ask help of him or favorsyou didnt feel shy you know or have that wishyoudidnthavetotry feeling that you have with other people  its just so yet and a body wonders at it too because hes been shamefully treated many times by people that had used him for a ladder to climb up by and then kicked him down when they didnt need him any more  for a time you can see hes hurt his prides wounded because he shrinks away from that thing and dont want to talk about itand so i used to think now hes learned something and hell be more careful hereafterbut laws in a couple of weeks hes forgotten all about it and any selfish tramp out of nobody knows where can come and put up a poor mouth and walk right into his heart with his boots on  it must try your patience pretty sharply sometimes  oh no im used to it and id rather have him so than the other way when i call him a failure i mean to the world hes a failure he isnt to me  i dont know as i want him different much different anyway i have to scold him some snarl at him you might even call it but i reckon id do that just the same if he was differentits my make but im a good deal less snarly and more contented when hes a failure than i am when he isnt  then he isnt always a failure said hawking brightening  him  oh bless you no  he makes a strike as he calls it from time to time  thens my time to fret and fuss  for the money just flies first come first served  straight off he loads up the house with cripples and idiots and stray cats and all the different kinds of poor wrecks that other people dont want and he does and then when the poverty comes again ive got to clear the most of them out or wed starve and that distresses him and me the same of course  heres old danl and old jinny that the sheriff sold south one of the times that we got bankrupted before the warthey came wandering back after the peace worn out and used up on the cotton plantations helpless and not another lick of work left in their old hides for the rest of this earthly pilgrimageand we so pinched oh so pinched for the very crumbs to keep life in us and he just flung the door wide and the way he received them youd have thought they had come straight down from heaven in answer to prayer  i took him one side and said mulberry we cant have themweve nothing for ourselveswe cant feed them he looked at me kind of hurt and said turn them outand theyve come to me just as confident and trusting asaswhy polly i must have bought that confidence sometime or other a long time ago and given my note so to speakyou dont get such things as a giftand how am i going to go back on a debt like that  and you see theyre so poor and old and friendless and  but i was ashamed by that time and shut him off and somehow felt a new courage in me and so i said softly well keep themthe lord will provide  he was glad and started to blurt out one of those overconfident speeches of his but checked himself in time and said humbly i will anyway  it was years and years and years ago  well you see those old wrecks are here yet  but dont they do your housework  laws  the idea  they would if they could poor old things and perhaps they think they do do some of it  but its a superstition  danl waits on the front door and sometimes goes on an errand and sometimes youll see one or both of them letting on to dust around in herebut thats because theres something they want to hear about and mix their gabble into  and theyre always around at meals for the same reason  but the fact is we have to keep a young negro girl just to take care of them and a negro woman to do the housework and help take care of them  well they ought to be tolerably happy i should think  its no name for it  they quarrel together pretty much all the time most always about religion because danls a dunker baptist and jinnys a shouting methodist and jinny believes in special providences and danl dont because he thinks hes a kind of a freethinkerand they play and sing plantation hymns together and talk and chatter just eternally and forever and are sincerely fond of each other and think the world of mulberry and he puts up patiently with all their spoiled ways and foolishness and soah well theyre happy enough if it comes to that and i dont mindive got used to it  i can get used to anything with mulberry to help and the fact is i dont much care what happens so long as hes spared to me  well heres to him and hoping hell make another strike soon  and rake in the lame the halt and the blind and turn the house into a hospital again  its what he would do  ive seen aplenty of that and more  no washington i want his strikes to be mighty moderate ones the rest of the way down the vale  well then big strike or little strike or no strike at all heres hoping hell never lack for friendsand i dont reckon he ever will while theres people around who know enough to  him lack for friends and she tilted her head up with a frank pride why washington you cant name a man thats anybody that isnt fond of him  ill tell you privately that ive had satans own time to keep them from appointing him to some office or other  they knew hed no business with an office just as well as i did but hes the hardest man to refuse anything to a body ever saw  mulberry sellers with an office laws goodness you know what that would be like  why theyd come from the ends of the earth to see a circus like that  id just as lieves be married to niagara falls and done with it  after a reflective pause she addedhaving wandered back in the interval to the remark that had been her text friendsoh indeed no man ever had more and such friends grant sherman sheridan johnston longstreet leemanys the time theyve sat in that chair youre sitting in hawkins was out of it instantly and contemplating it with a reverential surprise and with the awed sense of having trodden shod upon holy ground  they he said  oh indeed yes a many and a many a time  he continued to gaze at the chair fascinated magnetized and for once in his life that continental stretch of dry prairie which stood for his imagination was afire and across it was marching a slanting flamefront that joined its wide horizons together and smothered the skies with smoke  he was experiencing what one or another drowsing geographically ignorant alien experiences every day in the year when he turns a dull and indifferent eye out of the car window and it falls upon a certain stationsign which reads stratfordonavon mrs  sellers went gossiping comfortably along  oh they like to hear him talk especially if their load is getting rather heavy on one shoulder and they want to shift it  hes all air you knowbreeze you may sayand he freshens them up its a trip to the country they say  many a time hes made general grant laughand thats a tidy job i can tell you and as for sheridan his eye lights up and he listens to mulberry sellers the same as if he was artillery you see the charm about mulberry is he is so catholic and unprejudiced that he fits in anywhere and everywhere  it makes him powerful good company and as popular as scandal  you go to the white house when the presidents holding a general receptionsometime when mulberrys there why dear me you cant tell which of them it is thats holding that reception  well he certainly is a remarkable manand he always was  is he religious  clear to his marrowdoes more thinking and reading on that subject than any other except russia and siberia thrashes around over the whole field too nothing bigoted about him  what is his religion  he she stopped and was lost for a moment or two in thinking then she said with simplicity i think he was a mohammedan or something last week  washington started down town now to bring his trunk for the hospitable sellerses would listen to no excuses their house must be his home during the session  the colonel returned presently and resumed work upon his plaything  it was finished when washington got back  there it is said the colonel all finished  what is it for colonel  oh its just a trifle  toy to amuse the children  washington examined it  it seems to be a puzzle  yes thats what it is  i call it pigs in the clover  put them insee if you can put them in the pen  after many failures washington succeeded and was as pleased as a child  its wonderfully ingenious colonel its ever so clever and interestingwhy i could play with it all day  what are you going to do with it  oh nothing  patent it and throw it aside  dont you do anything of the kind  theres money in that thing  a compassionate look traveled over the colonels countenance and he said  moneyyes pin money a couple of hundred thousand perhaps  not more  washingtons eyes blazed  a couple of hundred thousand dollars  do you call that pin money  the colonel rose and tiptoed his way across the room closed a door that was slightly ajar tiptoed his way to his seat again and said under his breath  you can keep a secret  washington nodded his affirmative he was too awed to speak  you have heard of materializationmaterialization of departed spirits  washington had heard of it  and probably didnt believe in it and quite right too  the thing as practised by ignorant charlatans is unworthy of attention or respect where theres a dim light and a dark cabinet and a parcel of sentimental gulls gathered together with their faith and their shudders and their tears all ready and one and the same fatty degeneration of protoplasm and humbug comes out and materializes himself into anybody you want grandmother grandchild brotherinlaw witch of endor john milton siamese twins peter the great and all such frantic nonsenseno that is all foolish and pitiful  but when a man that is competent brings the vast powers of science to bear its a different matter a totally different matter you see  the spectre that answers that call has come to stay  do you note the commercial value of that detail  well ithethe truth is that i dont quite know that i do  do you mean that such being permanent not transitory would give more general satisfaction and so enhance the priceof tickets to the show  show  follylisten to me and get a good grip on your breath for you are going to need it  within three days i shall have completed my method and thenlet the world stand aghast for it shall see marvels washington within three daysten at the outsideyou shall see me call the dead of any century and they will arise and walk  walkthey shall walk forever and never die again  walk with all the muscle and spring of their pristine vigor  colonel  indeed it does take ones breath away  now do you see the money thats in it  imwell imnot really sure that i do  great scott look here  i shall have a monopoly theyll all belong to me wont they  two thousand policemen in the city of new york  wages four dollars a day  ill replace them with dead ones at half the money  oh prodigious  i never thought of that  four thousand dollars a day  now i do begin to see  but will dead policemen answer  havent theyup to this time  well if you put it that way  put it any way you want to  modify it to suit yourself and my lads shall still be superior  they wont eat they wont drinkdont need those things they wont wink for cash at gambling dens and unlicensed rumholes they wont spark the scullery maids and moreover the bands of toughs that ambuscade them on lonely beats and cowardly shoot and knife them will only damage the uniforms and not live long enough to get more than a momentary satisfaction out of that  why colonel if you can furnish policemen then of course  certainlyi can furnish any line of goods thats wanted  take the army for instancenow twentyfive thousand men expense twentytwo millions a year  i will dig up the romans i will resurrect the greeks i will furnish the government for ten millions a year ten thousand veterans drawn from the victorious legions of all the agessoldiers that will chase indians year in and year out on materialized horses and cost never a cent for rations or repairs  the armies of europe cost two billions a year nowi will replace them all for a billion  i will dig up the trained statesmen of all ages and all climes and furnish this country with a congress that knows enough to come in out of the rain a thing thats never happened yet since the declaration of independence and never will happen till these practically dead people are replaced with the genuine article  i will restock the thrones of europe with the best brains and the best morals that all the royal sepulchres of all the centuries can furnishwhich isnt promising very muchand ill divide the wages and the civil list fair and square merely taking my half and  colonel if the half of this is true theres millions in itmillions  billions in itbillions thats what you mean  why look here the thing is so close at hand so imminent so absolutely immediate that if a man were to come to me now and say colonel i am a little short and if you could lend me a couple of billion dollars forcome in  this in answer to a knock  an energetic looking man bustled in with a big pocketbook in his hand took a paper from it and presented it with the curt remark  seventeenth and last callyou want to out with that three dollars and forty cents this time without fail colonel mulberry sellers  the colonel began to slap this pocket and that one and feel here and there and everywhere muttering  what have i done with that walletlet me seeumnot here not there oh i must have left it in the kitchen ill just run and  no you wontyoull stay right where you are  and youre going to disgorge toothis time  washington innocently offered to go and look  when he was gone the colonel said  the fact is ive got to throw myself on your indulgence just this once more suggs you see the remittances i was expecting  hang the remittancesits too staleit wont answer  come  the colonel glanced about him in despair  then his face lighted he ran to the wall and began to dust off a peculiarly atrocious chromo with his handkerchief  then he brought it reverently offered it to the collector averted his face and said  take it but dont let me see it go  its the sole remaining rembrandt that  rembrandt be damned its a chromo  oh dont speak of it so i beg you  its the only really great original the only supreme example of that mighty school of art which  art  its the sickest looking thing i  the colonel was already bringing another horror and tenderly dusting it  take this one toothe gem of my collectionthe only genuine fra angelico that  illuminated liverpad thats what it is  give it heregood day people will think ive robbed a nigger barbershop  as he slammed the door behind him the colonel shouted with an anguished accent  do please cover them updont let the damp get at them  the delicate tints in the angelico  but the man was gone  washington reappeared and said he had looked everywhere and so had mrs sellers and the servants but in vain and went on to say he wished he could get his eye on a certain man about this timeno need to hunt up that pocketbook then  the colonels interest was awake at once  what man  onearmed pete they call him out thereout in the cherokee country i mean  robbed the bank in tahlequah  do they have banks in tahlequah  yesa bank anyway  he was suspected of robbing it  whoever did it got away with more than twenty thousand dollars  they offered a reward of five thousand  i believe i saw that very man on my way east  nois that so  i certainly saw a man on the train the first day i struck the railroad that answered the description pretty exactlyat least as to clothes and a lacking arm  why dont you get him arrested and claim the reward  i couldnt  i had to get a requisition of course  but i meant to stay by him till i got my chance  well  well he left the train during the night some time  oh hang it thats too bad  not so very bad either  why  because he came down to baltimore in the very train i was in though i didnt know it in time  as we moved out of the station i saw him going toward the iron gate with a satchel in his hand  good well catch him  lets lay a plan  send description to the baltimore police  why what are you talking about  no  do you want them to get the reward  what shall we do then  the colonel reflected  ill tell you  put a personal in the baltimore sun  word it like this       a drop me a line pete  hold on  which arm has he lost  the right  good  now then  a drop me a line pete even if you have to write with your left hand address x y z general postoffice washington  from you know who  therethatll fetch him  but he wont know whowill he  no but hell want to know wont he  why certainlyi didnt think of that  what made you think of it  knowledge of human curiosity  strong trait very strong trait  now ill go to my room and write it out and enclose a dollar and tell them to print it to the worth of that     chapter iv  the day wore itself out  after dinner the two friends put in a long and harassing evening trying to decide what to do with the five thousand dollars reward which they were going to get when they should find onearmed pete and catch him and prove him to be the right person and extradite him and ship him to tahlequah in the indian territory  but there were so many dazzling openings for ready cash that they found it impossible to make up their minds and keep them made up  finally mrs sellers grew very weary of it all and said  what is the sense in cooking a rabbit before its caught  then the matter was dropped for the time being and all went to bed next morning being persuaded by hawkins the colonel made drawings and specifications and went down and applied for a patent for his toy puzzle and hawkins took the toy itself and started out to see what chance there might be to do something with it commercially  he did not have to go far  in a small old wooden shanty which had once been occupied as a dwelling by some humble negro family he found a keeneyed yankee engaged in repairing cheap chairs and other secondhand furniture  this man examined the toy indifferently attempted to do the puzzle found it not so easy as he had expected grew more interested and finally emphatically so achieved a success at last and asked  is it patented  patent applied for  that will answer  what do you want for it  what will it retail for  well twentyfive cents i should think  what will you give for the exclusive right  i couldnt give twenty dollars if i had to pay cash down but ill tell you what ill do ill make it and market it and pay you five cents royalty on each one  washington sighed  another dream disappeared no money in the thing so he said  all right take it at that  draw me a paper  he went his way with the paper and dropped the matter out of his mind dropped it out to make room for further attempts to think out the most promising way to invest his half of the reward in case a partnership investment satisfactory to both beneficiaries could not be hit upon  he had not been very long at home when sellers arrived sodden with grief and booming with glad excitementworking both these emotions successfully sometimes separately sometimes together  he fell on hawkinss neck sobbing and said  oh mourn with me my friend mourn for my desolate house death has smitten my last kinsman and i am earl of rossmorecongratulate me  he turned to his wife who had entered while this was going on put his arms about her and saidyou will bear up for my sake my ladyit had to happen it was decreed  she bore up very well and said  its no great loss  simon lathers was a poor wellmeaning useless thing and no account and his brother never was worth shucks  the rightful earl continued  i am too much prostrated by these conflicting griefs and joys to be able to concentrate my mind upon affairs i will ask our good friend here to break the news by wire or post to the lady gwendolen and instruct her to  what lady gwendolen  our poor daughter who alas  sally sellers  mulberry sellers are you losing your mind  thereplease do not forget who you are and who i am remember your own dignity be considerate also of mine  it were best to cease from using my family name now lady rossmore  goodness gracious well i never  what am i to call you then  in private the ordinary terms of endearment will still be admissible to some degree but in public it will be more becoming if your ladyship will speak to me as my lord or your lordship and of me as rossmore or the earl or his lordship and  oh scat  i cant ever do it berry  but indeed you must my lovewe must live up to our altered position and submit with what grace we may to its requirements  well all right have it your own way ive never set my wishes against your commands yet mulmy lord and its late to begin now though to my mind its the rottenest foolishness that ever was  spoken like my own true wife  there kiss and be friends again  butgwendolen  i dont know how i am ever going to stand that name why a body wouldnt know sally sellers in it  its too large for her kind of like a cherub in an ulster and its a most outlandish sort of a name anyway to my mind  youll not hear her find fault with it my lady  thats a true word  she takes to any kind of romantic rubbish like she was born to it  she never got it from me thats sure  and sending her to that silly college hasnt helped the matter anyjust the other way  now hear her hawkins  rowenaivanhoe college is the selectest and most aristocratic seat of learning for young ladies in our country  under no circumstances can a girl get in there unless she is either very rich and fashionable or can prove four generations of what may be called american nobility  castellated collegebuildingstowers and turrets and an imitation moatand everything about the place named out of sir walter scotts books and redolent of royalty and state and style and all the richest girls keep phaetons and coachmen in livery and ridinghorses with english grooms in plug hats and tightbuttoned coats and topboots and a whiphandle without any whip to it to ride sixtythree feet behind them  and they dont learn a blessed thing washington hawkins not a single blessed thing but showy rubbish and unamerican pretentiousness  but send for the lady gwendolendo for i reckon the peerage regulations require that she must come home and let on to go into seclusion and mourn for those arkansas blatherskites shes lost  my darling  blatherskites  remembernoblesse oblige  there theretalk to me in your own tongue rossyou dont know any other and you only botch it when you try  oh dont stareit was a slip and no crime customs of a lifetime cant be dropped in a second rossmorethere now be appeased and go along with you and attend to gwendolen  are you going to write washingtonor telegraph  he will telegraph dear  i thought as much my lady muttered as she left the room  wants it so the address will have to appear on the envelop  it will just make a fool of that child  shell get it of course for if there are any other sellerses there theyll not be able to claim it  and just leave her alone to show it around and make the most of it  well maybe shes forgivable for that  shes so poor and theyre so rich of course shes had her share of snubs from the liveryflunkey sort and i reckon its only human to want to get even  uncle danl was sent with the telegram for although a conspicuous object in a corner of the drawingroom was a telephone hanging on a transmitter washington found all attempts to raise the central office vain  the colonel grumbled something about its being always out of order when youve got particular and especial use for it  but he didnt explain that one of the reasons for this was that the thing was only a dummy and hadnt any wire attached to it  and yet the colonel often used itwhen visitors were presentand seemed to get messages through it  mourning paper and a seal were ordered then the friends took a rest  next afternoon while hawkins by request draped andrew jacksons portrait with crape the rightful earl wrote off the family bereavement to the usurper in englanda letter which we have already read  he also by letter to the village authorities at duffys corners arkansas gave order that the remains of the late twins be embalmed by some st louis expert and shipped at once to the usurperwith bill  then he drafted out the rossmore arms and motto on a great sheet of brown paper and he and hawkins took it to hawkinss yankee furnituremender and at the end of an hour came back with a couple of stunning hatchments which they nailed up on the front of the houseattractions calculated to draw and they did for it was mainly an idle and shiftless negro neighborhood with plenty of ragged children and indolent dogs to spare for a point of interest like that and keep on sparing them for it days and days together  the new earl foundwithout surprisethis society item in the evening paper and cut it out and scrapbooked it       by a recent bereavement our esteemed fellow citizen colonel      mulberry sellers perpetual memberatlarge of the diplomatic body      succeeds as rightful lord to the great earldom of rossmore third      by order of precedence in the earldoms of great britain and will      take early measures by suit in the house of lords to wrest the      title and estates from the present usurping holder of them  until      the season of mourning is past the usual thursday evening      receptions at rossmore towers will be discontinued  lady rossmores commentto herself  receptions  people who dont rightly know him may think he is commonplace but to my mind he is one of the most unusual men i ever saw as for suddenness and capacity in imagining things his beat dont exist i reckon  as like as not it wouldnt have occurred to anybody else to name this poor old rattrap rossmore towers but it just comes natural to him  well no doubt its a blessed thing to have an imagination that can always make you satisfied no matter how you are fixed  uncle dave hopkins used to always say turn me into john calvin and i want to know which place im going to turn me into mulberry sellers and i dont care  the rightful earls commentto himself  its a beautiful name beautiful  pity i didnt think of it before i wrote the usurper  but ill be ready for him when he answers     chapter v  no answer to that telegram no arriving daughter  yet nobody showed any uneasiness or seemed surprised that is nobody but washington  after three days of waiting he asked lady rossmore what she supposed the trouble was  she answered tranquilly  oh its some notion of hers you never can tell  shes a sellers all throughat least in some of her ways and a sellers cant tell you beforehand what hes going to do because he dont know himself till hes done it  shes all right no occasion to worry about her  when shes ready shell come or shell write and you cant tell which till its happened  it turned out to be a letter  it was handed in at that moment and was received by the mother without trembling hands or feverish eagerness or any other of the manifestations common in the case of long delayed answers to imperative telegrams  she polished her glasses with tranquility and thoroughness pleasantly gossiping along the while then opened the letter and began to read aloud                           kenilworth keep redgauntlet hall                          rowenaivanhoe college thursday       dear precious mamma rossmore       oh the joy of ityou cant think  they had always turned up      their noses at our pretentions you know and i had fought back as      well as i could by turning up mine at theirs  they always said it      might be something great and fine to be rightful shadow of an      earldom but to merely be shadow of a shadow and two or three times      removed at thatpoohpooh  and i always retorted that not to be      able to show four generations of americancolonialdutch peddler      andsaltcodmcallisternobility might be endurable but to have to      confess such an originpfewfew  well the telegram it was just a      cyclone  the messenger came right into the great rob roy hall of      audience as excited as he could be singing out dispatch for lady      gwendolen sellers and you ought to have seen that simpering      chattering assemblage of pinchbeck aristocrats turn to stone      i was off in the corner of course by myselfits where cinderella      belongs  i took the telegram and read it and tried to faintand i      could have done it if i had had any preparation but it was all so      sudden you knowbut no matter i did the next best thing i put my      handkerchief to my eyes and fled sobbing to my room dropping the      telegram as i started  i released one corner of my eye a moment      just enough to see the herd swarm for the telegramand then      continued my brokenhearted flight just as happy as a bird       then the visits of condolence began and i had to accept the loan of      miss augustatempletonashmore hamiltons quarters because the press      was so great and there isnt room for three and a cat in mine  and      ive been holding a lodge of sorrow ever since and defending myself      against peoples attempts to claim kin  and do you know the very      first girl to fetch her tears and sympathy to my market was that      foolish skimperton girl who has always snubbed me so shamefully and      claimed lordship and precedence of the whole college because some      ancestor of hers some time or other was a mcallister  why it was      like the bottom bird in the menagerie putting on airs because its      head ancestor was a pterodactyl       but the gerreatest triumph of all wasguess  but youll never      this is it  that little fool and two others have always been      fussing and fretting over which was entitled to precedenceby rank      you know  theyve nearly starved themselves at it for each claimed      the right to take precedence of all the college in leaving the      table and so neither of them ever finished her dinner but broke      off in the middle and tried to get out ahead of the others  well      after my first days grief and seclusioni was fixing up a mourning      dress you seei appeared at the public table again and thenwhat      do you think  those three fluffy goslings sat there contentedly      and squared up the long faminelapped and lapped munched and      munched ate and ate till the gravy appeared in their eyeshumbly      waiting for the lady gwendolen to take precedence and move out      first you see       oh yes ive been having a darling good time  and do you know not      one of these collegians has had the cruelty to ask me how i came by      my new name  with some this is due to charity but with the others      it isnt  they refrain not from native kindness but from educated      discretion  i educated them       well as soon as i shall have settled up whats left of the old      scores and snuffed up a few more of those pleasantly intoxicating      clouds of incense i shall pack and depart homeward  tell papa i      am as fond of him as i am of my new name  i couldnt put it      stronger than that  what an inspiration it was  but inspirations      come easy to him                      these from your loving daughter                                         gwendolen   hawkins reached for the letter and glanced over it  good hand he said and full of confidence and animation and goes racing right along  shes brightthats plain  oh theyre all brightthe sellerses  anyway they would be if there were any  even those poor latherses would have been bright if they had been sellerses i mean full blood  of course they had a sellers strain in thema big strain of it toobut being a bland dollar dont make it a dollar just the same  the seventh day after the date of the telegram washington came dreaming down to breakfast and was set wide awake by an electrical spasm of pleasure  here was the most beautiful young creature he had ever seen in his life it was sally sellers lady gwendolen she had come in the night  and it seemed to him that her clothes were the prettiest and the daintiest he had ever looked upon and the most exquisitely contrived and fashioned and combined as to decorative trimmings and fixings and melting harmonies of color  it was only a morning dress and inexpensive but he confessed to himself in the english common to cherokee strip that it was a corker  and now as he perceived the reason why the sellers household poverties and sterilities had been made to blossom like the rose and charm the eye and satisfy the spirit stood explained here was the magician here in the midst of her works and furnishing in her own person the proper accent and climaxing finish of the whole  my daughter major hawkinscome home to mourn flown home at the call of affliction to help the authors of her being bear the burden of bereavement  she was very fond of the late earlidolized him sir idolized him  why father ive never seen him  trueshes right i was thinking of anothererof her mother  i idolized that smoked haddockthat sentimental spiritless  i was thinking of myself  poor noble fellow we were inseparable com  hear the man  mulberry selmulrossmorehang the troublesome name i can neverif ive heard you say once ive heard you say a thousand times that if that poor sheep  i was thinking ofofi dont know who i was thinking of and it doesnt make any difference anyway somebody idolized him i recollect it as if it were yesterday and  father i am going to shake hands with major hawkins and let the introduction work along and catch up at its leisure  i remember you very well in deed major hawkins although i was a little child when i saw you last and i am very very glad indeed to see you again and have you in our house as one of us and beaming in his face she finished her cordial shake with the hope that he had not forgotten her  he was prodigiously pleased by her outspoken heartiness and wanted to repay her by assuring her that he remembered her and not only that but better even than he remembered his own children but the facts would not quite warrant this still he stumbled through a tangled sentence which answered just as well since the purport of it was an awkward and unintentional confession that her extraordinary beauty had so stupefied him that he hadnt got back to his bearings yet and therefore couldnt be certain as to whether he remembered her at all or not  the speech made him her friend it couldnt well help it  in truth the beauty of this fair creature was of a rare type and may well excuse a moment of our time spent in its consideration  it did not consist in the fact that she had eyes nose mouth chin hair ears it consisted in their arrangement  in true beauty more depends upon right location and judicious distribution of feature than upon multiplicity of them  so also as regards color  the very combination of colors which in a volcanic irruption would add beauty to a landscape might detach it from a girl  such was gwendolen sellers  the family circle being completed by gwendolens arrival it was decreed that the official mourning should now begin that it should begin at six oclock every evening the dinner hour and end with the dinner  its a grand old line major a sublime old line and deserves to be mourned for almost royally almost imperially i may say  erlady gwendolenbut shes gone never mind i wanted my peerage ill fetch it myself presently and show you a thing or two that will give you a realizing idea of what our house is  ive been glancing through burke and i find that of william the conquerors sixtyfour natural ah my dear would you mind getting me that book  its on the escritoire in our boudoir  yes as i was saying theres only st albans buccleugh and grafton ahead of us on the listall the rest of the british nobility are in procession behind us  ah thanks my lady  now then we turn to william and we findletter for xyz  oh splendidwhend you get it  last night but i was asleep before you came you were out so late and when i came to breakfast miss gwendolenwell she knocked everything out of me you know  wonderful girl wonderful her great origin is detectable in her step her carriage her featuresbut what does he say  come this is exciting  i havent read iterrossmmr rossmer  mlord  just cut it short like that  its the english way  ill open it  ah now lets see  a  to you know who  think i know you  wait ten days  coming to      washington  the excitement died out of both mens faces  there was a brooding silence for a while then the younger one said with a sigh  why we cant wait ten days for the money  nothe mans unreasonable we are down to the bed rock financially speaking  if we could explain to him in some way that we are so situated that time is of the utmost importance to us  yesyes thats itand so if it would be as convenient for him to come at once it would be a great accommodation to us and one which wewhich wewhich wewhwell which we should sincerely appreciate  thats itand most gladly reciprocate  certainlythatll fetch him  worded right if hes a mangot any of the feelings of a man sympathies and all that hell be here inside of twentyfour hours  pen and papercome well get right at it  between them they framed twentytwo different advertisements but none was satisfactory  a main fault in all of them was urgency  that feature was very troublesome if made prominent it was calculated to excite petes suspicion if modified below the suspicionpoint it was flat and meaningless  finally the colonel resigned and said  i have noticed in such literary experiences as i have had that one of the most taking things to do is to conceal your meaning when you are trying to conceal it  whereas if you go at literature with a free conscience and nothing to conceal you can turn out a book every time that the very elect cant understand  they all do  then hawkins resigned also and the two agreed that they must manage to wait the ten days some how or other  next they caught a ray of cheer since they had something definite to go upon now they could probably borrow money on the rewardenough at any rate to tide them over till they got it and meantime the materializing recipe would be perfected and then good bye to trouble for good and all  the next day may the tenth a couple of things happenedamong others the remains of the noble arkansas twins left our shores for england consigned to lord rossmore and lord rossmores son kirkcudbright llanover marjoribanks sellers viscount berkeley sailed from liverpool for america to place the reversion of the earldom in the hands of the rightful peer mulberry sellers of rossmore towers in the district of columbia u s a  these two impressive shipments would meet and part in midatlantic five days later and give no sign     chapter vi  in the course of time the twins arrived and were delivered to their great kinsman  to try to describe the rage of that old man would profit nothing the attempt would fall so far short of the purpose  however when he had worn himself out and got quiet again he looked the matter over and decided that the twins had some moral rights although they had no legal ones they were of his blood and it could not be decorous to treat them as common clay  so he laid them with their majestic kin in the cholmondeley church with imposing state and ceremony and added the supreme touch by officiating as chief mourner himself  but he drew the line at hatchments  our friends in washington watched the weary days go by while they waited for pete and covered his name with reproaches because of his calamitous procrastinations  meantime sally sellers who was as practical and democratic as the lady gwendolen sellers was romantic and aristocratic was leading a life of intense interest and activity and getting the most she could out of her double personality  all day long in the privacy of her workroom sally sellers earned bread for the sellers family and all the evening lady gwendolen sellers supported the rossmore dignity  all day she was american practically and proud of the work of her head and hands and its commercial result all the evening she took holiday and dwelt in a rich shadowland peopled with titled and coroneted fictions by day to her the place was a plain unaffected ramshackle old trap just that and nothing more by night it was rossmore towers  at college she had learned a trade without knowing it  the girls had found out that she was the designer of her own gowns  she had no idle moments after that and wanted none for the exercise of an extraordinary gift is the supremest pleasure in life and it was manifest that sally sellers possessed a gift of that sort in the matter of costumedesigning  within three days after reaching home she had hunted up some work before pete was yet due in washington and before the twins were fairly asleep in english soil she was already nearly swamped with work and the sacrificing of the family chromos for debt had got an effective check  shes a brick said rossmore to the major just her father all over prompt to labor with head or hands and not ashamed of it capable always capable let the enterprise be what it may successful by nature dont know what defeat is thus intensely and practically american by inhaled nationalism and at the same time intensely and aristocratically european by inherited nobility of blood  just me exactly mulberry sellers in matter of finance and invention after office hours what do you find  the same clothes yes but whats in them  rossmore of the peerage  the two friends had haunted the general postoffice daily  at last they had their reward  toward evening the 20th of may they got a letter for xyz  it bore the washington postmark the note itself was not dated  it said       ash barrel back of lamp post black horse alley  if you are playing      square go and set on it tomorrow morning 21st 1022 not sooner not      later wait till i come  the friends cogitated over the note profoundly  presently the earl said  dont you reckon hes afraid we are a sheriff with a requisition  why mlord  because thats no place for a seance  nothing friendly nothing sociable about it  and at the same time a body that wanted to know who was roosting on that ashbarrel without exposing himself by going near it or seeming to be interested in it could just stand on the street corner and take a glance down the alley and satisfy himself dont you see  yes his idea is plain now  he seems to be a man that cant be candid and straightforward  he acts as if he thought weshucks i wish he had come out like a man and told us what hotel he  now youve struck it youve struck it sure washington he has told us  has he  yes he has but he didnt mean to  that alley is a lonesome little pocket that runs along one side of the new gadsby  thats his hotel  what makes you think that  why i just know it  hes got a room thats just across from that lamp post  hes going to sit there perfectly comfortable behind his shutters at 1022 tomorrow and when he sees us sitting on the ashbarrel hell say to himself i saw one of those fellows on the trainand then hell pack his satchel in half a minute and ship for the ends of the earth  hawkins turned sick with disappointment  oh dear its all up colonelits exactly what hell do  indeed he wont  wont he  why  because you wont be holding the ash barrel down itll be me  youll be coming in with an officer and a requisition in plain clothesthe officer i meanthe minute you see him arrive and open up a talk with me  well what a head you have got colonel sellers  i never should have thought of that in the world  neither would any earl of rossmore betwixt williams contribution and mulberryas earl but its office hours now you see and the earl in me sleeps  comeill show you his very room  they reached the neighborhood of the new gadsby about nine in the evening and passed down the alley to the lamp post  there you are said the colonel triumphantly with a wave of his hand which took in the whole side of the hotel  there it iswhat did i tell you  well butwhy colonel its six stories high  i dont quite make out which window you  all the windows all of them  let him have his choiceim indifferent now that i have located him  you go and stand on the corner and wait ill prospect the hotel  the earl drifted here and there through the swarming lobby and finally took a waiting position in the neighborhood of the elevator  during an hour crowds went up and crowds came down and all complete as to limbs but at last the watcher got a glimpse of a figure that was satisfactory got a glimpse of the back of it though he had missed his chance at the face through waning alertness  the glimpse revealed a cowboy hat and below it a plaided sack of rather loud pattern and an empty sleeve pinned up to the shoulder  then the elevator snatched the vision aloft and the watcher fled away in joyful excitement and rejoined the fellowconspirator  weve got him majorgot him sure  ive seen himseen him good and i dont care where or when that man approaches me backwards ill recognize him every time  were all right  now for the requisition  they got it after the delays usual in such cases  by half past eleven they were at home and happy and went to bed full of dreams of the morrows great promise  among the elevator load which had the suspect for fellowpassenger was a young kinsman of mulberry sellers but mulberry was not aware of it and didnt see him  it was viscount berkeley     chapter vii  arrived in his room lord berkeley made preparations for that first and last and allthetime duty of the visiting englishmanthe jotting down in his diary of his impressions to date  his preparations consisted in ransacking his box for a pen  there was a plenty of steel pens on his table with the ink bottle but he was english  the english people manufacture steel pens for nineteentwentieths of the globe but they never use any themselves  they use exclusively the prehistoric quill my lord not only found a quill pen but the best one he had seen in several yearsand after writing diligently for some time closed with the following entry            but in one thing i have made an immense mistake i ought to           have shucked my title and changed my name before i started  he sat admiring that pen a while and then went on  all attempts to mingle with the common people and became permanently one of them are going to fail unless i can get rid of it disappear from it and reappear with the solid protection of a new name  i am astonished and pained to see how eager the most of these americans are to get acquainted with a lord and how diligent they are in pushing attentions upon him  they lack english servility it is truebut they could acquire it with practice  my quality travels ahead of me in the most mysterious way  i write my family name without additions on the register of this hotel and imagine that i am going to pass for an obscure and unknown wanderer but the clerk promptly calls out front show his lordship to foureightytwo and before i can get to the lift there is a reporter trying to interview me as they call it  this sort of thing shall cease at once  i will hunt up the american claimant the first thing in the morning accomplish my mission then change my lodging and vanish from scrutiny under a fictitious name   he left his diary on the table where it would be handy in case any new impressions should wake him up in the night then he went to bed and presently fell asleep  an hour or two passed and then he came slowly to consciousness with a confusion of mysterious and augmenting sounds hammering at the gates of his brain for admission the next moment he was sharply awake and those sounds burst with the rush and roar and boom of an undammed freshet into his ears  banging and slamming of shutters smashing of windows and the ringing clash of falling glass clatter of flying feet along the halls shrieks supplications dumb moanings of despair within hoarse shouts of command outside cracklings and mappings and the windy roar of victorious flames  bang bang bang  on the door and a cry  turn outthe house is on fire  the cry passed on and the banging  lord berkeley sprang out of bed and moved with all possible speed toward the clothespress in the darkness and the gathering smoke but fell over a chair and lost his bearings he groped desperately about on his hands and presently struck his head against the table and was deeply grateful for it gave him his bearings again since it stood close by the door  he seized his most precious possession his journaled impressions of america and darted from the room  he ran down the deserted hall toward the red lamp which he knew indicated the place of a fireescape  the door of the room beside it was open in the room the gas was burning full head on a chair was a pile of clothing  he ran to the window could not get it up but smashed it with a chair and stepped out on the landing of the fireescape below him was a crowd of men with a sprinkling of women and youth massed in a ruddy light  must he go down in his spectral night dress  nothis side of the house was not yet on fire except at the further end he would snatch on those clothes  which he did  they fitted well enough though a trifle loosely and they were just a shade loud as to pattern  also as to hatwhich was of a new breed to him buffalo bill not having been to england yet  one side of the coat went on but the other side refused one of its sleeves was turned up and stitched to the shoulder  he started down without waiting to get it loose made the trip successfully and was promptly hustled outside the limitrope by the police  the cowboy hat and the coat but half on made him too much of a centre of attraction for comfort although nothing could be more profoundly respectful not to say deferential than was the manner of the crowd toward him  in his mind he framed a discouraged remark for early entry in his diary it is of no use they know a lord through any disguise and show awe of himeven something very like fear indeed  presently one of the gaping and adoring halfcircle of boys ventured a timid question  my lord answered it  the boys glanced wonderingly at each other and from somewhere fell the comment  english cowboy  well if that aint curious  another mental note to be preserved for the diary cowboy  now what might a cowboy be  perhaps but the viscount perceived that some more questions were about to be asked so he worked his way out of the crowd released the sleeve put on the coat and wandered away to seek a humble and obscure lodging  he found it and went to bed and was soon asleep  in the morning he examined his clothes  they were rather assertive it seemed to him but they were new and clean at any rate  there was considerable property in the pockets  item five onehundred dollar bills  item near fifty dollars in small bills and silver  plug of tobacco  hymnbook which refuses to open found to contain whiskey memorandum book bearing no name  scattering entries in it recording in a sprawling ignorant hand appointments bets horsetrades and so on with people of strange hyphenated namesixfingered jake youngmanafraidof hisshadow and the like  no letters no documents  the young man musesmaps out his course  his letter of credit is burned he will borrow the small bills and the silver in these pockets apply part of it to advertising for the owner and use the rest for sustenance while he seeks work  he sends out for the morning paper next and proceeds to read about the fire  the biggest line in the displayhead announces his own death  the body of the account furnishes all the particulars and tells how with the inherited heroism of his caste he went on saving women and children until escape for himself was impossible then with the eyes of weeping multitudes upon him he stood with folded arms and sternly awaited the approach of the devouring fiend and so standing amid a tossing sea of flame and onrushing billows of smoke the noble young heir of the great house of rossmore was caught up in a whirlwind of fiery glory and disappeared forever from the vision of men  the thing was so fine and generous and knightly that it brought the moisture to his eyes  presently he said to himself what to do is as plain as day now  my lord berkeley is deadlet him stay so  died creditably too that will make the calamity the easier for my father and i dont have to report to the american claimant now  yes nothing could be better than the way matters have turned out  i have only to furnish myself with a new name and take my new start in life totally untrammeled  now i breathe my first breath of real freedom and how fresh and breezy and inspiring it is  at last i am a man a man on equal terms with my neighbor and by my manhood and by it alone i shall rise and be seen of the world or i shall sink from sight and deserve it this is the gladdest day and the proudest that ever poured its sun upon my head     chapter viii  god bless my soul hawkins  the morning paper dropped from the colonels nervelessgrasp  what is it  hes gonethe bright the young the gifted the noblest of his illustrious racegone gone up in flames and unimaginable glory  who  my precious precious young kinsmankirkcudbright llanover marjoribanks sellers viscount berkeley son and heir of usurping rossmore  no  its truetoo true  when  last night  where  right here in washington where he arrived from england last night the papers say  you dont say  hotel burned down  what hotel  the new gadsby  oh my goodness  and have we lost both of them  both who  onearm pete  oh great guns i forgot all about him  oh i hope not  hope  well i should say  oh we cant spare him  we can better afford to lose a million viscounts than our only support and stay  they searched the paper diligently and were appalled to find that a onearmed man had been seen flying along one of the halls of the hotel in his underclothing and apparently out of his head with fright and as he would listen to no one and persisted in making for a stairway which would carry him to certain death his case was given over as a hopeless one  poor fellow sighed hawkins and he had friends so near  i wish we hadnt come away from theremaybe we could have saved him  the earl looked up and said calmly  his being dead doesnt matter  he was uncertain before  weve got him sure this time  got him  how  i will materialize him  rossmore dontdont trifle with me  do you mean that  can you do it  i can do it just as sure as you are sitting there  and i will  give me your hand and let me have the comfort of shaking it  i was perishing and you have put new life into me  get at it oh get at it right away  it will take a little time hawkins but theres no hurry none in the worldin the circumstances  and of course certain duties have devolved upon me now which necessarily claim my first attention  this poor young nobleman  why yes i am sorry for my heartlessness and you smitten with this new family affliction  of course you must materialize him firsti quite understand that  iiwell i wasnt meaning just that butwhy what am i thinking of  of course i must materialize him  oh hawkins selfishness is the bottom trait in human nature i was only thinking that now with the usurpers heir out of the way  but youll forgive that momentary weakness and forget it  dont ever remember it against me that mulberry sellers was once mean enough to think the thought that i was thinking  ill materialise himi will on my honorand id do it were he a thousand heirs jammed into one and stretching in a solid rank from here to the stolen estates of rossmore and barring the road forever to the rightful earl  there spoke the real sellersthe other had a false ring old friend  hawkins my boy it just occurs to mea thing i keep forgetting to mentiona matter that weve got to be mighty careful about  what is that  we must keep absolutely still about these materializations  mind not a hint of them must escapenot a hint  to say nothing of how my wife and daughterhighstrung sensitive organizationsmight feel about them the negroes wouldnt stay on the place a minute  thats true they wouldnt  its well you spoke for im not naturally discreet with my tongue when im not warned  sellers reached out and touched a bellbutton in the wall set his eye upon the rear door and waited touched it again and waited and just as hawkins was remarking admiringly that the colonel was the most progressive and most alert man he had ever seen in the matter of impressing into his service every modern convenience the moment it was invented and always keeping breast to breast with the drum major in the great work of material civilization he forsook the button which hadnt any wire attached to it rang a vast dinner bell which stood on the table and remarked that he had tried that newfangled dry battery now to his entire satisfaction and had got enough of it and added  nothing would do graham bell but i must try it said the mere fact of my trying it would secure public confidence and get it a chance to show what it could do  i told him that in theory a dry battery was just a curled darling and no mistake but when it come to practice shoand heres the result  was i right  what should you say washington hawkins  youve seen me try that button twice  was i rightthats the idea  did i know what i was talking about or didnt i  well you know how i feel about you colonel sellers and always have felt  it seems to me that you always know everything about everything if that man had known you as i know you he would have taken your judgment at the start and dropped his dry battery where it was  did you ring marse sellers  no marse sellers didnt  den it was you marse washington  is heah suh  no it wasnt marse washington either  de good lan who did ring her den  lord rossmore rang it  the old negro flung up his hands and exclaimed  blame my skin if i haint gone en forgit dat name agin  come heah jinnyrun heah honey  jinny arrived  you take dishyer order de lord gwine to give you is gwine down suller and study dat name tell i git it  i take de order  whos yo nigger las year  de bell rung for you  dat dont make no diffunce  when a bell ring for anybody en old marster tell me to  clear out and settle it in the kitchen  the noise of the quarreling presently sank to a murmur in the distance and the earl added thats a trouble with old house servants that were your slaves once and have been your personal friends always  yes and members of the family  members of the family is just what they becomethe members of the family in fact  and sometimes master and mistress of the household these two are mighty good and loving and faithful and honest but hang it they do just about as they please they chip into a conversation whenever they want to and the plain fact is they ought to be killed  it was a random remark but it gave him an ideahowever nothing could happen without that result  what i wanted hawkins was to send for the family and break the news to them  o never mind bothering with the servants then  i will go and bring them down  while he was gone the earl worked his idea  yes he said to himself when ive got the materializing down to a certainty i will get hawkins to kill them and after that they will be under better control  without doubt a materialized negro could easily be hypnotized into a state resembling silence  and this could be made permanentyes and also modifiable at willsometimes very silent sometimes turn on more talk more action more emotion according to what you want  its a prime good idea  make it adjustablewith a screw or something  the two ladies entered now with hawkins and the two negroes followed uninvited and fell to brushing and dusting around for they perceived that there was matter of interest to the fore and were willing to find out what it was  sellers broke the news with stateliness and ceremony first warning the ladies with gentle art that a pang of peculiar sharpness was about to be inflicted upon their heartshearts still sore from a like hurt still lamenting a like lossthen he took the paper and with trembling lips and with tears in his voice he gave them that heroic deathpicture  the result was a very genuine outbreak of sorrow and sympathy from all the hearers  the elder lady cried thinking how proud that greathearted young heros mother would be if she were living and how unappeasable her grief and the two old servants cried with her and spoke out their applauses and their pitying lamentations with the eloquent sincerity and simplicity native to their race  gwendolen was touched and the romantic side of her nature was strongly wrought upon  she said that such a nature as that young mans was rarely and truly noble and nearly perfect and that with nobility of birth added it was entirely perfect for such a man she could endure all things suffer all things even to the sacrificing of her life  she wished she could have seen him the slightest the most momentary contact with such a spirit would have ennobled her own character and made ignoble thoughts and ignoble acts thereafter impossible to her forever  have they found the body rossmore asked the wife  yes that is theyve found several  it must be one of them but none of them are recognizable  what are you going to do  i am going down there and identify one of them and send it home to the stricken father  but papa did you ever see the young man  no gwendolenwhy  how will you identify it  iwell you know it says none of them are recognizable  ill send his father one of themtheres probably no choice  gwendolen knew it was not worth while to argue the matter further since her fathers mind was made up and there was a chance for him to appear upon that sad scene down yonder in an authentic and official way  so she said no moretill he asked for a basket  a basket papa  what for  it might be ashes     chapter ix  the earl and washington started on the sorrowful errand talking as they walked  and as usual  what colonel  seven of them in that hotel  actresses  and all burnt out of course  any of them burnt up  oh no they escaped they always do but theres never a one of them that knows enough to fetch out her jewelry with her  thats strange  strangeits the most unaccountable thing in the world  experience teaches them nothing they cant seem to learn anything except out of a book  in some uses theres manifestly a fatality about it  for instance take whatshername that plays those sensational thunder and lightning parts  shes got a perfectly immense reputationdraws like a dogfightand it all came from getting burnt out in hotels  why how could that give her a reputation as an actress  it didntit only made her name familiar  people want to see her play because her name is familiar but they dont know what made it familiar because they dont remember  first she was at the bottom of the ladder and absolutely obscure wages thirteen dollars a week and find her own pads  pads  yesthings to fat up her spindles with so as to be plump and attractive well she got burnt out in a hotel and lost 30000 worth of diamonds  she  whered she get them  goodness knowsgiven to her no doubt by spoony young flats and sappy old baldheads in the front row  all the papers were full of it  she struck for higher pay and got it  well she got burnt out again and lost all her diamonds and it gave her such a lift that she went starring  well if hotel fires are all shes got to depend on to keep up her name its a pretty precarious kind of a reputation i should think  not with her  no anything but that  because shes so lucky born lucky i reckon  every time theres a hotel fire shes in it  shes always thereand if she cant be there herself her diamonds are  now you cant make anything out of that but just sheer luck  i never heard of such a thing  she must have lost quarts of diamonds  quarts shes lost bushels of them  its got so that the hotels are superstitious about her  they wont let her in  they think there will be a fire and besides if shes there it cancels the insurance  shes been waning a little lately but this fire will set her up  she lost 60000 worth last night  i think shes a fool  if i had 60000 worth of diamonds i wouldnt trust them in a hotel  i wouldnt either but you cant teach an actress that  this ones been burnt out thirtyfive times  and yet if theres a hotel fire in san francisco tonight shes got to bleed again you mark my words  perfect ass they say shes got diamonds in every hotel in the country  when they arrived at the scene of the fire the poor old earl took one glimpse at the melancholy morgue and turned away his face overcome by the spectacle  he said  it is too true hawkinsrecognition is impossible not one of the five could be identified by its nearest friend  you make the selection i cant bear it  which one had i better  oh take any of them  pick out the best one  however the officers assured the earlfor they knew him everybody in washington knew himthat the position in which these bodies were found made it impossible that any one of them could be that of his noble young kinsman  they pointed out the spot where if the newspaper account was correct he must have sunk down to destruction and at a wide distance from this spot they showed him where the young man must have gone down in case he was suffocated in his room and they showed him still a third place quite remote where he might possibly have found his death if perchance he tried to escape by the side exit toward the rear  the old colonel brushed away a tear and said to hawkins  as it turns out there was something prophetic in my fears  yes its a matter of ashes  will you kindly step to a grocery and fetch a couple more baskets  reverently they got a basket of ashes from each of those now hallowed spots and carried them home to consult as to the best manner of forwarding them to england and also to give them an opportunity to lie in statea mark of respect which the colonel deemed obligatory considering the high rank of the deceased  they set the baskets on the table in what was formerly the library drawingroom and workshopnow the hall of audienceand went up stairs to the lumber room to see if they could find a british flag to use as a part of the outfit proper to the lying in state  a moment later lady rossmore came in from the street and caught sight of the baskets just as old jinny crossed her field of vision  she quite lost her patience and said  well what will you do next  what in the world possessed you to clutter up the parlor table with these baskets of ashes  ashes  and she came to look  she put up her hands in pathetic astonishment  well i never see de like  didnt you do it  who me  clah to goodness its de fust time ive sot eyes on em miss polly  dats danl  dat ole moke is losin his mine  but it wasnt danl for he was called and denied it  dey aint no way to splain dat  wen hits one er deseyer common currences a body kin reckon maybe de cat  oh and a shudder shook lady rossmore to her foundations  i see it all  keep away from themtheyre his  his m lady  yesyour young marse sellers from england thats burnt up  she was alone with the ashesalone before she could take half a breath then she went after mulberry sellers purposing to make short work with his program whatever it might be for said she when his sentimentals are up hes a numskull and theres no knowing what extravagance hell contrive if you let him alone  she found him he had found the flag and was bringing it  when she heard that his idea was to have the remains lie in state and invite the government and the public she broke it up  she said  your intentions are all rightthey always areyou want to do honour to the remains and surely nobody can find any fault with that for he was your kin but you are going the wrong way about it and you will see it yourself if you stop and think  you cant file around a basket of ashes trying to look sorry for it and make a sight that is really solemn because the solemner it is the more it isntanybody can see that  it would be so with one basket it would be three times so with three well it stands to reason that if it wouldnt be solemn with one mourner it wouldnt be with a processionand there would be five thousand people here  i dont know but it would be pretty near ridiculous i think it would  no mulberry they cant lie in stateit would be a mistake give that up and think of something else  so he gave it up and not reluctantly when he had thought it over and realized how right her instinct was  he concluded to merely sit up with the remains just himself and hawkins  even this seemed a doubtful attention to his wife but she offered no objection for it was plain that he had a quite honest and simplehearted desire to do the friendly and honourable thing by these forlorn poor relics which could command no hospitality in this far off land of strangers but his  he draped the flag about the baskets put some crape on the doorknob and said with satisfaction  therehe is as comfortable now as we can make him in the circumstances  exceptyes we must strain a point thereone must do as one would wish to be done byhe must have it  have what dear  hatchment  the wife felt that the housefront was standing about all it could well stand in that way the prospect of another stunning decoration of that nature distressed her and she wished the thing had not occurred to him she said hesitatingly  but i thought such an honour as that wasnt allowed to any but very very near relations who  right you are quite right my lady perfectly right but there arent any nearer relatives than relatives by usurpation  we cannot avoid it we are slaves of aristocratic custom and must submit  the hatchments were unnecessarily generous each being as large as a blanket and they were unnecessarily volcanic too as to variety and violence of color but they pleased the earls barbaric eye and they satisfied his taste for symmetry and completeness too for they left no waste room to speak of on the housefront  lady rossmore and her daughter assisted at the sittingup till near midnight and helped the gentlemen to consider what ought to be done next with the remains  rossmore thought they ought to be sent home with a committee and resolutionsat once  but the wife was doubtful  she said  would you send all of the baskets  oh yes all  all at once  to his father  oh noby no means  think of the shock  noone at a time break it to him by degrees  would that have that effect father  yes my daughter  remember you are young and elastic but he is old to send him the whole at once might well be more than he could bear but mitigatedone basket at a time with restful intervals between he would be used to it by the time he got all of him  and sending him in three ships is safer anyway  on account of wrecks and storms  i dont like the idea father  if i were his father it would be dreadful to have him coming in thatin that  on the installment plan suggested hawkins gravely and proud of being able to help  yesdreadful to have him coming in that incoherent way  there would be the strain of suspense upon me all the time  to have so depressing a thing as a funeral impending delayed waiting unaccomplished  oh no my child said the earl reassuringly there would be nothing of that kind so old a gentleman could not endure a longdrawn suspense like that  there will be three funerals  lady rossmore looked up surprised and said  how is that going to make it easier for him  its a total mistake to my mind  he ought to be buried all at once im sure of it  i should think so too said hawkins  and certainly i should said the daughter  you are all wrong said the earl  you will see it yourselves if you think  only one of these baskets has got him in it  very well then said lady rossmore the thing is perfectly simple bury that one  certainly said lady gwendolen  but it is not simple said the earl because we do not know which basket he is in  we know he is in one of them but that is all we do know  you see now i reckon that i was right it takes three funerals there is no other way  and three graves and three monuments and three inscriptions asked the daughter  wellyesto do it right  that is what i should do  it could not be done so father  each of the inscriptions would give the same name and the same facts and say he was under each and all of these monuments and that would not answer at all  the earl nestled uncomfortably in his chair  no he said that is an objection  that is a serious objection  i see no way out  there was a general silence for a while  then hawkins said  it seems to me that if we mixed the three ramifications together  the earl grasped him by the hand and shook it gratefully  it solves the whole problem he said  one ship one funeral one grave one monumentit is admirably conceived  it does you honor major hawkins it has relieved me of a most painful embarrassment and distress and it will save that poor stricken old father much suffering  yes he shall go over in one basket  when asked the wife  tomorrowimmediately of course  i would wait mulberry  wait  why  you dont want to break that childless old mans heart  god knows i dont  then wait till he sends for his sons remains  if you do that you will never have to give him the last and sharpest pain a parent can know i mean the certainty that his son is dead  for he will never send  why wont he  because to sendand find out the truthwould rob him of the one precious thing left him the uncertainty the dim hope that maybe after all his boy escaped and he will see him again some day  why polly hell know by the papers that he was burnt up  he wont let himself believe the papers hell argue against anything and everything that proves his son is dead and he will keep that up and live on it and on nothing else till he dies  but if the remains should actually come and be put before that poor old dimhoping soul  oh my god they never shall  polly youve saved me from a crime and ill bless you for it always  now we know what to do  well place them reverently away and he shall never know     chapter x  the young lord berkeley with the fresh air of freedom in his nostrils was feeling invincibly strong for his new career and yetand yetif the fight should prove a very hard one at first very discouraging very taxing on untoughened moral sinews he might in some weak moment want to retreat  not likely of course but possibly that might happen  and so on the whole it might be pardonable caution to burn his bridges behind him  oh without doubt  he must not stop with advertising for the owner of that money but must put it where he could not borrow from it himself meantime under stress of circumstances  so he went down town and put in his advertisement then went to a bank and handed in the 500 for deposit  what name  he hesitated and colored a little he had forgotten to make a selection he now brought out the first one that suggested itself  howard tracy  when he was gone the clerks marveling said  the cowboy blushed  the first step was accomplished  the money was still under his command and at his disposal but the next step would dispose of that difficulty he went to another bank and drew upon the first bank for the 500 by check  the money was collected and deposited a second time to the credit of howard tracy  he was asked to leave a few samples of his signature which he did  then he went away once more proud and of perfect courage saying  no help for me now for henceforth i couldnt draw that money without identification and that is become legally impossible  no resources to fall back on  it is work or starve from now to the end  i am readyand not afraid  then he sent this cablegram to his father  escaped unhurt from burning hotel  have taken fictitious name goodbye  during the evening while he was wandering about in one of the outlying districts of the city he came across a small brick church with a bill posted there with these words printed on it mechanics club debate all invited  he saw people apparently mainly of the working class entering the place and he followed and took his seat  it was a humble little church quite bare as to ornamentation  it had painted pews without cushions and no pulpit properly speaking but it had a platform  on the platform sat the chairman and by his side sat a man who held a manuscript in his hand and had the waiting look of one who is going to perform the principal part  the church was soon filled with a quiet and orderly congregation of decently dressed and modest people this is what the chairman said  the essayist for this evening is an old member of our club whom you all know mr  parker assistant editor of the daily democrat  the subject of his essay is the american press and he will use as his text a couple of paragraphs taken from mr matthew arnolds new book  he asks me to read these texts for him  the first is as follows  goethe says somewhere that the thrill of awe that is to say reverence is the best thing humanity has  mr arnolds other paragraph is as follows  i should say that if one were searching for the best means to efface and kill in a whole nation the discipline of respect one could not do better than take the american newspapers  mr  parker rose and bowed and was received with warm applause  he then began to read in a good round resonant voice with clear enunciation and careful attention to his pauses and emphases  his points were received with approval as he went on  the essayist took the position that the most important function of a public journal in any country was the propagating of national feeling and pride in the national namethe keeping the people in love with their country and its institutions and shielded from the allurements of alien and inimical systems  he sketched the manner in which the reverent turkish or russian journalist fulfilled this functionthe one assisted by the prevalent discipline of respect for the bastinado the other for siberia  continuing he said  the chief function of an english journal is that of all other journals the world over it must keep the public eye fixed admiringly upon certain things and keep it diligently diverted from certain others  for instance it must keep the public eye fixed admiringly upon the glories of england a processional splendor stretching its receding line down the hazy vistas of time with the mellowed lights of a thousand years glinting from its banners and it must keep it diligently diverted from the fact that all these glories were for the enrichment and aggrandizement of the petted and privileged few at cost of the blood and sweat and poverty of the unconsidered masses who achieved them but might not enter in and partake of them  it must keep the public eye fixed in loving and awful reverence upon the throne as a sacred thing and diligently divert it from the fact that no throne was ever set up by the unhampered vote of a majority of any nation and that hence no throne exists that has a right to exist and no symbol of it flying from any flagstaff is righteously entitled to wear any device but the skull and crossbones of that kindred industry which differs from royalty only businesswisemerely as retail differs from wholesale  it must keep the citizens eye fixed in reverent docility upon that curious invention of machine politics an established church and upon that bald contradiction of common justice a hereditary nobility and diligently divert it from the fact that the one damns him if he doesnt wear its collar and robs him under the gentle name of taxation whether he wears it or not and the other gets all the honors while he does all the work  the essayist thought that mr  arnold with his trained eye and intelligent observation ought to have perceived that the very quality which he so regretfully missed from our pressrespectfulness reverence was exactly the thing which would make our press useless to us if it had itrob it of the very thing which differentiates it from all other journalism in the world and makes it distinctively and preciously american its frank and cheerful irreverence being by all odds the most valuable of all its qualities  for its missionoverlooked by mr arnoldis to stand guard over a nations liberties not its humbugs and shams  he thought that if during fifty years the institutions of the old world could be exposed to the fire of a flouting and scoffing press like ours monarchy and its attendant crimes would disappear from christendom  monarchists might doubt this then why not persuade the czar to give it a trial in russia  concluding he said  well the charge is that our press has but little of that old world quality reverence  let us be candidly grateful that it is so  with its limited reverence it at least reveres the things which this nation reveres as a rule and that is sufficient what other people revere is fairly and properly matter of light importance to us  our press does not reverence kings it does not reverence so called nobilities it does not reverence established ecclesiastical slaveries it does not reverence laws which rob a younger son to fatten an elder one it does not reverence any fraud or sham or infamy howsoever old or rotten or holy which sets one citizen above his neighbor by accident of birth it does not reverence any law or custom howsoever old or decayed or sacred which shuts against the best man in the land the best place in the land and the divine right to prove property and go up and occupy it  in the sense of the poet goethethat meek idolater of provincial three carat royalty and nobilityour press is certainly bankrupt in the thrill of aweotherwise reverence reverence for nickel plate and brummagem let us sincerely hope that this fact will remain a fact forever for to my mind a discriminating irreverence is the creator and protector of human libertyeven as the other thing is the creator nurse and steadfast protector of all forms of human slavery bodily and mental  tracy said to himself almost shouted to himself im glad i came to this country  i was right  i was right to seek out a land where such healthy principles and theories are in mens hearty and minds  think of the innumerable slaveries imposed by misplaced reverence  how well he brought that out and how true it is  theres manifestly prodigious force in reverence  if you can get a man to reverence your ideals hes your slave  oh yes in all the ages the peoples of europe have been diligently taught to avoid reasoning about the shams of monarchy and nobility been taught to avoid examining them been taught to reverence them and now as a natural result to reverence them is second nature in order to shock them it is sufficient to inject a thought of the opposite kind into their dull minds  for ages any expression of socalled irreverence from their lips has been sin and crime  the sham and swindle of all this is apparent the moment one reflects that he is himself the only legitimately qualified judge of what is entitled to reverence and what is not  come i hadnt thought of that before but it is true absolutely true  what right has goethe what right has arnold what right has any dictionary to define the word irreverence for me what their ideals are is nothing to me  so long as i reverence my own ideals my whole duty is done and i commit no profanation if i laugh at theirs  i may scoff at other peoples ideals as much as i want to  it is my right and my privilege  no man has any right to deny it  tracy was expecting to hear the essay debated but this did not happen the chairman said by way of explanation  i would say for the information of the strangers present here that in accordance with our custom the subject of this meeting will be debated at the next meeting of the club  this is in order to enable our members to prepare what they may wish to say upon the subject with pen and paper for we are mainly mechanics and unaccustomed to speaking  we are obliged to write down what we desire to say  many brief papers were now read and several offhand speeches made in discussion of the essay read at the last meeting of the club which had been a laudation by some visiting professor of college culture and the grand results flowing from it to the nation  one of the papers was read by a man approaching middle age who said he hadnt had a college education that he had got his education in a printing office and had graduated from there into the patent office where he had been a clerk now for a great many years  then he continued to this effect  the essayist contrasted the america of today with the america of bygone times and certainly the result is the exhibition of a mighty progress but i think he a little overrated the collegeculture share in the production of that result  it can no doubt be easily shown that the colleges have contributed the intellectual part of this progress and that that part is vast but that the material progress has been immeasurably vaster i think you will concede  now i have been looking over a list of inventorsthe creators of this amazing material developmentand i find that they were not collegebred men  of course there are exceptionslike professor henry of princeton the inventor of mr morses system of telegraphybut these exceptions are few  it is not overstatement to say that the imaginationstunning material development of this century the only century worth living in since time itself was invented is the creation of men not collegebred  we think we see what these inventors have done no we see only the visible vast frontage of their work behind it is their far vaster work and it is invisible to the careless glance  they have reconstructed this nation made it over that isand metaphorically speaking have multiplied its numbers almost beyond the power of figures to express  i will explain what i mean  what constitutes the population of a land  merely the numberable packages of meat and bones in it called by courtesy men and women  shall a million ounces of brass and a million ounces of gold be held to be of the same value  take a truer standard the measure of a mans contributing capacity to his time and his peoplethe work he can doand then number the population of this country today as multiplied by what a man can now do more than his grandfather could do  by this standard of measurement this nation two or three generations ago consisted of mere cripples paralytics dead men as compared with the men of today  in 1840 our population was 17000000  by way of rude but striking illustration let us consider for arguments sake that four of these millions consisted of aged people little children and other incapables and that the remaining 13000000 were divided and employed as follows  2000000 as ginners of cotton 6000000 women as stockingknitters 2000000 women as threadspinners 500000 as screw makers 400000 as reapers binders etc 1000000 as corn shellers 40000 as weavers 1000 as stitchers of shoe soles  now the deductions which i am going to append to these figures may sound extravagant but they are not  i take them from miscellaneous documents no 50 second session 45th congress and they are official and trustworthy  today the work of those 2000000 cottonginners is done by 2000 men that of the 6000000 stockingknitters is done by 3000 boys that of the 2000000 threadspinners is done by 1000 girls that of the 500000 screw makers is done by 500 girls that of the 400000 reapers binders etc is done by 4000 boys that of the 1000000 corn shelters is done by 7500 men that of the 40000 weavers is done by 1200 men and that of the 1000 stitchers of shoe soles is done by 6 men  to bunch the figures 17900 persons today do the abovework whereas fifty years ago it would have taken thirteen millions of persons to do it  now then how many of that ignorant raceour fathers and grandfatherswith their ignorant methods would it take to do our work today  it would take forty thousand millionsa hundred times the swarming population of chinatwenty times the present population of the globe  you look around you and you see a nation of sixty millions apparently but secreted in their hands and brains and invisible to your eyes is the true population of this republic and it numbers forty billions  it is the stupendous creation of those humble unlettered uncollegebred inventorsall honor to their name  how grand that is said tracy as he wended homeward  what a civilization it is and what prodigious results these are and brought about almost wholly by common men not by oxfordtrained aristocrats but men who stand shoulder to shoulder in the humble ranks of life and earn the bread that they eat  again im glad i came  i have found a country at last where one may start fair and breast to breast with his fellow man rise by his own efforts and be something in the world and be proud of that something not be something created by an ancestor three hundred years ago     chapter xi  during the first few days he kept the fact diligently before his mind that he was in a land where there was work and bread for all  in fact for convenience sake he fitted it to a little tune and hummed it to himself but as time wore on the fact itself began to take on a doubtful look and next the tune got fatigued and presently ran down and stopped his first effort was to get an upper clerkship in one of the departments where his oxford education could come into play and do him service but he stood no chance whatever  there competency was no recommendation political backing without competency was worth six of it  he was glaringly english and that was necessarily against him in the political centre of a nation where both parties prayed for the irish cause on the housetop and blasphemed it in the cellar  by his dress he was a cowboy that won him respectwhen his back was not turnedbut it couldnt get a clerkship for him  but he had said in a rash moment that he would wear those clothes till the owner or the owners friends caught sight of them and asked for that money and his conscience would not let him retire from that engagement now  at the end of a week things were beginning to wear rather a startling look  he had hunted everywhere for work descending gradually the scale of quality until apparently he had sued for all the various kinds of work a man without a special calling might hope to be able to do except ditching and the other coarse manual sortsand had got neither work nor the promise of it  he was mechanically turning over the leaves of his diary meanwhile and now his eye fell upon the first record made after he was burnt out  i myself did not doubt my stamina before nobody could doubt it now if they could see how i am housed and realise that i feel absolutely no disgust with these quarters but am as serenely content with them as any dog would be in a similar kennel  terms twentyfive dollars a week i said i would start at the bottom  i have kept my word  a shudder went quaking through him and he exclaimed  what have i been thinking of  this the bottom  mooning along a whole week and these terrific expenses climbing and climbing all the time i must end this folly straightway  he settled up at once and went forth to find less sumptuous lodgings  he had to wander far and seek with diligence but he succeeded  they made him pay in advancefour dollars and a half this secured both bed and food for a week  the goodnatured hardworked landlady took him up three flights of narrow uncarpeted stairs and delivered him into his room there were two doublebedsteads in it and one single one  he would be allowed to sleep alone in one of the double beds until some new boarder should come but he wouldnt be charged extra  so he would presently be required to sleep with some stranger the thought of it made him sick  mrs  marsh the landlady was very friendly and hoped he would like her housethey all liked it she said  and theyre a very nice set of boys  they carry on a good deal but thats their fun  you see this room opens right into this back one and sometimes theyre all in one and sometimes in the other and hot nights they all sleep on the roof when it dont rain  they get out there the minute its hot enough  the seasons so early that theyve already had a night or two up there  if youd like to go up and pick out a place you can  youll find chalk in the side of the chimney where theres a brick wanting  you just take the chalk andbut of course youve done it before  oh no i havent  why of course you haventwhat am i thinking of  plenty of room on the plains without chalking ill be bound  well you just chalk out a place the size of a blanket anywhere on the tin that aint already marked off you know and thats your property  you and your bedmate take turnabout carrying up the blanket and pillows and fetching them down again or one carries them up and the other fetches them down you fix it the way you like you know  youll like the boys theyre everlasting sociableexcept the printer  hes the one that sleeps in that single bedthe strangest creature why i dont believe you could get that man to sleep with another man not if the house was afire  mind you im not just talking i know  the boys tried him to see  they took his bed out one night and so when he got home about three in the morninghe was on a morning paper then but hes on an evening one nowthere wasnt any place for him but with the ironmoulder and if youll believe me he just set up the rest of the nighthe did honest  they say hes cracked but it aint so hes englishtheyre awful particular you wont mind my saying that  youyoure english  yes  i thought so  i could tell it by the way you mispronounce the words thats got as in them you know such as saying loff when you mean laff but youll get over that  hes a right down good fellow and a little sociable with the photographers boy and the caulker and the blacksmith that work in the navy yard but not so much with the others  the fact is though its private and the others dont know it hes a kind of an aristocrat his father being a doctor and you know what style that is in england i mean because in this country a doctor aint so very much even if hes that  but over there of course its different  so this chap had a falling out with his father and was pretty high strung and just cut for this country and the first he knew he had to get to work or starve  well hed been to college you see and so he judged he was all rightdid you say anything  noi only sighed  and theres where he was mistaken  why he mighty near starved  and i reckon he would have starved sure enough if some jour printer or other hadnt took pity on him and got him a place as apprentice  so he learnt the trade and then he was all rightbut it was a close call  once he thought he had got to haul in his pride and holler for his father and why youre sighing again  is anything the matter with youdoes my clatter  oh dearno  pray go oni like it  yes you see hes been over here ten years hes twentyeight now and he aint pretty well satisfied in his mind because he cant get reconciled to being a mechanic and associating with mechanics he being as he says to me a gentleman which is a pretty plain lettingon that the boys aint but of course i know enough not to let that cat out of the bag  whywould there be any harm in it  harm in it  theyd lick him wouldnt they  wouldnt you  of course you would  dont you ever let a man say you aint a gentleman in this country  but laws what am i thinking about  i reckon a body would think twice before he said a cowboy wasnt a gentleman  a trim active slender and very pretty girl of about eighteen walked into the room now in the most satisfied and unembarrassed way  she was cheaply but smartly and gracefully dressed and the mothers quick glance at the strangers face as he rose was of the kind which inquires what effect has been produced and expects to find indications of surprise and admiration  this is my daughter hattiewe call her puss  its the new boarder puss  this without rising  the young englishman made the awkward bow common to his nationality and time of life in circumstances of delicacy and difficulty and these were of that sort for being taken by surprise his natural lifelong self sprang to the front and that self of course would not know just how to act when introduced to a chambermaid or to the heiress of a mechanics boarding house  his other selfthe self which recognized the equality of all menwould have managed the thing better if it hadnt been caught off guard and robbed of its chance  the young girl paid no attention to the bow but put out her hand frankly and gave the stranger a friendly shake and said  how do you do  then she marched to the one washstand in the room tilted her head this way and that before the wreck of a cheap mirror that hung above it dampened her fingers with her tongue perfected the circle of a little lock of hair that was pasted against her forehead then began to busy herself with the slops  well i must be goingits getting towards supper time  make yourself at home mr  tracy youll hear the bell when its ready  the landlady took her tranquil departure without commanding either of the young people to vacate the room  the young man wondered a little that a mother who seemed so honest and respectable should be so thoughtless and was reaching for his hat intending to disembarrass the girl of his presence but she said  where are you going  wellnowhere in particular but as i am only in the way here  why who said you were in the way  sit downill move you when you are in the way  she was making the beds now  he sat down and watched her deft and diligent performance  what gave you that notion  do you reckon i need a whole room just to make up a bed or two in  well no it wasnt that exactly  we are away up here in an empty house and your mother being gone  the girl interrupted him with an amused laugh and said  nobody to protect me  bless you i dont need it  im not afraid i might be if i was alone because i do hate ghosts and i dont deny it not that i believe in them for i dont  im only just afraid of them  how can you be afraid of them if you dont believe in them  oh i dont know the how of itthats too many for me i only know its so  its the same with maggie lee  who is that  one of the boarders young lady that works in the factry  she works in a factory  yes  shoe factory  in a shoe factory and you call her a young lady  why shes only twentytwo what should you call her  i wasnt thinking of her age i was thinking of the title  the fact is i came away from england to get away from artificial formsfor artificial forms suit artificial people onlyand here youve got them too  im sorry  i hoped you had only men and women everybody equal no differences in rank  the girl stopped with a pillow in her teeth and the case spread open below it contemplating him from under her brows with a slightly puzzled expression  she released the pillow and said  why they are all equal  wheres any difference in rank  if you call a factory girl a young lady what do you call the presidents wife  call her an old one  oh you make age the only distinction  there aint any other to make as far as i can see  then all women are ladies  certainly they are  all the respectable ones  well that puts a better face on it  certainly there is no harm in a title when it is given to everybody  it is only an offense and a wrong when it is restricted to a favored few  but misser  hattie  miss hattie be frank confess that that title isnt accorded by everybody to everybody  the rich american doesnt call her cook a lady isnt that so  yes its so  what of it  he was surprised and a little disappointed to see that his admirable shot had produced no perceptible effect  what of it he said  why this equality is not conceded here after all and the americans are no better off than the english  in fact theres no difference  now what an idea  theres nothing in a title except what is put into ityouve said that yourself  suppose the title is clean instead of lady  you get that  i believe so  instead of speaking of a woman as a lady you substitute clean and say shes a clean person  thats it  in england the swell folks dont speak of the working people as gentlemen and ladies  oh no  and the working people dont call themselves gentlemen and ladies  certainly not  so if you used the other word there wouldnt be any change  the swell people wouldnt call anybody but themselves clean and those others would drop sort of meekly into their way of talking and they wouldnt call themselves clean  we dont do that way here  everybody calls himself a lady or gentleman and thinks he is and dont care what anybody else thinks him so long as he dont say it out loud  you think theres no difference  you knuckle down and we dont  aint that a difference  it is a difference i hadnt thought of i admit that  stillcalling ones self a lady doesnter  i wouldnt go on if i were you  howard tracy turned his head to see who it might be that had introduced this remark  it was a short man about forty years old with sandy hair no beard and a pleasant face badly freckled but alive and intelligent and he wore slopshop clothing which was neat but showed wear  he had come from the front room beyond the hall where he had left his hat and he had a chipped and cracked white washbowl in his hand  the girl came and took the bowl  ill get it for you  you go right ahead and give it to him mr barrow  hes the new boardermr tracyand id just got to where it was getting too deep for me  much obliged if you will hattie  i was coming to borrow of the boys he sat down at his ease on an old trunk and said ive been listening and got interested and as i was saying i wouldnt go on if i were you you see where you are coming to dont you  calling yourself a lady doesnt elect you that is what you were going to say and you saw that if you said it you were going to run right up against another difference that you hadnt thought of towit whose right is it to do the electing over there twenty thousand people in a million elect themselves gentlemen and ladies and the nine hundred and eighty thousand accept that decree and swallow the affront which it puts upon them  why if they didnt accept it it wouldnt be an election it would be a dead letter and have no force at all  over here the twenty thousand wouldbe exclusives come up to the polls and vote themselves to be ladies and gentlemen  but the thing doesnt stop there  the nine hundred and eighty thousand come and vote themselves to be ladies and gentlemen too and that elects the whole nation  since the whole million vote themselves ladies and gentlemen there is no question about that election  it does make absolute equality and there is no fiction about it while over yonder the inequality by decree of the infinitely feeble and consent of the infinitely strong is also absoluteas real and absolute as our equality  tracy had shrunk promptly into his english shell when this speech began notwithstanding he had now been in severe training several weeks for contact and intercourse with the common herd on the common herds terms but he lost no time in pulling himself out again and so by the time the speech was finished his valves were open once more and he was forcing himself to accept without resentment the common herds frank fashion of dropping sociably into other peoples conversations unembarrassed and uninvited  the process was not very difficult this time for the mans smile and voice and manner were persuasive and winning  tracy would even have liked him on the spot but for the factfact which he was not really aware ofthat the equality of men was not yet a reality to him it was only a theory the mind perceived but the man failed to feel it it was hatties ghost over again merely turned around  theoretically barrow was his equal but it was distinctly distasteful to see him exhibit it  he presently said  i hope in all sincerity that what you have said is true as regards the americans for doubts have crept into my mind several times  it seemed that the equality must be ungenuine where the signnames of castes were still in vogue but those signnames have certainly lost their offence and are wholly neutralized nullified and harmless if they are the undisputed property of every individual in the nation  i think i realize that caste does not exist and cannot exist except by common consent of the masses outside of its limits  i thought caste created itself and perpetuated itself but it seems quite true that it only creates itself and is perpetuated by the people whom it despises and who can dissolve it at any time by assuming its mere signnames themselves  its what i think  there isnt any power on earth that can prevent englands thirty millions from electing themselves dukes and duchesses tomorrow and calling themselves so  and within six months all the former dukes and duchesses would have retired from the business i wish theyd try that  royalty itself couldnt survive such a process a handful of frowners against thirty million laughers in a state of irruption  why its herculaneum against vesuvius it would take another eighteen centuries to find that herculaneum after the cataclysm  whats a colonel in our south  hes a nobody because theyre all colonels down there  no tracy shudder from tracy nobody in england would call you a gentleman and you wouldnt call yourself one and i tell you its a state of things that makes a man put himself into most unbecoming attitudes sometimesthe broad and general recognition and acceptance of caste as caste does i mean  makes him do it unconsciouslybeing bred in him you see and never thought over and reasoned out  you couldnt conceive of the matterhorn being flattered by the notice of one of your comely little english hills could you  why no  well then let a man in his right mind try to conceive of darwin feeling flattered by the notice of a princess  its so grotesque that itwell it paralyzes the imagination  yet that memnon was flattered by the notice of that statuette he says sosays so himself  the system that can make a god disown his godship and profane itoh well its all wrong its all wrong and ought to be abolished i should say  the mention of darwin brought on a literary discussion and this topic roused such enthusiasm in barrow that he took off his coat and made himself the more free and comfortable for it and detained him so long that he was still at it when the noisy proprietors of the room came shouting and skylarking in and began to romp scuffle wash and otherwise entertain themselves  he lingered yet a little longer to offer the hospitalities of his room and his book shelf to tracy and ask him a personal question or two  what is your trade  theywell they call me a cowboy but that is a fancy  im not that i havent any trade  what do you work at for your living  oh anythingi mean i would work at anything i could get to do but thus far i havent been able to find an occupation  maybe i can help you id like to try  i shall be very glad  ive tried myself to weariness  well of course where a man hasnt a regular trade hes pretty bad off in this world  what you needed i reckon was less book learning and more breadandbutter learning  i dont know what your father could have been thinking of  you ought to have had a trade you ought to have had a trade by all means  but never mind about that well stir up something to do i guess  and dont you get homesick thats a bad business well talk the thing over and look around a little  youll come out all right  wait for meill go down to supper with you  by this time tracy had achieved a very friendly feeling for barrow and would have called him a friend maybe if not taken too suddenly on a straightout requirement to realize on his theories  he was glad of his society anyway and was feeling lighter hearted than before  also he was pretty curious to know what vocation it might be which had furnished barrow such a large acquaintanceship with books and allowed him so much time to read     chapter xii  presently the supper bell began to ring in the depths of the house and the sound proceeded steadily upward growing in intensity all the way up towards the upper floors  the higher it came the more maddening was the noise until at last what it lacked of being absolutely deafening was made up of the sudden crash and clatter of an avalanche of boarders down the uncarpeted stairway  the peerage did not go to meals in this fashion tracys training had not fitted him to enjoy this hilarious zoological clamor and enthusiasm  he had to confess that there was something about this extraordinary outpouring of animal spirits which he would have to get inured to before he could accept it  no doubt in time he would prefer it but he wished the process might be modified and made just a little more gradual and not quite so pronounced and violent barrow and tracy followed the avalanche down through an ever increasing and ever more and more aggressive stench of bygone cabbage and kindred smells smells which are to be found nowhere but in a cheap private boarding house smells which once encountered can never be forgotten smells which encountered generations later are instantly recognizable but never recognizable with pleasure  to tracy these odors were suffocating horrible almost unendurable but he held his peace and said nothing  arrived in the basement they entered a large diningroom where thirtyfive or forty people sat at a long table  they took their places the feast had already begun and the conversation was going on in the liveliest way from one end of the table to the other  the table cloth was of very coarse material and was liberally spotted with coffee stains and grease  the knives and forks were iron with bone handles the spoons appeared to be iron or sheet iron or something of the sort the tea and coffee cups were of the commonest and heaviest and most durable stone ware  all the furniture of the table was of the commonest and cheapest sort  there was a single large thick slice of bread by each boarders plate and it was observable that he economized it as if he were not expecting it to be duplicated  dishes of butter were distributed along the table within reach of peoples arms if they had long ones but there were no private butter plates  the butter was perhaps good enough and was quiet and well behaved but it had more bouquet than was necessary though nobody commented upon that fact or seemed in any way disturbed by it  the main feature of the feast was a piping hot irish stew made of the potatoes and meat left over from a procession of previous meals  everybody was liberally supplied with this dish  on the table were a couple of great dishes of sliced ham and there were some other eatables of minor importancepreserves and new orleans molasses and such things  there was also plenty of tea and coffee of an infernal sort with brown sugar and condensed milk but the milk and sugar supply was not left at the discretion of the boarders but was rationed out at headquartersone spoonful of sugar and one of condensed milk to each cup and no more  the table was waited upon by two stalwart negro women who raced back and forth from the bases of supplies with splendid dash and clatter and energy  their labors were supplemented after a fashion by the young girl puss  she carried coffee and tea back and forth among the boarders but she made pleasure excursions rather than business ones in this way to speak strictly she made jokes with various people  she chaffed the young men pleasantly and wittily as she supposed and as the rest also supposed apparently judging by the applause and laughter which she got by her efforts manifestly she was a favorite with most of the young fellows and sweetheart of the rest of them  where she conferred notice she conferred happiness as was seen by the face of the recipient and at the same time she conferred unhappinessone could see it fall and dim the faces of the other young fellows like a shadow  she never mistered these friends of hers but called them billy tom john and they called her puss or hattie  mr marsh sat at the head of the table his wife sat at the foot  marsh was a man of sixty and was an american but if he had been born a month earlier he would have been a spaniard  he was plenty good enough spaniard as it was his face was very dark his hair very black and his eyes were not only exceedingly black but were very intense and there was something about them that indicated that they could burn with passion upon occasion  he was stoopshouldered and leanfaced and the general aspect of him was disagreeable he was evidently not a very companionable person  if looks went for anything he was the very opposite of his wife who was all motherliness and charity good will and good nature all the young men and the women called her aunt rachael which was another sign  tracys wandering and interested eye presently fell upon one boarder who had been overlooked in the distribution of the stew he was very pale and looked as if he had but lately come out of a sick bed and also as if he ought to get back into it again as soon as possible  his face was very melancholy  the waves of laughter and conversation broke upon it without affecting it any more than if it had been a rock in the sea and the words and the laughter veritable waters he held his head down and looked ashamed  some of the women cast glances of pity toward him from time to time in a furtive and half afraid way and some of the youngest of the men plainly had compassion on the young fellowa compassion exhibited in their faces but not in any more active or compromising way  but the great majority of the people present showed entire indifference to the youth and his sorrows  marsh sat with his head down but one could catch the malicious gleam of his eyes through his shaggy brows  he was watching that young fellow with evident relish he had not neglected him through carelessness and apparently the table understood that fact  the spectacle was making mrs marsh very uncomfortable  she had the look of one who hopes against hope that the impossible may happen  but as the impossible did not happen she finally ventured to speak up and remind her husband that nat brady hadnt been helped to the irish stew  marsh lifted his head and gasped out with mock courtliness oh he hasnt hasnt he  what a pity that is  i dont know how i came to overlook him  ah he must pardon me  you must indeed mrerbaxter barker you must pardon me  iermy attention was directed to some other matter i dont know what  the thing that grieves me mainly is that it happens every meal now  but you must try to overlook these little things mr bunker these little neglects on my part  theyre always likely to happen with me in any case and they are especially likely to happen where a person haserwell where a person is say about three weeks in arrears for his board  you get my meaningyou get my idea  here is your irish stew anderit gives me the greatest pleasure to send it to you and i hope that you will enjoy the charity as much as i enjoy conferring it  a blush rose in bradys white cheeks and flowed slowly backward to his ears and upward toward his forehead but he said nothing and began to eat his food under the embarrassment of a general silence and the sense that all eyes were fastened upon him  barrow whispered to tracy  the old mans been waiting for that  he wouldnt have missed that chance for anything  its a brutal business said tracy  then he said to himself purposing to set the thought down in his diary later  well here in this very house is a republic where all are free and equal if men are free and equal anywhere in the earth therefore i have arrived at the place i started to find and i am a man among men and on the strictest equality possible to men no doubt  yet here on the threshold i find an inequality  there are people at this table who are looked up to for some reason or another and here is a poor devil of a boy who is looked down upon treated with indifference and shamed by humiliations when he has committed no crime but that common one of being poor  equality ought to make men nobleminded  in fact i had supposed it did do that  after supper barrow proposed a walk and they started  barrow had a purpose  he wanted tracy to get rid of that cowboy hat  he didnt see his way to finding mechanical or manual employment for a person rigged in that fashion  barrow presently said  as i understand it youre not a cowboy  no im not  well now if you will not think me too curious how did you come to mount that hat  whered you get it  tracy didnt know quite how to reply to this but presently said  well without going into particulars i exchanged clothes with a stranger under stress of weather and i would like to find him and reexchange  well why dont you find him  where is he  i dont know  i supposed the best way to find him would be to continue to wear his clothes which are conspicuous enough to attract his attention if i should meet him on the street  oh very well said barrow the rest of the outfit is well enough and while its not too conspicuous it isnt quite like the clothes that anybody else wears  suppress the hat  when you meet your man hell recognize the rest of his suit  thats a mighty embarrassing hat you know in a centre of civilization like this  i dont believe an angel could get employment in washington in a halo like that  tracy agreed to replace the hat with something of a modester form and they stepped aboard a crowded car and stood with others on the rear platform  presently as the car moved swiftly along the rails two men crossing the street caught sight of the backs of barrow and tracy and both exclaimed at once there he is  it was sellers and hawkins both were so paralyzed with joy that before they could pull themselves together and make an effort to stop the car it was gone too far and they decided to wait for the next one  they waited a while then it occurred to washington that there could be no use in chasing one horsecar with another and he wanted to hunt up a hack  but the colonel said  when you come to think of it theres no occasion for that at all now that ive got him materialized i can command his motions  ill have him at the house by the time we get there  then they hurried off home in a state of great and joyful excitement  the hat exchange accomplished the two new friends started to walk back leisurely to the boarding house  barrows mind was full of curiosity about this young fellow  he said  youve never been to the rocky mountains  no  youve never been out on the plains  no  how long have you been in this country  only a few days  youve never been in america before  then barrow communed with himself  now what odd shapes the notions of romantic people take  heres a young fellow whos read in england about cowboys and adventures on the plains  he comes here and buys a cowboys suit  thinks he can play himself on folks for a cowboy all inexperienced as he is  now the minute hes caught in this poor little game hes ashamed of it and ready to retire from it  it is that exchange that he has put up as an explanation  its rather thin too thin altogether  well hes young never been anywhere knows nothing about the world sentimental no doubt  perhaps it was the natural thing for him to do but it was a most singular choice curious freak altogether  both men were busy with their thoughts for a time then tracy heaved a sigh and said  mr barrow the case of that young fellow troubles me  you mean nat brady  yes brady or baxter or whatever it was  the old landlord called him by several different names  oh yes he has been very liberal with names for brady since brady fell into arrears for his board  well thats one of his sarcasmsthe old man thinks hes great on sarcasm  well what is bradys difficulty  what is bradywho is he  brady is a tinner  hes a young journeyman tinner who was getting along all right till he fell sick and lost his job  he was very popular before he lost his job everybody in the house liked brady  the old man was rather especially fond of him but you know that when a man loses his job and loses his ability to support himself and to pay his way as he goes it makes a great difference in the way people look at him and feel about him  is that so  is it so  barrow looked at tracy in a puzzled way  why of course its so wouldnt you know that naturally  dont you know that the wounded deer is always attacked and killed by its companions and friends  tracy said to himself while a chilly and boding discomfort spread itself through his system in a republic of deer and men where all are free and equal misfortune is a crime and the prosperous gore the unfortunate to death  then he said aloud here in the boarding house if one would have friends and be popular instead of having the cold shoulder turned upon him he must be prosperous  yes barrow said that is so  its their human nature  they do turn against brady now that hes unfortunate and they dont like him as well as they did before but it isnt because of any lack in bradyhes just as he was before has the same nature and the same impulses but they well brady is a thorn in their consciences you see  they know they ought to help him and theyre too stingy to do it and theyre ashamed of themselves for that and they ought also to hate themselves on that account but instead of that they hate brady because he makes them ashamed of themselves  i say thats human nature that occurs everywhere this boarding house is merely the world in little its the case all overtheyre all alike  in prosperity we are popular popularity comes easy in that case but when the other thing comes our friends are pretty likely to turn against us  tracys noble theories and high purposes were beginning to feel pretty damp and clammy  he wondered if by any possibility he had made a mistake in throwing his own prosperity to the winds and taking up the cross of other peoples unprosperity  but he wouldnt listen to that sort of thing he cast it out of his mind and resolved to go ahead resolutely along the course he had mapped out for himself  extracts from his diary  have now spent several days in this singular hive  i dont know quite what to make out of these people  they have merits and virtues but they have some other qualities and some ways that are hard to get along with i cant enjoy them  the moment i appeared in a hat of the period i noticed a change  the respect which had been paid me before passed suddenly away and the people became friendlymore than thatthey became familiar and im not used to familiarity and cant take to it right off i find that out  these peoples familiarity amounts to impudence sometimes  i suppose its all right no doubt i can get used to it but its not a satisfactory process at all  i have accomplished my dearest wish i am a man among men on an equal footing with tom dick and harry and yet it isnt just exactly what i thought it was going to be  ii miss home  am obliged to say i am homesick  another thing and this is a confessiona reluctant one but i will make it the thing i miss most and most severely is the respect the deference with which i was treated all my life in england and which seems to be somehow necessary to me  i get along very well without the luxury and the wealth and the sort of society ive been accustomed to but i do miss the respect and cant seem to get reconciled to the absence of it  there is respect there is deference here but it doesnt fall to my share  it is lavished on two men  one of them is a portly man of middle age who is a retired plumber  everybody is pleased to have that mans notice hes full of pomp and circumstance and self complacency and bad grammar and at table he is sir oracle and when he opens his mouth not any dog in the kennel barks  the other person is a policeman at the capitolbuilding  he represents the government  the deference paid to these two men is not so very far short of that which is paid to an earl in england though the method of it differs  not so much courtliness but the deference is all there  yes and there is obsequiousness too  it does rather look as if in a republic where all are free and equal prosperity and position constitute rank     chapter xiii  the days drifted by and they grew ever more dreary  for barrows efforts to find work for tracy were unavailing  always the first question asked was what union do you belong to  tracy was obliged to reply that he didnt belong to any tradeunion  very well then its impossible to employ you  my men wouldnt stay with me if i should employ a scab or rat or whatever the phrase was  finally tracy had a happy thought  he said why the thing for me to do of course is to join a tradeunion  yes barrow said that is the thing for you to doif you can  if i can  is it difficult  well yes barrow said its sometimes difficultin fact very difficult  but you can try and of course it will be best to try  therefore tracy tried but he did not succeed  he was refused admission with a good deal of promptness and was advised to go back home where he belonged not come here taking honest mens bread out of their mouths tracy began to realize that the situation was desperate and the thought made him cold to the marrow  he said to himself so there is an aristocracy of position here and an aristocracy of prosperity and apparently there is also an aristocracy of the ins as opposed to the outs and i am with the outs  so the ranks grow daily here  plainly there are all kinds of castes here and only one that i belong to the outcasts  but he couldnt even smile at his small joke although he was obliged to confess that he had a rather good opinion of it  he was feeling so defeated and miserable by this time that he could no longer look with philosophical complacency on the horseplay of the young fellows in the upper rooms at night  at first it had been pleasant to see them unbend and have a good time after having so well earned it by the labors of the day but now it all rasped upon his feelings and his dignity he lost patience with the spectacle  when they were feeling good they shouted they scuffled they sang songs they romped about the place like cattle and they generally wound up with a pillow fight in which they banged each other over the head and threw the pillows in all directions and every now and then he got a buffet himself and they were always inviting him to join in  they called him johnny bull and invited him with excessive familiarity to take a hand  at first he had endured all this with good nature but latterly he had shown by his manner that it was distinctly distasteful to him and very soon he saw a change in the manner of these young people toward him  they were souring on him as they would have expressed it in their language  he had never been what might be called popular  that was hardly the phrase for it he had merely been liked but now dislike for him was growing  his case was not helped by the fact that he was out of luck couldnt get work didnt belong to a union and couldnt gain admission to one  he got a good many slights of that small illdefined sort that you cant quite put your finger on and it was manifest that there was only one thing which protected him from open insult and that was his muscle  these young people had seen him exercising mornings after his cold sponge bath and they had perceived by his performance and the build of his body that he was athletic and also versed in boxing  he felt pretty naked now recognizing that he was shorn of all respect except respect for his fists  one night when he entered his room he found about a dozen of the young fellows there carrying on a very lively conversation punctuated with horselaughter  the talking ceased instantly and the frank affront of a dead silence followed  he said  good evening gentlemen and sat down  there was no response  he flushed to the temples but forced himself to maintain silence  he sat there in this uncomfortable stillness some time then got up and went out  the moment he had disappeared he heard a prodigious shout of laughter break forth  he saw that their plain purpose had been to insult him he ascended to the flat roof hoping to be able to cool down his spirit there and get back his tranquility  he found the young tinner up there alone and brooding and entered into conversation with him  they were pretty fairly matched now in unpopularity and general illluck and misery and they had no trouble in meeting upon this common ground with advantage and something of comfort to both  but tracys movements had been watched and in a few minutes the tormentors came straggling one after another to the roof where they began to stroll up and down in an apparently purposeless way  but presently they fell to dropping remarks that were evidently aimed at tracy and some of them at the tinner the ringleader of this little mob was a shorthaired bully and amateur prizefighter named allen who was accustomed to lording it over the upper floor and had more than once shown a disposition to make trouble with tracy  now there was an occasional catcall and hootings and whistlings and finally the diversion of an exchange of connected remarks was introduced  how many does it take to make a pair  well two generally makes a pair but sometimes there aint stuff enough in them to make a whole pair  general laugh  what were you saying about the english a while ago  oh nothing the english are all right onlyi  what was it you said about them  oh i only said they swallow well  swallow better than other people  oh yes the english swallow a good deal better than other people  what is it they swallow best  oh insults  another general laugh  pretty hard to make em fight aint it  no taint hard to make em fight  aint it really  no taint hard  its impossible  another laugh  this ones kind of spiritless thats certain  couldnt be the other wayin his case  why  dont you know the secret of his birth  no has he got a secret of his birth  you bet he has  what is it  his father was a waxfigger  allen came strolling by where the pair were sitting stopped and said to the tinner  how are you off for friends these days  well enough off  got a good many  well as many as i need  a friend is valuable sometimesas a protector you know  what do you reckon would happen if i was to snatch your cap off and slap you in the face with it  please dont trouble me mr  allen i aint doing anything to you  you answer me  what do you reckon would happen  well i dont know  tracy spoke up with a good deal of deliberation and said  dont trouble the young fellow i can tell you what would happen  oh you can can you  boys johnny bull can tell us what would happen if i was to snatch this chumps cap off and slap him in the face with it now youll see  he snatched the cap and struck the youth in the face and before he could inquire what was going to happen it had already happened and he was warming the tin with the broad of his back  instantly there was a rush and shouts of  a ring a ring make a ring  fair play all round  johnnys grit give him a chance  the ring was quickly chalked on the tin and tracy found himself as eager to begin as he could have been if his antagonist had been a prince instead of a mechanic  at bottom he was a little surprised at this because although his theories had been all in that direction for some time he was not prepared to find himself actually eager to measure strength with quite so common a man as this ruffian  in a moment all the windows in the neighborhood were filled with people and the roofs also the men squared off and the fight began  but allen stood no chance whatever against the young englishman  neither in muscle nor in science was he his equal  he measured his length on the tin time and again in fact as fast as he could get up he went down again and the applause was kept up in liberal fashion from all the neighborhood around finally allen had to be helped up  then tracy declined to punish him further and the fight was at an end  allen was carried off by some of his friends in a very much humbled condition his face black and blue and bleeding and tracy was at once surrounded by the young fellows who congratulated him and told him that he had done the whole house a service and that from this out mr allen would be a little more particular about how he handled slights and insults and maltreatment around amongst the boarders  tracy was a hero now and exceedingly popular  perhaps nobody had ever been quite so popular on that upper floor before  but if being discountenanced by these young fellows had been hard to bear their lavish commendations and approval and heroworship was harder still to endure  he felt degraded but he did not allow himself to analyze the reasons why too closely  he was content to satisfy himself with the suggestion that he looked upon himself as degraded by the public spectacle which he had made of himself fighting on a tin roof for the delectation of everybody a block or two around  but he wasnt entirely satisfied with that explanation of it  once he went a little too far and wrote in his diary that his case was worse than that of the prodigal son he said the prodigal son merely fed swine he didnt have to chum with them  but he struck that out and said all men are equal  i will not disown my principles  these men are as good as i am  tracy was become popular on the lower floors also  everybody was grateful for allens reduction to the ranks and for his transformation from a doer of outrages to a mere threatener of them  the young girls of whom there were half a dozen showed many attentions to tracy particularly that boarding house pet hattie the landladys daughter she said to him very sweetly  i think youre ever so nice  and when he said im glad you think so miss hattie she said still more sweetly  dont call me miss hattiecall me puss  ah here was promotion  he had struck the summit  there were no higher heights to climb in that boarding house  his popularity was complete  in the presence of people tracy showed a tranquil outside but his heart was being eaten out of him by distress and despair  in a little while he should be out of money and then what should he do he wished now that he had borrowed a little more liberally from that strangers store  he found it impossible to sleep  a single torturing terrifying thought went racking round and round in his head wearing a groove in his brain what should he dowhat was to become of him  and along with it began to intrude a something presently which was very like a wish that he had not joined the great and noble ranks of martyrdom but had stayed at home and been content to be merely an earl and nothing better with nothing more to do in this world of a useful sort than an earl finds to do  but he smothered that part of his thought as well as he could he made every effort to drive it away and with fair keep it from intruding a little  success but he couldnt now and then and when it intruded it came suddenly and nipped him like a bite a sting a burn he recognized that thought by the peculiar sharpness of its pang  the others were painful enough but that one cut to the quick when it calm night after night he lay tossing to the music of the hideous snoring of the honest breadwinners until two and three oclock in the morning then got up and took refuge on the roof where he sometimes got a nap and sometimes failed entirely  his appetite was leaving him and the zest of life was going along with it  finally owe day being near the imminent verge of total discouragement he said to himselfand took occasion to blush privately when he said it if my father knew what my american name ishewell my duty to my father rather requires that i furnish him my name  i have no right to make his days and nights unhappy i can do enough unhappiness for the family all by myself  really he ought to know what my american name is  he thought over it a while and framed a cablegram in his mind to this effect  my american name is howard tracy  that wouldnt be suggesting anything  his father could understand that as he chose and doubtless he would understand it as it was meant as a dutiful and affectionate desire on the part of a son to make his old father happy for a moment  continuing his train of thought tracy said to himself ah but if he should cable me to come home  iicouldnt do thati mustnt do that  ive started out on a mission and i mustnt turn my back on it in cowardice  no no i couldnt go home atat least i shouldnt want to go home  after a reflective pause well maybeperhapsit would be my duty to go in the circumstances hes very old and he does need me by him to stay his footsteps down the long hill that inclines westward toward the sunset of his life  well ill think about that  yes of course it wouldnt be right to stay here  if i well perhaps i could just drop him a line and put it off a little while and satisfy him in that way  it would bewell it would mar everything to have him require me to come instantly  another reflective pause then and yet if he should do that i dont know butoh dear mehome how good it sounds and a body is excusable for wanting to see his home again now and then anyway  he went to one of the telegraph offices in the avenue and got the first end of what barrow called the usual washington courtesy where they treat you as a tramp until they find out youre a congressman and then they slobber all over you  there was a boy of seventeen on duty there tying his shoe  he had his foot on a chair and his back turned towards the wicket  he glanced over his shoulder took tracys measure turned back and went on tying his shoe  tracy finished writing his telegram and waited still waited and still waited for that performance to finish but there didnt seem to be any finish to it so finally tracy said  cant you take my telegram  the youth looked over his shoulder and said by his manner not his words  dont you think you could wait a minute if you tried  however he got the shoe tied at last and came and took the telegram glanced over it then looked up surprised at tracy  there was something in his look that bordered upon respect almost reverence it seemed to tracy although he had been so long without anything of this kind he was not sure that he knew the signs of it  the boy read the address aloud with pleased expression in face and voice  the earl of rossmore  cracky  do you know him  yes  is that so  does he know you  wellyes  well i swear  will he answer you  i think he will  will he though  wherell you have it sent  oh nowhere  ill call here and get it  when shall i call  oh i dont knowill send it to you  where shall i send it  give me your address ill send it to you soons it comes  but tracy didnt propose to do this  he had acquired the boys admiration and deferential respect and he wasnt willing to throw these precious things away a result sure to follow if he should give the address of that boarding house  so he said again that he would call and get the telegram and went his way  he idled along reflecting  he said to himself there is something pleasant about being respected  i have acquired the respect of mr allen and some of those others and almost the deference of some of them on pure merit for having thrashed allen  while their respect and their deferenceif it is deferenceis pleasant a deference based upon a sham a shadow does really seem pleasanter still  its no real merit to be in correspondence with an earl and yet after all that boy makes me feel as if there was  the cablegram was actually gone home the thought of it gave him an immense uplift  he walked with a lighter tread  his heart was full of happiness  he threw aside all hesitances and confessed to himself that he was glad through and through that he was going to give up this experiment and go back to his home again  his eagerness to get his fathers answer began to grow now and it grew with marvelous celerity after it began  he waited an hour walking about putting in his time as well as he could but interested in nothing that came under his eye and at last he presented himself at the office again and asked if any answer had come yet  the boy said  no no answer yet then glanced at the clock and added i dont think its likely youll get one today  why not  well you see its getting pretty late  you cant always tell where bouts a man is when hes on the other side and you cant always find him just the minute you want him and you see its getting about six oclock now and over there its pretty late at night  why yes said tracy i hadnt thought of that  yes pretty late now half past ten or eleven  oh yes you probably wont get any answer tonight     chapter xiv  so tracy went home to supper  the odors in that supper room seemed more strenuous and more horrible than ever before and he was happy in the thought that he was so soon to be free from them again  when the supper was over he hardly knew whether he had eaten any of it or not and he certainly hadnt heard any of the conversation  his heart had been dancing all the time his thoughts had been faraway from these things and in the visions of his mind the sumptuous appointments of his fathers castle had risen before him without rebuke  even the plushed flunkey that walking symbol of a sham inequality had not been unpleasant to his dreaming view  after the meal barrow said  come with me  ill give you a jolly evening  very good  where are you going  to my club  what club is that  mechanics debating club  tracy shuddered slightly  he didnt say anything about having visited that place himself  somehow he didnt quite relish the memory of that time  the sentiments which had made his former visit there so enjoyable and filled him with such enthusiasm had undergone a gradual change and they had rotted away to such a degree that he couldnt contemplate another visit there with anything strongly resembling delight  in fact he was a little ashamed to go he didnt want to go there and find out by the rude impact of the thought of those people upon his reorganized condition of mind how sharp the change had been  he would have preferred to stay away  he expected that now he should hear nothing except sentiments which would be a reproach to him in his changed mental attitude and he rather wished he might be excused  and yet he didnt quite want to say that he didnt want to show how he did feel or show any disinclination to go and so he forced himself to go along with barrow privately purposing to take an early opportunity to get away  after the essayist of the evening had read his paper the chairman announced that the debate would now be upon the subject of the previous meeting the american press  it saddened the backsliding disciple to hear this announcement  it brought up too many reminiscences  he wished he had happened upon some other subject  but the debate began and he sat still and listened  in the course of the discussion one of the speakersa blacksmith named tompkinsarraigned all monarchs and all lords in the earth for their cold selfishness in retaining their unearned dignities  he said that no monarch and no son of a monarch no lord and no son of a lord ought to be able to look his fellow man in the face without shame  shame for consenting to keep his unearned titles property and privilegesat the expense of other people shame for consenting to remain on any terms in dishonourable possession of these things which represented bygone robberies and wrongs inflicted upon the general people of the nation he said if there were a laid or the son of a lord here i would like to reason with him and try to show him how unfair and how selfish his position is  i would try to persuade him to relinquish it take his place among men on equal terms earn the bread he eats and hold of slight value all deference paid him because of artificial position all reverence not the just due of his own personal merits  tracy seemed to be listening to utterances of his own made in talks with his radical friends in england  it was as if some eavesdropping phonograph had treasured up his words and brought them across the atlantic to accuse him with them in the hour of his defection and retreat  every word spoken by this stranger seemed to leave a blister on tracys conscience and by the time the speech was finished he felt that he was all conscience and one blister  this mans deep compassion for the enslaved and oppressed millions in europe who had to bear with the contempt of that small class above them throned upon shining heights whose paths were shut against them was the very thing he had often uttered himself  the pity in this mans voice and words was the very twin of the pity that used to reside in his own heart and come from his own lips when he thought of these oppressed peoples  the homeward tramp was accomplished in brooding silence  it was a silence most grateful to tracys feelings  he wouldnt have broken it for anything for he was ashamed of himself all the way through to his spine  he kept saying to himself  how unanswerable it all ishow absolutely unanswerable  it is basely degradingly selfish to keep those unearned honors andandoh hang it nobody but a cur  what an idiotic damned speech that tompkins made  this outburst was from barrow  it flooded tracys demoralized soul with waters of refreshment  these were the darlingest words the poor vacillating young apostate had ever heardfor they whitewashed his shame for him and that is a good service to have when you cant get the best of all verdicts selfacquittal  come up to my room and smoke a pipe tracy  tracy had been expecting this invitation and had had his declination all ready but he was glad enough to accept now  was it possible that a reasonable argument could be made against that mans desolating speech he was burning to hear barrow try it  he knew how to start him and keep him going it was to seem to combat his positionsa process effective with most people  what is it you object to in tompkinss speech barrow  oh the leaving out of the factor of human nature requiring another man to do what you wouldnt do yourself  do you mean  why heres what i mean its very simple  tompkins is a blacksmith has a family works for wages and hard toofooling around wont furnish the bread  suppose it should turn out that by the death of somebody in england he is suddenly an earlincome half a million dollars a year what would he do  well ii suppose he would have to decline to  man he would grab it in a second  do you really think he would  thinki dont think anything about it i know it  why  because hes not a fool  so you think that if he were a fool he  no i dont  fool or no fool he would grab it  anybody would anybody thats alive  and ive seen dead people that would get up and go for it  i would myself  this was balm this was healing this was rest and peace and comfort  but i thought you were opposed to nobilities  transmissible ones yes  but thats nothing  im opposed to millionaires but it would be dangerous to offer me the position  youd take it  i would leave the funeral of my dearest enemy to go and assume its burdens and responsibilities  tracy thought a while then said  i dont know that i quite get the bearings of your position  you say you are opposed to hereditary nobilities and yet if you had the chance you would  take one  in a minute i would  and there isnt a mechanic in that entire club that wouldnt  there isnt a lawyer doctor editor author tinker loafer railroad president saintland there isnt a human being in the united states that wouldnt jump at the chance  except me said tracy softly  except you   barrow could hardly get the words out his scorn so choked him  and he couldnt get any further than that form of words it seemed to dam his flow utterly  he got up and came and glared upon tracy in a kind of outraged and unappeasable way and said again except you  he walked around himinspecting him from one point of view and then another and relieving his soul now and then by exploding that formula at him except you  finally he slumped down into his chair with the air of one who gives it up and said  hes straining his viscera and hes breaking his heart trying to get some lowdown job that a good dog wouldnt have and yet wants to let on that if he had a chance to scoop an earldom he wouldnt do it  tracy dont put this kind of a strain on me  lately im not as strong as i was  well i wasnt meaning to puta strain on you barrow i was only meaning to intimate that if an earldom ever does fall in my way  therei wouldnt give myself any worry about that if i was you  and besides i can settle what you would do  are you any different from me  wellno  are you any better than me  oerwhy certainly not  are you as good  come  indeed ithe fact is you take me so suddenly  suddenly  what is there sudden about it  it isnt a difficult question is it  or doubtful  just measure us on the only fair linesthe lines of meritand of course youll admit that a journeyman chairmaker that earns his twenty dollars a week and has had the good and genuine culture of contact with men and care and hardship and failure and success and downs and ups and ups and downs is just a trifle the superior of a young fellow like you who doesnt know how to do anything thats valuable cant earn his living in any secure and steady way hasnt had any experience of life and its seriousness hasnt any culture but the artificial culture of books which adorns but doesnt really educate come if i wouldnt scorn an earldom what the devil right have you to do it  tracy dissembled his joy though he wanted to thank the chairmaker for that last remark  presently a thought struck him and he spoke up briskly and said  but look here i really cant quite get the hang of your notionsyour principles if they are principles  you are inconsistent  you are opposed to aristocracies yet youd take an earldom if you could  am i to understand that you dont blame an earl for being and remaining an earl  i certainly dont  and you wouldnt blame tompkins or yourself or me or anybody for accepting an earldom if it was offered  indeed i wouldnt  well then who would you blame  the whole nationany bulk and mass of population anywhere in any country that will put up with the infamy the outrage the insult of a hereditary aristocracy which they cant enterand on absolutely free and equal terms  come arent you beclouding yourself with distinctions that are not differences  indeed i am not  i am entirely clearheaded about this thing  if i could extirpate an aristocratic system by declining its honors then i should be a rascal to accept them  and if enough of the mass would join me to make the extirpation possible then i should be a rascal to do otherwise than help in the attempt  i believe i understandyes i think i get the idea  you have no blame for the lucky few who naturally decline to vacate the pleasant nest they were born into you only despise the allpowerful and stupid mass of the nation for allowing the nest to exist  thats it thats it  you can get a simple thing through your head if you work at it long enough  thanks  dont mention it  and ill give you some sound advice when you go back if you find your nation up and ready to abolish that hoary affront lend a hand but if that isnt the state of things and you get a chance at an earldom dont you be a foolyou take it  tracy responded with earnestness and enthusiasm  as i live ill do it  barrow laughed  i never saw such a fellow  i begin to think youve got a good deal of imagination  with you the idlestfancy freezes into a reality at a breath  why you looked then as if it wouldnt astonish you if you did tumble into an earldom  tracy blushed  barrow added earldom  oh yes take it if it offers but meantime well go on looking around in a modest way and if you get a chance to superintend a sausagestuffer at six or eight dollars a week you just trade off the earldom for a last years almanac and stick to the sausagestuffing     chapter xv  tracy went to bed happy once more at rest in his mind once more  he had started out on a high emprisethat was to his credit he argued he had fought the best fight he could considering the odds against himthat was to his credit he had been defeatedcertainly there was nothing discreditable in that  being defeated he had a right to retire with the honors of war and go back without prejudice to the position in the worlds society to which he had been born  why not even the rabid republican chairmaker would do that  yes his conscience was comfortable once more  he woke refreshed happy and eager for his cablegram  he had been born an aristocrat he had been a democrat for a time he was now an aristocrat again  he marveled to find that this final change was not merely intellectual it had invaded his feeling and he also marveled to note that this feeling seemed a good deal less artificial than any he had entertained in his system for a long time  he could also have noted if he had thought of it that his bearing had stiffened over night and that his chin had lifted itself a shade  arrived in the basement he was about to enter the breakfast room when he saw old marsh in the dim light of a corner of the hall beckoning him with his finger to approach the blood welled slowly up in tracys cheek and he said with a grade of injured dignity almost ducal  is that for me  yes  what is the purpose of it  i want to speak to youin private  this spot is private enough for me  marsh was surprised and not particularly pleased  he approached and said  oh in public then if you prefer  though it hasnt been my way  the boarders gathered to the spot interested  speak out said tracy  what is it you want  well havent youerforgot something  i  im not aware of it  oh youre not  now you stop and think a minute  i refuse to stop and think  it doesnt interest me  if it interests you speak out  well then said marsh raising his voice to a slightly angry pitch you forgot to pay your board yesterdayif youre bound to have it public  oh yes this heir to an annual million or so had been dreaming and soaring and had forgotten that pitiful three or four dollars  for penalty he must have it coarsely flung in his face in the presence of these peoplepeople in whose countenances was already beginning to dawn an uncharitable enjoyment of the situation  is that all  take your money and give your terrors a rest  tracys hand went down into his pocket with angry decision  butit didnt come out  the color began to ebb out of his face  the countenances about him showed a growing interest and some of them a heightened satisfaction  there was an uncomfortable pausethen he forced out with difficulty the words  ivebeen robbed  old marshs eyes flamed up with spanish fire and he exclaimed  robbed is it  thats your tune  its too oldbeen played in this house too often everybody plays it that cant get work when he wants it and wont work when he can get it  trot out mr allen somebody and let him take a toot at it  its his turn next he forgot too last night im laying for him  one of the negro women came scrambling down stairs as pale as a sorrel horse with consternation and excitement  misto marsh misto allens skipped out  what  yessah and cleaned out his room clean tuck bofe towels en de soap  you lie you hussy  its jes so jes as i tells youen misto summers socks is gone en misto naylors yuther shirt  mr marsh was at boiling point by this time  he turned upon tracy  answer up nowwhen are you going to settle  todaysince you seem to be in a hurry  today is it  sundayand you out of work  i like that  comewhere are you going to get the money  tracys spirit was rising again  he proposed to impress these people  i am expecting a cablegram from home  old marsh was caught out with the surprise of it  the idea was so immense so extravagant that he couldnt get his breath at first  when he did get it it came rancid with sarcasm  a cablegramthink of it ladies and gents hes expecting a cablegram hes expecting a cablegramthis duffer this scrub this bilk  from his fathereh  yeswithout a doubt  a dollar or two a wordoh thats nothingthey dont mind a little thing like thatthis kinds fathers dont  now his father iserwell i reckon his father  my father is an english earl  the crowd fell back aghastaghast at the sublimity of the young loafers cheek  then they burst into a laugh that made the windows rattle tracy was too angry to realize that he had done a foolish thing  he said  stand aside please  i  wait a minute your lordship said marsh bowing low where is your lordship going  for the cablegram  let me pass  excuse me your lordship youll stay right where you are  what do you mean by that  i mean that i didnt begin to keep boardinghouse yesterday  it means that i am not the kind that can be taken in by every hackdrivers son that comes loafing over here because he cant bum a living at home  it means that you cant skip out on any such  tracy made a step toward the old man but mrs  marsh sprang between and said  dont mr tracy please  she turned to her husband and said do bridle your tongue  what has he done to be treated so  cant you see he has lost his mind with trouble and distress  hes not responsible  thank your kind heart madam but ive not lost my mind and if i can have the mere privilege of stepping to the telegraph office  well you cant cried marsh  or sending  sending  that beats everything  if theres anybody thats fool enough to go on such a chuckleheaded errand  here comes mr barrowhe will go for me  barrow  a brisk fire of exclamations broke out  say barrow hes expecting a cablegram  cablegram from his father you know  yescablegram from the waxfigger  and say barrow this fellows an earltake off your hat pull down your vest  yes hes come off and forgot his crown that he wears sundays  hes cabled over to his pappy to send it  you step out and get that cablegram barrow his majestys a little lame today  oh stop cried barrow give the man a chance  he turned and said with some severity tracy whats the matter with you  what kind of foolishness is this youve been talking  you ought to have more sense  ive not been talking foolishness and if youll go to the telegraph office  oh dont talk so  im your friend in trouble and out of it before your face and behind your back for anything in reason but youve lost your head you see and this moonshine about a cablegram  ill go there and ask for it  thank you from the bottom of my heart brady  here ill give you a written order for it  fly now and fetch it  well soon see  brady flew  immediately the sort of quiet began to steal over the crowd which means dawning doubt misgiving and might be translated into the words maybe he is expecting a cablegrammaybe he has got a father somewheremaybe weve been just a little too fresh just a shade too previous  loud talk ceased then the mutterings and low murmurings and whisperings died out  the crowd began to crumble apart  by ones and twos the fragments drifted to the breakfast table  barrow tried to bring tracy in but he said  not yet barrowpresently  mrs marsh and hattie tried offering gentle and kindly persuasions but he said  i would rather waittill he comes  even old marsh began to have suspicions that maybe he had been a trifle too brash as he called it in the privacy of his soul and he pulled himself together and started toward tracy with invitation in his eyes but tracy warned him off with a gesture which was quite positive and eloquent  then followed the stillest quarter of an hour which had ever been known in that house at that time of day  it was so still and so solemn withal that when somebodys cup slipped from his fingers and landed in his plate the shock made people start and the sharp sound seemed as indecorous there and as out of place as if a coffin and mourners were imminent and being waited for  and at last when bradys feet came clattering down the stairs the sacrilege seemed unbearable everybody rose softly and turned toward the door where stood tracy then with a common impulse moved a step or two in that direction and stopped  while they gazed young brady arrived panting and put into tracys handsure enoughan envelope  tracy fastened a bland victorious eye upon the gazers and kept it there till one by one they dropped their eyes vanquished and embarrassed  then he tore open the telegram and glanced at its message  the yellow paper fell from his fingers and fluttered to the floor and his face turned white  there was nothing there but one word  thanks  the humorist of the house the tall rawboned billy nash caulker from the navy yard was standing in the rear of the crowd  in the midst of the pathetic silence that was now brooding over the place and moving some few hearts there toward compassion he began to whimper then he put his handkerchief to his eyes and buried his face in the neck of the bashfulest young fellow in the company a navyyard blacksmith shrieked oh pappy how could you and began to bawl like a teething baby if one may imagine a baby with the energy and the devastating voice of a jackass  so perfect was that imitation of a childs cry and so vast the scale of it and so ridiculous the aspect of the performer that all gravity was swept from the place as if by a hurricane and almost everybody there joined in the crash of laughter provoked by the exhibition  then the small mob began to take its revengerevenge for the discomfort and apprehension it had brought upon itself by its own too rash freshness of a little while before  it guyed its poor victim baited him worried him as dogs do with a cornered cat  the victim answered back with defiances and challenges which included everybody and which only gave the sport new spirit and variety but when he changed his tactics and began to single out individuals and invite them by name the fun lost its funniness and the interest of the show died out along with the noise  finally marsh was about to take an innings but barrow said  never mind nowleave him alone  youve no account with him but a money account  ill take care of that myself  the distressed and worried landlady gave barrow a fervently grateful look for his championship of the abused stranger and the pet of the house a very prism in her cheap but ravishing sunday rig blew him a kiss from the tips of her fingers and said with the darlingest smile and a sweet little toss of her head  youre the only man here and im going to set my cap for you you dear old thing  for shame puss  how you talk  i never saw such a child  it took a good deal of argument and persuasionthat is to say petting under these disguisesto get tracy to entertain the idea of breakfast he at first said he would never eat again in that house and added that he had enough firmness of character he trusted to enable him to starve like a man when the alternative was to eat insult with his bread  when he had finished his breakfast barrow took him to his room furnished him a pipe and said cheerily  now old fellow take in your battleflag out of the wet youre not in the hostile camp any more  youre a little upset by your troubles and thats natural enough but dont let your mind run on them anymore than you can help drag your thoughts away from your troubles by the ears by the heels or any other way so you manage it its the healthiest thing a body can do dwelling on troubles is deadly just deadlyand thats the softest name there is for it  you must keep your mind amusedyou must indeed  oh miserable me  dont  theres just pure heartbreak in that tone  its just as i say youve got to get right down to it and amuse your mind as if it was salvation  theyre easy words to say barrow but how am i going to amuse entertain divert a mind that finds itself suddenly assaulted and overwhelmed by disasters of a sort not dreamed of and not provided for nono the bare idea of amusement is repulsive to my feelings let us talk of death and funerals  nonot yet  that would be giving up the ship  well not give up the ship yet  im going to amuse you i sent brady out for the wherewithal before you finished breakfast  you did  what is it  come this is a good signcuriosity  oh theres hope for you yet     chapter xvi  brady arrived with a box and departed after saying  theyre finishing one up but theyll be along as soon as its done  barrow took a frameless oil portrait a foot square from the box set it up in a good light without comment and reached for another taking a furtive glance at tracy meantime the stony solemnity in tracys face remained as it was and gave out no sign of interest  barrow placed the second portrait beside the first and stole another glance while reaching for a third  the stone image softened a shade  no 3 forced the ghost of a smile no 4 swept indifference wholly away and no 5 started a laugh which was still in good and hearty condition when no 14 took its place in the row  oh youre all right yet said barrow  you see youre not past amusement  the pictures were fearful as to color and atrocious as to drawing and expression but the feature which squelched animosity and made them funny was a feature which could not achieve its full force in a single picture but required the wonderworking assistance of repetition  one loudly dressed mechanic in stately attitude with his hand on a cannon ashore and a ship riding at anchor in the offingthis is merely odd but when one sees the same cannon and the same ship in fourteen pictures in a row and a different mechanic standing watch in each the thing gets to be funny  explainexplain these aberrations said tracy  well they are not the achievement of a single intellect a single talentit takes two to do these miracles  they are collaborations the one artist does the figure the other the accessories  the figureartist is a german shoemaker with an untaught passion for art the other is a simple hearted old yankee sailorman whose possibilities are strictly limited to his ship his cannon and his patch of petrified sea they work these things up from twentyfivecent tintypes they get six dollars apiece for them and they can grind out a couple a day when they strike what they call a boostthat is an inspiration  people actually pay money for these calumnies  they actually doand quite willingly too  and these abortionists could double their trade and work the women in if capt saltmarsh could whirl a horse in or a piano or a guitar in place of his cannon  the fact is he fatigues the market with that cannon  even the male market i mean  these fourteen in the procession are not all satisfied  one is an old independent fireman and he wants an engine in place of the cannon another is a mate of a tug and wants a tug in place of the ship and so on and so on  but the captain cant make a tug that is deceptive and a fire engine is many flights beyond his power  this is a most extraordinary form of robbery i never have heard of anything like it  its interesting  yes and so are the artists  they are perfectly honest men and sincere  and the old sailorman is full of sound religion and is as devoted a student of the bible and misquoter of it as you can find anywhere  i dont know a better man or kinder hearted old soul than saltmarsh although he does swear a little sometimes  he seems to be perfect  i want to know him barrow  youll have the chance  i guess i hear them coming now  well draw them out on their art if you like  the artists arrived and shook hands with great heartiness  the german was forty and a little fleshy with a shiny bald head and a kindly face and deferential manner  capt  saltmarsh was sixty tall erect powerfully built with coalblack hair and whiskers and he had a well tanned complexion and a gait and countenance that were full of command confidence and decision  his horny hands and wrists were covered with tattoomarks and when his lips parted his teeth showed up white and blemishless  his voice was the effortless deep bass of a church organ and would disturb the tranquility of a gas flame fifty yards away  theyre wonderful pictures said barrow  weve been examining them  it is very bleasant dot you like dem said handel the german greatly pleased  und you herr tracy you haf peen bleased mit dem too alretty  i can honestly say i have never seen anything just like them before  schon cried the german delighted  you hear gaptain  here is a chentleman yes vot abbreviate unser aart  the captain was charmed and said  well sir were thankful for a compliment yet though theyre not as scarce now as they used to be before we made a reputation  getting the reputation is the uphill time in most things captain  its so  it aint enough to know how to reef a gasket you got to make the mate know you know it  thats reputation  the good word said at the right time thats the word that makes us and evil be to him that evil thinks as isaiah says  its very relevant and hits the point exactly said tracy  where did you study art captain  i havent studied its a natural gift  he is born mit dose cannon in him  he tondt haf to do noding his chenius do all de vork  of he is asleep and take a pencil in his hand out come a cannon  py crashus of he could do a clavier of he could do a guitar of he could do a vashtub it is a fortune heiliger yohanniss it is yoost a fortune  well it is an immense pity that the business is hindered and limited in this unfortunate way  the captain grew a trifle excited himself now  youve said it mr tracyhindered  well i should say so  why look here  this fellow here no 11 hes a hackmana flourishing hackman i may say  he wants his hack in this picture  wants it where the cannon is  i got around that difficulty by telling him the cannons our trademark so to speakproves that the pictures our work and i was afraid if we left it out people wouldnt know for certain if it was a saltmarshhandelnow you wouldnt yourself  what captain  you wrong yourself indeed you do  anyone who has once seen a genuine saltmarshhandel is safe from imposture forever  strip it flay it skin it out of every detail but the bare color and expression and that man will still recognize itstill stop to worship  oh how it makes me feel to hear dose oxpressions  still say to himself again as he had said a hundred times before the art of the saltmarshhandel is an art apart there is nothing in the heavens above or in the earth beneath that resembles it  py chiminy nur horen sie einmal  in my life day haf i never heard so brecious worts  so i talked him out of the hack mr tracy and he let up on that and said put in a hearse thenbecause hes chief mate of a hearse but dont own itstands a watch for wages you know  but i cant do a hearse any more than i can a hack so here we arebecalmed you see  and its the same with women and such  they come and they want a little johnry picture  its the accessories that make it a genre  yescannon or cat or any little thing like that that you heave into whoop up the effect  we could do a prodigious trade with the women if we could foreground the things they like but they dont give a damn for artillery  mines the lack continued the captain with a sigh andys end of the business is all right i tell you hes an artist from way back  yoost hear dot old man  he always talk poud me like dot purred the pleased german  look at his work yourself  fourteen portraits in a row  and no two of them alike  now that you speak of it it is true i hadnt noticed it before  it is very remarkable  unique i suppose  i should say so  thats the very thing about andyhe discriminates discriminations the thief of timefortyninth psalm but that aint any matter its the honest thing and it pays in the end  yes he certainly is great in that feature one is obliged to admit it butnow mind im not really criticisingdont you think he is just a trifle overstrong in technique  the captains face was knocked expressionless by this remark  it remained quite vacant while he muttered to himselftechnique techniquepolytechniquepyrotechnique thats it likelyfireworks too much color  then he spoke up with serenity and confidence and said  well yes he does pile it on pretty loud but they all like it you knowfact is its the life of the business  take that no 9 there evans the butcher  he drops into the stoodio as sobercolored as anything you ever see now look at him  you cant tell him from scarlet fever  well it pleases that butcher to death  im making a study of a sausagewreath to hang on the cannon and i dont really reckon i can do it right but if i can we can break the butcher  unquestionably your confederatei mean youryour fellowcraftsman is a great colorist  oh danke schon  in fact a quite extraordinary colorist a colorist i make bold to say without imitator here or abroadand with a most bold and effective touch a touch like a battering ram and a manner so peculiar and romantic and extraneous and ad libitum and heartsearching that thathehe is an impressionist i presume  no said the captain simply he is a presbyterian  it accounts for it allalltheres something divine about his art soulful unsatisfactory yearning dim hearkening on the void horizon vaguemurmuring to the spirit out of ultramarine distances and farsounding cataclysms of uncreated spaceoh if heif hehas he ever tried distemper  the captain answered up with energy  not if he knows himself  but his dog has and  oh no it vas not my dog  why you said it was your dog  oh no gaptain i  it was a white dog wasnt it with his tail docked and one ear gone and  dots him dots himder fery dog  wy py chorge dot dog he would eat baint yoost de same like  well never mind that nowvast heavingi never saw such a man  you start him on that dog and hell dispute a year  blamed if i havent seen him keep it up a level two hours and a half  why captain said barrow  i guess that must be hearsay  no sir no hearsay about ithe disputed with me  i dont see how you stood it  oh youve got toif you run with andy  but its the only fault hes got  aint you afraid of acquiring it  oh no said the captain tranquilly no danger of that i reckon  the artists presently took their leave  then barrow put his hands on tracys shoulders and said  look me in the eye my boy  steady steady  thereits just as i thoughthoped anyway youre all right thank goodness  nothing the matter with your mind  but dont do that againeven for fun  it isnt wise  they wouldnt have believed you if youd been an earls son why they couldntdont you know that  what ever possessed you to take such a freak  but never mind about that lets not talk of it  it was a mistake you see that yourself  yesit was a mistake  well just drop it out of your mind its no harm we all make them pull your courage together and dont brood and dont give up  im at your back and well pull through dont you be afraid  when he was gone barrow walked the floor a good while uneasy in his mind  he said to himself im troubled about him  he never would have made a break like that if he hadnt been a little off his balance but i know what being out of work and no prospect ahead can do for a man first it knocks the pluck out of him and drags his pride in the dirt worry does the rest and his mind gets shaky  i must talk to these people  noif theres any humanity in themand there is at bottom theyll be easier on him if they think his troubles have disturbed his reason  but ive got to find him some work works the only medicine for his disease poor devil away off here and not a friend     chapter xvii  the moment tracy was alone his spirits vanished away and all the misery of his situation was manifest to him  to be moneyless and an object of the chairmakers charitythis was bad enough but his folly in proclaiming himself an earls son to that scoffing and unbelieving crew and on top of that the humiliating resultthe recollection of these things was a sharper torture still  he made up his mind that he would never play earls son again before a doubtful audience  his fathers answer was a blow he could not understand  at times he thought his father imagined he could get work to do in america without any trouble and was minded to let him try it and cure himself of his radicalism by hard cold disenchanting experience  that seemed the most plausible theory yet he could not content himself with it  a theory that pleased him better was that this cablegram would be followed by another of a gentler sort requiring him to come home  should he write and strike his flag and ask for a ticket home  oh no that he couldnt ever do  at least not yet  that cablegram would come it certainly would  so he went from one telegraph office to another every day for nearly a week and asked if there was a cablegram for howard tracy no there wasnt any  so they answered him at first  later they said it before he had a chance to ask  later still they merely shook their heads impatiently as soon as he came in sight  after that he was ashamed to go any more  he was down in the lowest depths of despair now for the harder barrow tried to find work for him the more hopeless the possibilities seemed to grow  at last he said to barrow  look here  i want to make a confession  i have got down now to where i am not only willing to acknowledge to myself that i am a shabby creature and full of false pride but am willing to acknowledge it to you  well ive been allowing you to wear yourself out hunting for work for me when theres been a chance open to me all the time  forgive my pridewhat was left of it  it is all gone now and ive come to confess that if those ghastly artists want another confederate im their manfor at last i am dead to shame  no  really can you paint  not as badly as they  no i dont claim that for i am not a genius in fact i am a very indifferent amateur a slouchy dabster a mere artistic sarcasm but drunk or asleep i can beat those buccaneers  shake  i want to shout  oh i tell you i am immensely delighted and relieved  oh just to workthat is life  no matter what the work is thats of no consequence  just work itself is bliss when a mans been starving for it  ive been there  come right along well hunt the old boys up  dont you feel good  i tell you i do  the freebooters were not at home  but their works were displayed in profusion all about the little ratty studio  cannon to the right of them cannon to the left of them cannon in frontit was balaclava come again  heres the uncontented hackman tracy  buckle todeepen the seagreen to turf turn the ship into a hearse  let the boys have a taste of your quality  the artists arrived just as the last touch was put on  they stood transfixed with admiration  my souls but shes a stunner that hearse  the hackman will just go all to pieces when he sees that wont he andy  oh it is sphlennid sphlennid  herr tracy why haf you not said you vas a so sublime aartist  lob gott of you had lifd in paris you would be a pree de rome dots votes de matter  the arrangements were soon made  tracy was taken into full and equal partnership and he went straight to work with dash and energy to reconstructing gems of art whose accessories had failed to satisfy under his hand on that and succeeding days artillery disappeared and the emblems of peace and commerce took its placecats hacks sausages tugs fire engines pianos guitars rocks gardens flowerpots landscapeswhatever was wanted he flung it in and the more out of place and absurd the required object was the more joy he got out of fabricating it  the pirates were delighted the customers applauded the sex began to flock in great was the prosperity of the firm  tracy was obliged to confess to himself that there was something about workeven such grotesque and humble work as thiswhich most pleasantly satisfied a something in his nature which had never been satisfied before and also gave him a strange new dignity in his own private view of himself                        the unqualified member from cherokee strip was in a state of deep dejection  for a good while now he had been leading a sort of life which was calculated to kill for it had consisted in regularly alternating days of brilliant hope and black disappointment  the brilliant hopes were created by the magician sellers and they always promised that now he had got the trick sure and would effectively influence that materialized cowboy to call at the towers before night the black disappointments consisted in the persistent and monotonous failure of these prophecies  at the date which this history has now reached sellers was appalled to find that the usual remedy was inoperative and that hawkinss low spirits refused absolutely to lift  something must be done he reflected it was heartbreaking this woe this smileless misery this dull despair that looked out from his poor friends face  yes he must be cheered up  he mused a while then he saw his way  he said in his most conspicuously casual vein  eruhby the way hawkins we are feeling disappointed about this thingthe way the materializee is acting i meanwe are disappointed you concede that  concede it  why yes if you like the term  very well so far so good  now for the basis of the feeling  it is not that your heart your affections are concerned that is to say it is not that you want the materializee itself  you concede that  yes i concede that toocordially  very well again we are making progress  to sum up the feeling it is conceded is not engendered by the mere conduct of the materializee it is conceded that it does not arise from any pang which the personality of the materializee could assuage  now then said the earl with the light of triumph in his eye the inexorable logic of the situation narrows us down to this our feeling has its source in the moneyloss involved comeisnt that so  goodness knows i concede that with all my heart  very well  when youve found out the source of a disease youve also found out what remedy is requiredjust as in this case  in this case money is required  and only money  the old old seduction was in that airy confident tone and those significant wordsusually called pregnant words in books  the old answering signs of faith and hope showed up in hawkinss countenance and he said  only money  do you mean that you know a way to  washington have you the impression that i have no resources but those i allow the public and my intimate friends to know about  well ier  is it likely do you think that a man moved by nature and taught by experience to keep his affairs to himself and a cautious and reluctant tongue in his head wouldnt be thoughtful enough to keep a few resources in reserve for a rainy day when hes got as many as i have to select from  oh you make me feel so much better already colonel  have you ever been in my laboratory  why no  thats it  you see you didnt even know that i had one  come along ive got a little trick there that i want to show you  ive kept it perfectly quiet not fifty people know anything about it  but thats my way always been my way  wait till youre ready thats the idea and when youre ready zziplet her go  well colonel ive never seen a man that ive had such unbounded confidence in as you  when you say a thing right out i always feel as if that ends it as if that is evidence and proof and everything else  the old earl was profoundly pleased and touched  im glad you believe in me washington not everybody is so just  i always have believed in you and i always shall as long as i live  thank you my boy  you shant repent it  and you cant  arrived in the laboratory the earl continued now cast your eye around this roomwhat do you see  apparently a junkshop apparently a hospital connected with a patent officein reality the mines of golconda in disguise  look at that thing there  now what would you take that thing to be  i dont believe i could ever imagine  of course you couldnt  its my grand adaptation of the phonograph to the marine service  you store up profanity in it for use at sea you know that sailors dont fly around worth a cent unless you swear at themso the mate that can do the best job of swearing is the most valuable man  in great emergencies his talent saves the ship  but a ship is a large thing and he cant be everywhere at once so there have been times when one mate has lost a ship which could have been saved if they had had a hundred  prodigious storms you know  well a ship cant afford a hundred mates but she can afford a hundred cursing phonographs and distribute them all over the vesseland there you see shes armed at every point  imagine a big storm and a hundred of my machines all cursing away at oncesplendid spectacle splendidyou couldnt hear yourself think  ship goes through that storm perfectly sereneshes just as safe as shed be on shore  its a wonderful idea  how do you prepare the thing  load itsimply load it  how  why you just stand over it and swear into it  that loads it does it  yesbecause every word it collars it keepskeeps it forever  never wears out  any time you turn the crank out itll come  in times of great peril you can reverse it and itll swear backwards  that makes a sailor hump himself  o i see  who loads themthe mate  yes if he chooses  or ill furnish them already loaded  i can hire an expert for 75 a month who will load a hundred and fifty phonographs in 150 hours and do it easy  and an expert can furnish a stronger article of course than the mere average uncultivated mate could  then you see all the ships of the world will buy them ready loadedfor i shall have them loaded in any language a customer wants  hawkins it will work the grandest moral reform of the 19th century  five years from now all the swearing will be done by machineryyou wont ever hear a profane word come from human lips on a ship  millions of dollars have been spent by the churches in the effort to abolish profanity in the commercial marine  think of itmy name will live forever in the affections of good men as the man who solitary and alone accomplished this noble and elevating reform  o it is grand and beneficent and beautiful  how did you ever come to think of it  you have a wonderful mind  how did you say you loaded the machine  o its no troubleperfectly simple  if you want to load it up loud and strong you stand right over it and shout  but if you leave it open and all set itll eavesdrop so to speakthat is to say it will load itself up with any sounds that are made within six feet of it  now ill show you how it works  i had an expert come and load this one up yesterday  hello its been left openits too badstill i reckon it hasnt had much chance to collect irrelevant stuff  all you do is to press this button in the floorso  the phonograph began to sing in a plaintive voice            there is a boardinghouse far far away           where they have ham and eggs 3 times a day  hang it that aint it  somebodys been singing around here  the plaintive song began again mingled with a low gradually rising wail of cats slowly warming up toward a fight            o how the boarders yell           when they hear that dinner bell           they give that landlord  momentary outburst of terrific catfight which drowns out one word            three times a day  renewal of furious catfight for a moment  the plaintive voice on a high fierce key scat you devilsand a racket as of flying missiles  well never mindlet it go  ive got some sailorprofanity down in there somewhere if i could get to it  but it isnt any matter you see how the machine works  hawkins responded with enthusiasm  o it works admirably  i know theres a hundred fortunes in it  and mind the hawkins family get their share washington  o thanks thanks you are just as generous as ever  ah its the grandest invention of the age  ah well we live in wonderful times  the elements are crowded full of beneficent forcesalways have beenand ours is the first generation to turn them to account and make them work for us  why hawkins everything is usefulnothing ought ever to be wasted  now look at sewer gas for instance  sewer gas has always been wasted heretofore nobody tried to save up sewergasyou cant name me a man  aint that so you know perfectly well its so  yes it is sobut i nevereri dont quite see why a body  should want to save it up  well ill tell you  do you see this little invention hereits a decomposeri call it a decomposer  i give you my word of honor that if you show me a house that produces a given quantity of sewergas in a day ill engage to set up my decomposer there and make that house produce a hundred times that quantity of sewergas in less than half an hour  dear me but why should you want to  want to  listen and youll see  my boy for illuminating purposes and economy combined theres nothing in the world that begins with sewergas  and really it dont cost a cent  you put in a good inferior article of plumbingsuch as you find everywhereand add my decomposer and there you are  just use the ordinary gas pipesand there your expense ends  think of it  why major in five years from now you wont see a house lighted with anything but sewergas  every physician i talk to recommends it and every plumber  but isnt it dangerous  o yes more or less but everything iscoal gas candles electricity there isnt anything that aint  it lights up well does it  o magnificently  have you given it a good trial  well no not a first rate one  pollys prejudiced and she wont let me put it in here but im playing my cards to get it adopted in the presidents house and then itll godont you doubt it  i shall not need this one for the present washington you may take it down to some boardinghouse and give it a trial if you like     chapter xviii  washington shuddered slightly at the suggestion then his face took on a dreamy look and he dropped into a trance of thought  after a little sellers asked him what he was grinding in his mental mill  well this  have you got some secret project in your head which requires a bank of england back of it to make it succeed  the colonel showed lively astonishment and said  why hawkins are you a mindreader  i  i never thought of such a thing  well then how did you happen to drop onto that idea in this curious fashion  its just mindreading thats what it is though you may not know it  because i have got a private project that requires a bank of england at its back  how could you divine that  what was the process this is interesting  there wasnt any process  a thought like this happened to slip through my head by accident how much would make you or me comfortable a hundred thousand  yet you are expecting two or three ofthese inventions of yours to turn out some billions of moneyand you are wanting them to do that  if you wanted ten millions i could understand thatits inside the human limits  but billions  thats clear outside the limits  there must be a definite project back of that somewhere  the earls interest and surprise augmented with every word and when hawkins finished he said with strong admiration  its wonderfully reasoned out washington it certainly is  it shows what i think is quite extraordinary penetration  for youve hit it youve driven the centre youve plugged the bullseye of my dream  now ill tell you the whole thing and youll understand it  i dont need to ask you to keep it to yourself because youll see that the project will prosper all the better for being kept in the background till the right time  have you noticed how many pamphlets and books ive got lying around relating to russia  yes i think most anybody would notice thatanybody who wasnt dead  well ive been posting myself a good while  thats a great and splendid nation and deserves to be set free  he paused then added in a quite matteroffact way when i get this money im going to set it free  great guns  why what makes you jump like that  dear me when you are going to drop a remark under a mans chair that is likely to blow him out through the roof why dont you put some expression some force some noise unto it that will prepare him  you shouldnt flip out such a gigantic thing as this in that colorless kind of a way  you do jolt a person up so  go on now im all right again tell me all about it  im all interestyes and sympathy too  well ive looked the ground over and concluded that the methods of the russian patriots while good enough considering the way the boys are hampered are not the best at least not the quickest  they are trying to revolutionize russia from within thats pretty slow you know and liable to interruption all the time and is full of perils for the workers  do you know how peter the great started his army  he didnt start it on the family premises under the noses of the strelitzes no he started it away off yonder privatelyonly just one regiment you know and he built to that  the first thing the strelitzes knew the regiment was an army their position was turned and they had to take a walk just that little idea made the biggest and worst of all the despotisms the world has seen  the same idea can unmake it  im going to prove it im going to get out to one side and work my scheme the way peter did  this is mighty interesting rossmore  what is it you are going to do  i am going to buy siberia and start a republic  therebang you go again without giving any notice  going to buy it  yes as soon as i get the money  i dont care what the price is i shall take it  i can afford it and i will  now then consider this and youve never thought of it ill warrant  where is the place where there is twentyfive times more manhood pluck true heroism unselfishness devotion to high and noble ideals adoration of liberty wide education and brains per thousand of population than any other domain in the whole world can show  siberia  right  it is true it certainly is true but i never thought of it before  nobody ever thinks of it  but its so just the same  in those mines and prisons are gathered together the very finest and noblest and capablest multitude of human beings that god is able to create  now if you had that kind of a population to sell would you offer it to a despotism  no the despotism has no use for it you would lose money a despotism has no use for anything but human cattle  but suppose you want to start a republic  yes i see  its just the material for it  well i should say so  theres siberia with just the very finest and choicest material on the globe for a republic and more comingmore coming all the time dont you see  it is being daily weekly monthly recruited by the most perfectly devised system that has ever been invented perhaps  by this system the whole of the hundred millions of russia are being constantly and patiently sifted sifted sifted by myriads of trained experts spies appointed by the emperor personally and whenever they catch a man woman or child that has got any brains or education or character they ship that person straight to siberia  it is admirable it is wonderful  it is so searching and so effective that it keeps the general level of russian intellect and education down to that of the czar  come that sounds like exaggeration  well its what they say anyway  but i think myself its a lie  and it doesnt seem right to slander a whole nation that way anyhow  now then you see what the material is there in siberia for a republic he paused and his breast began to heave and his eye to burn under the impulse of strong emotion  then his words began to stream forth with constantly increasing energy and fire and he rose to his feet as if to give himself larger freedom  the minute i organize that republic the light of liberty intelligence justice humanity bursting from it flooding from it flaming from it will concentrate the gaze of the whole astonished world as upon the miracle of a new sun russias countless multitudes of slaves will rise up and march marcheastward with that great light transfiguring their faces as they come and far back of them you will seewhat will you seea vacant throne in an empty land  it can be done and by god i will do it  he stood a moment bereft of earthy consciousness by his exaltation then consciousness returned bringing him a slight shock and he said with grave earnestness  i must ask you to pardon me major hawkins  i have never used that expression before and i beg you will forgive it this time  hawkins was quite willing  you see washington it is an error which i am by nature not liable to only excitable people impulsive people are exposed to it  but the circumstances of the present casei being a democrat by birth and preference and an aristocrat by inheritance and relish  the earl stopped suddenly his frame stiffened and he began to stare speechless through the curtainless window  then he pointed and gasped out a single rapturous word  look  what is it colonel  it  no  sure as youre born  keep perfectly still  ill apply the influence ill turn on all my force  ive brought it thus farill fetch it right into the house  youll see  he was making all sorts of passes in the air with his hands  there  look at that  ive made it smile  see  quite true  tracy out for an afternoon stroll had come unexpectantly upon his family arms displayed upon this shabby housefront  the hatchments made him smile which was nothing they had made the neighborhood cats do that  look hawkins look  im drawing it over  youre drawing it sure rossmore  if i ever had any doubts about materialization theyre gone now and gone for good  oh this is a joyful day  tracy was sauntering over to read the doorplate  before he was half way over he was saying to himself why manifestly these are the american claimants quarters  its comingcoming right along  ill slide down and pull it in  you follow after me  sellers pale and a good deal agitated opened the door and confronted tracy  the old man could not at once get his voice then he pumped out a scattering and hardly coherent salutation and followed it with  walk in walk right in mrer  tracyhoward tracy  tracythankswalk right in youre expected  tracy entered considerably puzzled and said  expected  i think there must be some mistake  oh i judge not said sellers whonoticing that hawkins had arrived gave him a sidewise glance intended to call his close attention to a dramatic effect which he was proposing to produce by his next remark then he said slowly and impressivelyi amyou know who  to the astonishment of both conspirators the remark produced no dramatic effect at all for the newcomer responded with a quite innocent and unembarrassed air  no pardon me  i dont know who you are  i only supposebut no doubt correctlythat you are the gentleman whose title is on the doorplate  right quite rightsit down pray sit down  the earl was rattled thrown off his bearings his head was in a whirl  then he noticed hawkins standing apart and staring idiotically at what to him was the apparition of a defunct man and a new idea was born to him  he said to tracy briskly  but a thousand pardons dear sir i am forgetting courtesies due to a guest and stranger  let me introduce my friend general hawkinsgeneral hawkins our new senatorsenator from the latest and grandest addition to the radiant galaxy of sovereign states cherokee stripto himself that name will shrivel him upbut it didnt in the least and the colonel resumed the introduction piteously disheartened and amazed senator hawkins mr  howard tracy ofer  england  englandwhy thats im  england yes native of england  recently from there  yes quite recently  said the colonel to himself this phantom lies like an expert purifying this kind by fire dont work  ill sound him a little further give him another chance or two to work his gift  then aloudwith deep irony  visiting our great country for recreation and amusement no doubt i suppose you find that traveling in the majestic expanses of our far west is  i havent been west and havent been devoting myself to amusement with any sort of exclusiveness i assure you  in fact to merely live an artist has got to work not play  artist said hawkins to himself thinking of the rifled bank that is a name for it  are you an artist asked the colonel and added to himself now im going to catch him  in a humble way yes  what line pursued the sly veteran  oils  ive got him said sellers to himself  then aloud this is fortunate could i engage you to restore some of my paintings that need that attention  i shall be very glad  pray let me see them  no shuffling no evasion no embarrassment even under this crucial test the colonel was nonplussed  he led tracy to a chromo which had suffered damage in a former owners hands through being used as a lamp mat and said with a flourish of his hand toward the picture  this del sarto  is that a del sarto  the colonel bent a look of reproach upon tracy allowed it to sink home then resumed as if there had been no interruption  this del sarto is perhaps the only original of that sublime master in our country  you see yourself that the work is of such exceeding delicacy that the riskcoulderwould you mind giving me a little example of what you can do before we  cheerfully cheerfully  i will copy one of these marvels  watercolor materialsrelics of miss sallys college lifewere brought tracy said he was better in oils but would take a chance with these so he was left alone  he began his work but the attractions of the place were too strong for him and he got up and went drifting about fascinated also amazed     chapter xix  meantime the earl and hawkins were holding a troubled and anxious private consultation  the earl said  the mystery that bothers me is where did it get its other arm  yesit worries me too  and another thing troubles methe apparition is english  how do you account for that colonel  honestly i dont know hawkins i dont really know  it is very confusing and awful  dont you think maybe weve waked up the wrong one  the wrong one  how do you account for the clothes  the clothes are right theres no getting around it  what are we going to do  we cant collect as i see  the reward is for a onearmed american  this is a twoarmed englishman  well it may be that that is not objectionable  you see it isnt less than is called for it is more and so  but he saw that this argument was weak and dropped it  the friends sat brooding over their perplexities some time in silence  finally the earls face began to glow with an inspiration and he said impressively  hawkins this materialization is a grander and nobler science than we have dreamed of  we have little imagined what a solemn and stupendous thing we have done  the whole secret is perfectly clear to me now clear as day  every man is made up of heredities longdescended atoms and particles of his ancestors  this present materialization is incomplete  we have only brought it down to perhaps the beginning of this century  what do you mean colonel cried hawkins filled with vague alarms by the old mans awecompelling words and manner  this  weve materialized this burglars ancestor  oh dontdont say that  its hideous  but its true hawkins i know it  look at the facts  this apparition is distinctly englishnote that  it uses good grammarnote that  it is an artistnote that  it has the manners and carriage of a gentleman note that  wheres your cowboy  answer me that  rossmore this is dreadfulits too dreadful to think of  never resurrected a rag of that burglar but the clothes not a solitary rag of him but the clothes  colonel do you really mean  the colonel brought his fist down with emphasis and said  i mean exactly this  the materialization was immature the burglar has evaded us this is nothing but a damned ancestor  he rose and walked the floor in great excitement  hawkins said plaintively  its a bitter disappointmentbitter  i know it  i know it senator i feel it as deeply as anybody could but weve got to submiton moral grounds  i need money but god knows i am not poor enough or shabby enough to be an accessory to the punishing of a mans ancestor for crimes committed by that ancestors posterity  but colonel implored hawkins stop and think dont be rash you know its the only chance weve got to get the money and besides the bible itself says posterity to the fourth generation shall be punished for the sins and crimes committed by ancestors four generations back that hadnt anything to do with them and so its only fair to turn the rule around and make it work both ways  the colonel was struck with the strong logic of this position  he strode up and down and thought it painfully over  finally he said  theres reason in it yes theres reason in it  and so although it seems a piteous thing to sweat this poor ancient devil for a burglary he hadnt the least hand in still if duty commands i suppose we must give him up to the authorities  i would said hawkins cheered and relieved id give him up if he was a thousand ancestors compacted into one  lord bless me thats just what he is said sellers with something like a groan its exactly what he is theres a contribution in him from every ancestor he ever had  in him theres atoms of priests soldiers crusaders poets and sweet and gracious womenall kinds and conditions of folk who trod this earth in old old centuries and vanished out of it ages ago and now by act of ours they are summoned from their holy peace to answer for gutting a onehorse bank away out on the borders of cherokee strip and its just a howling outrage  oh dont talk like that colonel it takes the heart all out of me and makes me ashamed of the part i am proposing to  waitive got it  a saving hope  shout it out i am perishing  its perfectly simple a child would have thought of it  he is all right not a flaw in him as far as i have carried the work  if ive been able to bring him as far as the beginning of this century whats to stop me now  ill go on and materialize him down to date  land i never thought of that said hawkins all ablaze with joy again its the very thing  what a brain you have got  and will he shed the superfluous arm  he will  and lose his english accent  it will wholly disappear  he will speak cherokee stripand other forms of profanity  colonel maybe hell confess  confess  merely that bank robbery  merely  yes but why merely  the colonel said in his most impressive manner hawkins he will be wholly under my command  i will make him confess every crime he ever committed  there must be a thousand  do you get the idea  wellnot quite  the rewards will come to us  prodigious conception  i never saw such ahead for seeing with a lightning glance all the outlying ramifications and possibilities of a central idea  it is nothing it comes natural to me  when his time is out in one jail he goes to the next and the next and we shall have nothing to do but collect the rewards as he goes along  it is a perfectly steady income as long as we live hawkins  and much better than other kinds of investments because he is indestructible  it looksit really does look the way you say it does indeed  lookwhy it is  it will not be denied that i have had a pretty wide and comprehensive financial experience and i do not hesitate to say that i consider this one of the most valuable properties i have ever controlled  do you really think so  i do indeed  o colonel the wasting grind and grief of poverty  if we could realize immediately  i dont mean sell it all but sell partenough you know to  see how you tremble with excitement  that comes of lack of experience my boy when you have been familiar with vast operations as long as i have youll be different  look at me is my eye dilated do you notice a quiver anywhere  feel my pulse plunkplunkplunksame as if i were asleep  and yet what is passing through my calm cold mind  a procession of figures which would make a financial novice drunk just the sight of them  now it is by keeping cool and looking at a thing all around that a man sees whats really in it and saves himself from the novices unfailing mistakethe one youve just suggestedeagerness to realize  listen to me  your idea is to sell a part of him for ready cash  now mine isguess  i havent an idea  what is it  stock himof course  well i should never have thought of that  because you are not a financier  say he has committed a thousand crimes  certainly thats a low estimate  by the look of him even in his unfinished condition he has committed all of a million  but call it only a thousand to be perfectly safe five thousand reward multiplied by a thousand gives us a dead sure cash basis ofwhat  five million dollars  waitlet me get my breath  and the property indestructible  perpetually fruitfulperpetually for a property with his disposition will go on committing crimes and winning rewards  you daze me you make my head whirl  let it whirl it wont do it any harm  now that matter is all fixed leave it alone  ill get up the company and issue the stock all in good time  just leave it in my hands  i judge you dont doubt my ability to work it up for all it is worth  indeed i dont  i can say that with truth  all right then  thats disposed of  everything in its turn  we old operators go by order and systemno helterskelter business with us whats the next thing on the docket  the carrying on of the materializationthe bringing it down to date  i will begin on that at once  i think  look here rossmore  you didnt lock it in  a hundred to one it has escaped  calm yourself as to that dont give yourself any uneasiness  but why shouldnt it escape  let it if it wants to  what of it  well i should consider it a pretty serious calamity  why my dear boy once in my power always in my power  it may go and come freely  i can produce it here whenever i want it just by the exercise of my will  well i am truly glad to hear that i do assure you  yes i shall give it all the painting it wants to do and we and the family will make it as comfortable and contented as we can  no occasion to restrain its movements  i hope to persuade it to remain pretty quiet though because a materialization which is in a state of arrested development must of necessity be pretty soft and flabby and substanceless anderby the way i wonder where it comes from  how  what do you mean  the earl pointed significantlyand interrogatively toward the sky hawkins started then settled into deep reflection finally shook his head sorrowfully and pointed downwards  what makes you think so washington  well i hardly know but really you can see yourself that he doesnt seem to be pining for his last place  its well thought  soundly deduced  weve done that thing a favor but i believe i will pump it a little in a quiet way and find out if we are right  how long is it going to take to finish him off and fetch him down to date colonel  i wish i knew but i dont  i am clear knocked out by this new detail this unforeseen necessity of working a subject down gradually from his condition of ancestor to his ultimate result as posterity  but ill make him hump himself anyway  rossmore  yes dear  were in the laboratory  comehawkins is here  mind now hawkinshes a sound living human being to all the familydont forget that  here she comes  keep your seats im not coming in  i just wanted to ask who is it thats painting down there  that  oh thats a young artist young englishman named tracy very promisingfavorite pupil of hans christian andersen or one of the other old mastersandersen im pretty sure it is hes going to halfsole some of our old italian masterpieces  been talking to him  well only a word  i stumbled right in on him without expecting anybody was there  i tried to be polite to him offered him a snacksellers delivered a large wink to hawkins from behind his hand but he declined and said he wasnt hungry another sarcastic wink so i brought some apples doublewink and he ate a couple of  what and the colonel sprang some yards toward the ceiling and came down quaking with astonishment  lady rossmore was smitten dumb with amazement  she gazed at the sheepish relic of cherokee strip then at her husband and then at the guest again  finally she said  what is the matter with you mulberry  he did not answer immediately  his back was turned he was bending over his chair feeling the seat of it  but he answered next moment and said  ah there it is it was a tack  the lady contemplated him doubtfully a moment then said pretty snappishly  all that for a tack  praise goodness it wasnt a shingle nail it would have landed you in the milky way  i do hate to have my nerves shook up so  and she turned on her heel and went her way  as soon as she was safely out the colonel said in a suppressed voice  comewe must see for ourselves  it must be a mistake  they hurried softly down and peeped in  sellers whispered in a sort of despair  it is eating  what a grisly spectacle  hawkins its horrible  take me awayi cant stand  they tottered back to the laboratory     chapter xx  tracy made slow progress with his work for his mind wandered a good deal  many things were puzzling him  finally a light burst upon him all of a suddenseemed to at any rateand he said to himself ive got the clew at lastthis mans mind is off its balance i dont know how much but its off a point or two sure off enough to explain this mess of perplexities anyway  these dreadful chromos which he takes for old masters these villainous portraitswhich to his frantic mind represent rossmores the hatchments the pompous name of this ramshackle old crib rossmore towers and that odd assertion of his that i was expected  how could i be expected that is lord berkeley  he knows by the papers that that person was burned up in the new gadsby  why hang it he really doesnt know who he was expecting for his talk showed that he was not expecting an englishman or yet an artist yet i answer his requirements notwithstanding  he seems sufficiently satisfied with me  yes he is a little off in fact i am afraid he is a good deal off poor old gentleman  but hes interestingall people in about his condition are i suppose  i hope hell like my work i would like to come every day and study him  and when i write my fatherah that hurts  i mustnt get on that subject it isnt good for my spirits  somebody comingi must get to work  its the old gentleman again  he looks bothered  maybe my clothes are suspicious and they arefor an artist  if my conscience would allow me to make a change but that is out of the question i wonder what hes making those passes in the air for with his hands i seem to be the object of them  can he be trying to mesmerize me i dont quite like it  theres something uncanny about it  the colonel muttered to himself it has an effect on him i can see it myself  thats enough for one time i reckon  hes not very solid yet i suppose and i might disintegrate him  ill just put a sly question or two at him now and see if i can find out what his condition is and where hes from  he approached and said affably  dont let me disturb you mr  tracy i only want to take a little glimpse of your work  ah thats finethats very fine indeed  you are doing it elegantly  my daughter will be charmed with this  may i sit down by you  oh do i shall be glad  it wont disturb you  i mean wont dissipate your inspirations  tracy laughed and said they were not ethereal enough to be very easily discommoded  the colonel asked a number of cautious and wellconsidered questions questions which seemed pretty odd and flighty to tracybut the answers conveyed the information desired apparently for the colonel said to himself with mixed pride and gratification  its a good job as far as ive got with it  hes solid  solid and going to last solid as the real thing  its wonderfulwonderful  i believe i couldpetrify him  after a little he asked warily do you prefer being here oror there  there  where  whyerwhere youve been  tracys thought flew to his boardinghouse and he answered with decision  oh here much  the colonel was startled and said to himself theres no uncertain ring about that  it indicates where hes been to poor fellow  well i am satisfied now  im glad i got him out  he sat thinking and thinking and watching the brush go  at length he said to himself yes it certainly seems to account for the failure of my endeavors in poor berkeleys case  he went in the other direction well its all right  hes better off  sally sellers entered from the street now looking her divinest and the artist was introduced to her  it was a violent case of mutual love at first sight though neither party was entirely aware of the fact perhaps  the englishman made this irrelevant remark to himself perhaps he is not insane after all  sally sat down and showed an interest in tracys work which greatly pleased him and a benevolent forgiveness of it which convinced him that the girls nature was cast in a large mould sellers was anxious to report his discoveries to hawkins so he took his leave saying that if the two young devotees of the colored muse thought they could manage without him he would go and look after his affairs  the artist said to himself i think he is a little eccentric perhaps but that is all  he reproached himself for having injuriously judged a man without giving him any fair chance to show what he really was  of course the stranger was very soon at his ease and chatting along comfortably  the average american girl possesses the valuable qualities of naturalness honesty and inoffensive straightforwardness she is nearly barren of troublesome conventions and artificialities consequently her presence and her ways are unembarrassing and one is acquainted with her and on the pleasantest terms with her before he knows how it came about  this new acquaintanceshipfriendship indeed progressed swiftly and the unusual swiftness of it and the thoroughness of it are sufficiently evidenced and established by one noteworthy fact that within the first half hour both parties had ceased to be conscious of tracys clothes  later this consciousness was reawakened it was then apparent to gwendolen that she was almost reconciled to them and it was apparent to tracy that he wasnt  the reawakening was brought about by gwendolens inviting the artist to stay to dinner  he had to decline because he wanted to live nowthat is now that there was something to live forand he could not survive in those clothes at a gentlemans table  he thought he knew that  but he went away happy for he saw that gwendolen was disappointed  and whither did he go  he went straight to a slopshop and bought as neat and reasonably wellfitting a suit of clothes as an englishman could be persuaded to wear  he saidto himself but at his consciencei know its wrong but it would be wrong not to do it and two wrongs do not make a right  this satisfied him and made his heart light  perhaps it will also satisfy the readerif he can make out what it means  the old people were troubled about gwendolen at dinner because she was so distraught and silent  if they had noticed they would have found that she was sufficiently alert and interested whenever the talk stumbled upon the artist and his work but they didnt notice and so the chat would swap around to some other subject and then somebody would presently be privately worrying about gwendolen again and wondering if she were not well or if something had gone wrong in the millinery line her mother offered her various reputable patent medicines and tonics with iron and other hardware in them and her father even proposed to send out for wine relentless prohibitionist and head of the order in the district of columbia as he was but these kindnesses were all declined thankfully but with decision  at bedtime when the family were breaking up for the night she privately looted one of the brushes saying to herself its the one he has used the most  the next morning tracy went forth wearing his new suit and equipped with a pink in his buttonholea daily attention from puss  his whole soul was full of gwendolen sellers and this condition was an inspiration artwise  all the morning his brush pawed nimbly away at the canvases almost without his awarityawarity in this sense being the sense of being aware though disputed by some authoritiesturning out marvel upon marvel in the way of decorative accessories to the portraits with a felicity and celerity which amazed the veterans of the firm and fetched out of them continuous explosions of applause  meantime gwendolen was losing her morning and many dollars  she supposed tracy was coming in the forenoona conclusion which she had jumped to without outside help  so she tripped down stairs every little while from her workparlor to arrange the brushes and things over again and see if he had arrived  and when she was in her workparlor it was not profitable but just the other wayas she found out to her sorrow  she had put in her idle moments during the last little while back in designing a particularly rare and capable gown for herself and this morning she set about making it up but she was absent minded and made an irremediable botch of it  when she saw what she had done she knew the reason of it and the meaning of it and she put her work away from her and said she would accept the sign  and from that time forth she came no more away from the audience chamber but remained there and waited  after luncheon she waited again  a whole hour  then a great joy welled up in her heart for she saw him coming  so she flew back up stairs thankful and could hardly wait for him to miss the principal brush which she had mislaid down there but knew where she had mislaid it  however all in good time the others were called in and couldnt find the brush and then she was sent for and she couldnt find it herself for some little time but then she found it when the others had gone away to hunt in the kitchen and down cellar and in the woodshed and all those other places where people look for things whose ways they are not familiar with  so she gave him the brush and remarked that she ought to have seen that everything was ready for him but it hadnt seemed necessary because it was so early that she wasnt expectingbut she stopped there surprised at herself for what she was saying and he felt caught and ashamed and said to himself i knew my impatience would drag me here before i was expected and betray me and that is just what it has done she sees straight through meand is laughing at me inside of course  gwendolen was very much pleased on one account and a little the other way in another pleased with the new clothes and the improvement which they had achieved less pleased by the pink in the buttonhole yesterdays pink had hardly interested her this one was just like it but somehow it had got her immediate attention and kept it  she wished she could think of some way of getting at its history in a properly colorless and indifferent way  presently she made a venture  she said  whatever a mans age may be he can reduce it several years by putting a brightcolored flower in his buttonhole  i have often noticed that is that your sexs reason for wearing a boutonniere  i fancy not but certainly that reason would be a sufficient one  ive never heard of the idea before  you seem to prefer pinks  is it on account of the color or the form  oh no he said simply they are given to me  i dont think i have any preference  they are given to him she said to herself and she felt a coldness toward that pink  i wonder who it is and what she is like  the flower began to take up a good deal of room it obtruded itself everywhere it intercepted all views and marred them it was becoming exceedingly annoying and conspicuous for a little thing  i wonder if he cares for her  that thought gave her a quite definite pain     chapter xxi  she had made everything comfortable for the artist there was no further pretext for staying  so she said she would go now and asked him to summon the servants in case he should need anything  she went away unhappy and she left unhappiness behind her for she carried away all the sunshine  the time dragged heavily for both now  he couldnt paint for thinking of her she couldnt design or millinerize with any heart for thinking of him  never before had painting seemed so empty to him never before had millinerizing seemed so void of interest to her  she had gone without repeating that dinnerinvitationan almost unendurable disappointment to him  on her partwell she was suffering too for she had found she couldnt invite him  it was not hard yesterday but it was impossible today  a thousand innocent privileges seemed to have been filched from her unawares in the past twentyfour hours  today she felt strangely hampered restrained of her liberty  today she couldnt propose to herself to do anything or say anything concerning this young man without being instantly paralyzed into nonaction by the fear that he might suspect  invite him to dinner today  it made her shiver to think of it  and so her afternoon was one long fret  broken at intervals  three times she had to go down stairs on errandsthat is she thought she had to go down stairs on errands  thus going and coming she had six glimpses of him in the aggregate without seeming to look in his direction and she tried to endure these electric ecstasies without showing any sign but they fluttered her up a good deal and she felt that the naturalness she was putting on was overdone and quite too frantically sober and hysterically calm to deceive  the painter had his share of the rapture he had his six glimpses and they smote him with waves of pleasure that assaulted him beat upon him washed over him deliciously and drowned out all consciousness of what he was doing with his brush  so there were six places in his canvas which had to be done over again  at last gwendolen got some peace of mind by sending word to the thompsons in the neighborhood that she was coming there to dinner she wouldnt be reminded at that table that there was an absentee who ought to be a presenteea word which she meant to look out in the dictionary at a calmer time  about this time the old earl dropped in for a chat with the artist and invited him to stay to dinner  tracy cramped down his joy and gratitude by a sudden and powerful exercise of all his forces and he felt that now that he was going to be close to gwendolen and hear her voice and watch her face during several precious hours earth had nothing valuable to add to his life for the present  the earl said to himself this spectre can eat apples apparently we shall find out now if that is a specialty  i think myself its a specialty  apples without doubt constitute the spectral limit  it was the case with our first parents  no i am wrongat least only partly right  the line was drawn at apples just as in the present case but it was from the other direction  the new clothes gave him a thrill of pleasure and pride  he said to himself ive got part of him down to date anyway  sellers said he was pleased with tracys work and he went on and engaged him to restore his old masters and said he should also want him to paint his portrait and his wifes and possibly his daughters  the tide of the artists happiness was at flood now  the chat flowed pleasantly along while tracy painted and sellers carefully unpacked a picture which he had brought with him  it was a chromo a new one just out  it was the smirking selfsatisfied portrait of a man who was inundating the union with advertisements inviting everybody to buy his specialty which was a threedollar shoe or a dresssuit or something of that kind  the old gentleman rested the chromo flat upon his lap and gazed down tenderly upon it and became silent and meditative  presently tracy noticed that he was dripping tears on it  this touched the young fellows sympathetic nature and at the same time gave him the painful sense of being an intruder upon a sacred privacy an observer of emotions which a stranger ought not to witness  but his pity rose superior to other considerations and compelled him to try to comfort the old mourner with kindly words and a show of friendly interest  he said  i am very sorryis it a friend whom  ah more than that far more than thata relative the dearest i had on earth although i was never permitted to see him  yes it is young lord berkeley who perished so heroically in the awful conflagration what is the matter  oh nothing nothing  it was a little startling to be so suddenly brought face to face so to speak with a person one has heard so much talk about  is it a good likeness  without doubt yes  i never saw him but you can easily see the resemblance to his father said sellers holding up the chromo and glancing from it to the chromo misrepresenting the usurping earl and back again with an approving eye  well noi am not sure that i make out the likeness  it is plain that the usurping earl there has a great deal of character and a long face like a horses whereas his heir here is smirky moonfaced and characterless  we are all that way in the beginningall the line said sellers undisturbed  we all start as moonfaced fools then later we tadpole along into horsefaced marvels of intellect and character  it is by that sign and by that fact that i detect the resemblance here and know this portrait to be genuine and perfect  yes all our family are fools at first  this young man seems to meet the hereditary requirement certainly  yes yes he was a fool without any doubt  examine the face the shape of the head the expression  its all fool fool fool straight through  thanks said tracy involuntarily  thanks  i mean for explaining it to me  go on please  as i was saying fool is printed all over the face  a body can even read the details  what do they say  well added up he is a wobbler  a which  wobbler  a person thats always taking a firm stand about something or otherkind of a gibraltar stand he thinks for unshakable fidelity and everlastingnessand then inside of a little while he begins to wobble no more gibraltar there no sir a mighty ordinary commonplace weakling wobblingaround on stilts  thats lord berkeley to a dot you can see it look at that sheep  butwhy are you blushing like sunset  dear sir have i unwittingly offended in some way  oh no indeed no indeed  far from it  but it always makes me blush to hear a man revile his own blood  he said to himself how strangely his vagrant and unguided fancies have hit upon the truth  by accident he has described me  i am that contemptible thing  when i left england i thought i knew myself i thought i was a very frederick the great for resolution and staying capacity whereas in truth i am just a wobbler simply a wobbler  wellafter all it is at least creditable to have high ideals and give birth to lofty resolutions i will allow myself that comfort  then he said aloud could this sheep as you call him breed a great and selfsacrificing idea in his head do you think  could he meditate such a thing for instance as the renunciation of the earldom and its wealth and its glories and voluntary retirement to the ranks of the commonalty there to rise by his own merit or remain forever poor and obscure  could he  why look at himlook at this simpering selfrighteous mug there is your answer  its the very thing he would think of  and he would start in to do it too  and then  hed wobble  and back down  every time  is that to happen with all myi mean would that happen to all his high resolutions  oh certainlycertainly  its the rossmore of it  then this creature was fortunate to die  suppose for arguments sake that i was a rossmore and  it cant be done  why  because its not a supposable case  to be a rossmore at your age youd have to be a fool and youre not a fool  and youd have to be a wobbler whereas anybody that is an expert in reading character can see at a glance that when you set your foot down once its there to stay and earthquake cant wobble it  he added to himself thats enough to say to him but it isnt half strong enough for the facts  the more i observe him now the more remarkable i find him  it is the strongest face i have ever examined  there is almost superhuman firmness here immovable purpose iron steadfastness of will  a most extraordinary young man  he presently said aloud  some time i want to ask your advice about a little matter mr  tracy you see ive got that young lords remaimsmy goodness how you jump  oh its nothing pray go on  youve got his remains  yes  are you sure they are his and not somebody elses  oh perfectly sure  samples i mean  not all of him  samples  yesin baskets  some time you will be going home and if you wouldnt mind taking them along  who  i  yescertainly  i dont mean now but after a while afterbut look here would you like to see them  no  most certainly not  i dont want to see them  o very well  i only thoughthey where are you going dear  out to dinner papa  tracy was aghast  the colonel said in a disappointed voice  well im sorry  sho i didnt know she was going out mr  tracy  gwendolens face began to take on a sort of apprehensive whathaveidone expression  three old people to one young onewell it isnt a good team thats a fact  gwendolens face betrayed a dawning hopefulness and she saidwith a tone of reluctance which hadnt the hallmark on it  if you prefer i will send word to the thompsons that i  oh is it the thompsons  that simplifies itsets everything right we can fix it without spoiling your arrangements my child  youve got your heart set on  but papa id just as soon go there some other  noi wont have it  you are a good hardworking darling child and your father is not the man to disappoint you when you  but papa i  go along i wont hear a word  well get along dear  gwendolen was ready to cry with venation  but there was nothing to do but start which she was about to do when her father hit upon an idea which filled him with delight because it so deftly covered all the difficulties of the situation and made things smooth and satisfactory  ive got it my love so that you wont be robbed of your holiday and at the same time well be pretty satisfactorily fixed for a good time here you send belle thompson hereperfectly beautiful creature tracy perfectly beautiful i want you to see that girl why youll just go mad youll go mad inside of a minute yes you send her right along gwendolen and tell herwhy shes gone  he turnedshe was already passing out at the gate  he muttered i wonder whats the matter i dont know what her mouths doing but i think her shoulders are swearing  well said sellers blithely to tracy i shall miss her parents always miss the children as soon as theyre out of sight its only a natural and wisely ordained partialitybut youll be all right because miss belle will supply the youthful element for you and to your entire content and we old people will do our best too  we shall have a good enough time  and youll have a chance to get better acquainted with admiral hawkins  thats a rare character mr tracyone of the rarest and most engaging characters the world has produced  youll find him worth studying  ive studied him ever since he was a child and have always found him developing  i really consider that one of the main things that has enabled me to master the difficult science of characterreading was the livid interest i always felt in that boy and the baffling inscrutabilities of his ways and inspirations  tracy was not hearing a word  his spirits were gone he was desolate  yes a most wonderful character  concealmentthats the basis of it always the first thing you want to do is to find the keystone a mans character is built onthen youve got it  no misleading and apparently inconsistent peculiarities can fool you then  what do you read on the senators surface  simplicity a kind of rank and protuberant simplicity whereas in fact thats one of the deepest minds in the world  a perfectly honest manan absolutely honest and honorable man and yet without doubt the profoundest master of dissimulation the world has ever seen  o its devilish  this was wrung from the unlistening tracy by the anguished thought of what might have been if only the dinner arrangements hadnt got mixed  no i shouldnt call it that said sellers who was now placidly walking up and down the room with his hands under his coattails and listening to himself talk  one could quite properly call it devilish in another man but not in the senator  your term is rightperfectly righti grant thatbut the application is wrong  it makes a great difference  yes he is a marvelous character  i do not suppose that any other statesman ever had such a colossal sense of humor combined with the ability to totally conceal it  i may except george washington and cromwell and perhaps robespierre but i draw the line there  a person not an expert might be in judge hawkinss company a lifetime and never find out he had any more sense of humor than a cemetery  a deepdrawn yardlong sigh from the distraught and dreaming artist followed by a murmured miserable oh miserable  well no i shouldnt say that about it quite  on the contrary i admire his ability to conceal his humor even more if possible than i admire the gift itself stupendous as it is  another thinggeneral hawkins is a thinker a keen logical exhaustive analytical thinker perhaps the ablest of modern times  that is of course upon themes suited to his size like the glacial period and the correlation of forces and the evolution of the christian from the caterpillarany of those things give him a subject according to his size and just stand back and watch him think  why you can see the place rock  ah yes you must know him you must get on the inside of him  perhaps the most extraordinary mind since aristotle  dinner was kept waiting for a while for miss thompson but as gwendolen had not delivered the invitation to her the waiting did no good and the household presently went to the meal without her  poor old sellers tried everything his hospitable soul could devise to make the occasion an enjoyable one for the guest and the guest tried his honest best to be cheery and chatty and happy for the old gentlemans sake in fact all hands worked hard in the interest of a mutual good time but the thing was a failure from the start tracys heart was lead in his bosom there seemed to be only one prominent feature in the landscape and that was a vacant chair he couldnt drag his mind away from gwendolen and his hard luck consequently his distractions allowed deadly pauses to slip in every now and then when it was his turn to say something and of course this disease spread to the rest of the conversationwherefore instead of having a breezy sail in sunny waters as anticipated everybody was bailing out and praying for land  what could the matter be  tracy alone could have told the others couldnt even invent a theory  meanwhile they were having a similarly dismal time at the thompson house in fact a twin experience  gwendolen was ashamed of herself for allowing her disappointment to so depress her spirits and make her so strangely and profoundly miserable but feeling ashamed of herself didnt improve the matter any it only seemed to aggravate the suffering  she explained that she was not feeling very well and everybody could see that this was true so she got sincere sympathy and commiseration but that didnt help the case  nothing helps that kind of a case  it is best to just stand off and let it fester  the moment the dinner was over the girl excused herself and she hurried home feeling unspeakably grateful to get away from that house and that intolerable captivity and suffering  will he be gone  the thought arose in her brain but took effect in her heels  she slipped into the house threw off her things and made straight for the dining room  she stopped and listened  her fathers voicewith no life in it presently her mothersno life in that a considerable vacancy then a sterile remark from washington hawkins another silence then not tracys but her fathers voice again  hes gone she said to herself despairingly and listlessly opened the door and stepped within  why my child cried the mother how white you are  are youhas anything  white exclaimed sellers  its gone like a flash twasnt serious already shes as red as the soul of a watermelon  sit down dear sit downgoodness knows youre welcome  did you have a good time  weve had great times hereimmense  why didnt miss belle come  mr tracy is not feeling well and shed have made him forget it  she was content now and out from her happy eyes there went a light that told a secret to another pair of eyes there and got a secret in return in just that infinitely small fraction of a second those two great confessions were made received and perfectly understood  all anxiety apprehension uncertainty vanished out of these young peoples hearts and left them filled with a great peace  sellers had had the most confident faith that with the new reinforcement victory would be at this last moment snatched from the jaws of defeat but it was an error  the talk was as stubbornly disjointed as ever he was proud of gwendolen and liked to show her off even against miss belle thompson and here had been a great opportunity and what had she made of it  he felt a good deal put out  it vexed him to think that this englishman with the traveling britons everlasting disposition to generalize whole mountain ranges from single samplegrains of sand would jump to the conclusion that american girls were as dumb as himself generalizing the whole tribe from this single sample and she at her poorest there being nothing at that table to inspire her give her a start keep her from going to sleep  he made up his mind that for the honor of the country he would bring these two together again over the social board before long  there would be a different result another time he judged  he said to himself with a deep sense of injury hell put in his diarythey all keep diarieshell put in his diary that she was miraculously uninterestingdear dear but wasnt she i never saw the likeand yet looking as beautiful as satan tooand couldnt seem to do anything but paw bread crumbs and pick flowers to pieces and look fidgety  and it isnt any better here in the hall of audience  ive had enough ill haul down my flagthe others may fight it out if they want to  he shook hands all around and went off to do some work which he said was pressing  the idolaters were the width of the room apart and apparently unconscious of each others presence  the distance got shortened a little now  very soon the mother withdrew  the distance narrowed again  tracy stood before a chromo of some ohio politician which had been retouched and chainmailed for a crusading rossmore and gwendolen was sitting on the sofa not far from his elbow artificially absorbed in examining a photograph album that hadnt any photographs in it  the senator still lingered  he was sorry for the young people it had been a dull evening for them  in the goodness of his heart he tried to make it pleasant for them now tried to remove the ill impression necessarily left by the general defeat tried to be chatty even tried to be gay  but the responses were sickly there was no starting any enthusiasm he would give it up and quitit was a day specially picked out and consecrated to failures  but when gwendolen rose up promptly and smiled a glad smile and said with thankfulness and blessing must you go it seemed cruel to desert and he sat down again  he was about to begin a remark whenwhen he didnt  we have all been there  he didnt know how he knew his concluding to stay longer had been a mistake he merely knew it and knew it for dead certain too  and so he bade goodnight and went mooning out wondering what he could have done that changed the atmosphere that way  as the door closed behind him those two were standing side by side looking at that doorlooking at it in a waiting secondcounting but deeply grateful kind of way  and the instant it closed they flung their arms about each others necks and there heart to heart and lip to lip  oh my god shes kissing it  nobody heard this remark because hawkins who bred it only thought it he didnt utter it  he had turned the moment he had closed the door and had pushed it open a little intending to reenter and ask what illadvised thing he had done or said and apologize for it  but he didnt reenter he staggered off stunned terrified distressed     chapter xxii  five minutes later he was sitting in his room with his head bowed within the circle of his arms on the tablefinal attitude of grief and despair his tears were flowing fast and now and then a sob broke upon the stillness  presently he said  i knew her when she was a little child and used to climb about my knees i love her as i love my own and nowoh poor thing poor thing i cannot bear itshes gone and lost her heart to this mangy materializee  why didnt we see that that might happen  but how could we  nobody could nobody could ever have dreamed of such a thing  you couldnt expect a person would fall in love with a waxwork  and this one doesnt even amount to that  he went on grieving to himself and now and then giving voice to his lamentations  its done oh its done and theres no help for it no undoing the miserable business  if i had the nerve i would kill it  but that wouldnt do any good  she loves it she thinks its genuine and authentic  if she lost it she would grieve for it just as she would for a real person  and whos to break it to the family  not iill die first  sellers is the best human being i ever knew and i wouldnt any more think ofoh dear why itll break his heart when he finds it out and pollys too  this comes of meddling with such infernal matters but for this the creature would still be roasting in sheol where it belongs  how is it that these people dont smell the brimstone sometimes i cant come into the same room with him without nearly suffocating  after a while he broke out again  well theres one thing sure  the materializing has got to stop right where it is  if shes got to marry a spectre let her marry a decent one out of the middle ages like this onenot a cowboy and a thief such as this protoplasmic tadpoles going to turn into if sellers keeps on fussing at it  it costs five thousand dollars cash and shuts down on the incorporated company to stop the works at this point but sally sellerss happiness is worth more than that  he heard sellers coming and got himself to rights  sellers took a seat and said  well ive got to confess im a good deal puzzled  it did certainly eat theres no getting around it  not eat exactly either but it nibbled nibbled in an appetiteless way but still it nibbled and thats just a marvel  now the question is what does it do with those nibblings  thats itwhat does it do with them  my idea is that we dont begin to know all there is to this stupendous discovery yet but time will showtime and sciencegive us a chance and dont get impatient  but he couldnt get hawkins interested couldnt make him talk to amount to anything couldnt drag him out of his depression  but at last he took a turn that arrested hawkinss attention  im coming to like him hawkins  he is a person of stupendous characterabsolutely gigantic  under that placid exterior is concealed the most daredevil spirit that was ever put into a manhes just a clive over again  yes im all admiration for him on account of his character and liking naturally follows admiration you know  im coming to like him immensely  do you know i havent the heart to degrade such a character as that down to the burglar estate for money or for anything else and ive come to ask if you are willing to let the reward go and leave this poor fellow  where he is  yesnot bring him down to date  oh theres my hand and my hearts in it too  ill never forget you for this hawkins said the old gentleman in a voice which he found it hard to control  you are making a great sacrifice for me and one which you can ill afford but ill never forget your generosity and if i live you shall not suffer for it be sure of that  sally sellers immediately and vividly realized that she was become a new being a being of a far higher and worthier sort than she had been such a little while before an earnest being in place of a dreamer and supplied with a reason for her presence in the world where merely a wistful and troubled curiosity about it had existed before  so great and so comprehensive was the change which had been wrought that she seemed to herself to be a real person who had lately been a shadow a something which had lately been a nothing a purpose which had lately been a fancy a finished temple with the altarfires lit and the voice of worship ascending where before had been but an architects confusion of arid working plans unintelligible to the passing eye and prophesying nothing  lady gwendolen  the pleasantness of that sound was all gone it was an offense to her ear now  she said  therethat sham belongs to the past i will not be called by it any more  i may call you simply gwendolen  you will allow me to drop the formalities straightway and name you by your dear first name without additions  she was dethroning the pink and replacing it with a rosebud  therethat is better  i hate pinkssome pinks  indeed yes you are to call me by my first name without additionsthat iswell i dont mean without additions entirely but  it was as far as she could get  there was a pause his intellect was struggling to comprehend presently it did manage to catch the idea in time to save embarrassment all around and he said gratefully  dear gwendolen  i may say that  yespart of it  butdont kiss me when i am talking it makes me forget what i was going to say  you can call me by part of that form but not the last part  gwendolen is not my name  not your name this in a tone of wonder and surprise  the girls soul was suddenly invaded by a creepy apprehension a quite definite sense of suspicion and alarm  she put his arms away from her looked him searchingly in the eye and said  answer me truly on your honor  you are not seeking to marry me on account of my rank  the shot almost knocked him through the wall he was so little prepared for it  there was something so finely grotesque about the question and its parent suspicion that he stopped to wonder and admire and thus was he saved from laughing  then without wasting precious time he set about the task of convincing her that he had been lured by herself alone and had fallen in love with her only not her title and position that he loved her with all his heart and could not love her more if she were a duchess or less if she were without home name or family  she watched his face wistfully eagerly hopefully translating his words by its expression and when he had finished there was gladness in her heart a tumultuous gladness indeed though outwardly she was calm tranquil even judicially austere  she prepared a surprise for him now calculated to put a heavy strain upon those disinterested protestations of his and thus she delivered it burning it away word by word as the fuse burns down to a bombshell and watching to see how far the explosion would lift him  listenand do not doubt me for i shall speak the exact truth  howard tracy i am no more an earls child than you are  to her joyand secret surprise alsoit never phased him  he was ready this time and saw his chance  he cried out with enthusiasm thank heaven for that and gathered her to his arms  to express her happiness was almost beyond her gift of speech  you make me the proudest girl in all the earth she said with her head pillowed on his shoulder  i thought it only natural that you should be dazzled by the titlemaybe even unconsciously you being englishand that you might be deceiving yourself in thinking you loved only me and find you didnt love me when the deception was swept away so it makes me proud that the revelation stands for nothing and that you do love just me only meoh prouder than any words can tell  it is only you sweetheart i never gave one envying glance toward your fathers earldom  that is utterly true dear gwendolen  thereyou mustnt call me that  i hate that false name  i told you it wasnt mine  my name is sally sellersor sarah if you like  from this time i banish dreams visions imaginings and will no more of them i am going to be myselfmy genuine self my honest self my natural self clear and clean of sham and folly and fraud and worthy of you there is no grain of social inequality between us i like you am poor i like you am without position or distinction you are a struggling artist i am that too in my humbler way  our bread is honest bread we work for our living  hand in hand we will walk hence to the grave helping each other in all ways living for each other being and remaining one in heart and purpose one in hope and aspiration inseparable to the end  and though our place is low judged by the worlds eye we will make it as high as the highest in the great essentials of honest work for what we eat and wear and conduct above reproach  we live in a land let us be thankful where this is allsufficient and no man is better than his neighbor by the grace of god but only by his own merit  tracy tried to break in but she stopped him and kept the floor herself  i am not through yet  i am going to purge myself of the last vestiges of artificiality and pretence and then start fair on your own honest level and be worthy mate to you thenceforth  my father honestly thinks he is an earl  well leave him his dream it pleases him and does no one any harm it was the dream of his ancestors before him  it has made fools of the house of sellers for generations and it made something of a fool of me but took no deep root  i am done with it now and for good fortyeight hours ago i was privately proud of being the daughter of a pinchbeck earl and thought the proper mate for me must be a man of like degree but todayoh how grateful i am for your love which has healed my sick brain and restored my sanityi could make oath that no earls son in all the world  ohwell butbut  why you look like a person in a panic  what is it  what is the matter  matter  oh nothingnothing  i was only going to saybut in his flurry nothing occurred to him to say for a moment then by a lucky inspiration he thought of something entirely sufficient for the occasion and brought it out with eloquent force oh how beautiful you are  you take my breath away when you look like that  it was well conceived well timed and cordially deliveredand it got its reward  let me see  where was i  yes my fathers earldom is pure moonshine look at those dreadful things on the wall  you have of course supposed them to be portraits of his ancestors earls of rossmore  well they are not  they are chromos of distinguished americansall moderns but he has carried them back a thousand years by relabeling them  andrew jackson there is doing what he can to be the late american earl and the newest treasure in the collection is supposed to be the young english heiri mean the idiot with the crape but in truth its a shoemaker and not lord berkeley at all  are you sure  why of course i am  he wouldnt look like that  why  because his conduct in his last moments when the fire was sweeping around him shows that he was a man  it shows that he was a fine highsouled young creature  tracy was strongly moved by these compliments and it seemed to him that the girls lovely lips took on anew loveliness when they were delivering them  he said softly  it is a pity he could not know what a gracious impression his behavior was going to leave with the dearest and sweetest stranger in the land of  oh i almost loved him  why i think of him every day  he is always floating about in my mind  tracy felt that this was a little more than was necessary  he was conscious of the sting of jealousy  he said  it is quite right to think of himat least now and thenthat is at intervalsin perhaps an admiring waybut it seems to me that  howard tracy are you jealous of that dead man  he was ashamedand at the same time not ashamed  he was jealousand at the same time he was not jealous  in a sense the dead man was himself in that case compliments and affection lavished upon that corpse went into his own till and were clear profit  but in another sense the dead man was not himself and in that case all compliments and affection lavished there were wasted and a sufficient basis for jealousy  a tiff was the result of the dispute between the two  then they made it up and were more loving than ever  as an affectionate clincher of the reconciliation sally declared that she had now banished lord berkeley from her mind and added and in order to make sure that he shall never make trouble between us again i will teach myself to detest that name and all that have ever borne it or ever shall bear it  this inflicted another pang and tracy was minded to ask her to modify that a little just on general principles and as practice in not overdoing a good thingperhaps he might better leave things as they were and not risk bringing on another tiff  he got away from that particular and sought less tender ground for conversation  i suppose you disapprove wholly of aristocracies and nobilities now that you have renounced your title and your fathers earldom  real ones  oh dear nobut ive thrown aside our sham one for good  this answer fell just at the right time and just in the right place to save the poor unstable young man from changing his political complexion once more  he had been on the point of beginning to totter again but this prop shored him up and kept him from floundering back into democracy and rerenouncing aristocracy  so he went home glad that he had asked the fortunate question  the girl would accept a little thing like a genuine earldom she was merely prejudiced against the brummagem article yes he could have his girl and have his earldom too that question was a fortunate stroke  sally went to bed happy too and remained happy deliriously happy for nearly two hours but at last just as she was sinking into a contented and luxurious unconsciousness the shady devil who lives and lurks and hides and watches inside of human beings and is always waiting for a chance to do the proprietor a malicious damage whispered to her soul and said that question had a harmless look but what was back of itwhat was the secret motive of itwhat suggested it  the shady devil had knifed her and could retire now and take a rest the wound would attend to business for him  and it did  why should howard tracy ask that question  if he was not trying to marry her for the sake of her rank what should suggest that question to him didnt he plainly look gratified when she said her objections to aristocracy had their limitations  ah he is after that earldom that gilded shamit isnt poor me he wants  so she argued in anguish and tears  then she argued the opposite theory but made a weak poor business of it and lost the case  she kept the arguing up one side and then the other the rest of the night and at last fell asleep at dawn fell in the fire at dawn one may say for that kind of sleep resembles fire and one comes out of it with his brain baked and his physical forces fried out of him     chapter xxiii  tracy wrote his father before he sought his bed  he wrote a letter which he believed would get better treatment than his cablegram received for it contained what ought to be welcome news namely that he had tried equality and working for a living had made a fight which he could find no reason to be ashamed of and in the matter of earning a living had proved that he was able to do it but that on the whole he had arrived at the conclusion that he could not reform the world singlehanded and was willing to retire from the conflict with the fair degree of honor which he had gained and was also willing to return home and resume his position and be content with it and thankful for it for the future leaving further experiment of a missionary sort to other young people needing the chastening and quelling persuasions of experience the only logic sure to convince a diseased imagination and restore it to rugged health  then he approached the subject of marriage with the daughter of the american claimant with a good deal of caution and much painstaking art  he said praiseful and appreciative things about the girl but didnt dwell upon that detail or make it prominent  the thing which he made prominent was the opportunity now so happily afforded to reconcile york and lancaster graft the warring roses upon one stem and end forever a crying injustice which had already lasted far too long  one could infer that he had thought this thing all out and chosen this way of making all things fair and right because it was sufficiently fair and considerably wiser than the renunciationscheme which he had brought with him from england  one could infer that but he didnt say it  in fact the more he read his letter over the more he got to inferring it himself  when the old earl received that letter the first part of it filled him with a grim and snarly satisfaction but the rest of it brought a snort or two out of him that could be translated differently  he wasted no ink in this emergency either in cablegrams or letters he promptly took ship for america to look into the matter himself  he had staunchly held his grip all this long time and given no sign of the hunger at his heart to see his son hoping for the cure of his insane dream and resolute that the process should go through all the necessary stages without assuaging telegrams or other nonsense from home and here was victory at last victory but stupidly marred by this idiotic marriage project  yes he would step over and take a hand in this matter himself  during the first ten days following the mailing of the letter tracys spirits had no idle time they were always climbing up into the clouds or sliding down into the earth as deep as the law of gravitation reached he was intensely happy or intensely miserable by turns according to miss sallys moods  he never could tell when the mood was going to change and when it changed he couldnt tell what it was that had changed it sometimes she was so in love with him that her love was tropical torrid and she could find no language fervent enough for its expression then suddenly and without warning or any apparent reason the weather would change and the victim would find himself adrift among the icebergs and feeling as lonesome and friendless as the north pole  it sometimes seemed to him that a man might better be dead than exposed to these devastating varieties of climate  the case was simple  sally wanted to believe that tracys preference was disinterested so she was always applying little tests of one sort or another hoping and expecting that they would bring out evidence which would confirm or fortify her belief  poor tracy did not know that these experiments were being made upon him consequently he walked promptly into all the traps the girl set for him  these traps consisted in apparently casual references to social distinction aristocratic title and privilege and such things  often tracy responded to these references heedlessly and not much caring what he said provided it kept the talk going and prolonged the seance  he didnt suspect that the girl was watching his face and listening for his words as one who watches the judges face and listens for the words which will restore him to home and friends and freedom or shut him away from the sun and human companionship forever  he didnt suspect that his careless words were being weighed and so he often delivered sentence of death when it would have been just as handy and all the same to him to pronounce acquittal  daily he broke the girls heart nightly he sent her to the rack for sleep  he couldnt understand it  some people would have put this and that together and perceived that the weather never changed until one particular subject was introduced and that then it always changed  and they would have looked further and perceived that that subject was always introduced by the one party never the other  they would have argued then that this was done for a purpose  if they could not find out what that purpose was in any simpler or easier way they would ask  but tracy was not deep enough or suspicious enough to think of these things  he noticed only one particular that the weather was always sunny when a visit began  no matter how much it might cloud up later it always began with a clear sky  he couldnt explain this curious fact to himself he merely knew it to be a fact  the truth of the matter was that by the time tracy had been out of sallys sight six hours she was so famishing for a sight of him that her doubts and suspicions were all consumed away in the fire of that longing and so always she came into his presence as surprisingly radiant and joyous as she wasnt when she went out of it  in circumstances like these a growing portrait runs a good many risks the portrait of sellers by tracy was fighting along day by day through this mixed weather and daily adding to itself ineradicable signs of the checkered life it was leading  it was the happiest portrait in spots that was ever seen but in other spots a damned soul looked out from it a soul that was suffering all the different kinds of distress there are from stomach ache to rabies  but sellers liked it  he said it was just himself all overa portrait that sweated moods from every pore and no two moods alike  he said he had as many different kinds of emotions in him as a jug  it was a kind of a deadly work of art maybe but it was a starchy picture for show for it was life size full length and represented the american earl in a peers scarlet robe with the three ermine bars indicative of an earls rank and on the gray head an earls coronet tilted just a wee bit to one side in a most gallus and winsome way  when sallys weather was sunny the portrait made tracy chuckle but when her weather was overcast it disordered his mind and stopped the circulation of his blood  late one night when the sweethearts had been having a flawless visit together sallys interior devil began to work his specialty and soon the conversation was drifting toward the customary rock  presently in the midst of tracys serene flow of talk he felt a shudder which he knew was not his shudder but exterior to his breast although immediately against it  after the shudder came sobs sally was crying  oh my darling what have i donewhat have i said  it has happened again  what have i done to wound you  she disengaged herself from his arms and gave him a look of deep reproach  what have you done  i will tell you what you have done  you have unwittingly revealedoh for the twentieth time though i could not believe it would not believe itthat it is not me you love but that foolish sham my fathers imitation earldom and you have broken my heart  oh my child what are you saying  i never dreamed of such a thing  oh howard howard the things you have uttered when you were forgetting to guard your tongue have betrayed you  things i have uttered when i was forgetting to guard my tongue  these are hard words  when have i remembered to guard it  never in one instance  it has no office but to speak the truth  it needs no guarding for that  howard i have noted your words and weighed them when you were not thinking of their significanceand they have told me more than you meant they should  do you mean to say you have answered the trust i had in you by using it as an ambuscade from which you could set snares for my unsuspecting tongue and be safe from detection while you did it  you have not done thissurely you have not done this thing  oh ones enemy could not do it  this was an aspect of the girls conduct which she had not clearly perceived before  was it treachery  had she abused a trust  the thought crimsoned her cheeks with shame and remorse  oh forgive me she said i did not know what i was doing  i have been so torturedyou will forgive me you must i have suffered so much and i am so sorry and so humble you do forgive me dont youdont turn away dont refuse me it is only my love that is at fault and you know i love you love you with all my heart i couldnt bear tooh dear dear i am so miserable and i sever meant any harm and i didnt see where this insanity was carrying me and how it was wronging and abusing the dearest heart in all the world to meandandoh take me in your arms again i have no other refuge no other home and hope  there was reconciliation againimmediate perfect allembracingand with it utter happiness  this would have been a good time to adjourn but no now that the cloudbreeder was revealed at last now that it was manifest that all the sour weather had come from this girls dread that tracy was lured by her rank and not herself he resolved to lay that ghost immediately and permanently by furnishing the best possible proof that he couldnt have had back of him at any time the suspected motive so he said  let me whisper a little secret in your eara secret which i have kept shut up in my breast all this time  your rank couldnt ever have been an enticement  i am son and heir to an english earl  the girl stared at himone two three moments maybe a dozenthen her lips parted  you she said and moved away from him still gazing at him in a kind of blank amazement  whywhy certainly i am  why do you act like this  what have i done now  what have you done  you have certainly made a most strange statement you must see that yourself  well with a timid little laugh it may be a strange enough statement but of what consequence is that if it is true  if it is true  you are already retiring from it  oh not for a moment  you should not say that  i have not deserved it i have spoken the truth why do you doubt it  her reply was prompt  simply because you didnt speak it earlier  oh it wasnt a groan exactly but it was an intelligible enough expression of the fact that he saw the point and recognized that there was reason in it  you have seemed to conceal nothing from me that i ought to know concerning yourself and you were not privileged to keep back such a thing as this from me a moment afterafterwell after you had determined to pay your court to me  its true its true i know it  but there were circumstancesin in the waycircumstances which  she waved the circumstances aside  well you see he said pleadingly you seemed so bent on our traveling the proud path of honest labor and honorable poverty that i was terrifiedthat is i was afraidofofwell you know how you talked  yes i know how i talked  and i also know that before the talk was finished you inquired how i stood as regards aristocracies and my answer was calculated to relieve your fears  he was silent a while  then he said in a discouraged way  i dont see any way out of it  it was a mistake  that is in truth all it was just a mistake  no harm was meant no harm in the world i didnt see how it might some time look  it is my way  i dont seem to see far  the girl was almost disarmed for a moment  then she flared up again  an earls son  do earls sons go about working in lowly callings for their bread and butter  god knows they dont  i have wished they did  do earls sons sink their degree in a country like this and come sober and decent to sue for the hand of a born child of poverty when they can go drunk profane and steeped in dishonorable debt and buy the pick and choice of the millionaires daughters of america  you an earls son show me the signs  i thank god i am not ableif those are the signs  but yet i am an earls son and heir  it is all i can say  i wish you would believe me but you will not  i know no way to persuade you  she was about to soften again but his closing remark made her bring her foot down with smart vexation and she cried out  oh you drive all patience out of me  would you have one believe that you havent your proofs at hand and yet are what you say you are you do not put your hand in your pocket nowfor you have nothing there you make a claim like this and then venture to travel without credentials  these are simply incredibilities  dont you see that yourself  he cast about in his mind for a defence of some kind or otherhesitated a little and then said with difficulty and diffidence  i will tell you just the truth foolish as it will seem to you to anybody i supposebut it is the truth  i had an idealcall it a dream a folly if you willbut i wanted to renounce the privileges and unfair advantages enjoyed by the nobility and wrung from the nation by force and fraud and purge myself of my share of those crimes against right and reason by thenceforth comrading with the poor and humble on equal terms earning with my own hands the bread i ate and rising by my own merit if i rose at all  the young girl scanned his face narrowly while he spoke and there was something about his simplicity of manner and statement which touched her touched her almost to the danger point but she set her grip on the yielding spirit and choked it to quiescence it could not be wise to surrender to compassion or any kind of sentiment yet she must ask one or two more questions  tracy was reading her face and what he read there lifted his drooping hopes a little  an earls son to do that  why he were a man  a man to loveoh more a man to worship  why  but he never lived  he is not born he will not be born  the selfabnegation that could do thateven in utter folly and hopeless of conveying benefit to any beyond the mere examplecould be mistaken for greatness why it would be greatness in this cold age of sordid ideals a momentwaitlet me finish i have one question more  your father is earl of what  rossmoreand i am viscount berkeley  the fat was in the fire again  the girl felt so outraged that it was difficult for her to speak  how can you venture such a brazen thing  you know that he is dead and you know that i know it  oh to rob the living of name and honors for a selfish and temporary advantage is crime enough but to rob the defenceless deadwhy it is more than crime it degrades crime  oh listen to mejust a worddont turn away like that  dont go dont leave me sostay one moment  on my honor  oh on your honor  on my honor i am what i say  and i will prove it and you will believe i know you will  i will bring you a messagea cablegram  when  tomorrownext day  signed rossmore  yessigned rossmore  what will that prove  what will it prove  what should it prove  if you force me to say itpossibly the presence of a confederate somewhere  this was a hard blow and staggered him  he said dejectedly  it is true  i did not think of it  oh my god i do not know any way to do i do everything wrong  you are goingand you wont say even goodnightor goodbye  ah we have not parted like this before  oh i want to run andno go now  a pausethen she said you may bring the message when it comes  oh may i  god bless you  he was gone and none too soon her lips were already quivering and now she broke down  through her sobbings her words broke from time to time  oh he is gone  i have lost him i shall never see him any more  and he didnt kiss me goodbye never even offered to force a kiss from me and he knowing it was the very very last and i expecting he would and never dreaming he would treat me so after all we have been to each other oh oh oh oh what shall i do what shall i do  he is a dear poor miserable goodhearted transparent liar and humbug but oh i do love him so  after a little she broke into speech again  how dear he is and i shall miss him so i shall miss him so  why wont he ever think to forge a message and fetch itbut no he never will he never thinks of anything hes so honest and simple it wouldnt ever occur to him oh what did possess him to think he could succeed as a fraudand he hasnt the first requisite except duplicity that i can see  oh dear ill go to bed and give it all up  oh i wish i had told him to come and tell me whenever he didnt get any telegramand now its all my own fault if i never see him again  how my eyes must look     chapter xxiv  next day sure enough the cablegram didnt come  this was an immense disaster for tracy couldnt go into the presence without that ticket although it wasnt going to possess any value as evidence  but if the failure of the cablegram on that first day may be called an immense disaster where is the dictionary that can turn out a phrase sizeable enough to describe the tenth days failure  of course every day that the cablegram didnt come made tracy all of twentyfour hours more ashamed of himself than he was the day before and made sally fully twentyfour hours more certain than ever that he not only hadnt any father anywhere but hadnt even a confederateand so it followed that he was a doubledyed humbug and couldnt be otherwise  these were hard days for barrow and the art firm  all these had their hands full trying to comfort tracy  barrows task was particularly hard because he was made a confidant in full and therefore had to humor tracys delusion that he had a father and that the father was an earl and that he was going to send a cablegram  barrow early gave up the idea of trying to convince tracy that he hadnt any father because this had such a bad effect on the patient and worked up his temper to such an alarming degree  he had tried as an experiment letting tracy think he had a father the result was so good that he went further with proper caution and tried letting him think his father was an earl this wrought so well that he grew bold and tried letting him think he had two fathers if he wanted to but he didnt want to so barrow withdrew one of them and substituted letting him think he was going to get a cablegramwhich barrow judged he wouldnt and was right but barrow worked the cablegram daily for all it was worth and it was the one thing that kept tracy alive that was barrows opinion  and these were bitter hard days for poor sally and mainly delivered up to private crying  she kept her furniture pretty damp and so caught cold and the dampness and the cold and the sorrow together undermined her appetite and she was a pitiful enough object poor thing  her state was bad enough as per statement of it above quoted but all the forces of nature and circumstance seemed conspiring to make it worseand succeeding  for instance the morning after her dismissal of tracy hawkins and sellers read in the associated press dispatches that a toy puzzle called pigs in the clover had come into sudden favor within the past few weeks and that from the atlantic to the pacific all the populations of all the states had knocked off work to play with it and that the business of the country had now come to a standstill by consequence that judges lawyers burglars parsons thieves merchants mechanics murderers women children babieseverybody indeed could be seen from morning till midnight absorbed in one deep project and purpose and only oneto pen those pigs work out that puzzle successfully that all gayety all cheerfulness had departed from the nation and in its place care preoccupation and anxiety sat upon every countenance and all faces were drawn distressed and furrowed with the signs of age and trouble and marked with the still sadder signs of mental decay and incipient madness that factories were at work night and day in eight cities and yet to supply the demand for the puzzle was thus far impossible  hawkins was wild with joy but sellers was calm  small matters could not disturb his serenity  he said  thats just the way things go  a man invents a thing which could revolutionize the arts produce mountains of money and bless the earth and who will bother with it or show any interest in itand so you are just as poor as you were before  but you invent some worthless thing to amuse yourself with and would throw it away if let alone and all of a sudden the whole world makes a snatch for it and out crops a fortune hunt up that yankee and collect hawkinshalf is yours you know leave me to potter at my lecture  this was a temperance lecture  sellers was head chief in the temperance camp and had lectured now and then in that interest but had been dissatisfied with his efforts wherefore he was now about to try a new plan  after much thought he had concluded that a main reason why his lectures lacked fire or something was that they were too transparently amateurish that is to say it was probably too plainly perceptible that the lecturer was trying to tell people about the horrid effects of liquor when he didnt really know anything about those effects except from hearsay since he had hardly ever tasted an intoxicant in his life his scheme now was to prepare himself to speak from bitter experience hawkins was to stand by with the bottle calculate the doses watch the effects make notes of results and otherwise assist in the preparation time was short for the ladies would be along about noonthat is to say the temperance organization called the daughters of siloamand sellers must be ready to head the procession  the time kept slipping alonghawkins did not returnsellers could not venture to wait longer so he attacked the bottle himself and proceeded to note the effects  hawkins got back at last took one comprehensive glance at the lecturer and went down and headed off the procession the ladies were grieved to hear that the champion had been taken suddenly ill and violently so but glad to hear that it was hoped he would be out again in a few days  as it turned out the old gentleman didnt turn over or show any signs of life worth speaking of for twentyfour hours  then he asked after the procession and learned what had happened about it  he was sorry said he had been fixed for it  he remained abed several days and his wife and daughter took turns in sitting with him and ministering to his wants often he patted sallys head and tried to comfort her  dont cry my child dont cry so you know your old father did it by mistake and didnt mean a bit of harm you know he wouldnt intentionally do anything to make you ashamed for the world you know he was trying to do good and only made the mistake through ignorance not knowing the right doses and washington not there to help  dont cry so dear it breaks my old heart to see you and think ive brought this humiliation on you and you so dear to me and so good  i wont ever do it again indeed i wont now be comforted honey thats a good child  but when she wasnt on duty at the bedside the crying went on just the same then the mother would try to comfort her and say  dont cry dear he never meant any harm it was all one of those happens that you cant guard against when you are trying experiments that way  you see i dont cry  its because i know him so well i could never look anybody in the face again if he had got into such an amazing condition as that apurpose but bless you his intention was pure and high and that makes the act pure though it was higher than was necessary  were not humiliated dear he did it under a noble impulse and we dont need to be ashamed  there dont cry any more honey  thus the old gentleman was useful to sally during several days as an explanation of her tearfulness  she felt thankful to him for the shelter he was affording her but often said to herself its a shame to let him see in my cryings a reproachas if he could ever do anything that could make me reproach him  but i cant confess ive got to go on using him for a pretext hes the only one ive got in the world and i do need one so much  as soon as sellers was out again and found that stacks of money had been placed in bank for him and hawkins by the yankee he said now well soon see whos the claimant and whos the authentic  ill just go over there and warm up that house of lords  during the next few days he and his wife were so busy with preparations for the voyage that sally had all the privacy she needed and all the chance to cry that was good for her then the old pair left for new yorkand england  sally had also had a chance to do another thing  that was to make up her mind that life was not worth living upon the present terms  if she must give up her impostor and die doubtless she must submit but might she not lay her whole case before some disinterested person first and see if there wasnt perhaps some saving way out of the matter  she turned this idea over in her mind a good deal  in her first visit with hawkins after her parents were gone the talk fell upon tracy and she was impelled to set her case before the statesman and take his counsel so she poured out her heart and he listened with painful solicitude she concluded pleadingly with  dont tell me he is an impostor  i suppose he is but doesnt it look to you as if he isnt  you are cool you know and outside and so maybe it can look to you as if he isnt one when it cant to me doesnt it look to you as if he isnt  couldnt youcant it look to you that wayforfor my sake  the poor man was troubled but he felt obliged to keep in the neighborhood of the truth  he fought around the present detail a little while then gave it up and said he couldnt really see his way to clearing tracy  no he said the truth is hes an impostor  that is youyou feel a little certain but not entirelyoh not entirely mr hawkins  its a pity to have to say iti do hate to say it but i dont think anything about it i know hes an impostor  oh now mr  hawkins you cant go that far  a body cant really know it you know  it isnt proved that hes not what he says he is  should he come out and make a clean breast of the whole wretched business  yesat least the most of itit ought to be done  so he set his teeth and went at the matter with determination but purposing to spare the girl one painthat of knowing that tracy was a criminal  now i am going to tell you a plain tale one not pleasant for me to tell or for you to hear but weve got to stand it  i know all about that fellow and i know he is no earls son  the girls eyes flashed and she said  i dont care a snap for thatgo on  this was so wholly unexpected that it at once obstructed the narrative hawkins was not even sure that he had heard aright  he said  i dont know that i quite understand  do you mean to say that if he was all right and proper otherwise youd be indifferent about the earl part of the business  absolutely  youd be entirely satisfied with him and wouldnt care for his not being an earls sonthat being an earls son wouldnt add any value to him  not the least value that i would care for  why mr  hawkins ive gotten over all that daydreaming about earldoms and aristocracies and all such nonsense and am become just a plain ordinary nobody and content with it and it is to him i owe my cure  and as to anything being able to add a value to him nothing can do that  he is the whole world to me just as he is he comprehends all the values there arethen how can you add one  shes pretty far gone  he said that to himself  he continued still to himself i must change my plan again i cant seem to strike one that will stand the requirements of this most variegated emergency five minutes on a stretch  without making this fellow a criminal i believe i will invent a name and a character for him calculated to disenchant her  if it fails to do it then ill know that the next rightest thing to do will be to help her to her fate poor thing not hinder her then he said aloud  well gwendolen  i want to be called sally  im glad of it i like it better myself  well then ill tell you about this man snodgrass  snodgrass  is that his name  yessnodgrass  the others his nom de plume  its hideous  i know it is but we cant help our names  and that is truly his real nameand not howard tracy  hawkins answered regretfully  yes it seems a pity  the girl sampled the name musingly once or twice  snodgrass  snodgrass  no i could not endure that  i could not get used to it  no i should call him by his first name  what is his first name  hiserhis initials are s m  his initials  i dont care anything about his initials  i cant call him by his initials  what do they stand for  well you see his father was a physician and hehewell he was an idolater of his profession and hewell he was a very eccentric man and  what do they stand for  what are you shuffling about  theywell they stand for spinal meningitis  his father being a phy  i never heard such an infamous name  nobody can ever call a person thata person they love  i wouldnt call an enemy by such a name it sounds like an epithet  after a moment she added with a kind of consternation why it would be my name  letters would come with it on  yesmrs spinal meningitis snodgrass  dont repeat itdont i cant bear it  was the father a lunatic  no that is not charged  i am glad of that because that is transmissible  what do you think was the matter with him then  well i dont really know  the family used to run a good deal to idiots and so maybe  oh there isnt any maybe about it  this one was an idiot  well yeshe could have been  he was suspected  suspected said sally with irritation  would one suspect there was going to be a dark time if he saw the constellations fall out of the sky but that is enough about the idiot i dont take any interest in idiots tell me about the son  very well then this one was the eldest but not the favorite  his brother zylobalsamum  waitgive me a chance to realize that  it is perfectly stupefying zylowhat did you call it  zylobalsamum  i never heard such a name it sounds like a disease  is it a disease  no i dont think its a disease  its either scriptural or  well its not scriptural  then its anatomical  i knew it was one or the other  yes i remember now it is anatomical  its a gangliona nerve centreit is what is called the zylobalsamum process  well go on and if you come to any more of them omit the names they make one feel so uncomfortable  very well then  as i said this one was not a favorite in the family and so he was neglected in every way never sent to school always allowed to associate with the worst and coarsest characters and so of course he has grown up a rude vulgar ignorant dissipated ruffian and  he  its no such thing  you ought to be more generous than to make such a statement as that about a poor young stranger whowhowhy he is the very opposite of that  he is considerate courteous obliging modest gentle refined cultivatedoh for shame  how can you say such things about him  i dont blame you sallyindeed i havent a word of blame for you for being blinded byyour affectionblinded to these minor defects which are so manifest to others who  minor defects  do you call these minor defects  what are murder and arson pray  it is a difficult question to answer straight offand of course estimates of such things vary with environment  with us out our way they would not necessarily attract as much attention as with you yet they are often regarded with disapproval  murder and arson are regarded with disapproval  oh frequently  with disapproval  who are those puritans you are talking about but waithow did you come to know so much about this family  where did you get all this hearsay evidence  sally it isnt hearsay evidence  that is the serious part of it i knew that familypersonally  this was a surprise  you  you actually knew them  knew zylo as we used to call him and knew his father dr snodgrass i didnt know your own snodgrass but have had glimpses of him from time to time and i heard about him all the time  he was the common talk you see on account of his  on account of his not being a houseburner or an assassin i suppose that would have made him commonplace  where did you know these people  in cherokee strip  oh how preposterous  there are not enough people in cherokee strip to give anybody a reputation good or bad  there isnt a quorum  why the whole population consists of a couple of wagon loads of horse thieves  hawkins answered placidly  our friend was one of those wagon loads  sallys eyes burned and her breath came quick and fast but she kept a fairly good grip on her anger and did not let it get the advantage of her tongue  the statesman sat still and waited for developments  he was content with his work  it was as handsome a piece of diplomatic art as he had ever turned out he thought and now let the girl make her own choice  he judged she would let her spectre go he hadnt a doubt of it in fact but anyway let the choice be made and he was ready to ratify it and offer no further hindrance  meantime sally had thought her case out and made up her mind  to the majors disappointment the verdict was against him  sally said  he has no friend but me and i will not desert him now  i will not marry him if his moral character is bad but if he can prove that it isnt i willand he shall have the chance  to me he seems utterly good and dear ive never seen anything about him that looked otherwise except of course his calling himself an earls son  maybe that is only vanity and no real harm when you get to the bottom of it  i do not believe he is any such person as you have painted him  i want to see him  i want you to find him and send him to me  i will implore him to be honest with me and tell me the whole truth and not be afraid  very well if that is your decision i will do it  but sally you know hes poor and  oh i dont care anything about that  thats neither here nor there will you bring him to me  ill do it  when  oh dear its getting toward dark now and so youll have to put it off till morning  but you will find him in the morning wont you promise  ill have him here by daylight  oh now youre your own old self againand lovelier than ever  i couldnt ask fairer than that  goodbye dear  sally mused a moment alone then said earnestly i love him in spite of his name and went about her affairs with a light heart     chapter xxv  hawkins went straight to the telegraph office and disburdened his conscience  he said to himself shes not going to give this galvanized cadaver up thats plain  wild horses cant pull her away from him ive done my share its for sellers to take an innings now  so he sent this message to new york  come back  hire special train  shes going to marry the materializee  meantime a note came to rossmore towers to say that the earl of rossmore had just arrived from england and would do himself the pleasure of calling in the evening  sally said to herself it is a pity he didnt stop in new york but its no matter he can go up tomorrow and see my father  he has come over here to tomahawk papa very likelyor buy out his claim  this thing would have excited me a while back but it has only one interest for me now and only one value  i can say toto spine spiny spinali dont like any form of that namei can say to him tomorrow dont try to keep it up any more or i shall have to tell you whom i have been talking with last night and then you will be embarrassed  tracy couldnt know he was to be invited for the morrow or he might have waited  as it was he was too miserable to wait any longer for his last hopea letterhad failed him  it was fully due today it had not come  had his father really flung him away  it looked so  it was not like his father but it surely looked so  his father was a rather tough nut in truth but had never been so with his sonstill this implacable silence had a calamitous look  anyway tracy would go to the towers and then what  he didnt know his head was tired out with thinking he wouldnt think about what he must do or saylet it all take care of itself  so that he saw sally once more he would be satisfied happen what might he wouldnt care  he hardly knew how he got to the towers or when  he knew and cared for only one thinghe was alone with sally  she was kind she was gentle there was moisture in her eyes and a yearning something in her face and manner which she could not wholly hidebut she kept her distance  they talked  bye and bye she saidwatching his downcast countenance out of the corner of her eye  its so lonesomewith papa and mamma gone  i try to read but i cant seem to get interested in any book  i try the newspapers but they do put such rubbish in them  you take up a paper and start to read something you thinks interesting and it goes on and on and on about how somebodywell dr snodgrass for instance  not a movement from tracy not the quiver of a muscle  sally was amazed what command of himself he must have  being disconcerted she paused so long that tracy presently looked up wearily and said  well  oh i thought you were not listening  yes it goes on and on about this doctor snodgrass till you are so tired and then about his younger son the favorite sonzylobalsamum snodgrass  not a sign from tracy whose head was drooping again  what supernatural selfpossession  sally fixed her eye on him and began again resolved to blast him out of his serenity this time if she knew how to apply the dynamite that is concealed in certain forms of words when those words are properly loaded with unexpected meanings  and next it goes on and on and on about the eldest sonnot the favorite this oneand how he is neglected in his poor barren boyhood and allowed to grow up unschooled ignorant coarse vulgar the comrade of the communitys scum and become in his completed manhood a rude profane dissipated ruffian  that head still drooped  sally rose moved softly and solemnly a step or two and stood before tracyhis head came slowly up his meek eyes met her intense onesthen she finished with deep impressiveness  named spinal meningitis snodgrass  tracy merely exhibited signs of increased fatigue  the girl was outraged by this iron indifference and callousness and cried out  what are you made of  i  why  havent you any sensitiveness  dont these things touch any poor remnant of delicate feeling in you  nno he said wonderingly they dont seem to  why should they  o dear me how can you look so innocent and foolish and good and empty and gentle and all that right in the hearing of such things as those  look me in the eyestraight in the eye  there now then answer me without a flinch  isnt doctor snodgrass your father and isnt zylobalsamum your brother here hawkins was about to enter the room but changed his mind upon hearing these words and elected for a walk down town and so glided swiftly away and isnt your name spinal meningitis and isnt your father a doctor and an idiot like all the family for generations and doesnt he name all his children after poisons and pestilences and abnormal anatomical eccentricities of the human body  answer me some way or somehowand quick  why do you sit there looking like an envelope without any address on it and see me going mad before your face with suspense  oh i wish i could dodoi wish i could do something anything that would give you peace again and make you happy but i know of nothing i know of no way  i have never heard of these awful people before  what  say it again  i have nevernever in my life till now  oh you do look so honest when you say that  it must be truesurely you couldnt look that way you wouldnt look that way if it were not truewould you  i couldnt and wouldnt  it is true  oh let us end this suffering take me back into your heart and confidence  waitone more thing  tell me you told that falsehood out of mere vanity and are sorry for it that youre not expecting to ever wear the coronet of an earl  truly i am curedcured this very dayi am not expecting it  o now you are mine  ive got you back in the beauty and glory of your unsmirched poverty and your honorable obscurity and nobody shall ever take you from me again but the grave  and if  de earl of rossmore fum englan  my father  the young man released the girl and hung his head  the old gentleman stood surveying the couplethe one with a strongly complimentary right eye the other with a mixed expression done with the left  this is difficult and not often resorted to  presently his face relaxed into a kind of constructive gentleness and he said to his son  dont you think you could embrace me too  the young man did it with alacrity  then you are the son of an earl after all said sally reproachfully  yes i  then i wont have you  o but you know  no i will not  youve told me another fib  shes right  go away and leave us  i want to talk with her  berkeley was obliged to go  but he did not go far  he remained on the premises  at midnight the conference between the old gentleman and the young girl was still going blithely on but it presently drew to a close and the former said  i came all the way over here to inspect you my dear with the general idea of breaking off this match if there were two fools of you but as theres only one you can have him if youll take him  indeed i will then  may i kiss you  you may  thank you  now you shall have that privilege whenever you are good  meantime hawkins had long ago returned and slipped up into the laboratory  he was rather disconcerted to find his late invention snodgrass there  the news was told him that the english rossmore was come  and im his son viscount berkeley not howard tracy any more  hawkins was aghast  he said  good gracious then youre dead  dead  yes you areweve got your ashes  hang those ashes im tired of them ill give them to my father  slowly and painfully the statesman worked the truth into his head that this was really a flesh and blood young man and not the insubstantial resurrection he and sellers had so long supposed him to be  then he said with feeling  im so glad so glad on sallys account poor thing  we took you for a departed materialized bank thief from tahlequah  this will be a heavy blow to sellers  then he explained the whole matter to berkeley who said  well the claimant must manage to stand the blow severe as it is but hell get over the disappointment  whothe colonel  hell get over it the minute he invents a new miracle to take its place  and hes already at it by this time  but look here what do you suppose became of the man youve been representing all this time  i dont know  i saved his clothesit was all i could do  i am afraid he lost his life  well you must have found twenty or thirty thousand dollars in those clothes in money or certificates of deposit  no i found only five hundred and a trifle  i borrowed the trifle and banked the five hundred  whatll we do about it  return it to the owner  its easy said but not easy to manage  lets leave it alone till we get sellerss advice  and that reminds me  ive got to run and meet sellers and explain who you are not and who you are or hell come thundering in here to stop his daughter from marrying a phantom  but suppose your father came over here to break off the match  well isnt he down stairs getting acquainted with sally  thats all safe  so hawkins departed to meet and prepare the sellerses  rossmore towers saw great times and late hours during the succeeding week  the two earls were such opposites in nature that they fraternized at once  sellers said privately that rossmore was the most extraordinary character he had ever meta man just made out of the condensed milk of human kindness yet with the ability to totally hide the fact from any but the most practised characterreader a man whose whole being was sweetness patience and charity yet with a cunning so profound an ability so marvelous in the acting of a double part that many a person of considerable intelligence might live with him for centuries and never suspect the presence in him of these characteristics   finally there was a quiet wedding at the towers instead of a big one at the british embassy with the militia and the fire brigades and the temperance organizations on hand in torchlight procession as at first proposed by one of the earls  the artfirm and barrow were present at the wedding and the tinner and puss had been invited but the tinner was ill and puss was nursing himfor they were engaged  the sellerses were to go to england with their new allies for a brief visit but when it was time to take the train from washington the colonel was missing  hawkins was going as far as new york with the party and said he would explain the matter on the road  the explanation was in a letter left by the colonel in hawkinss hands in it he promised to join mrs sellers later in england and then went on to say  the truth is my dear hawkins a mighty idea has been born to me within the hour and i must not even stop to say goodbye to my dear ones a mans highest duty takes precedence of all minor ones and must be attended to with his best promptness and energy at whatsoever cost to his affections or his convenience  and first of all a mans duties is his duty to his own honorhe must keep that spotless  mine is threatened  when i was feeling sure of my imminent future solidity i forwarded to the czar of russiaperhaps prematurelyan offer for the purchase of siberia naming a vast sum  since then an episode has warned me that the method by which i was expecting to acquire this money materialization upon a scale of limitless magnitudeis marred by a taint of temporary uncertainty  his imperial majesty may accept my offer at any moment  if this should occur now i should find myself painfully embarrassed in fact financially inadequate  i could not take siberia this would become known and my credit would suffer  recently my private hours have been dark indeed but the sun shines main now i see my way i shall be able to meet my obligation and without having to ask an extension of the stipulated time i think  this grand new idea of minethe sublimest i have ever conceived will save me whole i am sure  i am leaving for san francisco this moment to test it by the help of the great lick telescope  like all of my more notable discoveries and inventions it is based upon hard practical scientific laws all other bases are unsound and hence untrustworthy  in brief then i have conceived the stupendous idea of reorganizing the climates of the earth according to the desire of the populations interested that is to say i will furnish climates to order for cash or negotiable paper taking the old climates in part payment of course at a fair discount where they are in condition to be repaired at small cost and let out for hire to poor and remote communities not able to afford a good climate and not caring for an expensive one for mere display  my studies have convinced me that the regulation of climates and the breeding of new varieties at will from the old stock is a feasible thing  indeed i am convinced that it has been done before done in prehistoric times by now forgotten and unrecorded civilizations  everywhere i find hoary evidences of artificial manipulation of climates in bygone times  take the glacial period  was that produced by accident  not at all it was done for money  i have a thousand proofs of it and will some day reveal them  i will confide to you an outline of my idea  it is to utilize the spots on the sunget control of them you understand and apply the stupendous energies which they wield to beneficent purposes in the reorganizing of our climates  at present they merely make trouble and do harm in the evoking of cyclones and other kinds of electric storms but once under humane and intelligent control this will cease and they will become a boon to man  i have my plan all mapped out whereby i hope and expect to acquire complete and perfect control of the sunspots also details of the method whereby i shall employ the same commercially but i will not venture to go into particulars before the patents shall have been issued  i shall hope and expect to sell shoprights to the minor countries at a reasonable figure and supply a good business article of climate to the great empires at special rates together with fancy brands for coronations battles and other great and particular occasions  there are billions of money in this enterprise no expensive plant is required and i shall begin to realize in a few daysin a few weeks at furthest i shall stand ready to pay cash for siberia the moment it is delivered and thus save my honor and my credit  i am confident of this  i would like you to provide a proper outfit and start north as soon as i telegraph you be it night or be it day  i wish you to take up all the country stretching away from the north pole on all sides for many degrees south and buy greenland and iceland at the best figure you can get now while they are cheap  it is my intention to move one of the tropics up there and transfer the frigid zone to the equator  i will have the entire arctic circle in the market as a summer resort next year and will use the surplusage of the old climate over and above what can be utilized on the equator to reduce the temperature of opposition resorts but i have said enough to give you an idea of the prodigious nature of my scheme and the feasible and enormously profitable character of it i shall join all you happy people in england as soon as i shall have sold out some of my principal climates and arranged with the czar about siberia  meantime watch for a sign from me  eight days from now we shall be wide asunder for i shall be on the border of the pacific and you far out on the atlantic approaching england  that day if i am alive and my sublime discovery is proved and established i will send you greeting and my messenger shall deliver it where you are in the solitudes of the sea for i will waft a vast sunspot across the disk like drifting smoke and you will know it for my lovesign and will say mulberry sellers throws us a kiss across the universe       appendix  weather for use in this book  selected from the best authorities  a brief though violent thunderstorm which had raged over the city was passing away but still though the rain had ceased more than an hour before wild piles of dark and coppery clouds in which a fierce and rayless glow was laboring gigantically overhung the grotesque and huddled vista of dwarf houses while in the distance sheeting high over the low misty confusion of gables and chimneys spread a pall of dead leprous blue suffused with blotches of dull glistening yellow and with black plaguespots of vapor floating and faint lightnings crinkling on its surface  thunder still muttering in the close and sultry air kept the scared dwellers in the street within behind their closed shutters and all deserted cowed dejected squalid like poor stupid topheavy things that had felt the wrath of the summer tempest stood the drenched structures on either side of the narrow and crooked way ghastly and picturesque under the giant canopy  rain dripped wretchedly in slow drops of melancholy sound from their projecting eaves upon the broken flagging lay there in pools or trickled into the swollen drains where the fallen torrent sullenly gurgled on

swept upon us and t was night                     eastereve at kerakmoabclinton scollard   the quickcoming winter twilight was already at hand  snow was again falling sifting delicately down

with the awful shock of ten thousand batteries of artillery  it is the signal for the fury to springfor a thousand demons to scream and shriekfor innumerable serpents of fire to writhe and light up the blackness  now the rain fallsnow the wind is let loose with a terrible shrieknow the lightning is so constant that the eyes burn and the thunderclaps merge into an awful roar as did the 800 cannon at gettysburg  crash crash  crash  it is the cottonwood trees falling to earth  shriek shriek  shriek  it is the demon racing along the plain and uprooting even the blades of grass  shock  shock  shock  it is the fury flinging his fiery bolts into the bosom of the earth                     the demon and the fury  m quad   away up the gorge all diurnal fancies trooped into the wide liberties of endless luminous vistas of azure sunlit mountains beneath the shining azure heavens  the sky looking down in deep blue placidities only here and there smote the water to azure emulations of its tint                     in the strangers country charles egbert craddock   there was every indication of a duststorm though the sun still shone brilliantly  the hot wind had become wild and rampant  it was whipping up the sandy coating of the plain in every direction  high in the air were seen whirling spires and cones of sanda curious effect against the deepblue sky  below puffs of sand were breaking out of the plain in every direction as though the plain were alive with invisible horsemen these sandy cloudlets were instantly dissipated by the wind it was the larger clouds that were lifted whole into the air and the larger clouds of sand were becoming more and more the rule  alfreds eye quickly scanning the horizon descried the roof of the boundaryriders hut still gleaming in the sunlight  he remembered the hut well  it could not be farther than four miles if as much as that from this point of the track  he also knew these duststorms of old bindarra was notorious for them without thinking twice alfred put spurs to his horse and headed for the hut  before he had ridden half the distance the detached clouds of sand banded together in one dense whirlwind and it was only owing to his horses instinct that he did not ride wide of the hut altogether for during the last halfmile he never saw the hut until its outline loomed suddenly over his horses ears and by then the sun was invisible                      a bride from the bush   it rained forty days and forty nightsgenesis
