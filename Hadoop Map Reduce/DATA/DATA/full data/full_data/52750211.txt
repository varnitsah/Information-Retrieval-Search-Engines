52750211	the prairie  by j fenimore cooper     introduction  the prairie was the third in order of fenimore coopers leatherstocking tales its first appearance was in the year 1827 the idea of the story had suggested itself to him we are told before he had finished its immediate forerunner the last of the mohicans he chose entirely new scenes for it resolved to cross the mississippi and wander over the desolate wastes of the remote western prairies he had been taking every chance that came of making a personal acquaintance with the indian chiefs of the western tribes who were to be encountered about this period on their way in the frequent indian embassies to washington he saw much to command his admiration says mrs cooper in these wild braves it was a matter of course that in drawing indian character he should dwell on the better traits of the picture rather than on the coarser and more revolting though more common points like west he could see the apollo in the young mohawk  when in july 1826 cooper landed in england with his wife and family he carried his indian memories and associations with him they crossed to france and ascended the seine by steamboat and then settled for a time in paris of their quarters there in the rue st maur sarah fenimore cooper writes  it was thoroughly french in character there was a short narrow gloomy lane or street shut in between lofty dwelling houses the lane often dark always filthy without sidewalks a gutter running through the centre over which suspended from a rope hung a dim oil lamp or twosuch was the rue st maur in the faubourg st germain it was a gloomy approach certainly but a tall porte cochere opened and suddenly the whole scene changed within those high walls so forbidding in aspect there lay charming gardens gay with parterres of flowers and shaded by noble trees not only those belonging to the house itself but those of other adjoining dwellings of the same characterone looked over parklike grounds covering some acres the hotel itself standing on the street was old and built on a grand scale it had been the home of a french ducal family in the time of louis xiv the rooms on the two lower floors were imposing and spacious with ceilings of great height gilded wainscoting and various quaint little medallion pictures of shepherds and shepherdesses and other fancies of the time of madame de sevigne those little shepherds were supposed to have looked down upon la mere beaute and upon la plus jolie fille de france as she danced her incomparable minuets those grand saloons were now devoted to the humble service of a school for young ladies but on the third floor to which one ascended by a fine stone stairway broad and easy with elaborate iron railings there was a more simple set of rooms comfortably furnished where the american family were pleasantly provided for in a home of their own unwilling to separate from his children who were placed at the school the traveller adopted this plan that he might be near them one of the rooms overlooking the garden and opening on a small terrace became his study he was soon at work in his writingdesk lay some chapters of a new novel the ms had crossed the ocean with him though but little had been added to its pages during the wanderings of the english and french journeys  when some months later the story appeared its effect was immediate on both sides the atlantic it is worth note that during his french visit cooper met sir walter scott cooper was born at burlington new jersey 15th sept 1789 and died at cooperstown new

portion of the american union which lies between the alleghanies and the rocky mountains has given rise to many ingenious theories virtually the whole of this immense region is a plain for a distance extending nearly 1500 miles east and west and 600 north and south there is scarcely an elevation worthy to be called a mountain even hills are not common though a good deal of the face of the country has more or less of that rolling character which is described in the opening pages of this work  there is much reason to believe that the territory which now composes ohio illinois indiana michigan and a large portion of the country west of the mississippi lay formerly under water the soil of all the former states has the appearance of an alluvial deposit and isolated rocks have been found of a nature and in situations which render it difficult to refute the opinion that they have been transferred to their present beds by floating ice this theory assumes that the great lakes were the deep pools of one immense body of fresh water which lay too low to be drained by the irruption that laid bare the land  it will be remembered that the french when masters of the canadas and louisiana claimed the whole of the territory in question their hunters and advanced troops held the first communications with the savage occupants and the earliest written accounts we possess of these vast regions are from the pens of their missionaries many french words have consequently become of local use in this quarter of america and not a few names given in that language have been perpetuated when the adventurers who first penetrated these wilds met in the centre of the forests immense plains covered with rich verdure or rank grasses they naturally gave them the appellation of meadows as the english succeeded the french and found a peculiarity of nature differing from all they had yet seen on the continent already distinguished by a word that did not express any thing in their own language they left these natural meadows in possession of their title of convention in this manner has the word prairie been adopted into the english tongue  the american prairies are of two kinds those which lie east of the mississippi are comparatively small are exceedingly fertile and are always surrounded by forests they are susceptible of high cultivation and are fast becoming settled they abound in ohio michigan illinois and indiana they labour under the disadvantages of a scarcity of wood and waterevils of a serious character until art has had time to supply the deficiencies of nature as coal is said to abound in all that region and wells are generally successful the enterprise of the emigrants is gradually prevailing against these difficulties  the second description of these natural meadows lies west of the mississippi at a distance of a few hundred miles from that river and is called the great prairies they resemble the steppes of tartary more than any other known portion of christendom being in fact a vast country incapable of sustaining a dense population in the absence of the two great necessaries already named rivers abound it is true but this region is nearly destitute of brooks and the smaller water courses which tend so much to comfort and fertility  the origin and date of the great american prairies form one of natures most majestic mysteries the general character of the united states of the canadas and of mexico is that of luxuriant fertility it would be difficult to find another portion of the world of the same extent which has so little useless land as the inhabited parts of the american union most of the mountains are arable and even the prairies in this section of the republic are of deep alluvion the same is true between the rocky mountains and the pacific between the two lies the broad belt of comparative desert which is the scene of this tale appearing to interpose a barrier to the progress of the american people westward  the great prairies appear to be the final gathering place of the red men the remnants of the mohicans and the delawares of the creeks choctaws and cherokees are destined to fulfil their time on these vast plains the entire number of the indians within the union is differently computed at between one and three hundred thousand souls most of them inhabit the country west of the mississippi at the period of the tale they dwelt in open hostility national feuds passing from generation to generation the power of the republic has done much to restore peace to these wild scenes and it is now possible to travel in security where civilised man did not dare to pass unprotected fiveandtwenty years ago  the reader who has perused the two former works of which this is the natural successor will recognise an old acquaintance in the principal character of the story we have here brought him to his end and we trust he will be permitted to slumber in the peace of the just  j f cooper paris june 1832      the prairie    chapter i              i pray thee shepherd if that love or gold             can in this desert place buy entertainment             bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed                                                as you like it  much was said and written at the time concerning the policy of adding the vast regions of louisiana to the already immense and but halftenanted territories of the united states as the warmth of controversy however subsided and party considerations gave place to more liberal views the wisdom of the measure began to be generally conceded it soon became apparent to the meanest capacity that while nature had placed a barrier of desert to the extension of our population in the west the measure had made us the masters of a belt of fertile country which in the revolutions of the day might have become the property of a rival nation it gave us the sole command of the great thoroughfare of the interior and placed the countless tribes of savages who lay along our borders entirely within our control it reconciled conflicting rights and quieted national distrusts it opened a thousand avenues to the inland trade and to the waters of the pacific and if ever time or necessity shall require a peaceful division of this vast empire it assures us of a neighbour that will possess our language our religion our institutions and it is also to be hoped our sense of political justice  although the purchase was made in 1803 the spring of the succeeding year was permitted to open before the official prudence of the spaniard who held the province for his european master admitted the authority or even of the entrance of its new proprietors but the forms of the transfer were no sooner completed and the new government acknowledged than swarms of that restless people which is ever found hovering on the skirts of american society plunged into the thickets that fringed the right bank of the mississippi with the same careless hardihood as had already sustained so many of them in their toilsome progress from the atlantic states to the eastern shores of the father of rivers      the mississippi is thus termed in several of the indian languages     the reader will gain a more just idea of the importance of this     stream if he recalls to mind the fact that the missouri and the     mississippi are properly the same river their united lengths     cannot be greatly short of four thousand miles  time was necessary to blend the numerous and affluent colonists of the lower province with their new compatriots but the thinner and more humble population above was almost immediately swallowed in the vortex which attended the tide of instant emigration the inroad from the east was a new and sudden outbreaking of a people who had endured a momentary restraint after having been rendered nearly resistless by success the toils and hazards of former undertakings were forgotten as these endless and unexplored regions with all their fancied as well as real advantages were laid open to their enterprise the consequences were such as might easily have been anticipated from so tempting an offering placed as it was before the eyes of a race long trained in adventure and nurtured in difficulties  thousands of the elders of what were then called the new states broke up from the enjoyment of their hardearned indulgences and were to be seen leading long files of descendants born and reared in the forests of ohio and kentucky deeper into the land in quest of that which might be termed without the aid of poetry their natural and more congenial atmosphere the distinguished and resolute forester who first penetrated the wilds of the latter state was of the number this adventurous and venerable patriarch was now seen making his last remove placing the endless river between him and the multitude his own success had drawn around him and seeking for the renewal of enjoyments which were rendered worthless in his eyes when trammelled by the forms of human institutions       all the states admitted to the american union since the     revolution are called new states with the exception of vermont     that had claims before the war which were not however admitted     until a later day       colonel boon the patriarch of kentucky this venerable and hardy     pioneer of civilisation emigrated to an estate three hundred miles     west of the mississippi in his ninetysecond year because he     found a population of ten to the square mile inconveniently     crowded  in the pursuit of adventures such as these men are ordinarily governed by their habits or deluded by their wishes a few led by the phantoms of hope and ambitious of sudden affluence sought the mines of the virgin territory but by far the greater portion of the emigrants were satisfied to establish themselves along the margins of the larger watercourses content with the rich returns that the generous alluvial bottoms of the rivers never fail to bestow on the most desultory industry in this manner were communities formed with magical rapidity and most of those who witnessed the purchase of the empty empire have lived to see already a populous and sovereign state parcelled from its inhabitants and received into the bosom of the national union on terms of political equality  the incidents and scenes which are connected with this legend occurred in the earliest periods of the enterprises which have led to so great and so speedy a result  the harvest of the first year of our possession had long been passed and the fading foliage of a few scattered trees was already beginning to exhibit the hues and tints of autumn when a train of wagons issued from the bed of a dry rivulet to pursue its course across the undulating surface of what in the language of the country of which we write is called a rolling prairie the vehicles loaded with household goods and implements of husbandry the few straggling sheep and cattle that were herded in the rear and the rugged appearance and careless mien of the sturdy men who loitered at the sides of the lingering teams united to announce a band of emigrants seeking for the elderado of the west contrary to the usual practice of the men of their caste this party had left the fertile bottoms of the low country and had found its way by means only known to such adventurers across glen and torrent over deep morasses and arid wastes to a point far beyond the usual limits of civilised habitations in their front were stretched those broad plains which extend with so little diversity of character to the bases of the rocky mountains and many long and dreary miles in their rear foamed the swift and turbid waters of la platte  the appearance of such a train in that bleak and solitary place was rendered the more remarkable by the fact that the surrounding country offered so little that was tempting to the cupidity of speculation and if possible still less that was flattering to the hopes of an ordinary settler of new lands  the meagre herbage of the prairie promised nothing in favour of a hard and unyielding soil over which the wheels of the vehicles rattled as lightly as if they travelled on a beaten road neither wagons nor beasts making any deeper impression than to mark that bruised and withered grass which the cattle plucked from time to time and as often rejected as food too sour for even hunger to render palatable  whatever might be the final destination of these adventurers or the secret causes of their apparent security in so remote and unprotected a situation there was no visible sign of uneasiness uncertainty or alarm among them including both sexes and every age the number of the party exceeded twenty  at some little distance in front of the whole marched the individual who by his position and air appeared to be the leader of the band he was a tall sunburnt man past the middle age of a dull countenance and listless manner his frame appeared loose and flexible but it was vast and in reality of prodigious power it was only at moments however as some slight impediment opposed itself to his loitering progress that his person which in its ordinary gait seemed so lounging and nerveless displayed any of those energies which lay latent in his system like the slumbering and unwieldy but terrible strength of the elephant the inferior lineaments of his countenance were coarse extended and vacant while the superior or those nobler parts which are thought to affect the intellectual being were low receding and mean  the dress of this individual was a mixture of the coarsest vestments of a husbandman with the leathern garments that fashion as well as use had in some degree rendered necessary to one engaged in his present pursuits there was however a singular and wild display of prodigal and ill judged ornaments blended with his motley attire in place of the usual deerskin belt he wore around his body a tarnished silken sash of the most gaudy colours the buckhorn haft of his knife was profusely decorated with plates of silver the martens fur of his cap was of a fineness and shadowing that a queen might covet the buttons of his rude and soiled blanketcoat were of the glittering coinage of mexico the stock of his rifle was of beautiful mahogany riveted and banded with the same precious metal and the trinkets of no less than three worthless watches dangled from different parts of his person in addition to the pack and the rifle which were slung at his back together with the well filled and carefully guarded pouch and horn he had carelessly cast a keen and bright woodaxe across his shoulder sustaining the weight of the whole with as much apparent ease as if he moved unfettered in limb and free from incumbrance  a short distance in the rear of this man came a group of youths very similarly attired and bearing sufficient resemblance to each other and to their leader to distinguish them as the children of one family though the youngest of their number could not much have passed the period that in the nicer judgment of the law is called the age of discretion he had proved himself so far worthy of his progenitors as to have reared already his aspiring person to the standard height of his race there were one or two others of different mould whose descriptions must however be referred to the regular course of the narrative  of the females there were but two who had arrived at womanhood though several whiteheaded oliveskinned faces were peering out of the foremost wagon of the train with eyes of lively curiosity and characteristic animation the elder of the two adults was the sallow and wrinkled mother of most of the party and the younger was a sprightly active girl of eighteen who in figure dress and mien seemed to belong to a station in society several gradations above that of any one of her visible associates the second vehicle was covered with a top of cloth so tightly drawn as to conceal its contents with the nicest care the remaining wagons were loaded with such rude furniture and other personal effects as might be supposed to belong to one ready at any moment to change his abode without reference to season or distance  perhaps there was little in this train or in the appearance of its proprietors that is not daily to be encountered on the highways of this changeable and moving country but the solitary and peculiar scenery in which it was so unexpectedly exhibited gave to the party a marked character of wildness and adventure  in the little valleys which in the regular formation of the land occurred at every mile of their progress the view was bounded on two of the sides by the gradual and low elevations which gave name to the description of prairie we have mentioned while on the others the meagre prospect ran off in long narrow barren perspectives but slightly relieved by a pitiful show of coarse though somewhat luxuriant vegetation from the summits of the swells the eye became fatigued with the sameness and chilling dreariness of the landscape the earth was not unlike the ocean when its restless waters are heaving heavily after the agitation and fury of the tempest have begun to lessen there was the same waving and regular surface the same absence of foreign objects and the same boundless extent to the view indeed so very striking was the resemblance between the water and the land that however much the geologist might sneer at so simple a theory it would have been difficult for a poet not to have felt that the formation of the one had been produced by the subsiding dominion of the other here and there a tall tree rose out of the bottoms stretching its naked branches abroad like some solitary vessel and to strengthen the delusion far in the distance appeared two or three rounded thickets looming in the misty horizon like islands resting on the waters it is unnecessary to warn the practised reader that the sameness of the surface and the low stands of the spectators exaggerated the distances but as swell appeared after swell and island succeeded island there was a disheartening assurance that long and seemingly interminable tracts of territory must be passed before the wishes of the humblest agriculturist could be realised  still the leader of the emigrants steadily pursued his way with no other guide than the sun turning his back resolutely on the abodes of civilisation and plunging at each step more deeply if not irretrievably into the haunts of the barbarous and savage occupants of the country as the day drew nigher to a close however his mind which was perhaps incapable of maturing any connected system of forethought beyond that which related to the interests of the present moment became in some slight degree troubled with the care of providing for the wants of the hours of darkness  on reaching the crest of a swell that was a little higher than the usual elevations he lingered a minute and cast a half curious eye on either hand in quest of those well known signs which might indicate a place where the three grand requisites of water fuel and fodder were to be obtained in conjunction  it would seem that his search was fruitless for after a few moments of indolent and listless examination he suffered his huge frame to descend the gentle declivity in the same sluggish manner that an over fatted beast would have yielded to the downward pressure  his example was silently followed by those who succeeded him though not until the young men had manifested much more of interest if not of concern in the brief enquiry which each in his turn made on gaining the same lookout it was now evident by the tardy movements both of beasts and men that the time of necessary rest was not far distant the matted grass of the lower land presented obstacles which fatigue began to render formidable and the whip was becoming necessary to urge the lingering teams to their labour at this moment when with the exception of the principal individual a general lassitude was getting the mastery of the travellers and every eye was cast by a sort of common impulse wistfully forward the whole party was brought to a halt by a spectacle as sudden as it was unexpected  the sun had fallen below the crest of the nearest wave of the prairie leaving the usual rich and glowing train on its track in the centre of this flood of fiery light a human form appeared drawn against the gilded background as distinctly and seemingly as palpable as though it would come within the grasp of any extended hand the figure was colossal the attitude musing and melancholy and the situation directly in the route of the travellers but imbedded as it was in its setting of garish light it was impossible to distinguish its just proportions or true character  the effect of such a spectacle was instantaneous and powerful the man in front of the emigrants came to a stand and remained gazing at the mysterious object with a dull interest that soon quickened into superstitious awe his sons so soon as the first emotions of surprise had a little abated drew slowly around him and as they who governed the teams gradually followed their example the whole party was soon condensed in one silent and wondering group notwithstanding the impression of a supernatural agency was very general among the travellers the ticking of gunlocks was heard and one or two of the bolder youths cast their rifles forward in readiness for service  send the boys off to the right exclaimed the resolute wife and mother in a sharp dissonant voice i warrant me asa or abner will give some account of the creature  it may be well enough to try the rifle muttered a dull looking man whose features both in outline and expression bore no small resemblance to the first speaker and who loosened the stock of his piece and brought it dexterously to the front while delivering this opinion the pawnee loups are said to be hunting by hundreds in the plains if so theyll never miss a single man from their tribe  stay exclaimed a soft toned but alarmed female voice which was easily to be traced to the trembling lips of the younger of the two women we are not altogether it may be a friend  who is scouting now demanded the father scanning at the same time the cluster of his stout sons with a displeased and sullen eye put by the piece put by the piece he continued diverting the others aim with the finger of a giant and with the air of one it might be dangerous to deny my job is not yet ended let us finish the little that remains in peace  the man who had manifested so hostile an intention appeared to understand the others allusion and suffered himself to be diverted from his object the sons turned their inquiring looks on the girl who had so eagerly spoken to require an explanation but as if content with the respite she had obtained for the stranger she sunk back in her seat and chose to affect a maidenly silence  in the mean time the hues of the heavens had often changed in place of the brightness which had dazzled the eye a gray and more sober light had succeeded and as the setting lost its brilliancy the proportions of the fanciful form became less exaggerated and finally distinct ashamed to hesitate now that the truth was no longer doubtful the leader of the party resumed his journey using the precaution as he ascended the slight acclivity to release his own rifle from the strap and to cast it into a situation more convenient for sudden use  there was little apparent necessity however for such watchfulness from the moment when it had thus unaccountably appeared as it were between the heavens and the earth the strangers figure had neither moved nor given the smallest evidence of hostility had he harboured any such evil intention the individual who now came plainly into view seemed but little qualified to execute them  a frame that had endured the hardships of more than eighty seasons was not qualified to awaken apprehension in the breast of one as powerful as the emigrant notwithstanding his years and his look of emaciation if not of suffering there was that about this solitary being however which said that time and not disease had laid his hand heavily on him his form had withered but it was not wasted the sinews and muscles which had once denoted great strength though shrunken were still visible and his whole figure had attained an appearance of induration which if it were not for the well known frailty of humanity would have seemed to bid defiance to the further approaches of decay his dress was chiefly of skins worn with the hair to the weather a pouch and horn were suspended from his shoulders and he leaned on a rifle of uncommon length but which like its owner exhibited the wear of long and hard service  as the party drew nigher to this solitary being and came within a distance to be heard a low growl issued from the grass at his feet and then a tall gaunt toothless hound arose lazily from his lair and shaking himself made some show of resisting the nearer approach of the travellers  down hector down said his master in a voice that was a little tremulous and hollow with age what have ye to do pup with men who journey on their lawful callings  stranger if you ar much acquainted in this country said the leader of the emigrants can you tell a traveller where he may find necessaries for the night  is the land filled on the other side of the big river demanded the old man solemnly and without appearing to hearken to the others question or why do i see a sight i had never thought to behold again  why there is country left it is true for such as have money and ar not particular in the choice returned the emigrant but to my taste it is getting crowdy what may a man call the distance from this place to the nighest point on the main river  a hunted deer could not cool his sides in the mississippi without travelling a weary five hundred miles  and what may you name the district hereaway  by what name returned the old man pointing significantly upward would you call the spot where you see yonder cloud  the emigrant looked at the other like one who did not comprehend his meaning and who half suspected he was trifled with but he contented himself by saying  you ar but a new inhabitant like myself i reckon stranger otherwise you would not be backward in helping a traveller to some advice words cost but little and sometimes lead to friendships  advice is not a gift but a debt that the old owe to the young what would you wish to know  where i may camp for the night im no great difficulty maker as to bed and board but all old journeyers like myself know the virtue of sweet water and a good browse for the cattle  come then with me and you shall be master of both and little more is it that i can offer on this hungry prairie  as the old man was speaking he raised his heavy rifle to his shoulder with a facility a little remarkable for his years and appearance and without further words led the way over the acclivity to the adjacent bottom     chapter ii             up with my tent here will i lie tonight            but where tomorrowwell alls one for that                                             richard the third  the travellers soon discovered the usual and unerring evidences that the several articles necessary to their situation were not far distant a clear and gurgling spring burst out of the side of the declivity and joining its waters to those of other similar little fountains in its vicinity their united contributions formed a run which was easily to be traced for miles along the prairie by the scattering foliage and verdure which occasionally grew within the influence of its moisture hither then the stranger held his way eagerly followed by the willing teams whose instinct gave them a prescience of refreshment and rest  on reaching what he deemed a suitable spot the old man halted and with an enquiring look he seemed to demand if it possessed the needed conveniences the leader of the emigrants cast his eyes understandingly about him and examined the place with the keenness of one competent to judge of so nice a question though in that dilatory and heavy manner which rarely permitted him to betray precipitation  ay this may do he said satisfied with his scrutiny boys you have seen the last of the sun be stirring  the young men manifested a characteristic obedience the order for such in tone and manner it was in truth was received with respect but the utmost movement was the falling of an axe or two from the shoulder to the ground while their owners continued to regard the place with listless and incurious eyes in the mean time the elder traveller as if familiar with the nature of the impulses by which his children were governed disencumbered himself of his pack and rifle and assisted by the man already mentioned as disposed to appeal so promptly to the rifle he quietly proceeded to release the cattle from the gears  at length the eldest of the sons stepped heavily forward and without any apparent effort he buried his axe to the eye in the soft body of a cottonwood tree he stood a moment regarding the effect of the blow with that sort of contempt with which a giant might be supposed to contemplate the puny resistance of a dwarf and then flourishing the implement above his head with the grace and dexterity with which a master of the art of offence would wield his nobler though less useful weapon he quickly severed the trunk of the tree bringing its tall top crashing to the earth in submission to his prowess his companions regarded the operation with indolent curiosity until they saw the prostrate trunk stretched on the ground when as if a signal for a general attack had been given they advanced in a body to the work and in a space of time and with a neatness of execution that would have astonished an ignorant spectator they stripped a small but suitable spot of its burden of forest as effectually and almost as promptly as if a whirlwind had passed along the place  the stranger had been a silent but attentive observer of their progress as tree after tree came whistling down he cast his eyes upward at the vacancies they left in the heavens with a melancholy gaze and finally turned away muttering to himself with a bitter smile like one who disdained giving a more audible utterance to his discontent pressing through the group of active and busy children who had already lighted a cheerful fire the attention of the old man became next fixed on the movements of the leader of the emigrants and of his savage looking assistant  these two had already liberated the cattle which were eagerly browsing the grateful and nutritious extremities of the fallen trees and were now employed about the wagon which has been described as having its contents concealed with so much apparent care notwithstanding this particular conveyance appeared to be as silent and as tenantless as the rest of the vehicles the men applied their strength to its wheels and rolled it apart from the others to a dry and elevated spot near the edge of the thicket here they brought certain poles which had seemingly been long employed in such a service and fastening their larger ends firmly in the ground the smaller were attached to the hoops that supported the covering of the wagon large folds of cloth were next drawn out of the vehicle and after being spread around the whole were pegged to the earth in such a manner as to form a tolerably capacious and an exceedingly convenient tent after surveying their work with inquisitive and perhaps jealous eyes arranging a fold here and driving a peg more firmly there the men once more applied their strength to the wagon pulling it by its projecting tongue from the centre of the canopy until it appeared in the open air deprived of its covering and destitute of any other freight than a few light articles of furniture the latter were immediately removed by the traveller into the tent with his own hands as though to enter it were a privilege to which even his bosom companion was not entitled  curiosity is a passion that is rather quickened than destroyed by seclusion and the old inhabitant of the prairies did not view these precautionary and mysterious movements without experiencing some of its impulses he approached the tent and was about to sever two of its folds with the very obvious intention of examining more closely into the nature of its contents when the man who had once already placed his life in jeopardy seized him by the arm and with a rude exercise of his strength threw him from the spot he had selected as the one most convenient for his object  its an honest regulation friend the fellow drily observed though with an eye that threatened volumes and sometimes it is a safe one which says mind your own business  men seldom bring any thing to be concealed into these deserts returned the old man as if willing and yet a little ignorant how to apologize for the liberty he had been about to take and i had hoped no offence in examining your comforts  they seldom bring themselves i reckon though this has the look of an old country to my eye it seems not to be overly peopled  the land is as aged as the rest of the works of the lord i believe but you say true concerning its inhabitants many months have passed since i have laid eyes on a face of my own colour before your own i say again friend i meant no harm i did not know but there was something behind the cloth that might bring former days to my mind  as the stranger ended his simple explanation he walked meekly away like one who felt the deepest sense of the right which every man has to the quiet enjoyment of his own without any troublesome interference on the part of his neighbour a wholesome and just principle that he had also most probably imbibed from the habits of his secluded life as he passed towards the little encampment of the emigrants for such the place had now become he heard the voice of the leader calling aloud in its hoarse tones the name of  ellen wade  the girl who has been already introduced to the reader and who was occupied with the others of her sex around the fires sprang willingly forward at this summons and passing the stranger with the activity of a young antelope she was instantly lost behind the forbidden folds of the tent neither her sudden disappearance nor any of the arrangements we have mentioned seemed however to excite the smallest surprise among the remainder of the party the young men who had already completed their tasks with the axe were all engaged after their lounging and listless manner some in bestowing equitable portions of the fodder among the different animals others in plying the heavy pestle of a moveable homminymortar and one or two in wheeling the remainder of the wagons aside and arranging them in such a manner as to form a sort of outwork for their otherwise defenceless bivouac       homminy is a dish composed chiefly of cracked corn or maize  these several duties were soon performed and as darkness now began to conceal the objects on the surrounding prairie the shrilltoned termagant whose voice since the halt had been diligently exercised among her idle and drowsy offspring announced in tones that might have been heard at a dangerous distance that the evening meal waited only for the approach of those who were to consume it whatever may be the other qualities of a border man he is seldom deficient in the virtue of hospitality the emigrant no sooner heard the sharp call of his wife than he cast his eyes about him in quest of the stranger in order to offer him the place of distinction in the rude entertainment to which they were so unceremoniously summoned  i thank you friend the old man replied to the rough invitation to take a seat nigh the smoking kettle you have my hearty thanks but i have eaten for the day and am not one of them who dig their graves with their teeth well as you wish it i will take a place for it is long sin i have seen people of my colour eating their daily bread  you ar an old settler in these districts then the emigrant rather remarked than enquired with a mouth filled nearly to overflowing with the delicious homminy prepared by his skilful though repulsive spouse they told us below we should find settlers something thinnish hereaway and i must say the report was mainly true for unless we count the canada traders on the big river you ar the first white face i have met in a good five hundred miles that is calculating according to your own reckoning  though i have spent some years in this quarter i can hardly be called a settler seeing that i have no regular abode and seldom pass more than a month at a time on the same range  a hunter i reckon the other continued glancing his eyes aside as if to examine the equipments of his new acquaintance your fixen seem none of the best for such a calling  they are old and nearly ready to be laid aside like their master said the old man regarding his rifle with a look in which affection and regret were singularly blended and i may say they are but little needed too you are mistaken friend in calling me a hunter i am nothing better than a trapper       it is scarcely necessary to say that this american word means one     who takes his game in a trap it is of general use on the     frontiers the beaver an animal too sagacious to be easily     killed is oftener taken in this way than in any other  if you ar much of the one im bold to say you ar something of the other for the two callings go mainly together in these districts  to the shame of the man who is able to follow the first be it so said returned the trapper whom in future we shall choose to designate by his pursuit for more than fifty years did i carry my rifle in the wilderness without so much as setting a snare for even a bird that flies the heavensmuch less a beast that has nothing but legs for its gifts  i see but little difference whether a man gets his peltry by the rifle or by the trap said the illlooking companion of the emigrant in his rough manner the arth was made for our comfort and for that matter so ar its creaturs  you seem to have but little plunder stranger for one who is far abroad bluntly interrupted the emigrant as if he had a reason for wishing to change the conversation i hope you ar better off for skins       the cant word for luggage in the western states of america is     plunder the term might easily mislead one as to the character     of the people who notwithstanding their pleasant use of so     expressive a word are like the inhabitants of all new     settlements hospitable and honest knavery of the description     conveyed by plunder is chiefly found in regions more civilised  i make but little use of either the trapper quietly replied at my time of life food and clothing be all that is needed and i have little occasion for what you call plunder unless it may be now and then to barter for a horn of powder or a bar of lead  you ar not then of these parts by natur friend the emigrant continued having in his mind the exception which the other had taken to the very equivocal word which he himself according to the custom of the country had used for baggage or effects  i was born on the seashore though most of my life has been passed in the woods  the whole party now looked up at him as men are apt to turn their eyes on some unexpected object of general interest one or two of the young men repeated the words seashore and the woman tendered him one of those civilities with which uncouth as they were she was little accustomed to grace her hospitality as if in deference to the travelled dignity of her guest after a long and seemingly a meditating silence the emigrant who had however seen no apparent necessity to suspend the functions of his masticating powers resumed the discourse  it is a long road as i have heard from the waters of the west to the shores of the main sea  it is a weary path indeed friend and much have i seen and something have i suffered in journeying over it  a man would see a good deal of hard travel in going its length  seventy and five years have i been upon the road and there are not half that number of leagues in the whole distance after you leave the hudson on which i have not tasted venison of my own killing but this is vain boasting of what use are former deeds when time draws to an end  i once met a man that had boated on the river he names observed the eldest son speaking in a low tone of voice like one who distrusted his knowledge and deemed it prudent to assume a becoming diffidence in the presence of a man who had seen so much from his tell it must be a considerable stream and deep enough for a keelboat from top to bottom  it is a wide and deep watercourse and many sightly towns are there growing on its banks returned the trapper and yet it is but a brook to the waters of the endless river  i call nothing a stream that a man can travel round exclaimed the illlooking associate of the emigrant a real river must be crossed not headed like a bear in a county hunt       there is a practice in the new countries to assemble the men of     a large district sometimes of an entire county to exterminate     the beasts of prey they form themselves into a circle of several     miles in extent and gradually draw nearer killing all before     them the allusion is to this custom in which the hunted beast is     turned from one to another  have you been far towards the sundown friend interrupted the emigrant as if he desired to keep his rough companion as much as possible out of the discourse i find it is a wide tract of clearing this into which i have fallen  you may travel weeks and you will see it the same i often think the lord has placed this barren belt of prairie behind the states to warn men to what their folly may yet bring the land ay weeks if not months may you journey in these open fields in which there is neither dwelling nor habitation for man or beast even the savage animals travel miles on miles to seek their dens and yet the wind seldom blows from the east but i conceit the sound of axes and the crash of falling trees are in my ears  as the old man spoke with the seriousness and dignity that age seldom fails to communicate even to less striking sentiments his auditors were deeply attentive and as silent as the grave indeed the trapper was left to renew the dialogue himself which he soon did by asking a question in the indirect manner so much in use by the border inhabitants  you found it no easy matter to ford the watercourses and to make your way so deep into the prairies friend with teams of horses and herds of horned beasts  i kept the left bank of the main river the emigrant replied until i found the stream leading too much to the north when we rafted ourselves across without any great suffering the women lost a fleece or two from the next years shearing and the girls have one cow less to their dairy since then we have done bravely by bridging a creek every day or two  it is likely you will continue west until you come to land more suitable for a settlement  until i see reason to stop or to turn agin the emigrant bluntly answered rising at the same time and cutting short the dialogue by the suddenness of the movement his example was followed by the trapper as well as the rest of the party and then without much deference to the presence of their guest the travellers proceeded to make their dispositions to pass the night several little bowers or rather huts had already been formed of the tops of trees blankets of coarse country manufacture and the skins of buffaloes united without much reference to any other object than temporary comfort into these covers the children with their mother soon drew themselves and where it is more than possible they were all speedily lost in the oblivion of sleep before the men however could seek their rest they had sundry little duties to perform such as completing their works of defence carefully concealing the fires replenishing the fodder of their cattle and setting the watch that was to protect the party in the approaching hours of night  the former was effected by dragging the trunks of a few trees into the intervals left by the wagons and along the open space between the vehicles and the thicket on which in military language the encampment would be said to have rested thus forming a sort of chevauxdefrise on three sides of the position within these narrow limits with the exception of what the tent contained both man and beast were now collected the latter being far too happy in resting their weary limbs to give any undue annoyance to their scarcely more intelligent associates two of the young men took their rifles and first renewing the priming and examining the flints with the utmost care they proceeded the one to the extreme right and the other to the left of the encampment where they posted themselves within the shadows of the thicket but in such positions as enabled each to overlook a portion of the prairie  the trapper loitered about the place declining to share the straw of the emigrant until the whole arrangement was completed and then without the ceremony of an adieu he slowly retired from the spot  it was now in the first watch of the night and the pale quivering and deceptive light from a new moon was playing over the endless waves of the prairie tipping the swells with gleams of brightness and leaving the interval land in deep shadow accustomed to scenes of solitude like the present the old man as he left the encampment proceeded alone into the waste like a bold vessel leaving its haven to enter on the trackless field of the ocean he appeared to move for some time without object or indeed without any apparent consciousness whither his limbs were carrying him at length on reaching the rise of one of the undulations he came to a stand and for the first time since leaving the band who had caused such a flood of reflections and recollections to crowd upon his mind the old man became aware of his present situation throwing one end of his rifle to the earth he stood leaning on the other again lost in deep contemplation for several minutes during which time his hound came and crouched at his feet a deep menacing growl from the faithful animal first aroused him from his musing  what now dog he said looking down at his companion as if he addressed a being of an intelligence equal to his own and speaking in a voice of great affection what is it pup ha hector what is it nosing now it wont do dog it wont do the very fans play in open view of us without minding so worn out curs as you and i instinct is their gift hector and they have found out how little we are to be feared they have  the dog stretched his head upward and responded to the words of his master by a long and plaintive whine which he even continued after he had again buried his head in the grass as if he held an intelligent communication with one who so well knew how to interpret dumb discourse  this is a manifest warning hector the trapper continued dropping his voice to the tones of caution and looking warily about him what is it pup speak plainer dog what is it  the hound had however already laid his nose to the earth and was silent appearing to slumber but the keen quick glances of his master soon caught a glimpse of a distant figure which seemed through the deceptive light floating along the very elevation on which he had placed himself presently its proportions became more distinct and then an airy female form appeared to hesitate as if considering whether it would be prudent to advance though the eyes of the dog were now to be seen glancing in the rays of the moon opening and shutting lazily he gave no further signs of displeasure  come nigher we are friends said the trapper associating himself with his companion by long use and probably through the strength of the secret tie that connected them together we are your friends none will harm you  encouraged by the mild tones of his voice and perhaps led on by the earnestness of her purpose the female approached until she stood at his side when the old man perceived his visitor to be the young woman with whom the reader has already become acquainted by the name of ellen wade  i had thought you were gone she said looking timidly and anxiously around they said you were gone and that we should never see you again i did not think it was you  men are no common objects in these empty fields returned the trapper and i humbly hope though i have so long consorted with the beasts of the wilderness that i have not yet lost the look of my kind  oh i knew you to be a man and i thought i knew the whine of the hound too she answered hastily as if willing to explain she knew not what and then checking herself like one fearful of having already said too much  i saw no dogs among the teams of your father the trapper remarked  father exclaimed the girl feelingly i have no father i had nearly said no friend  the old man turned towards her with a look of kindness and interest that was even more conciliating than the ordinary upright and benevolent expression of his weatherbeaten countenance  why then do you venture in a place where none but the strong should come he demanded did you not know that when you crossed the big river you left a friend behind you that is always bound to look to the young and feeble like yourself  of whom do you speak  the lawtis bad to have it but i sometimes think it is worse to be entirely without it age and weakness have brought me to feel such weakness at times yesyes the law is needed when such as have not the gifts of strength and wisdom are to be taken care of i hope young woman if you have no father you have at least a brother  the maiden felt the tacit reproach conveyed in this covert question and for a moment she remained in an embarrassed silence but catching a glimpse of the mild and serious features of her companion as he continued to gaze on her with a look of interest she replied firmly and in a manner that left no doubt she comprehended his meaning  heaven forbid that any such as you have seen should be a brother of mine or any thing else near or dear to me but tell me do you then actually live alone in this desert district old man is there really none here besides yourself  there are hundreds nay thousands of the rightful owners of the country roving about the plains but few of our own colour  and have you then met none who are white but us interrupted the girl like one too impatient to await the tardy explanations of age and deliberation  not in many dayshush hector hush he added in reply to a low and nearly inaudible growl from his hound the dog scents mischief in the wind the black bears from the mountains sometimes make their way even lower than this the pup is not apt to complain of the harmless game i am not so ready and true with the piece as i usedtocouldbe yet i have struck even the fiercest animals of the prairie in my time so you have little reason for fear young woman  the girl raised her eyes in that peculiar manner which is so often practised by her sex when they commence their glances by examining the earth at their feet and terminate them by noting every thing within the power of human vision but she rather manifested the quality of impatience than any feeling of alarm  a short bark from the dog however soon gave a new direction to the looks of both and then the real object of his second warning became dimly visible     chapter iii     come come thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in italy    and as soon movd to be moody and as soon moody to be moved                                              romeo and juliet  though the trapper manifested some surprise when he perceived that another human figure was approaching him and that too from a direction opposite to the place where the emigrant had made his encampment it was with the steadiness of one long accustomed to scenes of danger  this is a man he said and one who has white blood in his veins or his step would be lighter it will be well to be ready for the worst as the halfandhalfs that one meets in these distant districts are altogether more barbarous than the real savage       halfbreeds men born of indian women by white fathers this race     has much of the depravity of civilisation without the virtues of     the savage  he raised his rifle while he spoke and assured himself of the state of its flint as well as of the priming by manual examination but his arm was arrested while in the act of throwing forward the muzzle of the piece by the eager and trembling hands of his companion  for gods sake be not too hasty she said it may be a friendan acquaintancea neighbour  a friend the old man repeated deliberately releasing himself at the same time from her grasp friends are rare in any land and less in this perhaps than in another and the neighbourhood is too thinly settled to make it likely that he who comes towards us is even an acquaintance  but though a stranger you would not seek his blood  the trapper earnestly regarded her anxious and frightened features and then he dropped the butt of his rifle on the ground like one whose purpose had undergone a sudden change  no he said speaking rather to himself than to his companion she is right blood is not to be spilt to save the life of one so useless and so near his time let him come on my skins my traps and even my rifle shall be his if he sees fit to demand them  he will ask for neitherhe wants neither returned the girl if he be an honest man he will surely be content with his own and ask for nothing that is the property of another  the trapper had not time to express the surprise he felt at this incoherent and contradictory language for the man who was advancing was already within fifty feet of the place where they stoodin the mean time hector had not been an indifferent witness of what was passing at the sound of the distant footsteps he had arisen from his warm bed at the feet of his master and now as the stranger appeared in open view he stalked slowly towards him crouching to the earth like a panther about to take his leap  call in your dog said a firm deep manly voice in tones of friendship rather than of menace i love a hound and should be sorry to do an injury to the animal  you hear what is said about you pup the trapper answered come hither fool his growl and his bark are all that is left him now you may come on friend the hound is toothless  the stranger profited by the intelligence he sprang eagerly forward and at the next instant stood at the side of ellen wade after assuring himself of the identity of the latter by a hasty but keen glance he turned his attention with a quickness and impatience that proved the interest he took in the result to a similar examination of her companion  from what cloud have you fallen my good old man he said in a careless offhand heedless manner that seemed too natural to be assumed or do you actually live hereaway in the prairies  i have been long on earth and never i hope nigher to heaven than i am at this moment returned the trapper my dwelling if dwelling i may be said to have is not far distant now may i take the liberty with you that you are so willing to take with others whence do you come and where is your home  softly softly when i have done with my catechism it will be time to begin with yours what sport is this you follow by moonlight you are not dodging the buffaloes at such an hour  i am as you see going from an encampment of travellers which lies over yonder swell in the land to my own wigwam in doing so i wrong no man  all fair and true and you got this young woman to show you the way because she knows it so well and you know so little about it yourself  i met her as i have met you by accident for ten tiresome years have i dwelt on these open fields and never before tonight have i found human beings with white skins on them at this hour if my presence here gives offence i am sorry and will go my way it is more than likely that when your young friend has told her story you will be better given to believe mine  friend said the youth lifting a cap of skins from his head and running his fingers leisurely through a dense mass of black and shaggy locks if i have ever laid eyes on the girl before tonight may i  youve said enough paul interrupted the female laying her hand on his mouth with a familiarity that gave something very like the lie direct to his intended asseveration our secret will be safe with this honest old man i know it by his looks and kind words  our secret ellen have you forgot  nothing i have not forgotten any thing i should remember but still i say we are safe with this honest trapper  trapper is he then a trapper give me your hand father our trades should bring us acquainted  there is little call for handicrafts in this region returned the other examining the athletic and active form of the youth as he leaned carelessly and not ungracefully on his rifle the art of taking the creaturs of god in traps and nets is one that needs more cunning than manhood and yet am i brought to practise it in my age but it would be quite as seemly in one like you to follow a pursuit better becoming your years and courage  i i never took even a slinking mink or a paddling muskrat in a cage though i admit having peppered a few of the darkskind devils when i had much better have kept my powder in the horn and the lead in its pouch not i old man nothing that crawls the earth is for my sport  what then may you do for a living friend for little profit is to be made in these districts if a man denies himself his lawful right in the beasts of the fields  i deny myself nothing if a bear crosses my path he is soon the mere ghost of bruin the deer begin to nose me and as for the buffaloe i have killd more beef old stranger than the largest butcher in all kentuck  you can shoot then demanded the trapper with a glow of latent fire glimmering about his eyes is your hand true and your look quick  the first is like a steel trap and the last nimbler than a buckshot i wish it was hot noon now grandther and that there was an acre or two of your white swans or of black feathered ducks going south over our heads you or ellen here might set your heart on the finest in the flock and my character against a horn of powder that the bird would be hanging head downwards in five minutes and that too with a single ball i scorn a shotgun no man can say he ever knew me carry one a rod  the lad has good in him i see it plainly by his manner said the trapper turning to ellen with an encouraging air i will take it on myself to say that you are not unwise in meeting him as you do tell me lad did you ever strike a leaping buck atwixt the antlers hector quiet pup quiet the very name of venison quickens the blood of the curdid you ever take an animal in that fashion on the long leap  you might just as well ask me did you ever eat there is no fashion old stranger that a deer has not been touched by my hand unless it was when asleep  ay ay you have a long and a happyay and an honest life afore you i am old and i suppose i might also say worn out and useless but if it was given me to choose my time and place againas such things are not and ought not ever to be given to the will of manthough if such a gift was to be given me i would say twenty and the wilderness but tell me how do you part with the peltry  with my pelts i never took a skin from a buck nor a quill from a goose in my life i knock them over now and then for a meal and sometimes to keep my finger true to the touch but when hunger is satisfied the prairie wolves get the remainder nonoi keep to my calling which pays me better than all the fur i could sell on the other side of the big river  the old man appeared to ponder a little but shaking his head he soon continued  i know of but one business that can be followed here with profit  he was interrupted by the youth who raised a small cup of tin which dangled at his neck before the others eyes and springing its lid the delicious odour of the finest flavoured honey diffused itself over the organs of the trapper  a bee hunter observed the latter with a readiness that proved he understood the nature of the occupation though not without some little surprise at discovering one of the others spirited mien engaged in so humble a pursuit it pays well in the skirts of the settlements but i should call it a doubtful trade in the more open districts  you think a tree is wanting for a swarm to settle in but i know differently and so i have stretched out a few hundred miles farther west than common to taste your honey and now i have bated your curiosity stranger you will just move aside while i tell the remainder of my story to this young woman  it is not necessary im sure it is not necessary that he should leave us said ellen with a haste that implied some little consciousness of the singularity if not of the impropriety of the request you can have nothing to say that the whole world might not hear  no well may i be stung to death by drones if i understand the buzzings of a womans mind for my part ellen i care for nothing nor any body and am just as ready to go down to the place where your uncle if uncle you can call one who ill swear is no relation has hoppled his teams and tell the old man my mind now as i shall be a year hence you have only to say a single word and the thing is done let him like it or not  you are ever so hasty and so rash paul hover that i seldom know when i am safe with you how can you who know the danger of our being seen together speak of going before my uncle and his sons  has he done that of which he has reason to be ashamed demanded the trapper who had not moved an inch from the place he first occupied  heaven forbid but there are reasons why he should not be seen just now that could do him no harm if known but which may not yet be told and so if you will wait father near yonder willow bush until i have heard what paul can possibly have to say i shall be sure to come and wish you a good night before i return to the camp  the trapper drew slowly aside as if satisfied with the somewhat incoherent reason ellen had given why he should retire when completely out of ear shot of the earnest and hurried dialogue that instantly commenced between the two he had left the old man again paused and patiently awaited the moment when he might renew his conversation with beings in whom he felt a growing interest no less from the mysterious character of their intercourse than from a natural sympathy in the welfare of a pair so young and who as in the simplicity of his heart he was also fain to believe were also so deserving he was accompanied by his indolent but attached dog who once more made his bed at the feet of his master and soon lay slumbering as usual with his head nearly buried in the dense fog of the prairie grass  it was a spectacle so unusual to see the human form amid the solitude in which he dwelt that the trapper bent his eyes on the dim figures of his new acquaintances with sensations to which he had long been a stranger their presence awakened recollections and emotions to which his sturdy but honest nature had latterly paid but little homage and his thoughts began to wander over the varied scenes of a life of hardships that had been strangely blended with scenes of wild and peculiar enjoyment the train taken by his thoughts had already conducted him in imagination far into an ideal world when he was once more suddenly recalled to the reality of his situation by the movements of the faithful hound  the dog who in submission to his years and infirmities had manifested such a decided propensity to sleep now arose and stalked from out the shadow cast by the tall person of his master and looked abroad into the prairie as if his instinct apprised him of the presence of still another visitor then seemingly content with his examination he returned to his comfortable post and disposed of his weary limbs with the deliberation and care of one who was no novice in the art of selfpreservation  what again hector said the trapper in a soothing voice which he had the caution however to utter in an under tone what is it dog tell it all to his master pup what is it  hector answered with another growl but was content to continue in his lair these were evidences of intelligence and distrust to which one as practised as the trapper could not turn an inattentive ear he again spoke to the dog encouraging him to watchfulness by a low guarded whistle the animal however as if conscious of having already discharged his duty obstinately refused to raise his head from the grass  a hint from such a friend is far better than mans advice muttered the trapper as he slowly moved towards the couple who were yet too earnestly and abstractedly engaged in their own discourse to notice his approach and none but a conceited settler would hear it and not respect it as he ought children he added when nigh enough to address his companions we are not alone in these dreary fields there are others stirring and therefore to the shame of our kind be it said danger is nigh  if one of the lazy sons of skirting ishmael is prowling out of his camp tonight said the young beehunter with great vivacity and in tones that might easily have been excited to a menace he may have an end put to his journey sooner than either he or his father is dreaming  my life on it they are all with the teams hurriedly answered the girl i saw the whole of them asleep myself except the two on watch and their natures have greatly changed if they too are not both dreaming of a turkey hunt or a courthouse fight at this very moment  some beast with a strong scent has passed between the wind and the hound father and it makes him uneasy or perhaps he too is dreaming i had a pup of my own in kentuck that would start upon a long chase from a deep sleep and all upon the fancy of some dream go to him and pinch his ear that the beast may feel the life within him  not sonot so returned the trapper shaking his head as one who better understood the qualities of his dogyouth sleeps ay and dreams too but age is awake and watchful the pup is never false with his nose and long experience tells me to heed his warnings  did you ever run him upon the trail of carrion  why i must say that the ravenous beasts have sometimes tempted me to let him loose for they are as greedy as men after the venison in its season but then i knew the reason of the dog would tell him the objectnono hector is an animal known in the ways of man and will never strike a false trail when a true one is to be followed  ay ay the secret is out you have run the hound on the track of a wolf and his nose has a better memory than his master said the beehunter laughing  i have seen the creatur sleep for hours with pack after pack in open view a wolf might eat out of his tray without a snarl unless there was a scarcity then indeed hector would be apt to claim his own  there are panthers down from the mountains i saw one make a leap at a sick deer as the sun was setting go go you back to the dog and tell him the truth father in a minute i  he was interrupted by a long loud and piteous howl from the hound which rose on the air of the evening like the wailing of some spirit of the place and passed off into the prairie in cadences that rose and fell like its own undulating surface the trapper was impressively silent listening intently even the reckless beehunter was struck with the wailing wildness of the sounds after a short pause the former whistled the dog to his side and turning to his companions he said with the seriousness which in his opinion the occasion demanded  they who think man enjoys all the knowledge of the creaturs of god will live to be disappointed if they reach as i have done the age of fourscore years i will not take upon myself to say what mischief is brewing nor will i vouch that even the hound himself knows so much but that evil is nigh and that wisdom invites us to avoid it i have heard from the mouth of one who never lies i did think the pup had become unused to the footsteps of man and that your presence made him uneasy but his nose has been on a long scent the whole evening and what i mistook as a notice of your coming has been intended for something more serious if the advice of an old man is then worth hearkening to children you will quickly go different ways to your places of shelter and safety  if i quit ellen at such a moment exclaimed the youth may i  youve said enough the girl interrupted by again interposing a band that might both by its delicacy and colour have graced a far more elevated station in life my time is out and we must part at all eventsso good night paulfathergood night  hist said the youth seizing her arm as she was in the very act of tripping from his sidehist do you hear nothing there are buffaloes playing their pranks at no great distancethat sound beats the earth like a herd of the mad scampering devils  his two companions listened as people in their situation would be apt to lend their faculties to discover the meaning of any doubtful noises especially when heard after so many and such startling warnings the unusual sounds were unequivocally though still faintly audible the youth and his female companion had made several hurried and vacillating conjectures concerning their nature when a current of the night air brought the rush of trampling footsteps too sensibly to their ears to render mistake any longer possible  i am right said the beehunter a panther is driving a herd before him or may be there is a battle among the beasts  your ears are cheats returned the old man who from the moment his own organs had been able to catch the distant sounds stood like a statue made to represent deep attentionthe leaps are too long for the buffaloe and too regular for terror hist now they are in a bottom where the grass is high and the sound is deadened ay there they go on the hard earth and now they come up the swell dead upon us they will be here afore you can find a cover  come ellen cried the youth seizing his companion by the hand let us make a trial for the encampment  too late too late exclaimed the trapper for the creaturs are in open view and a bloody band of accursed siouxes they are by their thieving look and the random fashion in which they ride  siouxes or devils they shall find us men said the beehunter with a mien as fierce as if he led a party of superior strength and of a courage equal to his ownyou have a piece old man and will pull a trigger in behalf of a helpless christian girl  down down into the grassdown with ye both whispered the trapper intimating to them to turn aside to the tall weeds which grew in a denser body than common near the place where they stood youve not the time to fly nor the numbers to fight foolish boy down into the grass if you prize the young woman or value the gift of life  his remonstrance seconded as it was by a prompt and energetic action did not fail to produce the submission to his order which the occasion seemed indeed imperiously to require the moon had fallen behind a sheet of thin fleecy clouds which skirted the horizon leaving just enough of its faint and fluctuating light to render objects visible dimly revealing their forms and proportions the trapper by exercising that species of influence over his companions which experience and decision usually assert in cases of emergency had effectually succeeded in concealing them in the grass and by the aid of the feeble rays of the luminary he was enabled to scan the disorderly party which was riding like so many madmen directly upon them  a band of beings who resembled demons rather than men sporting in their nightly revels across the bleak plain was in truth approaching at a fearful rate and in a direction to leave little hope that some one among them at least would not pass over the spot where the trapper and his companions lay at intervals the clattering of hoofs was borne along by the night wind quite audibly in their front and then again their progress through the fog of the autumnal grass was swift and silent adding to the unearthly appearance of the spectacle the trapper who had called in his hound and bidden him crouch at his side now kneeled in the cover also and kept a keen and watchful eye on the route of the band soothing the fears of the girl and restraining the impatience of the youth in the same breath  if theres one theres thirty of the miscreants he said in a sort of episode to his whispered comments ay ay they are edging towards the riverpeace puppeaceno here they come this way againthe thieves dont seem to know their own errand if there were just six of us lad what a beautiful ambushment we might make upon them from this very spotit wont do it wont do boy keep yourself closer or your head will be seenbesides im not altogether strong in the opinion it would be lawful as they have done us no harmthere they bend again to the riverno here they come up the swellnow is the moment to be as still as if the breath had done its duty and departed the body  the old man sunk into the grass while he was speaking as if the final separation to which he alluded had in his own case actually occurred and at the next instant a band of wild horsemen whirled by them with the noiseless rapidity in which it might be imagined a troop of spectres would pass the dark and fleeting forms were already vanished when the trapper ventured again to raise his head to a level with the tops of the bending herbage motioning at the same time to his companions to maintain their positions and their silence  they are going down the swell towards the encampment he continued in his former guarded tones no they halt in the bottom and are clustering together like deer in council by the lord they are turning again and we are not yet done with the reptiles  once more he sought his friendly cover and at the next instant the dark troop were to be seen riding in a disorderly manner on the very summit of the little elevation on which the trapper and his companions lay it was now soon apparent that they had returned to avail themselves of the height of the ground in order to examine the dim horizon  some dismounted while others rode to and fro like men engaged in a local enquiry of much interest happily for the hidden party the grass in which they were concealed not only served to skreen them from the eyes of the savages but opposed an obstacle to prevent their horses which were no less rude and untrained than their riders from trampling on them in their irregular and wild paces  at length an athletic and dark looking indian who by his air of authority would seem to be the leader summoned his chiefs about him to a consultation which was held mounted this body was collected on the very margin of that mass of herbage in which the trapper and his companions were hid as the young man looked up and saw the fierce aspect of the group which was increasing at each instant by the accession of some countenance and figure apparently more forbidding than any which had preceded it he drew his rifle by a very natural impulse from beneath him and commenced putting it in a state for service the female at his side buried her face in the grass by a feeling that was possibly quite as natural to her sex and habits leaving him to follow the impulses of his hot blood but his aged and more prudent adviser whispered sternly in his ear  the tick of the lock is as well known to the knaves as the blast of a trumpet to a soldier lay down the piecelay down the pieceshould the moon touch the barrel it could not fail to be seen by the devils whose eyes are keener than the blackest snakes the smallest motion now would be sure to bring an arrow among us  the beehunter so far obeyed as to continue immovable and silent but there was still sufficient light to convince his companion by the contracted brow and threatening eye of the young man that a discovery would not bestow a bloodless victory on the savages finding his advice disregarded the trapper took his measures accordingly and awaited the result with a resignation and calmness that were characteristic of the individual  in the mean time the siouxes for the sagacity of the old man was not deceived in the character of his dangerous neighbours had terminated their council and were again dispersed along the ridge of land as if they sought some hidden object  the imps have heard the hound whispered the trapper and their ears are too true to be cheated in the distance keep close lad keep close down with your head to the very earth like a dog that sleeps  let us rather take to our feet and trust to manhood returned his impatient companion  he would have proceeded but feeling a hand laid rudely on his shoulder he turned his eyes upward and beheld the dark and savage countenance of an indian gleaming full upon him notwithstanding the surprise and the disadvantage of his attitude the youth was not disposed to become a captive so easily quicker than the flash of his own gun he sprang upon his feet and was throttling his opponent with a power that would soon have terminated the contest when he felt the arms of the trapper thrown round his body confining his exertions by a strength very little inferior to his own before he had time to reproach his comrade for this apparent treachery a dozen siouxes were around them and the whole party were compelled to yield themselves as prisoners     chapter iv             with much more dismay            i view the fight than those that make the fray                                            merchant of venice  the unfortunate beehunter and his companions had become the captives of a people who might without exaggeration be called the ishmaelites of the american deserts from time immemorial the hands of the siouxes had been turned against their neighbours of the prairies and even at this day when the influence and authority of a civilised government are beginning to be felt around them they are considered a treacherous and dangerous race at the period of our tale the case was far worse few white men trusting themselves in the remote and unprotected regions where so false a tribe was known to dwell  notwithstanding the peaceable submission of the trapper he was quite aware of the character of the band into whose hands he had fallen it would have been difficult however for the nicest judge to have determined whether fear policy or resignation formed the secret motive of the old man in permitting himself to be plundered as he did without a murmur so far from opposing any remonstrance to the rude and violent manner in which his conquerors performed the customary office he even anticipated their cupidity by tendering to the chiefs such articles as he thought might prove the most acceptable on the other hand paul hover who had been literally a conquered man manifested the strongest repugnance to submit to the violent liberties that were taken with his person and property he even gave several exceedingly unequivocal demonstrations of his displeasure during the summary process and would more than once have broken out in open and desperate resistance but for the admonitions and entreaties of the trembling girl who clung to his side in a manner so dependent as to show the youth that her hopes were now placed no less on his discretion than on his disposition to serve her  the indians had however no sooner deprived the captives of their arms and ammunition and stripped them of a few articles of dress of little use and perhaps of less value than they appeared disposed to grant them a respite business of greater moment pressed on their hands and required their attention another consultation of the chiefs was convened and it was apparent by the earnest and vehement manner of the few who spoke that the warriors conceived their success as yet to be far from complete  it will be well whispered the trapper who knew enough of the language he heard to comprehend perfectly the subject of the discussion if the travellers who lie near the willow brake are not awoke out of their sleep by a visit from these miscreants they are too cunning to believe that a woman of the palefaces is to be found so far from the settlements without having a white mans inventions and comforts at hand  if they will carry the tribe of wandering ishmael to the rocky mountains said the young beehunter laughing in his vexation with a sort of bitter merriment i may forgive the rascals  paul paul exclaimed his companion in a tone of reproach you forget all think of the dreadful consequences  ay it was thinking of what you call consequences ellen that prevented me from putting the matter at once to yonder reddevil and making it a real knockdown and dragout old trapper the sin of this cowardly business lies on your shoulders but it is no more than your daily calling i reckon to take men as well as beasts in snares  i implore you paul to be calmto be patient  well since it is your wish ellen returned the youth endeavouring to swallow his spleen i will make the trial though as you ought to know it is part of the religion of a kentuckian to fret himself a little at a mischance  i fear your friends in the other bottom will not escape the eyes of the imps continued the trapper as coolly as though he had not heard a syllable of the intervening discourse they scent plunder and it would be as hard to drive a hound from his game as to throw the varmints from its trail  is there nothing to be done asked ellen in an imploring manner which proved the sincerity of her concern  it would be an easy matter to call out in so loud a voice as to make old ishmael dream that the wolves were among his flock paul replied i can make myself heard a mile in these open fields and his camp is but a short quarter from us  and get knocked on the head for your pains returned the trapper no no cunning must match cunning or the hounds will murder the whole family  murder nono murder ishmael loves travel so well there would be no harm in his having a look at the other sea but the old fellow is in a bad condition to take the long journey i would try a lock myself before he should be quite murdered  his party is strong in number and well armed do you think it will fight  look here old trapper few men love ishmael bush and his seven sledgehammer sons less than one paul hover but i scorn to slander even a tennessee shotgun there is as much of the true standup courage among them as there is in any family that was ever raised in kentuck itself they are a longsided and a doublejointed breed and let me tell you that he who takes the measure of one of them on the ground must be a workman at a hug  hist the savages have done their talk and are about to set their accursed devices in motion let us be patient something may yet offer in favour of your friends  friends call none of the race a friend of mine trapper if you have the smallest regard for my affection what i say in their favour is less from love than honesty  i did not know but the young woman was of the kin returned the other a little drilybut no offence should be taken where none was intended  the mouth of paul was again stopped by the hand of ellen who took on herself to reply in her conciliating tones we should be all of a family when it is in our power to serve each other we depend entirely on your experience honest old man to discover the means to apprise our friends of their danger  there will be a real time of it muttered the beehunter laughing if the boys get at work in good earnest with these red skins  he was interrupted by a general movement which took place among the band the indians dismounted to a man giving their horses in charge to three or four of the party who were also intrusted with the safe keeping of the prisoners they then formed themselves in a circle around a warrior who appeared to possess the chief authority and at a given signal the whole array moved slowly and cautiously from the centre in straight and consequently in diverging lines most of their dark forms were soon blended with the brown covering of the prairie though the captives who watched the slightest movement of their enemies with vigilant eyes were now and then enabled to discern a human figure drawn against the horizon as some one more eager than the rest rose to his greatest height in order to extend the limits of his view but it was not long before even these fugitive glimpses of the moving and constantly increasing circle were lost and uncertainty and conjecture were added to apprehension in this manner passed many anxious and weary minutes during the close of which the listeners expected at each moment to hear the whoop of the assailants and the shrieks of the assailed rising together on the stillness of the night but it would seem that the search which was so evidently making was without a sufficient object for at the expiration of half an hour the different individuals of the band began to return singly gloomy and sullen like men who were disappointed  our time is at hand observed the trapper who noted the smallest incident or the slightest indication of hostility among the savages we are now to be questioned and if i know any thing of the policy of our case i should say it would be wise to choose one among us to hold the discourse in order that our testimony may agree and furthermore if an opinion from one as old and as worthless as a hunter of fourscore is to be regarded i would just venture to say that man should be the one most skilled in the natur of an indian and that he should also know something of their languageare you acquainted with the tongue of the siouxes friend  swarm your own hive returned the discontented beehunter you are good at buzzing old trapper if you are good at nothing else  tis the gift of youth to be rash and heady the trapper calmly retorted the day has been boy when my blood was like your own too swift and too hot to run quietly in my veins but what will it profit to talk of silly risks and foolish acts at this time of life a grey head should cover a brain of reason and not the tongue of a boaster  true true whispered ellen and we have other things to attend to now here comes the indian to put his questions  the girl whose apprehensions had quickened her senses was not deceived she was yet speaking when a tall half naked savage approached the spot where they stood and after examining the whole party as closely as the dim light permitted for more than a minute in perfect stillness he gave the usual salutation in the harsh and guttural tones of his own language the trapper replied as well as he could which it seems was sufficiently well to be understood in order to escape the imputation of pedantry we shall render the substance and so far as it is possible the form of the dialogue that succeeded into the english tongue  have the palefaces eaten their own buffaloes and taken the skins from all their own beavers continued the savage allowing the usual moment of decorum to elapse after the words of greeting before he again spoke that they come to count how many are left among the pawnees  some of us are here to buy and some to sell returned the trapper but none will follow if they hear it is not safe to come nigh the lodge of a sioux  the siouxes are thieves and they live among the snow why do we talk of a people who are so far when we are in the country of the pawnees  if the pawnees are the owners of this land then white and red are here by equal right  have not the palefaces stolen enough from the red men that you come so far to carry a lie i have said that this is a huntingground of my tribe  my right to be here is equal to your own the trapper rejoined with undisturbed coolness i do not speak as i mightit is better to be silent the pawnees and the white men are brothers but a sioux dare not show his face in the village of the loups  the dahcotahs are men exclaimed the savage fiercely forgetting in his anger to maintain the character he had assumed and using the appellation of which his nation was most proud the dahcotahs have no fear speak what brings you so far from the villages of the palefaces  i have seen the sun rise and set on many councils and have heard the words of wise men let your chiefs come and my mouth shall not be shut  i am a great chief said the savage affecting an air of offended dignity do you take me for an assiniboine weucha is a warrior often named and much believed  am i a fool not to know a burntwood teton demanded the trapper with a steadiness that did great credit to his nerves go it is dark and you do not see that my head is grey  the indian now appeared convinced that he had adopted too shallow an artifice to deceive one so practised as the man he addressed and he was deliberating what fiction he should next invent in order to obtain his real object when a slight commotion among the band put an end at once to all his schemes casting his eyes behind him as if fearful of a speedy interruption he said in tones much less pretending than those he had first resorted to  give weucha the milk of the longknives and he will sing your name in the ears of the great men of his tribe  go repeated the trapper motioning him away with strong disgust your young men are speaking of mahtoree my words are for the ears of a chief  the savage cast a look at the other which notwithstanding the dim light was sufficiently indicative of implacable hostility he then stole away among his fellows anxious to conceal the counterfeit he had attempted to practise no less than the treachery he had contemplated against a fair division of the spoils from the man named by the trapper whom he now also knew to be approaching by the manner in which his name passed from one to another in the band he had hardly disappeared before a warrior of powerful frame advanced out of the dark circle and placed himself before the captives with that high and proud bearing for which a distinguished indian chief is ever so remarkable he was followed by all the party who arranged themselves around his person in a deep and respectful silence  the earth is very large the chief commenced after a pause of that true dignity which his counterfeit had so miserably affected why can the children of my great white father never find room on it  some among them have heard that their friends in the prairies are in want of many things returned the trapper and they have come to see if it be true some want in their turns what the red men are willing to sell and they come to make their friends rich with powder and blankets  do traders cross the big river with empty hands  our hands are empty because your young men thought we were tired and they have lightened us of our load they were mistaken i am old but i am still strong  it cannot be your load has fallen in the prairies show my young men the place that they may pick it up before the pawnees find it  the path to the spot is crooked and it is night the hour is come for sleep said the trapper with perfect composure bid your warriors go over yonder hill there is water and there is wood let them light their fires and sleep with warm feet when the sun comes again i will speak to you  a low murmur but one that was clearly indicative of dissatisfaction passed among the attentive listeners and served to inform the old man that he had not been sufficiently wary in proposing a measure that he intended should notify the travellers in the brake of the presence of their dangerous neighbours mahtoree however without betraying in the slightest degree the excitement which was so strongly exhibited by his companions continued the discourse in the same lofty manner as before  i know that my friend is rich he said that he has many warriors not far off and that horses are plentier with him than dogs among the redskins  you see my warriors and my horses  what has the woman the feet of a dahcotah that she can walk for thirty nights in the prairies and not fall i know the red men of the woods make long marches on foot but we who live where the eye cannot see from one lodge to another love our horses  the trapper now hesitated in his turn he was perfectly aware that deception if detected might prove dangerous and for one of his pursuits and character he was strongly troubled with an unaccommodating regard for the truth but recollecting that he controlled the fate of others as well as of himself he determined to let things take their course and to permit the dahcotah chief to deceive himself if he would  the women of the siouxes and of the white men are not of the same wigwam he answered evasively would a teton warrior make his wife greater than himself i know he would not and yet my ears have heard that there are lands where the councils are held by squaws  another slight movement in the dark circle apprised the trapper that his declaration was not received without surprise if entirely without distrust the chief alone seemed unmoved nor was he disposed to relax from the loftiness and high dignity of his air  my white fathers who live on the great lakes have declared he said that their brothers towards the rising sun are not men and now i know they did not lie gowhat is a nation whose chief is a squaw are you the dog and not the husband of this woman  i am neither never did i see her face before this day she came into the prairies because they had told her a great and generous nation called the dahcotahs lived there and she wished to look on men the women of the palefaces like the women of the siouxes open their eyes to see things that are new but she is poor like myself and she will want corn and buffaloes if you take away the little that she and her friend still have  my ears listen to many wicked lies exclaimed the teton warrior in a voice so stern that it startled even his red auditors am i a woman has not a dahcotah eyes tell me white hunter who are the men of your colour that sleep near the fallen trees  as he spoke the indignant chief pointed in the direction of ishmaels encampment leaving the trapper no reason to doubt that the superior industry and sagacity of this man had effected a discovery which had eluded the search of the rest of his party notwithstanding his regret at an event that might prove fatal to the sleepers and some little vexation at having been so completely outwitted in the dialogue just related the old man continued to maintain his air of inflexible composure  it may be true he answered that white men are sleeping in the prairie if my brother says it it is true but what men thus trust to the generosity of the tetons i cannot tell if there be strangers asleep send your young men to wake them up and let them say why they are here every paleface has a tongue the chief shook his head with a wild and fierce smile answering abruptly as he turned away to put an end to the conference  the dahcotahs are a wise race and mahtoree is their chief he will not call to the strangers that they may rise and speak to him with their carabines he will whisper softly in their ears when this is done let the men of their own colour come and awake them  as he uttered these words and turned on his heel a low and approving laugh passed around the dark circle which instantly broke its order and followed him to a little distance from the stand of the captives where those who might presume to mingle opinions with so great a warrior again gathered about him in consultation weucha profited by the occasion to renew his importunities but the trapper who had discovered how great a counterfeit he was shook him off in displeasure an end was however more effectually put to the annoyance of this malignant savage by a mandate for the whole party including men and beasts to change their positions the movement was made in dead silence and with an order that would have done credit to more enlightened beings a halt however was soon made and when the captives had time to look about them they found they were in view of the low dark outline of the copse near which lay the slumbering party of ishmael  here another short but grave and deliberative consultation was held  the beasts which seemed trained to such covert and silent attacks were once more placed under the care of keepers who as before were charged with the duty of watching the prisoners the mind of the trapper was in no degree relieved from the uneasiness which was at each instant getting a stronger possession of him when he found weucha was placed nearest to his own person and as it appeared by the air of triumph and authority he assumed at the head of the guard also the savage however who doubtless had his secret instructions was content for the present with making a significant gesture with his tomahawk which menaced death to ellen after admonishing in this expressive manner his male captives of the fate that would instantly attend their female companion on the slightest alarm proceeding from any of the party he was content to maintain a rigid silence this unexpected forbearance on the part of weucha enabled the trapper and his two associates to give their undivided attention to the little that might be seen of the interesting movements which were passing in their front  mahtoree took the entire disposition of the arrangements on himself he pointed out the precise situation he wished each individual to occupy like one intimately acquainted with the qualifications of his respective followers and he was obeyed with the deference and promptitude with which an indian warrior is wont to submit to the instructions of his chief in moments of trial some he despatched to the right and others to the left each man departed with the noiseless and quick step peculiar to the race until all had assumed their allotted stations with the exception of two chosen warriors who remained nigh the person of their leader when the rest had disappeared mahtoree turned to these select companions and intimated by a sign that the critical moment had arrived when the enterprise he contemplated was to be put in execution  each man laid aside the light fowlingpiece which under the name of a carabine he carried in virtue of his rank and divesting himself of every article of exterior or heavy clothing he stood resembling a dark and fierce looking statue in the attitude and nearly in the garb of nature mahtoree assured himself of the right position of his tomahawk felt that his knife was secure in its sheath of skin tightened his girdle of wampum and saw that the lacing of his fringed and ornamental leggings was secure and likely to offer no impediment to his exertions thus prepared at all points and ready for his desperate undertaking the teton gave the signal to proceed  the three advanced in a line with the encampment of the travellers until in the dim light by which they were seen their dusky forms were nearly lost to the eyes of the prisoners here they paused looking around them like men who deliberate and ponder long on the consequences before they take a desperate leap then sinking together they became lost in the grass of the prairie  it is not difficult to imagine the distress and anxiety of the different spectators of these threatening movements whatever might be the reasons of ellen for entertaining no strong attachment to the family in which she has first been seen by the reader the feelings of her sex and perhaps some lingering seeds of kindness predominated more than once she felt tempted to brave the awful and instant danger that awaited such an offence and to raise her feeble and in truth impotent voice in warning so strong indeed and so very natural was the inclination that she would most probably have put it in execution but for the often repeated though whispered remonstrances of paul hover in the breast of the young beehunter himself there was a singular union of emotions his first and chiefest solicitude was certainly in behalf of his gentle and dependent companion but the sense of her danger was mingled in the breast of the reckless woodsman with a consciousness of a high and wild and by no means an unpleasant excitement though united to the emigrants by ties still less binding than those of ellen he longed to hear the crack of their rifles and had occasion offered he would gladly have been among the first to rush to their rescue there were in truth moments when he felt in his turn an impulse that was nearly resistless to spring forward and awake the unconscious sleepers but a glance at ellen would serve to recall his tottering prudence and to admonish him of the consequences the trapper alone remained calm and observant as if nothing that involved his personal comfort or safety had occurred his evermoving vigilant eyes watched the smallest change with the composure of one too long inured to scenes of danger to be easily moved and with an expression of cool determination which denoted the intention he actually harboured of profiting by the smallest oversight on the part of the captors  in the mean time the teton warriors had not been idle profiting by the high fog which grew in the bottoms they had wormed their way through the matted grass like so many treacherous serpents stealing on their prey until the point was gained where an extraordinary caution became necessary to their further advance mahtoree alone had occasionally elevated his dark grim countenance above the herbage straining his eyeballs to penetrate the gloom which skirted the border of the brake in these momentary glances he gained sufficient knowledge added to that he had obtained in his former search to be the perfect master of the position of his intended victims though he was still profoundly ignorant of their numbers and of their means of defence  his efforts to possess himself of the requisite knowledge concerning these two latter and essential points were however completely baffled by the stillness of the camp which lay in a quiet as deep as if it were literally a place of the dead too wary and distrustful to rely in circumstances of so much doubt on the discretion of any less firm and crafty than himself the dahcotah bade his companions remain where they lay and pursued the adventure alone  the progress of mahtoree was now slow and to one less accustomed to such a species of exercise it would have proved painfully laborious but the advance of the wily snake itself is not more certain or noiseless than was his approach he drew his form foot by foot through the bending grass pausing at each movement to catch the smallest sound that might betray any knowledge on the part of the travellers of his proximity he succeeded at length in dragging himself out of the sickly light of the moon into the shadows of the brake where not only his own dark person was much less liable to be seen but where the surrounding objects became more distinctly visible to his keen and active glances  here the teton paused long and warily to make his observations before he ventured further his position enabled him to bring the whole encampment with its tent wagons and lodges into a dark but clearly marked profile furnishing a clue by which the practised warrior was led to a tolerably accurate estimate of the force he was about to encounter still an unnatural silence pervaded the spot as if men suppressed even the quiet breathings of sleep in order to render the appearance of their confidence more evident the chief bent his head to the earth and listened intently he was about to raise it again in disappointment when the long drawn and trembling respiration of one who slumbered imperfectly met his ear the indian was too well skilled in all the means of deception to become himself the victim of any common artifice he knew the sound to be natural by its peculiar quivering and he hesitated no longer  a man of nerves less tried than those of the fierce and conquering mahtoree would have been keenly sensible of all the hazard he incurred the reputation of those hardy and powerful white adventurers who so often penetrated the wilds inhabited by his people was well known to him but while he drew nigher with the respect and caution that a brave enemy never fails to inspire it was with the vindictive animosity of a red man jealous and resentful of the inroads of the stranger  turning from the line of his former route the teton dragged himself directly towards the margin of the thicket when this material object was effected in safety he arose to his seat and took a better survey of his situation a single moment served to apprise him of the place where the unsuspecting traveller lay the reader will readily anticipate that the savage had succeeded in gaining a dangerous proximity to one of those slothful sons of ishmael who were deputed to watch over the isolated encampment of the travellers  when certain that he was undiscovered the dahcotah raised his person again and bending forward he moved his dark visage above the face of the sleeper in that sort of wanton and subtle manner with which the reptile is seen to play about its victim before it strikes satisfied at length not only of the condition but of the character of the stranger mahtoree was in the act of withdrawing his head when a slight movement of the sleeper announced the symptoms of reviving consciousness the savage seized the knife which hung at his girdle and in an instant it was poised above the breast of the young emigrant then changing his purpose with an action as rapid as his own flashing thoughts he sunk back behind the trunk of the fallen tree against which the other reclined and lay in its shadow as dark as motionless and apparently as insensible as the wood itself  the slothful sentinel opened his heavy eyes and gazing upward for a moment at the hazy heavens he made an extraordinary exertion and raised his powerful frame from the support of the log then he looked about him with an air of something like watchfulness suffering his dull glances to run over the misty objects of the encampment until they finally settled on the distant and dim field of the open prairie meeting with nothing more attractive than the same faint outlines of swell and interval which every where rose before his drowsy eyes he changed his position so as completely to turn his back on his dangerous neighbour and suffered his person to sink sluggishly down into its former recumbent attitude a long and on the part of the teton an anxious and painful silence succeeded before the deep breathing of the traveller again announced that he was indulging in his slumbers the savage was however far too jealous of a counterfeit to trust to the first appearance of sleep but the fatigues of a day of unusual toil lay too heavy on the sentinel to leave the other long in doubt still the motion with which mahtoree again raised himself to his knees was so noiseless and guarded that even a vigilant observer might have hesitated to believe he stirred the change was however at length effected and the dahcotah chief then bent again over his enemy without having produced a noise louder than that of the cottonwood leaf which fluttered at his side in the currents of the passing air  mahtoree now felt himself master of the sleepers fate at the same time that he scanned the vast proportions and athletic limbs of the youth in that sort of admiration which physical excellence seldom fails to excite in the breast of a savage he coolly prepared to extinguish the principle of vitality which could alone render them formidable after making himself sure of the seat of life by gently removing the folds of the intervening cloth he raised his keen weapon and was about to unite his strength and skill in the impending blow when the young man threw his brawny arm carelessly backward exhibiting in the action the vast volume of its muscles  the sagacious and wary teton paused it struck his acute faculties that sleep was less dangerous to him at that moment than even death itself might prove the smallest noise the agony of struggling with which such a frame would probably relinquish its hold of life suggested themselves to his rapid thoughts and were all present to his experienced senses he looked back into the encampment turned his head into the thicket and glanced his glowing eyes abroad into the wild and silent prairies bending once more over the respited victim he assured himself that he was sleeping heavily and then abandoned his immediate purpose in obedience alone to the suggestions of a more crafty policy  the retreat of mahtoree was as still and guarded as had been his approach he now took the direction of the encampment stealing along the margin of the brake as a cover into which he might easily plunge at the smallest alarm the drapery of the solitary hut attracted his notice in passing after examining the whole of its exterior and listening with painful intensity in order to gather counsel from his ears the savage ventured to raise the cloth at the bottom and to thrust his dark visage beneath it might have been a minute before the teton chief drew back and seated himself with the whole of his form without the linen tenement here he sat seemingly brooding over his discovery for many moments in rigid inaction then he resumed his crouching attitude and once more projected his visage beyond the covering of the tent his second visit to the interior was longer and if possible more ominous than the first but it had like every thing else its termination and the savage again withdrew his glaring eyes from the secrets of the place  mahtoree had drawn his person many yards from the spot in his slow progress towards the cluster of objects which pointed out the centre of the position before he again stopped he made another pause and looked back at the solitary little dwelling he had left as if doubtful whether he should not return but the chevauxdefrise of branches now lay within reach of his arm and the very appearance of precaution it presented as it announced the value of the effects it encircled tempted his cupidity and induced him to proceed  the passage of the savage through the tender and brittle limbs of the cottonwood could be likened only to the sinuous and noiseless winding of the reptiles which he imitated when he had effected his object and had taken an instant to become acquainted with the nature of the localities within the enclosure the teton used the precaution to open a way through which he might make a swift retreat then raising himself on his feet he stalked through the encampment like the master of evil seeking whom and what he should first devote to his fell purposes he had already ascertained the contents of the lodge in which were collected the woman and her young children and had passed several gigantic frames stretched on different piles of brush which happily for him lay in unconscious helplessness when he reached the spot occupied by ishmael in person it could not escape the sagacity of one like mahtoree that he had now within his power the principal man among the travellers he stood long hovering above the recumbent and herculean form of the emigrant keenly debating in his own mind the chances of his enterprise and the most effectual means of reaping its richest harvest  he sheathed the knife which under the hasty and burning impulse of his thoughts he had been tempted to draw and was passing on when ishmael turned in his lair and demanded roughly who was moving before his halfopened eyes nothing short of the readiness and cunning of a savage could have evaded the crisis imitating the gruff tones and nearly unintelligible sounds he heard mahtoree threw his body heavily on the earth and appeared to dispose himself to sleep though the whole movement was seen by ishmael in a sort of stupid observation the artifice was too bold and too admirably executed to fail the drowsy father closed his eyes and slept heavily with this treacherous inmate in the very bosom of his family  it was necessary for the teton to maintain the position he had taken for many long and weary minutes in order to make sure that he was no longer watched though his body lay so motionless his active mind was not idle he profited by the delay to mature a plan which he intended should put the whole encampment including both its effects and their proprietors entirely at his mercy the instant he could do so with safety the indefatigable savage was again in motion he took his way towards the slight pen which contained the domestic animals worming himself along the ground in his former subtle and guarded manner  the first animal he encountered among the beasts occasioned a long and hazardous delay the weary creature perhaps conscious through its secret instinct that in the endless wastes of the prairies its surest protector was to be found in man was so exceedingly docile as quietly to submit to the close examination it was doomed to undergo the hand of the wandering teton passed over the downy coat the meek countenance and the slender limbs of the gentle creature with untiring curiosity but he finally abandoned the prize as useless in his predatory expeditions and offering too little temptation to the appetite as soon however as he found himself among the beasts of burden his gratification was extreme and it was with difficulty that he restrained the customary ejaculations of pleasure that were more than once on the point of bursting from his lips here he lost sight of the hazards by which he had gained access to his dangerous position and the watchfulness of the wary and long practised warrior was momentarily forgotten in the exultation of the savage     chapter v              why worthy father what have we to lose                     the law             protects us not then why should we be tender             to let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us             play judge and executioner                                                     cymbeline  while the teton thus enacted his subtle and characteristic part not a sound broke the stillness of the surrounding prairie the whole band lay at their several posts waiting with the wellknown patience of the natives for the signal which was to summon them to action to the eyes of the anxious spectators who occupied the little eminence already described as the position of the captives the scene presented the broad solemn view of a waste dimly lighted by the glimmering rays of a clouded moon the place of the encampment was marked by a gloom deeper than that which faintly shadowed out the courses of the bottoms and here and there a brighter streak tinged the rolling summits of the ridges as for the rest it was the deep imposing quiet of a desert  but to those who so well knew how much was brooding beneath this mantle of stillness and night it was a scene of high and wild excitement their anxiety gradually increased as minute after minute passed away and not the smallest sound of life arose out of the calm and darkness which enveloped the brake the breathing of paul grew louder and deeper and more than once ellen trembled at she knew not what as she felt the quivering of his active frame while she leaned dependently on his arm for support  the shallow honesty as well as the besetting infirmity of weucha have already been exhibited the reader therefore will not be surprised to learn that he was the first to forget the regulations he had himself imposed it was at the precise moment when we left mahtoree yielding to his nearly ungovernable delight as he surveyed the number and quality of ishmaels beasts of burden that the man he had selected to watch his captives chose to indulge in the malignant pleasure of tormenting those it was his duty to protect bending his head nigh the ear of the trapper the savage rather muttered than whispered  if the tetons lose their great chief by the hands of the longknives old shall die as well as young       the whites are so called by the indians from their swords  life is the gift of the wahcondah was the unmoved reply the burntwood warrior must submit to his laws as well as his other children men only die when he chooses and no dahcotah can change the hour  look returned the savage thrusting the blade of his knife before the face of his captive weucha is the wahcondah of a dog  the old man raised his eyes to the fierce visage of his keeper and for a moment a gleam of honest and powerful disgust shot from their deep cells but it instantly passed away leaving in its place an expression of commiseration if not of sorrow  why should one made in the real image of god suffer his natur to be provoked by a mere effigy of reason he said in english and in tones much louder than those in which weucha had chosen to pitch the conversation the latter profited by the unintentional offence of his captive and seizing him by the thin grey locks that fell from beneath his cap was on the point of passing the blade of his knife in malignant triumph around their roots when a long shrill yell rent the air and was instantly echoed from the surrounding waste as if a thousand demons opened their throats in common at the summons weucha relinquished his grasp and uttered a cry of exultation  now shouted paul unable to control his impatience any longer now old ishmael is the time to show the native blood of kentucky fire low boyslevel into the swales for the red skins are settling to the very earth  his voice was however lost or rather unheeded in the midst of the shrieks shouts and yells that were by this time bursting from fifty mouths on every side of him the guards still maintained their posts at the side of the captives but it was with that sort of difficulty with which steeds are restrained at the startingpost when expecting the signal to commence the trial of speed they tossed their arms wildly in the air leaping up and down more like exulting children than sober men and continued to utter the most frantic cries  in the midst of this tumultuous disorder a rushing sound was heard similar to that which might be expected to precede the passage of a flight of buffaloes and then came the flocks and cattle of ishmael in one confused and frightened drove  they have robbed the squatter of his beasts said the attentive trapper the reptiles have left him as hoofless as a beaver he was yet speaking when the whole body of the terrified animals rose the little acclivity and swept by the place where he stood followed by a band of dusky and demonlike looking figures who pressed madly on their rear  the impulse was communicated to the teton horses long accustomed to sympathise in the untutored passions of their owners and it was with difficulty that the keepers were enabled to restrain their impatience at this moment when all eyes were directed to the passing whirlwind of men and beasts the trapper caught the knife from the hands of his inattentive keeper with a power that his age would have seemed to contradict and at a single blow severed the thong of hide which connected the whole of the drove the wild animals snorted with joy and terror and tearing the earth with their heels they dashed away into the broad prairies in a dozen different directions  weucha turned upon his assailant with the ferocity and agility of a tiger he felt for the weapon of which he had been so suddenly deprived fumbled with impotent haste for the handle of his tomahawk and at the same moment glanced his eyes after the flying cattle with the longings of a western indian the struggle between thirst for vengeance and cupidity was severe but short the latter quickly predominated in the bosom of one whose passions were proverbially grovelling and scarcely a moment intervened between the flight of the animals and the swift pursuit of the guards the trapper had continued calmly facing his foe during the instant of suspense that succeeded his hardy act and now that weucha was seen following his companions he pointed after the dark train saying with his deep and nearly inaudible laugh  rednatur is rednatur let it show itself on a prairie or in a forest a knock on the head would be the smallest reward to him who should take such a liberty with a christian sentinel but there goes the teton after his horses as if he thought two legs as good as four in such a race and yet the imps will have every hoof of them afore the day sets in because its reason agin instinct poor reason i allow but still there is a great deal of the man in an indian ahs me your delawares were the redskins of which america might boast but few and scattered is that mighty people now well the traveller may just make his pitch where he is he has plenty of water though natur has cheated him of the pleasure of stripping the arth of its lawful trees he has seen the last of his fourfooted creatures or i am but little skilled in sioux cunning  had we not better join the party of ishmael said the beehunter there will be a regular fight about this matter or the old fellow has suddenly grown chickenhearted  nonono hastily exclaimed ellen  she was stopped by the trapper who laid his hand gently on her mouth as he answered  histhistthe sound of voices might bring us into danger is your friend he added turning to paul a man of spirit enough  dont call the squatter a friend of mine interrupted the youth i never yet harboured with one who could not show hand and zeal for the land which fed him  wellwell let it then be acquaintance is he a man to maintain his own stoutly by dint of powder and lead  his own ay and that which is not his own too can you tell me old trapper who held the rifle that did the deed for the sheriffs deputy that thought to rout the unlawful settlers who had gathered nigh the buffaloe lick in old kentucky i had lined a beautiful swarm that very day into the hollow of a dead beech and there lay the peoples officer at its roots with a hole directly through the grace of god which he carried in his jacket pocket covering his heart as if he thought a bit of sheepskin was a breastplate against a squatters bullet now ellen you neednt be troubled for it never strictly was brought home to him and there were fifty others who had pitched in that neighbourhood with just the same authority from the law  the poor girl shuddered struggling powerfully to suppress the sigh which arose in spite of her efforts as if from the very bottom of her heart  thoroughly satisfied that he understood the character of the emigrants by the short but comprehensive description conveyed in pauls reply the old man raised no further question concerning the readiness of ishmael to revenge his wrongs but rather followed the train of thought which was suggested to his experience by the occasion  each one knows the ties which bind him to his fellowcreatures best he answered though it is greatly to be mourned that colour and property and tongue and larning should make so wide a difference in those who after all are but the children of one father howsomever he continued by a transition not a little characteristic of the pursuits and feelings of the man as this is a business in which there is much more likelihood of a fight than need for a sermon it is best to be prepared for what may followhush there is a movement below it is an equal chance that we are seen  the family is stirring cried ellen with a tremor that announced nearly as much terror at the approach of her friends as she had before manifested at the presence of her enemies go paul leave me you at least must not be seen  if i leave you ellen in this desert before i see you safe in the care of old ishmael at least may i never hear the hum of another bee or what is worse fail in sight to line him to his hive  you forget this good old man he will not leave me though i am sure paul we have parted before where there has been more of a desert than this  never these indians may come whooping back and then where are you half way to the rocky mountains before a man can fairly strike the line of your flight what think you old trapper how long may it be before these tetons as you call them will be coming for the rest of old ishmaels goods and chattels  no fear of them returned the old man laughing in his own peculiar and silent manner i warrant me the devils will be scampering after their beasts these six hours yet listen you may hear them in the willow bottoms at this very moment ay your real sioux cattle will run like so many longlegged elks hist crouch again into the grass down with ye both as im a miserable piece of clay i heard the ticking of a gunlock  the trapper did not allow his companions time to hesitate but dragging them both after him he nearly buried his own person in the fog of the prairie while he was speaking it was fortunate that the senses of the aged hunter remained so acute and that he had lost none of his readiness of action the three were scarcely bowed to the ground when their ears were saluted with the wellknown sharp short reports of the western rifle and instantly the whizzing of the ragged lead was heard buzzing within dangerous proximity of their heads  well done young chips well done old block whispered paul whose spirits no danger nor situation could entirely depress as pretty a volley as one would wish to bear on the wrong end of a rifle what dye say trapper here is likely to be a threecornered war shall i give em as good as they send  give them nothing but fair words returned the other hastily or you are both lost  im not certain it would much mend the matter if i were to speak with my tongue instead of the piece said paul in a tone half jocular half bitter  for the sake of heaven do not let them hear you cried ellen go paul go you can easily quit us now  several shots in quick succession each sending its dangerous messenger still nearer than the preceding discharge cut short her speech no less in prudence than in terror  this must end said the trapper rising with the dignity of one bent only on the importance of his object i know not what need ye may have children to fear those you should both love and honour but something must be done to save your lives a few hours more or less can never be missed from the time of one who has already numbered so many days therefore i will advance here is a clear space around you profit by it as you need and may god bless and prosper each of you as ye deserve  without waiting for any reply the trapper walked boldly down the declivity in his front taking the direction of the encampment neither quickening his pace in trepidation nor suffering it to be retarded by fear the light of the moon fell brighter for a moment on his tall gaunt form and served to warn the emigrants of his approach indifferent however to this unfavourable circumstance he held his way silently and steadily towards the copse until a threatening voice met him with a challenge of  who comes friend or foe  friend was the reply one who has lived too long to disturb the close of life with quarrels  but not so long as to forget the tricks of his youth said ishmael rearing his huge frame from beneath the slight covering of a low bush and meeting the trapper face to face old man you have brought this tribe of red devils upon us and tomorrow you will be sharing the booty  what have you lost calmly demanded the trapper  eight as good mares as ever travelled in gears besides a foal that is worth thirty of the brightest mexicans that bear the face of the king of spain then the woman has not a cloven hoof for her dairy or her loom and i believe even the grunters foot sore as they be are ploughing the prairie and now stranger he added dropping the butt of his rifle on the hard earth with a violence and clatter that would have intimidated one less firm than the man he addressed how many of these creatures may fall to your lot  horses have i never craved nor even used though few have journeyed over more of the wide lands of america than myself old and feeble as i seem but little use is there for a horse among the hills and woods of yorkthat is as york was but as i greatly fear york is no longeras for woollen covering and cows milk i covet no such womanly fashions the beasts of the field give me food and raiment no i crave no cloth better than the skin of a deer nor any meat richer than his flesh  the sincere manner of the trapper as he uttered this simple vindication was not entirely thrown away on the emigrant whose dull nature was gradually quickening into a flame that might speedily have burst forth with dangerous violence he listened like one who doubted not entirely convinced and he muttered between his teeth the denunciation with which a moment before he intended to precede the summary vengeance he had certainly meditated  this is brave talking he at length grumbled but to my judgment too lawyerlike for a straight forward fairweather and foulweather hunter  i claim to be no better than a trapper the other meekly answered  hunter or trapperthere is little difference i have come old man into these districts because i found the law sitting too tight upon me and am not over fond of neighbours who cant settle a dispute without troubling a justice and twelve men but i didnt come to be robbd of my plunder and then to say thankee to the man who did it  he who ventures far into the prairies must abide by the ways of its owners  owners echoed the squatter i am as rightful an owner of the land i stand on as any governor in the states can you tell me stranger where the law or the reason is to be found which says that one man shall have a section or a town or perhaps a county to his use and another have to beg for earth to make his grave in this is not nature and i deny that it is law that is your legal law  i cannot say that you are wrong returned the trapper whose opinions on this important topic though drawn from very different premises were in singular accordance with those of his companion and i have often thought and said as much when and where i have believed my voice could be heard but your beasts are stolen by them who claim to be masters of all they find in the deserts  they had better not dispute that matter with a man who knows better said the other in a portentous voice though it seemed deep and sluggish as he who spoke  i call myself a fair trader and one who gives to his chaps as good as he receives you saw the indians  i didthey held me a prisoner while they stole into your camp  it would have been more like a white man and a christian to have let me known as much in better season retorted ishmael casting another ominous sidelong glance at the trapper as if still meditating evil i am not much given to call every man i fall in with cousin but colour should be something when christians meet in such a place as this but what is done is done and cannot be mended by words come out of your ambush boys here is no one but the old man he has eaten of my bread and should be our friend though there is such good reason to suspect him of harbouring with our enemies  the trapper made no reply to the harsh suspicion which the other did not scruple to utter without the smallest delicacy notwithstanding the explanations and denials to which he had just listened the summons of the unnurtured squatter brought an immediate accession to their party four or five of his sons made their appearance from beneath as many covers where they had been posted under the impression that the figures they had seen on the swell of the prairie were a part of the sioux band as each man approached and dropped his rifle into the hollow of his arm he cast an indolent but enquiring glance at the stranger though neither of them expressed the least curiosity to know whence he had come or why he was there this forbearance however proceeded only in part from the sluggishness of their common temper for long and frequent experience in scenes of a similar character had taught them the virtue of discretion the trapper endured their sullen scrutiny with the steadiness of one as practised as themselves and with the entire composure of innocence content with the momentary examination he had made the eldest of the group who was in truth the delinquent sentinel by whose remissness the wily mahtoree had so well profited turned towards his father and said bluntly  if this man is all that is left of the party i saw on the upland yonder we havent altogether thrown away our ammunition  asa you are right said the father turning suddenly on the trapper a lost idea being recalled by the hint of his son how is it stranger there were three of you just now or there is no virtue in moonlight  if you had seen the tetons racing across the prairies like so many blacklooking evil ones on the heels of your cattle my friend it would have been an easy matter to have fancied them a thousand  ay for a town bred boy or a skeary woman though for that matter there is old esther she has no more fear of a redskin than of a suckling cub or of a wolf pup ill warrant ye had your thievish devils made their push by the light of the sun the good woman would have been smartly at work among them and the siouxes would have found she was not given to part with her cheese and her butter without a price but therell come a time stranger right soon when justice will have its dues and that too without the help of what is called the law we ar of a slow breed it may be said and it is often said of us but slow is sure and there ar few men living who can say they ever struck a blow that they did not get one as hard in return from ishmael bush  then has ishmael bush followed the instinct of the beasts rather than the principle which ought to belong to his kind returned the stubborn trapper i have struck many a blow myself but never have i felt the same ease of mind that of right belongs to a man who follows his reason after slaying even a fawn when there was no call for his meat or hide as i have felt at leaving a mingo unburied in the woods when following the trade of open and honest warfare  what you have been a soldier have you trapper i made a forage or two among the cherokees when i was a lad myself and i followed mad anthony one season through the beeches but there was altogether too much tatooing and regulating among his troops for me so i left him without calling on the paymaster to settle my arrearages though as esther afterwards boasted she had made such use of the payticket that the states gained no great sum by the oversight you have heard of such a man as mad anthony if you tarried long among the soldiers       anthony wayne a pennsylvanian distinguished in the war of the     revolution and subsequently against the indians of the west for     his daring as a general by which he gained from his followers the     title of mad anthony general wayne was the son of the person     mentioned in the life of west as commanding the regiment which     excited his military ardour  i fout my last battle as i hope under his orders returned the trapper a gleam of sunshine shooting from his dim eyes as if the event was recollected with pleasure and then a sudden shade of sorrow succeeding as though he felt a secret admonition against dwelling on the violent scenes in which he had so often been an actor i was passing from the states on the seashore into these far regions when i crossd the trail of his army and i fell in on his rear just as a lookeron but when they got to blows the crack of my rifle was heard among the rest though to my shame it may be said i never knew the right of the quarrel as well as a man of threescore and ten should know the reason of his acts afore he takes mortal life which is a gift he never can return  come stranger said the emigrant his rugged nature a good deal softened when he found that they had fought on the same side in the wild warfare of the west it is of small account what may be the groundwork of the disturbance when its a christian agin a savage we shall hear more of this horsestealing tomorrow tonight we can do no wiser or safer thing than to sleep  so saying ishmael deliberately led the way back towards his rifled encampment and ushered the man whose life a few minutes before had been in real jeopardy from his resentment into the presence of his family here with a very few words of explanation mingled with scarce but ominous denunciations against the plunderers he made his wife acquainted with the state of things on the prairie and announced his own determination to compensate himself for his broken rest by devoting the remainder of the night to sleep  the trapper gave his ready assent to the measure and adjusted his gaunt form on the pile of brush that was offered him with as much composure as a sovereign could resign himself to sleep in the security of his capital and surrounded by his armed protectors the old man did not close his eyes however until he had assured himself that ellen wade was among the females of the family and that her relation or lover whichever he might be had observed the caution of keeping himself out of view after which he slept though with the peculiar watchfulness of one long accustomed to vigilance even in the hours of deepest night     chapter vi           he is too picked too spruce too affected too odd          as it were too peregrinate as i may call it                                                    shakspeare  the angloamerican is apt to boast and not without reason that his nation may claim a descent more truly honourable than that of any other people whose history is to be credited whatever might have been the weaknesses of the original colonists their virtues have rarely been disputed if they were superstitious they were sincerely pious and consequently honest the descendants of these simple and singleminded provincials have been content to reject the ordinary and artificial means by which honours have been perpetuated in families and have substituted a standard which brings the individual himself to the ordeal of the public estimation paying as little deference as may be to those who have gone before him this forbearance selfdenial or common sense or by whatever term it may be thought proper to distinguish the measure has subjected the nation to the imputation of having an ignoble origin were it worth the enquiry it would be found that more than a just proportion of the renowned names of the mothercountry are at this hour to be found in her cidevant colonies and it is a fact well known to the few who have wasted sufficient time to become the masters of so unimportant a subject that the direct descendants of many a failing line which the policy of england has seen fit to sustain by collateral supporters are now discharging the simple duties of citizens in the bosom of this republic the hive has remained stationary and they who flutter around the venerable straw are wont to claim the empty distinction of antiquity regardless alike of the frailty of their tenement and of the enjoyments of the numerous and vigorous swarms that are culling the fresher sweets of a virgin world but as this is a subject which belongs rather to the politician and historian than to the humble narrator of the homebred incidents we are about to reveal we must confine our reflections to such matters as have an immediate relation to the subject of the tale  although the citizen of the united states may claim so just an ancestry he is far from being exempt from the penalties of his fallen race like causes are well known to produce like effects that tribute which it would seem nations must ever pay by way of a weary probation around the shrine of ceres before they can be indulged in her fullest favours is in some measure exacted in america from the descendant instead of the ancestor the march of civilisation with us has a strong analogy to that of all coming events which are known to cast their shadows before the gradations of society from that state which is called refined to that which approaches as near barbarity as connection with an intelligent people will readily allow are to be traced from the bosom of the states where wealth luxury and the arts are beginning to seat themselves to those distant and everreceding borders which mark the skirts and announce the approach of the nation as moving mists precede the signs of day  here and here only is to be found that widely spread though far from numerous class which may be at all likened to those who have paved the way for the intellectual progress of nations in the old world the resemblance between the american borderer and his european prototype is singular though not always uniform both might be called without restraint the one being above the other beyond the reach of the lawbrave because they were inured to dangersproud because they were independent and vindictive because each was the avenger of his own wrongs it would be unjust to the borderer to pursue the parallel much farther he is irreligious because he has inherited the knowledge that religion does not exist in forms and his reason rejects mockery he is not a knight because he has not the power to bestow distinctions and he has not the power because he is the offspring and not the parent of a system in what manner these several qualities are exhibited in some of the most strongly marked of the latter class will be seen in the course of the ensuing narrative  ishmael bush had passed the whole of a life of more than fifty years on the skirts of society he boasted that he had never dwelt where he might not safely fell every tree he could view from his own threshold that the law had rarely been known to enter his clearing and that his ears had never willingly admitted the sound of a church bell his exertions seldom exceeded his wants which were peculiar to his class and rarely failed of being supplied he had no respect for any learning except that of the leech because he was ignorant of the application of any other intelligence than such as met the senses his deference to this particular branch of science had induced him to listen to the application of a medical man whose thirst for natural history had led him to the desire of profiting by the migratory propensities of the squatter this gentleman he had cordially received into his family or rather under his protection and they had journeyed together thus far through the prairies in perfect harmony ishmael often felicitating his wife on the possession of a companion who would be so serviceable in their new abode wherever it might chance to be until the family were thoroughly acclimated the pursuits of the naturalist frequently led him however for days at a time from the direct line of the route of the squatter who rarely seemed to have any other guide than the sun most men would have deemed themselves fortunate to have been absent on the perilous occasion of the sioux inroad as was obed bat or as he was fond of hearing himself called battius md and fellow of several cisatlantic learned societiesthe adventurous gentleman in question  although the sluggish nature of ishmael was not actually awakened it was sorely pricked by the liberties which had just been taken with his property he slept however for it was the hour he had allotted to that refreshment and because he knew how impotent any exertions to recover his effects must prove in the darkness of midnight he also knew the danger of his present situation too well to hazard what was left in pursuit of that which was lost much as the inhabitants of the prairies were known to love horses their attachment to many other articles still in the possession of the travellers was equally well understood it was a common artifice to scatter the herds and to profit by the confusion but mahtoree had as it would seem in this particular undervalued the acuteness of the man he had assailed the phlegm with which the squatter learned his loss has already been seen and it now remains to exhibit the results of his more matured determinations  though the encampment contained many an eye that was long unclosed and many an ear that listened greedily to catch the faintest evidence of any new alarm it lay in deep quiet during the remainder of the night silence and fatigue finally performed their accustomed offices and before the morning all but the sentinels were again buried in sleep how well these indolent watchers discharged their duties after the assault has never been known inasmuch as nothing occurred to confirm or to disprove their subsequent vigilance  just as day however began to dawn and a grey light was falling from the heavens on the dusky objects of the plain the half startled anxious and yet blooming countenance of ellen wade was reared above the confused mass of children among whom she had clustered on her stolen return to the camp arising warily she stepped lightly across the recumbent bodies and proceeded with the same caution to the utmost limits of the defences of ishmael here she listened as if she doubted the propriety of venturing further the pause was only momentary however and long before the drowsy eyes of the sentinel who overlooked the spot where she stood had time to catch a glimpse of her active form it had glided along the bottom and stood on the summit of the nearest eminence  ellen now listened intently anxious to catch some other sound than the breathing of the morning air which faintly rustled the herbage at her feet she was about to turn in disappointment from the enquiry when the tread of human feet making their way through the matted grass met her ear springing eagerly forward she soon beheld the outlines of a figure advancing up the eminence on the side opposite to the camp she had already uttered the name of paul and was beginning to speak in the hurried and eager voice with which female affection is apt to greet a friend when drawing back the disappointed girl closed her salutation by coldly addingi did not expect doctor to meet you at this unusual hour  all hours and all seasons are alike my good ellen to the genuine lover of naturereturned a small slightly made but exceedingly active man dressed in an odd mixture of cloth and skins a little past the middle age and who advanced directly to her side with the familiarity of an old acquaintance and he who does not know how to find things to admire by this grey light is ignorant of a large portion of the blessings he enjoys  very true said ellen suddenly recollecting the necessity of accounting for her own appearance abroad at that unseasonable hour i know many who think the earth has a pleasanter look in the night than when seen by the brightest sunshine  ah their organs of sight must be too convex but the man who wishes to study the active habits of the feline race or the variety albinos must indeed be stirring at this hour i dare say there are men who prefer even looking at objects by twilight for the simple reason that they see better at that time of the day  and is this the cause why you are so much abroad in the night  i am abroad at night my good girl because the earth in its diurnal revolutions leaves the light of the sun but half the time on any given meridian and because what i have to do cannot be performed in twelve or fifteen consecutive hours now have i been off two days from the family in search of a plant that is known to exist on the tributaries of la platte without seeing even a blade of grass that is not already enumerated and classed  you have been unfortunate doctor but  unfortunate echoed the little man sideling nigher to his companion and producing his tablets with an air in which exultation struggled strangely with an affectation of selfabasement no no ellen i am any thing but unfortunate unless indeed a man may be so called whose fortune is made whose fame may be said to be established for ever whose name will go down to posterity with that of buffonbuffon a mere compiler one who flourishes on the foundation of other mens labours no pari passu with solander who bought his knowledge with pain and privations  have you discovered a mine doctor bat  more than a mine a treasure coined and fit for instant use girllisten i was making the angle necessary to intersect the line of your uncles march after my fruitless search when i heard sounds like the explosion produced by fire arms  yes exclaimed ellen eagerly we had an alarm  and thought i was lost continued the man of science too much bent on his own ideas to understand her interruption little danger of that i made my own base knew the length of the perpendicular by calculation and to draw the hypothenuse had nothing to do but to work my angle i supposed the guns were fired for my benefit and changed my course for the soundsnot that i think the sense more accurate or even as accurate as a mathematical calculation but i feared that some of the children might need my services  they are all happily  listen interrupted the other already forgetting his affected anxiety for his patients in the greater importance of the present subject i had crossed a large tract of prairiefor sound is conveyed far where there is little obstructionwhen i heard the trampling of feet as if bisons were beating the earth then i caught a distant view of a herd of quadrupeds rushing up and down the swellsanimals which would have still remained unknown and undescribed had it not been for a most felicitous accident one and he a noble specimen of the whole was running a little apart from the rest the herd made an inclination in my direction in which the solitary animal coincided and this brought him within fifty yards of the spot where i stood i profited by the opportunity and by the aid of steel and taper i wrote his description on the spot i would have given a thousand dollars ellen for a single shot from the rifle of one of the boys  you carry a pistol doctor why didnt you use it said the half inattentive girl anxiously examining the prairie but still lingering where she stood quite willing to be detained  ay but it carries nothing but the most minute particles of lead adapted to the destruction of the larger insects and reptiles no i did better than to attempt waging a war in which i could not be the victor i recorded the event noting each particular with the precision necessary to science you shall hear ellen for you are a good and improving girl and by retaining what you learn in this way may yet be of great service to learning should any accident occur to me indeed my worthy ellen mine is a pursuit which has its dangers as well as that of the warrior this very night he continued glancing his eye behind him this awful night has the principle of life itself been in great danger of extinction  by what  by the monster i have discovered it approached me often and ever as i receded it continued to advance i believe nothing but the little lamp i carried was my protector i kept it between us whilst i wrote making it serve the double purpose of luminary and shield but you shall hear the character of the beast and you may then judge of the risks we promoters of science run in behalf of mankind  the naturalist raised his tablets to the heavens and disposed himself to read as well as he could by the dim light they yet shed upon the plain premising with saying  listen girl and you shall hear with what a treasure it has been my happy lot to enrich the pages of natural history  is it then a creature of your forming said ellen turning away from her fruitless examination with a sudden lighting of her sprightly blue eyes that showed she knew how to play with the foible of her learned companion  is the power to give life to inanimate matter the gift of man i would it were you should speedily see a historia naturalis americana that would put the sneering imitators of the frenchman de buffon to shame a great improvement might be made in the formation of all quadrupeds especially those in which velocity is a virtue two of the inferior limbs should be on the principle of the lever wheels perhaps as they are now formed though i have not yet determined whether the improvement might be better applied to the anterior or posterior members inasmuch as i am yet to learn whether dragging or shoving requires the greatest muscular exertion a natural exudation of the animal might assist in overcoming the friction and a powerful momentum be obtained but all this is hopelessat least for the presenthe added raising his tablets again to the light and reading aloud oct 6 1805 thats merely the date which i dare say you know better than imem quadruped seen by starlight and by the aid of a pocketlamp in the prairies of north americasee journal for latitude and meridian genusunknown therefore named after the discoverer and from the happy coincidence of being seen in the eveningvespertilio horribilis

feline feet large and hairy talons long curvated dangerous ears inconspicuous horns elongated diverging and formidable colour plumbeousashy with fiery spots voice sonorous martial and appalling habits gregarious carnivorous fierce and fearless there exclaimed obed when he had ended this sententious but comprehensive description there is an animal which will be likely to dispute with the lion his title to be called the king of the beasts  i know not the meaning of all you have said doctor battius returned the quickwitted girl who understood the weakness of the philosopher and often indulged him with a title he loved so well to hear but i shall think it dangerous to venture far from the camp if such monsters are prowling over the prairies  you may well call it prowling returned the naturalist nestling still closer to her side and dropping his voice to such low and undignified tones of confidence as conveyed a meaning still more pointed than he had intended i have never before experienced such a trial of the nervous system there was a moment i acknowledge when the fortiter in re faltered before so terrible an enemy but the love of natural science bore me up and brought me off in triumph  you speak a language so different from that we use in tennessee said ellen struggling to conceal her laughter that i hardly know whether i understand your meaning if i am right you wish to say you were chickenhearted  an absurd simile drawn from an ignorance of the formation of the biped the heart of a chicken has a just proportion to its other organs and the domestic fowl is in a state of nature a gallant bird ellen he added with a countenance so solemn as to produce an impression on the attentive girl i was pursued hunted and in a danger that i scorn to dwell onwhats that  ellen started for the earnestness and simple sincerity of her companions manner had produced a certain degree of credulity even on her buoyant mind looking in the direction indicated by the doctor she beheld in fact a beast coursing over the prairie and making a straight and rapid approach to the very spot they occupied the day was not yet sufficiently advanced to enable her to distinguish its form and character though enough was discernible to induce her to imagine it a fierce and savage animal  it comes it comes exclaimed the doctor fumbling by a sort of instinct for his tablets while he fairly tottered on his feet under the powerful efforts he made to maintain his ground now ellen has fortune given me an opportunity to correct the errors made by starlightholdashyplumbeousno earshorns excessive his voice and hand were both arrested by a roar or rather a shriek from the beast that was sufficiently terrific to appal even a stouter heart than that of the naturalist the cries of the animal passed over the prairie in strange cadences and then succeeded a deep and solemn silence that was only broken by an uncontrolled fit of merriment from the more musical voice of ellen wade in the mean time the naturalist stood like a statue of amazement permitting a wellgrown ass against whose approach he no longer offered his boasted shield of light to smell about his person without comment or hinderance  it is your own ass cried ellen the instant she found breath for words your own patient hard working hack  the doctor rolled his eyes from the beast to the speaker and from the speaker to the beast but gave no audible expression of his wonder  do you refuse to know an animal that has laboured so long in your service continued the laughing girl a beast that i have heard you say a thousand times has served you well and whom you loved like a brother  asinus domesticus ejaculated the doctor drawing his breath like one who had been near suffocation there is no doubt of the genus and i will always maintain that the animal is not of the species equus this is undeniably asinus himself ellen wade but this is not the vespertilio horribilis of the prairies very different animals i can assure you young woman and differently characterized in every important particular that carnivorous he continued glancing his eye at the open page of his tablets this granivorous habits fierce dangerous habits patient abstemious ears inconspicuous ears elongated horns diverging c horns none  he was interrupted by another burst of merriment from ellen which served in some measure to recall him to his recollection  the image of the vespertilio was on the retina the astounded enquirer into the secrets of nature observed in a manner that seemed a little apologetic and i was silly enough to mistake my own faithful beast for the monster though even now i greatly marvel to see this animal running at large  ellen then proceeded to explain the history of the attack and its results she described with an accuracy that might have raised suspicions of her own movements in the mind of one less simple than her auditor the manner in which the beasts burst out of the encampment and the headlong speed with which they had dispersed themselves over the open plain although she forebore to say as much in terms she so managed as to present before the eyes of her listener the strong probability of his having mistaken the frightened drove for savage beasts and then terminated her account by a lamentation for their loss and some very natural remarks on the helpless condition in which it had left the family the naturalist listened in silent wonder neither interrupting her narrative nor suffering a single exclamation of surprise to escape him the keeneyed girl however saw that as she proceeded the important leaf was torn from the tablets in a manner which showed that their owner had got rid of his delusion at the same instant from that moment the world has heard no more of the vespertilio horribilis americanus and the natural sciences have irretrievably lost an important link in that great animated chain which is said to connect earth and heaven and in which man is thought to be so familiarly complicated with the monkey  when dr bat was put in full possession of all the circumstances of the inroad his concern immediately took a different direction he had left sundry folios and certain boxes well stored with botanical specimens and defunct animals under the good keeping of ishmael and it immediately struck his acute mind that marauders as subtle as the siouxes would never neglect the opportunity to despoil him of these treasures nothing that ellen could say to the contrary served to appease his apprehensions and consequently they separated he to relieve his doubts and fears together and she to glide as swiftly and silently as she had just before passed it into the still and solitary tent     chapter vii                 what fifty of my followers at a clap                                                          lear  the day had now fairly opened on the seemingly interminable waste of the prairie the entrance of obed at such a moment into the camp accompanied as it was by vociferous lamentations over his anticipated loss did not fail to rouse the drowsy family of the squatter ishmael and his sons together with the forbidding looking brother of his wife were all speedily afoot and then as the sun began to shed his light on the place they became gradually apprised of the extent of their loss  ishmael looked round upon the motionless and heavily loaded vehicles with his teeth firmly compressed cast a glance at the amazed and helpless group of children which clustered around their sullen but desponding mother and walked out upon the open land as if he found the air of the encampment too confined he was followed by several of the men who were attentive observers watching the dark expression of his eye as the index of their own future movements the whole proceeded in profound and moody silence to the summit of the nearest swell whence they could command an almost boundless view of the naked plains here nothing was visible but a solitary buffaloe that gleaned a meagre subsistence from the decaying herbage at no great distance and the ass of the physician who profited by his freedom to enjoy a meal richer than common  yonder is one of the creatures left by the villains to mock us said ishmael glancing his eye towards the latter and that the meanest of the stock this is a hard country to make a crop in boys and yet food must be found to fill many hungry mouths  the rifle is better than the hoe in such a place as this returned the eldest of his sons kicking the hard and thirsty soil on which he stood with an air of contempt it is good for such as they who make their dinner better on beggars beans than on homminy a crow would shed tears if obliged by its errand to fly across the district  what say you trapper returned the father showing the slight impression his powerful heel had made on the compact earth and laughing with frightful ferocity is this the quality of land a man would choose who never troubles the county clerk with title deeds  there is richer soil in the bottoms returned the old man calmly and you have passed millions of acres to get to this dreary spot where he who loves to till the arth might have received bushels in return for pints and that too at the cost of no very grievous labour if you have come in search of land you have journeyed hundreds of miles too far or as many leagues too little  there is then a better choice towards the other ocean demanded the squatter pointing in the direction of the pacific  there is and i have seen it all was the answer of the other who dropped his rifle to the earth and stood leaning on its barrel like one who recalled the scenes he had witnessed with melancholy pleasure i have seen the waters of the two seas on one of them was i born and raised to be a lad like yonder tumbling boy america has grown my men since the days of my youth to be a country larger than i once had thought the world itself to be near seventy years i dwelt in york province and state togetheryouve been in york tis like  not inot i i never visited the towns but often have heard the place you speak of named tis a wide clearing there i reckon  too wide too wide they scourge the very arth with their axes such hills and huntinggrounds as i have seen stripped of the gifts of the lord without remorse or shame i tarried till the mouths of my hounds were deafened by the blows of the chopper and then i came west in search of quiet it was a grievous journey that i made a grievous toil to pass through falling timber and to breathe the thick air of smoky clearings week after week as i did tis a far country too that state of york from this  it lies agin the outer edge of old kentuck i reckon though what the distance may be i never knew  a gull would have to fan a thousand miles of air to find the eastern sea and yet it is no mighty reach to hunt across when shade and game are plenty the time has been when i followed the deer in the mountains of the delaware and hudson and took the beaver on the streams of the upper lakes in the same season but my eye was quick and certain at that day and my limbs were like the legs of a moose the dam of hector dropping his look kindly to the aged hound that crouched at his feet was then a pup and apt to open on the game the moment she struck the scent she gave me a deal of trouble that slut she did  your hound is old stranger and a rap on the head would prove a mercy to the beast  the dog is like his master returned the trapper without appearing to heed the brutal advice the other gave and will number his days when his work amongst the game is over and not before to my eye things seem ordered to meet each other in this creation tis not the swiftest running deer that always throws off the hounds nor the biggest arm that holds the truest rifle look around you men what will the yankee choppers say when they have cut their path from the eastern to the western waters and find that a hand which can lay the arth bare at a blow has been here and swept the country in very mockery of their wickedness they will turn on their tracks like a fox that doubles and then the rank smell of their own footsteps will show them the madness of their waste howsomever these are thoughts that are more likely to rise in him who has seen the folly of eighty seasons than to teach wisdom to men still bent on the pleasures of their kind you have need yet of a stirring time if you think to escape the craft and hatred of the burntwood indians they claim to be the lawful owners of this country and seldom leave a white more than the skin he boasts of when once they get the power as they always have the will to do him harm  old man said ishmael sternly to which people do you belong you have the colour and speech of a christian while it seems that your heart is with the redskins  to me there is little difference in nations the people i loved most are scattered as the sands of the dry riverbeds fly before the fall hurricanes and life is too short to make use and custom with strangers as one can do with such as he has dwelt amongst for years still am i a man without the cross of indian blood and what is due from a warrior to his nation is owing by me to the people of the states though little need have they with their militia and their armed boats of help from a single arm of fourscore  since you own your kin i may ask a simple question where are the siouxes who have stolen my cattle  where is the herd of buffaloes which was chased by the panther across this plain no later than the morning of yesterday it is as hard  friend said dr battius who had hitherto been an attentive listener but who now felt a sudden impulse to mingle in the discourse i am grieved when i find a venator or hunter of your experience and observation following the current of vulgar error the animal you describe is in truth a species of the bos ferus or bos sylvestris as he has been happily called by the poets but though of close affinity it is altogether distinct from the common bubulus bison is the better word and i would suggest the necessity of adopting it in future when you shall have occasion to allude to the species  bison or buffaloe it makes but little matter the creatur is the same call it by what name you will and  pardon me venerable venator as classification is the very soul of the natural sciences the animal or vegetable must of necessity be characterised by the peculiarities of its species which is always indicated by the name  friend said the trapper a little positively would the tail of a beaver make the worse dinner for calling it a mink or could you eat of the wolf with relish because some bookish man had given it the name of venison  as these questions were put with no little earnestness and some spirit there was every probability that a hot discussion would have succeeded between two men of whom one was so purely practical and the other so much given to theory had not ishmael seen fit to terminate the dispute by bringing into view a subject that was much more important to his own immediate interests  beavers tails and minks flesh may do to talk about before a maple fire and a quiet hearth interrupted the squatter without the smallest deference to the interested feelings of the disputants but something more than foreign words or words of any sort is now needed tell me trapper where are your siouxes skulking  it would be as easy to tell you the colours of the hawk that is floating beneath yonder white cloud when a redskin strikes his blow he is not apt to wait until he is paid for the evil deed in lead  will the beggarly savages believe they have enough when they find themselves master of all the stock  natur is much the same let it be covered by what skin it may do you ever find your longings after riches less when you have made a good crop than before you were master of a kernel of corn if you do you differ from what the experience of a long life tells me is the common cravings of man  speak plainly old stranger said the squatter striking the butt of his rifle heavily on the earth his dull capacity finding no pleasure in a discourse that was conducted in so obscure allusions i have asked a simple question and one i know well that you can answer  you are right you are right i can answer for i have too often seen the disposition of my kind to mistake it when evil is stirring when the siouxes have gathered in the beasts and have made sure that you are not upon their heels they will be back nibbling like hungry wolves to take the bait they have left or it may be theyll show the temper of the great bears that are found at the falls of the long river and strike at once with the paw without stopping to nose their prey  you have then seen the animals you mention exclaimed dr battius who had now been thrown out of the conversation quite as long as his impatience could well brook and who approached the subject with his tablets ready opened as a book of reference can you tell me if what you encountered was of the species ursus horribiliswith the ears roundedfront arquatedeyesdestitute of the remarkable supplemental lidwith six incisores one false and four perfect molares  trapper go on for we are engaged in reasonable discourse interrupted ishmael you believe we shall see more of the robbers  naynayi do not call them robbers for it is the usage of their people and what may be called the prairie law  i have come five hundred miles to find a place where no man can ding the words of the law in my ears said ishmael fiercely and i am not in a humour to stand quietly at a bar while a redskin sits in judgment i tell you trapper if another sioux is seen prowling around my camp wherever it may be he shall feel the contents of old kentuck slapping his rifle in a manner that could not be easily misconstrued though he wore the medal of washington himself i call the man a robber who takes that which is not his own       the american government creates chiefs among the western tribes     and decorates them with silver medals hearing the impression of     the different presidents that of washington is the most prized  the teton and the pawnee and the konza and men of a dozen other tribes claim to own these naked fields  natur gives them the lie in their teeth the air the water and the ground are free gifts to man and no one has the power to portion them out in parcels man must drink and breathe and walkand therefore each has a right to his share of arth why do not the surveyors of the states set their compasses and run their lines over our heads as well as beneath our feet why do they not cover their shining sheepskins with big words giving to the landholder or perhaps he should be called air holder so many rods of heaven with the use of such a star for a boundarymark and such a cloud to turn a mill  as the squatter uttered his wild conceit he laughed from the very bottom of his chest in scorn the deriding but frightful merriment passed from the mouth of one of his ponderous sons to that of the other until it had made the circuit of the whole family  come trapper continued ishmael in a tone of better humour like a man who feels that he has triumphed neither of us i reckon has ever had much to do with titledeeds or county clerks or blazed trees therefore we will not waste words on fooleries you ar a man that has tarried long in this clearing and now i ask your opinion face to face without fear or favour if you had the lead in my business what would you do  the old man hesitated and seemed to give the required advice with deep reluctance as every eye however was fastened on him and whichever way he turned his face he encountered a look riveted on the lineaments of his own working countenance he answered in a low melancholy tone  i have seen too much mortal blood poured out in empty quarrels to wish ever to hear an angry rifle again ten weary years have i sojourned alone on these naked plains waiting for my hour and not a blow have i struck agin an enemy more humanised than the grizzly bear  ursus horribilis muttered the doctor  the speaker paused at the sound of the others voice but perceiving it was no more than a sort of mental ejaculation he continued in the same strain  more humanised than the grizzly hear or the panther of the rocky mountains unless the beaver which is a wise and knowing animal may be so reckoned what would i advise even the female buffaloe will fight for her young  it never then shall be said that ishmael bush has less kindness for his children than the bear for her cubs  and yet this is but a naked spot for a dozen men to make head in agin five hundred  ay it is so returned the squatter glancing his eye towards his humble camp but something might be done with the wagons and the cottonwood  the trapper shook his head incredulously and pointed across the rolling plain in the direction of the west as he answered  a rifle would send a bullet from these hills into your very sleepingcabins nay arrows from the thicket in your rear would keep you all burrowed like so many prairie dogs it wouldnt do it wouldnt do three long miles from this spot is a place where as i have often thought in passing across the desert a stand might be made for days and weeks together if there were hearts and hands ready to engage in the bloody work  another low deriding laugh passed among the young men announcing in a manner sufficiently intelligible their readiness to undertake a task even more arduous the squatter himself eagerly seized the hint which had been so reluctantly extorted from the trapper who by some singular process of reasoning had evidently persuaded himself that it was his duty to be strictly neutral a few direct and pertinent enquiries served to obtain the little additional information that was necessary in order to make the contemplated movement and then ishmael who was on emergencies as terrifically energetic as he was sluggish in common set about effecting his object without delay  notwithstanding the industry and zeal of all engaged the task was one of great labour and difficulty the loaded vehicles were to be drawn by hand across a wide distance of plain without track or guide of any sort except that which the trapper furnished by communicating his knowledge of the cardinal points of the compass in accomplishing this object the gigantic strength of the men was taxed to the utmost nor were the females or the children spared a heavy proportion of the toil while the sons distributed themselves about the heavily loaded wagons and drew them by main strength up the neighbouring swell their mother and ellen surrounded by the amazed group of little ones followed slowly in the rear bending under the weight of such different articles as were suited to their several strengths  ishmael himself superintended and directed the whole occasionally applying his colossal shoulder to some lagging vehicle until he saw that the chief difficulty that of gaining the level of their intended route was accomplished then he pointed out the required course cautioning his sons to proceed in such a manner that they should not lose the advantage they had with so much labour obtained and beckoning to the brother of his wife they returned together to the empty camp  throughout the whole of this movement which occupied an hour of time the trapper had stood apart leaning on his rifle with the aged hound slumbering at his feet a silent but attentive observer of all that passed occasionally a smile lighted his hard muscular but wasted features like a gleam of sunshine flitting across a ragged ruin and betrayed the momentary pleasure he found in witnessing from time to time the vast power the youths discovered then as the train drew slowly up the ascent a cloud of thought and sorrow threw all into the shade again leaving the expression of his countenance in its usual state of quiet melancholy as vehicle after vehicle left the place of the encampment he noted the change with increasing attention seldom failing to cast an enquiring look at the little neglected tent which with its proper wagon still remained as before solitary and apparently forgotten the summons of ishmael to his gloomy associate had however as it would now seem this hitherto neglected portion of his effects for its object  first casting a cautious and suspicious glance on every side of him the squatter and his companion advanced to the little wagon and caused it to enter within the folds of the cloth much in the manner that it had been extricated the preceding evening they both then disappeared behind the drapery and many moments of suspense succeeded during which the old man secretly urged by a burning desire to know the meaning of so much mystery insensibly drew nigh to the place until he stood within a few yards of the proscribed spot the agitation of the cloth betrayed the nature of the occupation of those whom it concealed though their work was conducted in rigid silence it would appear that long practice had made each of the two acquainted with his particular duty for neither sign nor direction of any sort was necessary from ishmael in order to apprise his surly associate of the manner in which he was to proceed in less time than has been consummated in relating it the interior portion of the arrangement was completed when the men reappeared without the tent too busy with his occupation to heed the presence of the trapper ishmael began to release the folds of the cloth from the ground and to dispose of them in such a manner around the vehicle as to form a sweeping train to the new form the little pavilion had now assumed the arched roof trembled with the occasional movement of the light vehicle which it was now apparent once more supported its secret burden just as the work was ended the scowling eye of ishmaels assistant caught a glimpse of the figure of the attentive observer of their movements dropping the shaft which he had already lifted from the ground preparatory to occupying the place that was usually filled by an animal less reasoning and perhaps less dangerous than himself he bluntly exclaimed  i am a fool as you often say but look for yourself if that man is not an enemy i will disgrace father and mother call myself an indian and go hunt with the siouxes  the cloud as it is about to discharge the subtle lightning is not more dark nor threatening than the look with which ishmael greeted the intruder he turned his head on every side of him as if seeking some engine sufficiently terrible to annihilate the offending trapper at a blow and then possibly recollecting the further occasion he might have for his counsel he forced himself to say with an appearance of moderation that nearly choked him  stranger i did believe this prying into the concerns of others was the business of women in the towns and settlements and not the manner in which men who are used to live where each has room for himself deal with the secrets of their neighbours to what lawyer or sheriff do you calculate to sell your news  i hold but little discourse except with one and then chiefly of my own affairs returned the old man without the least observable apprehension and pointing imposingly upward a judge and judge of all little does he need knowledge from my hands and but little will your wish to keep any thing secret from him profit you even in this desert  the mounting tempers of his unnurtured listeners were rebuked by the simple solemn manner of the trapper ishmael stood sullen and thoughtful while his companion stole a furtive and involuntary glance at the placid sky which spread so wide and blue above his head as if he expected to see the almighty eye itself beaming from the heavenly vault but impressions of a serious character are seldom lasting on minds long indulged in forgetfulness the hesitation of the squatter was consequently of short duration the language however as well as the firm and collected air of the speaker were the means of preventing much subsequent abuse if not violence  it would be showing more of the kindness of a friend and comrade ishmael returned in a tone sufficiently sullen to betray his humour though it was no longer threatening had your shoulder been put to the wheel of one of yonder wagons instead of edging itself in here where none are wanted but such as are invited  i can put the little strength that is left me returned the trapper to this as well as to another of your loads  do you take us for boys exclaimed ishmael laughing half in ferocity and half in derision applying his powerful strength at the same time to the little vehicle which rolled over the grass with as much seeming facility as if it were drawn by its usual team  the trapper paused and followed the departing wagon with his eye marvelling greatly as to the nature of its concealed contents until it had also gained the summit of the eminence and in its turn disappeared behind the swell of the land then he turned to gaze at the desolation of the scene around him the absence of human forms would have scarce created a sensation in the bosom of one so long accustomed to solitude had not the site of the deserted camp furnished such strong memorials of its recent visitors and as the old man was quick to detect of their waste also he cast his eye upwards with a shake of the head at the vacant spot in the heavens which had so lately been filled by the branches of those trees that now lay stripped of their verdure worthless and deserted logs at his feet  ay he muttered to himself i might have knowd iti might have knowd it often have i seen the same before and yet i brought them to the spot myself and have now sent them to the only neighbourhood of their kind within many long leagues of the spot where i stand this is mans wish and pride and waste and sinfulness he tames the beasts of the field to feed his idle wants and having robbed the brutes of their natural food he teaches them to strip the arth of its trees to quiet their hunger  a rustling in the low bushes which still grew for some distance along the swale that formed the thicket on which the camp of ishmael had rested caught his ear at the moment and cut short the soliloquy the habits of so many years spent in the wilderness caused the old man to bring his rifle to a poise with something like the activity and promptitude of his youth but suddenly recovering his recollection he dropped it into the hollow of his arm again and resumed his air of melancholy resignation  come forth come forth he said aloud be ye bird or be ye beast ye are safe from these old hands i have eaten and i have drunk why should i take life when my wants call for no sacrifice it will not be long afore the birds will peck at eyes that shall not see them and perhaps light on my very bones for if things like these are only made to perish why am i to expect to live for ever come forth come forth you are safe from harm at these weak hands  thank you for the good word old trapper cried paul hover springing actively forward from his place of concealment there was an air about you when you threw forward the muzzle of the piece that i did not like for it seemed to say that you were master of all the rest of the motions  you are right you are right cried the trapper laughing with inward selfcomplacency at the recollection of his former skill the day has been when few men knew the virtues of a long rifle like this i carry better than myself old and useless as i now seem you are right young man and the time was when it was dangerous to move a leaf within earshot of my stand or he added dropping his voice and looking serious for a red mingo to show an eyeball from his ambushment you have heard of the red mingos  i have heard of minks said paul taking the old man by the arm and gently urging him towards the thicket as he spoke while at the same time he cast quick and uneasy glances behind him in order to make sure he was not observed of your common black minks but none of any other colour  lord lord continued the trapper shaking his head and still laughing in his deep but quiet manner the boy mistakes a brute for a man though a mingo is little better than a beast or for that matter he is worse when rum and opportunity are placed before his eyes there was that accursed huron from the upper lakes that i knocked from his perch among the rocks in the hills back of the hori  his voice was lost in the thicket into which he had suffered himself to be led by paul while speaking too much occupied by thoughts which dwelt on scenes and acts that had taken place half a century earlier in the history of the country to offer the smallest resistance     chapter viii     now they are clapperclawing one another ill go look on that    dissembling abominable varlet diomed has got that same scurvy    doting foolish young knave in his helm                                          troilus and cressida  it is necessary in order that the thread of the narrative should not be spun to a length which might fatigue the reader that he should imagine a week to have intervened between the scene with which the preceding chapter closed and the events with which it is our intention to resume its relation in this the season was on the point of changing its character the verdure of summer giving place more rapidly to the brown and partycoloured livery of the fall the heavens were clothed in driving clouds piled in vast masses one above the other which whirled violently in the gusts opening occasionally to admit transient glimpses of the bright and glorious sight of the heavens dwelling in a magnificence by far too grand and durable to be disturbed by the fitful efforts of the lower world beneath the wind swept across the wild and naked prairies with a violence that is seldom witnessed in any section of the continent less open it would have been easy to have imagined in the ages of fable that the god of the winds had permitted his subordinate agents to escape from their den and that they now rioted in wantonness across wastes where neither tree nor work of man nor mountain nor obstacle of any sort opposed itself to their gambols       the americans call the autumn the fall from the fall of the     leaf  though nakedness might as usual be given as the pervading character of the spot whither it is now necessary to transfer the scene of the tale it was not entirely without the signs of human life amid the monotonous rolling of the prairie a single naked and ragged rock arose on the margin of a little watercourse which found its way after winding a vast distance through the plains into one of the numerous tributaries of the father of rivers a swale of low land lay near the base of the eminence and as it was still fringed with a thicket of alders and sumack it bore the signs of having once nurtured a feeble growth of wood the trees themselves had been transferred however to the summit and crags of the neighbouring rocks on this elevation the signs of man to which the allusion just made applies were to be found  seen from beneath there were visible a breastwork of logs and stones intermingled in such a manner as to save all unnecessary labour a few low roofs made of bark and boughs of trees an occasional barrier constructed like the defences on the summit and placed on such points of the acclivity as were easier of approach than the general face of the eminence and a little dwelling of cloth perched on the apex of a small pyramid that shot up on one angle of the rock the white covering of which glimmered from a distance like a spot of snow or to make the simile more suitable to the rest of the subject like a spotless and carefully guarded standard which was to be protected by the dearest blood of those who defended the citadel beneath it is hardly necessary to add that this rude and characteristic fortress was the place where ishmael bush had taken refuge after the robbery of his flocks and herds  on the day to which the narrative is advanced the squatter was standing near the base of the rocks leaning on his rifle and regarding the sterile soil that supported him with a look in which contempt and disappointment were strongly blended  tis time to change our naturs he observed to the brother of his wife who was rarely far from his elbow and to become ruminators instead of people used to the fare of christians and free men i reckon abiram you could glean a living among the grasshoppers you ar an active man and might outrun the nimblest skipper of them all  the country will never do returned the other who relished but little the forced humour of his kinsman and it is well to remember that a lazy traveller makes a long journey  would you have me draw a cart at my heels across this desert for weeksay months retorted ishmael who like all of his class could labour with incredible efforts on emergencies but who too seldom exerted continued industry on any occasion to brook a proposal that offered so little repose it may do for your people who live in settlements to hasten on to their houses but thank heaven my farm is too big for its owner ever to want a restingplace  since you like the plantation then you have only to make your crop  that is easier said than done on this corner of the estate i tell you abiram there is need of moving for more reasons than one you know im a man that very seldom enters into a bargain but who always fulfils his agreements better than your dealers in wordy contracts written on rags of paper if theres one mile there ar a hundred still needed to make up the distance for which you have my honour  as he spoke the squatter glanced his eye upward at the little tenement of cloth which crowned the summit of his ragged fortress the look was understood and answered by the other and by some secret influence which operated either through their interests or feelings it served to reestablish that harmony between them which had just been threatened with something like a momentary breach  i know it and feel it in every bone of my body but i remember the reason why i have set myself on this accursed journey too well to forget the distance between me and the end neither you nor i will ever be the better for what we have done unless we thoroughly finish what is so well begun ay that is the doctrine of the whole world i judge i heard a travelling preacher who was skirting it down the ohio a time since say if a man should live up to the faith for a hundred years and then fall from his work a single day he would find the settlement was to be made for the finishing blow that he had put to his job and that all the bad and none of the good would come into the final account  and you believed the hungry hypocrite  who said that i believed it retorted abiram with a bullying look that betrayed how much his fears had dwelt on the subject he affected to despise is it believing to tell what a roguishand yet ishmael the man might have been honest after all he told us that the world was in truth no better than a desert and that there was but one hand that could lead the most learned man through all its crooked windings now if this be true of the whole it may be true of a part  abiram out with your grievances like a man interrupted the squatter with a hoarse laugh you want to pray but of what use will it be according to your own doctrine to serve god five minutes and the devil an hour harkee friend im not much of a husbandman but this i know to my cost that to make a right good crop even on the richest bottom there must be hard labour and your snufflers liken the arth to a field of corn and the men who live on it to its yield now i tell you abiram that you are no better than a thistle or a mullin yea ye ar wood of too open a pore to be good even to burn  the malign glance which shot from the scowling eye of abiram announced the angry character of his feelings but as the furtive look quailed immediately before the unmoved steady countenance of the squatter it also betrayed how much the bolder spirit of the latter had obtained the mastery over his craven nature  content with his ascendency which was too apparent and had been too often exerted on similar occasions to leave him in any doubt of its extent ishmael coolly continued the discourse by adverting more directly to his future plans  you will own the justice of paying every one in kind he said i have been robbed of my stock and i have a scheme to make myself as good as before by taking hoof for hoof or for that matter when a man is put to the trouble of bargaining for both sides he is a fool if he dont pay himself something in the way of commission  as the squatter made this declaration in a tone which was a little excited by the humour of the moment four or five of his lounging sons who had been leaning against the foot of the rock came forward with the indolent step so common to the family  i have been calling ellen wade who is on the rock keeping the lookout to know if there is any thing to be seen observed the eldest of the young men and she shakes her head for an answer ellen is sparing of her words for a woman and might be taught manners at least without spoiling her good looks  ishmael cast his eye upward to the place where the offending but unconscious girl was holding her anxious watch she was seated at the edge of the uppermost crag by the side of the little tent and at least two hundred feet above the level of the plain little else was to be distinguished at that distance but the outline of her form her fair hair streaming in the gusts beyond her shoulders and the steady and seemingly unchangeable look that she had riveted on some remote point of the prairie  what is it nell cried ishmael lifting his powerful voice a little above the rushing of the element have you got a glimpse of any thing bigger than a burrowing barker  the lips of the attentive ellen parted she rose to the utmost height her small stature admitted seeming still to regard the unknown object but her voice if she spoke at all was not sufficiently loud to be heard amid the wind  it ar a fact that the child sees something more uncommon than a buffaloe or a prairie dog continued ishmael why nell girl ar ye deaf nell i sayi hope it is an army of redskins she has in her eye for i should relish the chance to pay them for their kindness under the favour of these logs and rocks  as the squatter accompanied his vaunt with corresponding gestures and directed his eyes to the circle of his equally confident sons while speaking he drew their gaze from ellen to himself but now when they turned together to note the succeeding movements of their female sentinel the place which had so lately been occupied by her form was vacant  as i am a sinner exclaimed asa usually one of the most phlegmatic of the youths the girl is blown away by the wind  something like a sensation was exhibited among them which might have denoted that the influence of the laughing blue eyes flaxen hair and glowing cheeks of ellen had not been lost on the dull natures of the young men and looks of amazement mingled slightly with concern passed from one to the other as they gazed in dull wonder at the point of the naked rock  it might well be added another she sat on a slivered stone and i have been thinking of telling her she was in danger for more than an hour  is that a riband of the child dangling from the corner of the hill below cried ishmael ha who is moving about the tent have i not told you all  ellen tis ellen interrupted the whole body of his sons in a breath and at that instant she reappeared to put an end to their different surmises and to relieve more than one sluggish nature from its unwonted excitement as ellen issued from beneath the folds of the tent she advanced with a light and fearless step to her former giddy stand and pointed toward the prairie appearing to speak in an eager and rapid voice to some invisible auditor  nell is mad said asa half in contempt and yet not a little in concern the girl is dreaming with her eyes open and thinks she sees some of them fierce creaturs with hard names with which the doctor fills her ears  can it be the child has found a scout of the siouxes said ishmael bending his look toward the plain but a low significant whisper from abiram drew his eyes quickly upward again where they were turned just in time to perceive that the cloth of the tent was agitated by a motion very evidently different from the quivering occasioned by the wind let her if she dare the squatter muttered in his teeth abiram they know my temper too well to play the prank with me  look for yourself if the curtain is not lifted i can see no better than the owl by daylight  ishmael struck the breach of his rifle violently on the earth and shouted in a voice that might easily have been heard by ellen had not her attention still continued rapt on the object which so unaccountably attracted her eyes in the distance  nell continued the squatter away with you fool will you bring down punishment on your own head why nellshe has forgotten her native speech let us see if she can understand another language  ishmael threw his rifle to his shoulder and at the next moment it was pointed upward at the summit of the rock before time was given for a word of remonstrance it had sent forth its contents in its usual streak of bright flame ellen started like the frightened chamois and uttering a piercing scream she darted into the tent with a swiftness that left it uncertain whether terror or actual injury had been the penalty of her offence  the action of the squatter was too sudden and unexpected to admit of prevention but the instant it was done his sons manifested in an unequivocal manner the temper with which they witnessed the desperate measure angry and fierce glances were interchanged and a murmur of disapprobation was uttered by the whole in common  what has ellen done father said asa with a degree of spirit which was the more striking from being unusual that she should be shot at like a straggling deer or a hungry wolf  mischief deliberately returned the squatter but with a cool expression of defiance in his eye that showed how little he was moved by the illconcealed humour of his children mischief boy mischief take you heed that the disorder dont spread  it would need a different treatment in a man than in yon screaming girl  asa you ar a man as you have often boasted but remember i am your father and your better  i know it well and what sort of a father  harkee boy i more than half believe that your drowsy head let in the siouxes be modest in speech my watchful son or you may have to answer yet for the mischief your own bad conduct has brought upon us  ill stay no longer to be hectored like a child in petticoats you talk of law as if you knew of none and yet you keep me down as though i had not life and wants of my own ill stay no longer to be treated like one of your meanest cattle  the world is wide my gallant boy and theres many a noble plantation on it without a tenant go you have title deeds signed and sealed to your hand few fathers portion their children better than ishmael bush you will say that for me at least when you get to be a wealthy landholder  look father look exclaimed several voices at once seizing with avidity an opportunity to interrupt a dialogue which threatened to become more violent  look repeated abiram in a voice which sounded hollow and warning if you have time for any thing but quarrels ishmael look  the squatter turned slowly from his offending son and cast an eye that still lowered with deep resentment upward but which the instant it caught a view of the object that now attracted the attention of all around him changed its expression to one of astonishment and dismay  a female stood on the spot from which ellen had been so fearfully expelled her person was of the smallest size that is believed to comport with beauty and which poets and artists have chosen as the beau ideal of feminine loveliness her dress was of a dark and glossy silk and fluttered like gossamer around her form long flowing and curling tresses of hair still blacker and more shining than her robe fell at times about her shoulders completely enveloping the whole of her delicate bust in their ringlets or at others streaming in the wind the elevation at which she stood prevented a close examination of the lineaments of a countenance which however it might be seen was youthful and at the moment of her unlookedfor appearance eloquent with feeling so young indeed did this fair and fragile being appear that it might be doubted whether the age of childhood was entirely passed one small and exquisitely moulded hand was pressed on her heart while with the other she made an impressive gesture which seemed to invite ishmael if further violence was meditated to direct it against her bosom  the silent wonder with which the group of borderers gazed upward at so extraordinary a spectacle was only interrupted as the person of ellen was seen emerging with timidity from the tent as if equally urged by apprehensions in behalf of herself and the fears which she felt on account of her companion to remain concealed and to advance she spoke but her words were unheard by those below and unheeded by her to whom they were addressed the latter however as if content with the offer she had made of herself as a victim to the resentment of ishmael now calmly retired and the spot she had so lately occupied became vacant leaving a sort of stupid impression on the spectators beneath not unlike that which it might be supposed would have been created had they just been gazing at some supernatural vision  more than a minute of profound silence succeeded during which the sons of ishmael still continued gazing at the naked rock in stupid wonder then as eye met eye an expression of novel intelligence passed from one to the other indicating that to them at least the appearance of this extraordinary tenant of the pavilion was as unexpected as it was incomprehensible at length asa in right of his years and moved by the rankling impulse of the recent quarrel took on himself the office of interrogator instead however of braving the resentment of his father of whose fierce nature when aroused he had had too frequent evidence to excite it wantonly he turned upon the cowering person of abiram observing with a sneer  this then is the beast you were bringing into the prairies for a decoy i know you to be a man who seldom troubles truth when any thing worse may answer but i never knew you to outdo yourself so thoroughly before the newspapers of kentuck have called you a dealer in black flesh a hundred times but little did they reckon that you drove the trade into white families  who is a kidnapper demanded abiram with a blustering show of resentment am i to be called to account for every lie they put in print throughout the states look to your own family boy look to yourselves the very stumps of kentucky and tennessee cry out agin ye ay my tonguey gentleman i have seen father and mother and three children yourself for one published on the logs and stubs of the settlements with dollars enough for reward to have made an honest man rich for  he was interrupted by a backhanded but violent blow on the mouth that caused him to totter and which left the impression of its weight in the starting blood and swelling lips  asa said the father advancing with a portion of that dignity with which the hand of nature seems to have invested the parental character you have struck the brother of your mother  i have struck the abuser of the whole family returned the angry youth and unless he teaches his tongue a wiser language he had better part with it altogether as the unruly member im no great performer with the knife but on an occasion could make out myself to cut off a slande  boy twice have you forgotten yourself today be careful that it does not happen the third time when the law of the land is weak it is right the law of nature should be strong you understand me asa and you know me as for you abiram the child has done you wrong and it is my place to see you righted remember i tell you justice shall be done it is enough but you have said hard things agin me and my family if the hounds of the law have put their bills on the trees and stumps of the clearings it was for no act of dishonesty as you know but because we maintain the rule that arth is common property no abiram could i wash my hands of things done by your advice as easily as i can of the things done by the whisperings of the devil my sleep would be quieter at night and none who bear my name need blush to hear it mentioned peace asa and you too man enough has been said let us all think well before any thing is added that may make what is already so bad still more bitter  ishmael waved his hand with authority as he ended and turned away with the air of one who felt assured that those he had addressed would not have the temerity to dispute his commands asa evidently struggled with himself to compel the required obedience but his heavy nature quietly sunk into its ordinary repose and he soon appeared again the being he really was dangerous only at moments and one whose passions were too sluggish to be long maintained at the point of ferocity not so with abiram while there was an appearance of a personal conflict between him and his colossal nephew his mien had expressed the infallible evidences of engrossing apprehension but now that the authority as well as gigantic strength of the father were interposed between him and his assailant his countenance changed from paleness to a livid hue that bespoke how deeply the injury he had received rankled in his breast like asa however he acquiesced in the decision of the squatter and the appearance at least of harmony was restored again among a set of beings who were restrained by no obligations more powerful than the frail web of authority with which ishmael had been able to envelope his children  one effect of the quarrel had been to divert the thoughts of the young men from their recent visitor with the dispute that succeeded the disappearance of the fair stranger all recollection of her existence appeared to have vanished a few ominous and secret conferences it is true were held apart during which the direction of the eyes of the different speakers betrayed their subject but these threatening symptoms soon disappeared and the whole party was again seen broken into its usual listless silent and lounging groups  i will go upon the rock boys and look abroad for the savages said ishmael shortly after advancing towards them with a mien which he intended should be conciliating at the same time that it was authoritative  if there is nothing to fear we will go out on the plain the day is too good to be lost in words like women in the towns wrangling over their tea and sugared cakes  without waiting for approbation or dissent the squatter advanced to the base of the rock which formed a sort of perpendicular wall nearly twenty feet high around the whole acclivity ishmael however directed his footsteps to a point where an ascent might be made through a narrow cleft which he had taken the precaution to fortify with a breastwork of cottonwood logs and which in its turn was defended by a chevauxdefrise of the branches of the same tree here an armed man was usually kept as at the key of the whole position and here one of the young men now stood indolently leaning against the rock ready to protect the pass if it should prove necessary until the whole party could be mustered at the several points of defence  from this place the squatter found the ascent still difficult partly by nature and partly by artificial impediments until he reached a sort of terrace or to speak more properly the plain of the elevation where he had established the huts in which the whole family dwelt these tenements were as already mentioned of that class which are so often seen on the borders and such as belonged to the infancy of architecture being simply formed of logs bark and poles the area on which they stood contained several hundred square feet and was sufficiently elevated above the plain greatly to lessen if not to remove all danger from indian missiles here ishmael believed he might leave his infants in comparative security under the protection of their spirited mother and here he now found esther engaged at her ordinary domestic employments surrounded by her daughters and lifting her voice in declamatory censure as one or another of the idle fry incurred her displeasure and far too much engrossed with the tempest of her own conversation to know any thing of the violent scene which had been passing below  a fine windy place you have chosen for the camp ishmael she commenced or rather continued by merely diverting the attack from a sobbing girl of ten at her elbow to her husband my word if i havent to count the young ones every ten minutes to see they are not flying away among the buzzards or the ducks why do ye all keep hovering round the rock like lolloping reptiles in the spring when the heavens are beginning to be alive with birds man dye think mouths can be filled and hunger satisfied by laziness and sleep  youll have your say eester said the husband using the provincial pronunciation of america for the name and regarding his noisy companions with a look of habitual tolerance rather than of affection but the birds you shall have if your own tongue dont frighten them to take too high a flight ay woman he continued standing on the very spot whence he had so rudely banished ellen which he had by this time gained and buffaloe too if my eye can tell the animal at the distance of a spanish league  come down come down and be doing instead of talking a talking man is no better than a barking dog i shall hang out the cloth if any of the redskins show themselves in time to give you notice but ishmael what have you been killing my man for it was your rifle i heard a few minutes agone unless i have lost my skill in sounds  poh twas to frighten the hawk you see sailing above the rock  hawk indeed at your time of day to be shooting at hawks and buzzards with eighteen open mouths to feed look at the bee and at the beaver my good man and learn to be a provider why ishmael i believe my soul she continued dropping the tow she was twisting on a distaff the man is in that tent agin more than half his time is spent about the worthless goodfornothing  the sudden reappearance of her husband closed the mouth of the wife and as the former descended to the place where esther had resumed her employment she was content to grumble forth her dissatisfaction instead of expressing it in more audible terms  the dialogue that now took place between the affectionate pair was sufficiently succinct and expressive the woman was at first a little brief and sullen in her answers but care for her family soon rendered her more complaisant as the purport of the conversation was merely an engagement to hunt during the remainder of the day in order to provide the chief necessary of life we shall not stop to record it  with this resolution then the squatter descended to the plain and divided his forces into two parts one of which was to remain as a guard with the fortress and the other to accompany him to the field he warily included asa and abiram in his own party well knowing that no authority short of his own was competent to repress the fierce disposition of his headlong son if fairly awakened when these arrangements were completed the hunters sallied forth separating at no great distance from the rock in order to form a circle about the distant herd of buffaloes     chapter ix                           priscian a little scratchd                  twill serve                                            loves labour lost  having made the reader acquainted with the manner in which ishmael bush had disposed of his family under circumstances that might have proved so embarrassing to most other men we shall again shift the scene a few short miles from the place last described preserving however the due and natural succession of time at the very moment that the squatter and his sons departed in the manner mentioned in the preceding chapter two men were intently occupied in a swale that lay along the borders of a little run just out of cannonshot from the encampment discussing the merits of a savoury bisons hump that had been prepared for their palates with the utmost attention to the particular merits of that description of food the choice morsel had been judiciously separated from the adjoining and less worthy parts of the beast and enveloped in the hairy coating provided by nature it had duly undergone the heat of the customary subterraneous oven and was now laid before its proprietors in all the culinary glory of the prairies so far as richness delicacy and wildness of flavour and substantial nourishment were concerned the viand might well have claimed a decided superiority over the meretricious cookery and laboured compounds of the most renowned artist though the service of the dainty was certainly achieved in a manner far from artificial it would appear that the two fortunate mortals to whose happy lot it fell to enjoy a meal in which health and appetite lent so keen a relish to the exquisite food of the american deserts were far from being insensible of the advantage they possessed  the one to whose knowledge in the culinary art the other was indebted for his banquet seemed the least disposed of the two to profit by his own skill he ate it is true and with a relish but it was always with the moderation with which age is apt to temper the appetite no such restraint however was imposed on the inclination of his companion in the very flower of his days and in the vigour of manhood the homage that he paid to the work of his more aged friends hands was of the most profound and engrossing character as one delicious morsel succeeded another he rolled his eyes towards his companion and seemed to express that gratitude which he had not speech to utter in looks of the most benignant nature  cut more into the heart of it lad said the trapper for it was the venerable inhabitant of those vast wastes who had served the beehunter with the banquet in question cut more into the centre of the piece there you will find the genuine riches of natur and that without need from spices or any of your biting mustard to give it a foreign relish  if i had but a cup of metheglin said paul stopping to perform the necessary operation of breathing i should swear this was the strongest meal that was ever placed before the mouth of man  ay ay well you may call it strong returned the other laughing after his peculiar manner in pure satisfaction at witnessing the infinite contentment of his companion strong it is and strong it makes him who eats it here hector tossing the patient hound who was watching his eye with a wistful look a portion of the meat you have need of strength my friend in your old days as well as your master now lad there is a dog that has eaten and slept wiser and better ay and that of richer food than any king of them all and why because he has used and not abused the gifts of his maker he was made a hound and like a hound has he feasted then did he create men but they have eaten like famished wolves a good and prudent dog has hector proved and never have i found one of his breed false in nose or friendship do you know the difference between the cookery of the wilderness and that which is found in the settlements no i see plainly you dont by your appetite then i will tell you the one follows man the other natur one thinks he can add to the gifts of the creator while the other is humble enough to enjoy them therein lies the secret  i tell you trapper said paul who was very little edified by the morality with which his associate saw fit to season their repast that every day while we are in this place and they are likely to be many i will shoot a buffaloe and you shall cook his hump  i cannot say that i cannot say that the beast is good take him in what part you will and it was to be food for man that he was fashioned but i cannot say that i will be a witness and a helper to the waste of killing one daily  the devil a bit of waste shall there be old man if they all turn out as good as this i will engage to eat them clean myself even to the hoofshow now who comes here some one with a long nose i will answer and one that has led him on a true scent if he is following the trail of a dinner  the individual who interrupted the conversation and who had elicited the foregoing remark of paul was seen advancing along the margin of the run with a deliberate pace in a direct line for the two revellers as there was nothing formidable nor hostile in his appearance the beehunter instead of suspending his operations rather increased his efforts in a manner which would seem to imply that he doubted whether the hump would suffice for the proper entertainment of all who were now likely to partake of the delicious morsel with the trapper however the case was different his more tempered appetite was already satisfied and he faced the new comer with a look of cordiality that plainly evinced how very opportune he considered his arrival  come on friend he said waving his hand as he observed the stranger to pause a moment apparently in doubt come on i say if hunger be your guide it has led you to a fitting place here is meat and this youth can give you corn parchd till it be whiter than the upland snow come on without fear we are not ravenous beasts eating of each other but christian men receiving thankfully that which the lord hath seen fit to give  venerable hunter returned the doctor for it was no other than the naturalist on one of his daily exploring expeditions i rejoice greatly at this happy meeting we are lovers of the same pursuits and should be friends  lord lord said the old man laughing without much deference to the rules of decorum in the philosophers very face it is the man who wanted to make me believe that a name could change the natur of a beast come friend you are welcome though your notions are a little blinded with reading too many books sit ye down and after eating of this morsel tell me if you can the name of the creatur that has bestowed on you its flesh for a meal  the eyes of doctor battius for we deem it decorous to give the good man the appellation he most preferred sufficiently denoted the satisfaction with which he listened to this proposal the exercise he had taken and the sharpness of the wind proved excellent stimulants and paul himself had hardly been in better plight to do credit to the trappers cookery than was the lover of nature when the grateful invitation met his ears indulging in a small laugh which his exertions to repress reduced nearly to a simper he took the indicated seat by the old mans side and made the customary dispositions to commence his meal without further ceremony  i should be ashamed of my profession he said swallowing a morsel of the hump with evident delight slily endeavouring at the same time to distinguish the peculiarities of the singed and defaced skin i ought to be ashamed of my profession were there beast or bird on the continent of america that i could not tell by some one of the many evidences which science has enlisted in her cause thisthenthe food is nutritious and savourya mouthful of your corn friend if you please  paul who continued eating with increasing industry looking askaunt not unlike a dog when engaged in the same agreeable pursuit threw him his pouch without deeming it at all necessary to suspend his own labours  you were saying friend that you have many ways of telling the creaturobserved the attentive trapper  many many and infallible now the animals that are carnivorous are known by their incisores  their what demanded the trapper  the teeth with which nature has furnished them for defence and in order to tear their food again  look you then for the teeth of this creatur interrupted the trapper who was bent on convincing a man who had presumed to enter into competition with himself in matters pertaining to the wilds of gross ignorance turn the piece round and find your insideovers  the doctor complied and of course without success though he profited by the occasion to take another fruitless glance at the wrinkled hide  well friend do you find the things you need before you can pronounce the creatur a duck or a salmon  i apprehend the entire animal is not here  you may well say as much cried paul who was now compelled to pause from pure repletion i will answer for some pounds of the fellow weighed by the truest steelyards west of the alleghanies still you may make out to keep soul and body together with what is left reluctantly eyeing a piece large enough to feed twenty men but which he felt compelled to abandon from satiety cut in nigher to the heart as the old man says and you will find the riches of the piece  the heart exclaimed the doctor inwardly delighted to learn there was a distinct organ to be submitted to his inspection ay let me see the heartit will at once determine the character of the animalcertes this is not the coray sure enough it isthe animal must be of the order belluae from its obese habits  he was interrupted by a long and hearty but still a noiseless fit of merriment from the trapper which was considered so illtimed by the offended naturalist as to produce an instant cessation of speech if not a stagnation of ideas  listen to his beasts habits and belly orders said the old man delighted with the evident embarrassment of his rival and then he says it is not the core why man you are farther from the truth than you are from the settlements with all your bookish laming and hard words which i have once for all said cannot be understood by any tribe or nation east of the rocky mountains beastly habits or no beastly habits the creaturs are to be seen cropping the prairies by tens of thousands and the piece in your hand is the core of as juicy a buffaloehump as stomach need crave  my aged companion said obed struggling to keep down a rising irascibility that he conceived would ill comport with the dignity of his character your system is erroneous from the premises to the conclusion and your classification so faulty as utterly to confound the distinctions of science the buffaloe is not gifted with a hump at all nor is his flesh savoury and wholesome as i must acknowledge it would seem the subject before us may well be characterised  there im dead against you and clearly with the trapper interrupted paul hover the man who denies that buffaloe beef is good should scorn to eat it       it is scarcely necessary to tell the reader that the animal so     often alluded to in this book and which is vulgarly called the     buffaloe is in truth the bison hence so many contretemps     between the men of the prairies and the men of science  the doctor whose observation of the beehunter had hitherto been exceedingly cursory stared at the new speaker with a look which denoted something like recognition  the principal characteristics of your countenance friend he said are familiar either you or some other specimen of your class is known to me  i am the man you met in the woods east of the big river and whom you tried to persuade to line a yellow hornet to his nest as if my eye was not too true to mistake any other animal for a honeybee in a clear day we tarried together a week as you may remember you at your toads and lizards and i at my highholes and hollow trees and a good job we made of it between us i filled my tubs with the sweetest honey i ever sent to the settlements besides housing a dozen hives and your bag was near bursting with a crawling museum i never was bold enough to put the question to your face stranger but i reckon you are a keeper of curiosities       the pursuit of a beehunter is not uncommon on the skirts of     american society though it is a little embellished here when the     bees are seen sucking the flowers their pursuer contrives to     capture one or two he then chooses a proper spot and suffering     one to escape the insect invariably takes its flight towards the     hive changing his ground to a greater or less distance according     to circumstances the beehunter then permits another to escape     having watched the courses of the bees which is technically     called lining he is enabled to calculate the intersecting angle     of the two lines which is the hive  ay that is another of their wanton wickednesses exclaimed the trapper they slay the buck and the moose and the wild cat and all the beasts that range the woods and stuffing them with worthless rags and placing eyes of glass into their heads they set them up to be stared at and call them the creaturs of the lord as if any mortal effigy could equal the works of his hand  i know you well returned the doctor on whom the plaint of the old man produced no visible impression i know you offering his hand cordially to paul it was a prolific week as my herbal and catalogues shall one day prove ay i remember you well young man you are of the class mammalia order primates genus homo species kentucky pausing to smile at his own humour the naturalist proceeded since our separation i have journeyed far having entered into a compactum or agreement with a certain man named ishmael  bush interrupted the impatient and reckless paul by the lord trapper this is the very bloodletter that ellen told me of  then nelly has not done me credit for what i trust i deserve returned the singleminded doctor for i am not of the phlebotomising school at all greatly preferring the practice which purifies the blood instead of abstracting it  it was a blunder of mine good stranger the girl called you a skilful man  therein she may have exceeded my merits dr battius continued bowing with sufficient meekness but ellen is a good and a kind and a spirited girl too a kind and a sweet girl i have ever found nell wade to be  the devil you have cried paul dropping the morsel he was sucking from sheer reluctance to abandon the hump and casting a fierce and direct look into the very teeth of the unconscious physician i reckon stranger you have a mind to bag ellen too  the riches of the whole vegetable and animal world united would not tempt me to harm a hair of her head i love the child with what may he called amor naturalisor rather paternusthe affection of a father  aythat indeed is more befitting the difference in your years paul coolly rejoined stretching forth his hand to regain the rejected morsel you would be no better than a drone at your time of day with a young hive to feed and swarm  yes there is reason because there is natur in what he says observed the trapper but friend you have said you were a dweller in the camp of one ishmael bush  true it is in virtue of a compactum  i know but little of the virtue of packing though i follow trapping in my old age for a livelihood they tell me that skins are well kept in the new fashion but it is long since i have left off killing more than i need for food and garments i was an eyewitness myself of the manner in which the siouxes broke into your encampment and drove off the cattle stripping the poor man you call ishmael of his smallest hoofs counting even the cloven feet  asinus excepted muttered the doctor who by this time was discussing his portion of the hump in utter forgetfulness of all its scientific attributes asinus domesticus americanus excepted  i am glad to hear that so many of them are saved though i know not the value of the animals you name which is nothing uncommon seeing how long it is that i have been out of the settlements but can you tell me friend what the traveller carries under the white cloth he guards with teeth as sharp as a wolf that quarrels for the carcass the hunter has left  youve heard of it exclaimed the other dropping the morsel he was conveying to his mouth in manifest surprise  nay i have heard nothing but i have seen the cloth and had like to have been bitten for no greater crime than wishing to know what it covered  bitten then after all the animal must be carnivorous it is too tranquil for the ursus horridus if it were the canis latrans the voice would betray it nor would nelly wade be so familiar with any of the genus ferae venerable hunter the solitary animal confined in that wagon by day and in the tent at night has occasioned me more perplexity of mind than the whole catalogue of quadrupeds besides and for this plain reason i did not know how to class it  you think it a ravenous beast  i know it to be a quadruped your own danger proves it to be carnivorous  during this broken explanation paul hover had sat silent and thoughtful regarding each speaker with deep attention but suddenly moved by the manner of the doctor the latter had scarcely time to utter his positive assertion before the young man bluntly demanded  and pray friend what may you call a quadruped  a vagary of nature wherein she has displayed less of her infinite wisdom than is usual could rotary levers be substituted for two of the limbs agreeably to the improvement in my new order of phalangacrura which might be rendered into the vernacular as leverlegged there would be a delightful perfection and harmony in the construction but as the quadruped is now formed i call it a mere vagary of nature no other than a vagary  harkee stranger in kentucky we are but small dealers in dictionaries vagary is as hard a word to turn into english as quadruped  a quadruped is an animal with four legsa beast  a beast do you then reckon that ishmael bush travels with a beast caged in that wagon  i know it and lend me your earnot literally friend observing paul to start and look surprised but figuratively through its functions and you shall hear i have already made known that in virtue of a compactum i journey with the aforesaid ishmael bush but though i am bound to perform certain duties while the journey lasts there is no condition which says that the said journey shall be sempiternum or eternal now though this region may scarcely be said to be wedded to science being to all intents a virgin territory as respects the enquirer into natural history still it is greatly destitute of the treasures of the vegetable kingdom i should therefore have tarried some hundreds of miles more to the eastward were it not for the inward propensity that i feel to have the beast in question inspected and suitably described and classed for that matter he continued dropping his voice like one who imparts an important secret i am not without hopes of persuading ishmael to let me dissect it  you have seen the creature  not with the organs of sight but with much more infallible instruments of vision the conclusions of reason and the deductions of scientific premises i have watched the habits of the animal young man and can fearlessly pronounce by evidence that would be thrown away on ordinary observers that it is of vast dimensions inactive possibly torpid of voracious appetite and as it now appears by the direct testimony of this venerable hunter ferocious and carnivorous  i should be better pleased stranger said paul on whom the doctors description was making a very sensible impression to be sure the creature was a beast at all  as to that if i wanted evidence of a fact which is abundantly apparent by the habits of the animal i have the word of ishmael himself a reason can be given for my smallest deductions i am not troubled young man with a vulgar and idle curiosity but all my aspirations after knowledge as i humbly believe are first for the advancement of learning and secondly for the benefit of my fellowcreatures i pined greatly in secret to know the contents of the tent which ishmael guarded so carefully and which he had covenanted that i should swear jurare per deos not to approach nigher than a defined number of cubits for a definite period of time your jusjurandum or oath is a serious matter and not to be dealt in lightly but as my expedition depended on complying i consented to the act reserving to myself at all times the power of distant observation it is now some ten days since ishmael pitying the state in which he saw me a humble lover of science imparted the fact that the vehicle contained a beast which he was carrying into the prairies as a decoy by which he intends to entrap others of the same genus or perhaps species since then my task has been reduced simply to watch the habits of the animal and to record the results when we reach a certain distance where these beasts are said to abound i am to have the liberal examination of the specimen  paul continued to listen in the most profound silence until the doctor concluded his singular but characteristic explanation then the incredulous beehunter shook his head and saw fit to reply by saying  stranger old ishmael has burrowed you in the very bottom of a hollow tree where your eyes will be of no more use than the sting of a drone i too know something of that very wagon and i may say that i have lined the squatter down into a flat lie harkee friend do you think a girl like ellen wade would become the companion of a wild beast  why not why not repeated the naturalist nelly has a taste and often listens with pleasure to the treasures that i am sometimes compelled to scatter in this desert why should she not study the habits of any animal even though it were a rhinoceros  softly softly returned the equally positive and though less scientific certainly on this subject better instructed beehunter ellen is a girl of spirit and one too that knows her own mind or im much mistaken but with all her courage and brave looks she is no better than a woman after all havent i often had the girl crying  you are an acquaintance then of nellys  the devil a bit but i know woman is woman and all the books in kentucky couldnt make ellen wade go into a tent alone with a ravenous beast  it seems to me the trapper calmly observed that there is something dark and hidden in this matter i am a witness that the traveller likes none to look into the tent and i have a proof more sure than what either of you can lay claim to that the wagon does not carry the cage of a beast here is hector come of a breed with noses as true and faithful as a hand that is allpowerful has made any of their kind and had there been a beast in the place the hound would long since have told it to his master  do you pretend to oppose a dog to a man brutality to learning instinct to reason exclaimed the doctor in some heat in what manner pray can a hound distinguish the habits species or even the genus of an animal like reasoning learned scientific triumphant man  in what manner coolly repeated the veteran woodsman listen and if you believe that a schoolmaster can make a quicker wit than the lord you shall be made to see how much youre mistaken do you not hear something move in the brake it has been cracking the twigs these five minutes now tell me what the creatur is  i hope nothing ferocious exclaimed the doctor who still retained a lively impression of his rencounter with the vespertilio horribilis you have rifles friends would it not be prudent to prime them for this fowling piece of mine is little to be depended on  there may be reason in what he says returned the trapper so far complying as to take his piece from the place where it had lain during the repast and raising its muzzle in the air now tell me the name of the creatur  it exceeds the limits of earthly knowledge buffon himself could not tell whether the animal was a quadruped or of the order serpens a sheep or a tiger  then was your buffoon a fool to my hector here pupwhat is it dogshall we run it down pupor shall we let it pass  the hound which had already manifested to the experienced trapper by the tremulous motion of his ears his consciousness of the proximity of a strange animal lifted his head from his fore paws and slightly parted his lips as if about to show the remnants of his teeth but suddenly abandoning his hostile purpose he snuffed the air a moment gaped heavily shook himself and peaceably resumed his recumbent attitude  now doctor cried the trapper triumphantly i am well convinced there is neither game nor ravenous beast in the thicket and that i call substantial knowledge to a man who is too old to be a spendthrift of his strength and yet who would not wish to be a meal for a panther  the dog interrupted his master by a growl but still kept his head crouched to the earth  it is a man exclaimed the trapper rising it is a man if i am a judge of the creaturs ways there is but little said atwixt the hound and me but we seldom mistake each others meaning  paul hover sprang to his feet like lightning and throwing forward his rifle he cried in a voice of menace  come forward if a friend if an enemy stand ready for the worst  a friend a white man and i hope a christian returned a voice from the thicket which opened at the same instant and at the next the speaker made his appearance     chapter x                       go apart adam and thou shalt hear              how he will shake me up                                                as you like it  it is well known that even long before the immense regions of louisiana changed their masters for the second and as it is to be hoped for the last time its unguarded territory was by no means safe from the inroads of white adventurers the semibarbarous hunters from the canadas the same description of population a little more enlightened from the states and the metiffs or halfbreeds who claimed to be ranked in the class of white men were scattered among the different indian tribes or gleaned a scanty livelihood in solitude amid the haunts of the beaver and the bison or to adopt the popular nomenclature of the country of the buffaloe       in addition to the scientific distinctions which mark the two     species it may be added with due deference to dr battius that a     much more important particular is the fact that while the former     of these animals is delicious and nourishing food the latter is     scarcely edible  it was therefore no unusual thing for strangers to encounter each other in the endless wastes of the west by signs which an unpractised eye would pass unobserved these borderers knew when one of his fellows was in his vicinity and he avoided or approached the intruder as best comported with his feelings or his interests generally these interviews were pacific for the whites had a common enemy to dread in the ancient and perhaps more lawful occupants of the country but instances were not rare in which jealousy and cupidity had caused them to terminate in scenes of the most violent and ruthless treachery the meeting of two hunters on the american desert as we find it convenient sometimes to call this region was consequently somewhat in the suspicious and wary manner in which two vessels draw together in a sea that is known to be infested with pirates while neither party is willing to betray its weakness by exhibiting distrust neither is disposed to commit itself by any acts of confidence from which it may be difficult to recede  such was in some degree the character of the present interview the stranger drew nigh deliberately keeping his eyes steadily fastened on the movements of the other party while he purposely created little difficulties to impede an approach which might prove too hasty on the other hand paul stood playing with the lock of his rifle too proud to let it appear that three men could manifest any apprehension of a solitary individual and yet too prudent to omit entirely the customary precautions the principal reason of the marked difference which the two legitimate proprietors of the banquet made in the receptions of their guests was to be explained by the entire difference which existed in their respective appearances  while the exterior of the naturalist was decidedly pacific not to say abstracted that of the new comer was distinguished by an air of vigour and a front and step which it would not have been difficult to have at once pronounced to be military  he wore a foragecap of fine blue cloth from which depended a soiled tassel in gold and which was nearly buried in a mass of exuberant curling jetblack hair around his throat he had negligently fastened a stock of black silk his body was enveloped in a huntingshirt of dark green trimmed with the yellow fringes and ornaments that were sometimes seen among the bordertroops of the confederacy beneath this however were visible the collar and lapels of a jacket similar in colour and cloth to the cap his lower limbs were protected by buckskin leggings and his feet by the ordinary indian moccasins a richly ornamented and exceedingly dangerous straight dirk was stuck in a sash of red silk network another girdle or rather belt of uncoloured leather contained a pair of the smallest sized pistols in holsters nicely made to fit and across his shoulder was thrown a short heavy military rifle its horn and pouch occupying the usual places beneath his arms at his back he bore a knapsack marked by the well known initials that have since gained for the government of the united states the goodhumoured and quaint appellation of uncle sam  i come in amity the stranger said like one too much accustomed to the sight of arms to be startled at the ludicrously belligerent attitude which dr battius had seen fit to assume i come as a friend and am one whose pursuits and wishes will not at all interfere with your own  harkee stranger said paul hover bluntly do you understand lining a bee from this open place into a wood distant perhaps a dozen miles  the bee is a bird i have never been compelled to seek returned the other laughing though i have too been something of a fowler in my time  i thought as much exclaimed paul thrusting forth his hand frankly and with the true freedom of manner that marks an american borderer let us cross fingers you and i will never quarrel about the comb since you set so little store by the honey and now if your stomach has an empty corner and you know how to relish a genuine dewdrop when it falls into your very mouth there lies the exact morsel to put into it try it stranger and having tried it if you dont call it as snug a fit as you have made sincehow long ar you from the settlements pray  tis many weeks and i fear it may be as many more before i can return i will however gladly profit by your invitation for i have fasted since the rising of yesterdays sun and i know too well the merits of a bisons bump to reject the food  ah you ar acquainted with the dish well therein you have the advantage of me in setting out though i think i may say we could now start on equal ground i should be the happiest fellow between kentucky and the rocky mountains if i had a snug cabin near some old wood that was filled with hollow trees just such a hump every day as that for dinner a load of fresh straw for hives and little el  little what demanded the stranger evidently amused with the communicative and frank disposition of the beehunter  something that i shall have one day and which concerns nobody so much as myself returned paul picking the flint of his rifle and beginning very cavalierly to whistle an air well known on the waters of the mississippi  during this preliminary discourse the stranger had taken his seat by the side of the hump and was already making a serious inroad on its relics dr battius however watched his movements with a jealousy still more striking than the cordial reception which the openhearted paul had just exhibited  but the doubts or rather apprehensions of the naturalist were of a character altogether different from the confidence of the beehunter he had been struck with the strangers using the legitimate instead of the perverted name of the animal off which he was making his repast and as he had been among the foremost himself to profit by the removal of the impediments which the policy of spain had placed in the way of all explorers of her transatlantic dominions whether bent on the purposes of commerce or like himself on the more laudable pursuits of science he had a sufficiency of everyday philosophy to feel that the same motives which had so powerfully urged himself to his present undertaking might produce a like result on the mind of some other student of nature here then was the prospect of an alarming rivalry which bade fair to strip him of at least a moiety of the just rewards of all his labours privations and dangers under these views of his character therefore it is not at all surprising that the native meekness of the naturalists disposition was a little disturbed and that he watched the proceedings of the other with such a degree of vigilance as he believed best suited to detect his sinister designs  this is truly a delicious repast observed the unconscious young stranger for both young and handsome he was fairly entitled to be considered either hunger has given a peculiar relish to the viand or the bison may lay claim to be the finest of the ox family  naturalists sir are apt when they speak familiarly to give the cow the credit of the genus said dr battius swelling with secret distrust and clearing his throat before speaking much in the manner that a duellist examines the point of the weapon he is about to plunge into the body of his foe the figure is more perfect as the bos meaning the ox is unable to perpetuate his kind and the bos in its most extended meaning or vacca is altogether the nobler animal of the two  the doctor uttered this opinion with a certain air that he intended should express his readiness to come at once to any of the numerous points of difference which he doubted not existed between them and he now awaited the blow of his antagonist intending that his next thrust should be still more vigorous but the young stranger appeared much better disposed to partake of the good cheer with which he had been so providentially provided than to take up the cudgels of argument on this or on any other of the knotty points which are so apt to furnish the lovers of science with the materials of a mental joust  i dare say you are very right sir he replied with a most provoking indifference to the importance of the points he conceded i dare say you are quite right and that vacca would have been the better word  pardon me sir you are giving a very wrong construction to my language if you suppose i include without many and particular qualifications the bibulus americanus in the family of the vacca for as you well know siror as i presume i should say doctor you have the medical diploma no doubt  you give me credit for an honour i cannot claim interrupted the other  an undergraduateor perhaps your degrees have been taken in some other of the liberal sciences  still wrong i do assure you  surely young man you have not entered on this importanti may say this awful service without some evidence of your fitness for the task some commission by which you can assert an authority to proceed or by which you may claim an affinity and a communion with your fellowworkers in the same beneficent pursuits  i know not by what means or for what purposes you have made yourself master of my objects exclaimed the youth reddening and rising with a quickness which manifested how little he regarded the grosser appetites when a subject nearer his heart was approached still sir your language is incomprehensible that pursuit which in another might perhaps be justly called beneficent is in me a dear and cherished duty though why a commission should be demanded or needed is i confess no less a subject of surprise  it is customary to be provided with such a document returned the doctor gravely and on all suitable occasions to produce it in order that congenial and friendly minds may at once reject unworthy suspicions and stepping over what may be called the elements of discourse come at once to those points which are desiderata to both  it is a strange request the youth muttered turning his frowning eye from one to the other as if examining the characters of his companions with a view to weigh their physical powers then putting his hand into his bosom he drew forth a small box and extending it with an air of dignity towards the doctor he continuedyou will find by this sir that i have some right to travel in a country which is now the property of the american states  what have we here exclaimed the naturalist opening the folds of a large parchment why this is the signmanual of the philosopher jefferson the seal of state countersigned by the minister of war why this is a commission creating duncan uncas middleton a captain of artillery  of whom of whom repeated the trapper who had sat regarding the stranger during the whole discourse with eyes that seemed greedily to devour each lineament how is the name did you call him uncasuncas was it uncas  such is my name returned the youth a little haughtily it is the appellation of a native chief that both my uncle and myself bear with pride for it is the memorial of an important service done my family by a warrior in the old wars of the provinces  uncas did ye call him uncas repeated the trapper approaching the youth and parting the dark curls which clustered over his brow without the slightest resistance on the part of their wondering owner ah my eyes are old and not so keen as when i was a warrior myself but i can see the look of the father in the son i saw it when he first came nigh but so many things have since passed before my failing sight that i could not name the place where i had met his likeness tell me lad by what name is your father known  he was an officer of the states in the war of the revolution of my own name of course my mothers brother was called duncan uncas heyward  still uncas still uncas echoed the other trembling with eagerness and his father  was called the same without the appellation of the native chief it was to him and to my grandmother that the service of which i have just spoken was rendered  i knowd it i knowd it shouted the old man in his tremulous voice his rigid features working powerfully as if the names the other mentioned awakened some long dormant emotions connected with the events of an anterior age i knowd it son or grandson it is all the same it is the blood and tis the look tell me is he they calld duncan without the uncasis he living  the young man shook his head sorrowfully as he replied in the negative  he died full of days and of honours beloved happy and bestowing happiness  full of days repeated the trapper looking down at his own meagre but still muscular hands ah he livd in the settlements and was wise only after their fashions but you have often seen him and you have heard him discourse of uncas and of the wilderness  often he was then an officer of the king but when the war took place between the crown and her colonies my grandfather did not forget his birthplace but threw off the empty allegiance of names and was true to his proper country he fought on the side of liberty  there was reason in it and what is better there was natur come sit ye down beside me lad sit ye down and tell me of what your grandther used to speak when his mind dwelt on the wonders of the wilderness  the youth smiled no less at the importunity than at the interest manifested by the old man but as he found there was no longer the least appearance of any violence being contemplated he unhesitatingly complied  give it all to the trapper by rule and by figures of speech said paul very coolly taking his seat on the other side of the young soldier it is the fashion of old age to relish these ancient traditions and for that matter i can say that i dont dislike to listen to them myself  middleton smiled again and perhaps with a slight air of derision but goodnaturedly turning to the trapper he continued  it is a long and might prove a painful story bloodshed and all the horrors of indian cruelty and of indian warfare are fearfully mingled in the narrative  ay give it all to us stranger continued paul we are used to these matters in kentuck and i must say i think a story none the worse for having a few scalps in it  but he told you of uncas did he resumed the trapper without regarding the slight interruptions of the beehunter which amounted to no more than a sort of byplay and what thought he and said he of the lad in his parlour with the comforts and ease of the settlements at his elbow  i doubt not he used a language similar to that he would have adopted in the woods and had he stood face to face with his friend  did he call the savage his friend the poor naked painted warrior he was not too proud then to call the indian his friend  he even boasted of the connection and as you have already heard bestowed a name on his firstborn which is likely to be handed down as an heirloom among the rest of his descendants  it was well done like a man ay and like a christian too he used to say the delaware was swift of footdid he remember that  as the antelope indeed he often spoke of him by the appellation of le cerf agile a name he had obtained by his activity  and bold and fearless lad continued the trapper looking up into the eyes of his companion with a wistfulness that bespoke the delight he received in listening to the praises of one whom it was so very evident he had once tenderly loved  brave as a blooded hound without fear he always quoted uncas and his father who from his wisdom was called the great serpent as models of heroism and constancy  he did them justice he did them justice truer men were not to be found in tribe or nation be their skins of what colour they might i see your grandther was just and did his duty too by his offspring twas a perilous time he had of it among them hills and nobly did he play his own part tell me lad or officer i should saysince officer you bewas this all  certainly not it was as i have said a fearful tale full of moving incidents and the memories both of my grandfather and of my grandmother  ah exclaimed the trapper tossing a hand into the air as his whole countenance lighted with the recollections the name revived they called her alice elsie or alice tis all the same a laughing playful child she was when happy and tender and weeping in her misery her hair was shining and yellow as the coat of the young fawn and her skin clearer than the purest water that drips from the rock well do i remember her i remember her right well  the lip of the youth slightly curled and he regarded the old man with an expression which might easily have been construed into a declaration that such were not his own recollections of his venerable and revered ancestor though it would seem he did not think it necessary to say as much in words he was content to answer  they both retained impressions of the dangers they had passed by far too vivid easily to lose the recollection of any of their fellowactors  the trapper looked aside and seemed to struggle with some deeply innate feeling then turning again towards his companion though his honest eyes no longer dwelt with the same open interest as before on the countenance of the other he continued  did he tell you of them all were they all redskins but himself and the daughters of munro  no there was a white man associated with the delawares a scout of the english army but a native of the provinces  a drunken worthless vagabond like most of his colour who harbour with the savages i warrant you  old man your grey hairs should caution you against slander the man i speak of was of great simplicity of mind but of sterling worth unlike most of those who live a border life he united the better instead of the worst qualities of the two people he was a man endowed with the choicest and perhaps rarest gift of nature that of distinguishing good from evil his virtues were those of simplicity because such were the fruits of his habits as were indeed his very prejudices in courage he was the equal of his red associates in warlike skill being better instructed their superior in short he was a noble shoot from the stock of human nature which never could attain its proper elevation and importance for no other reason than because it grew in the forest such old hunter were the very words of my grandfather when speaking of the man you imagine so worthless  the eyes of the trapper had sunk to the earth as the stranger delivered this character in the ardent tones of generous youth he played with the ears of his hound fingered his own rustic garment and opened and shut the pan of his rifle with hands that trembled in a manner that would have implied their total unfitness to wield the weapon when the other had concluded he hoarsely added  your grandther didnt then entirely forget the white man  so far from that there are already three among us who have also names derived from that scout  a name did you say exclaimed the old man starting what the name of the solitary unlarned hunter do the great and the rich and the honoured and what is better still the just do they bear his very actual name  it is borne by my brother and by two of my cousins whatever may be their titles to be described by the terms you have mentioned  do you mean the actual name itself spelt with the very same letters beginning with an n and ending with an l  exactly the same the youth smilingly replied no no we have forgotten nothing that was his i have at this moment a dog brushing a deer not far from this who is come of a hound that very scout sent as a present after his friends and which was of the stock he always used himself a truer breed in nose and foot is not to be found in the wide union  hector said the old man struggling to conquer an emotion that nearly suffocated him and speaking to his hound in the sort of tones he would have used to a child do ye hear that pup your kin and blood are in the prairies a nameit is wonderfulvery wonderful  nature could endure no more overcome by a flood of unusual and extraordinary sensations and stimulated by tender and long dormant recollections strangely and unexpectedly revived the old man had just selfcommand enough to add in a voice that was hollow and unnatural through the efforts he made to command it  boy i am that scout a warrior once a miserable trapper now when the tears broke over his wasted cheeks out of fountains that had long been dried and sinking his face between his knees he covered it decently with his buckskin garment and sobbed aloud  the spectacle produced correspondent emotions in his companions paul hover had actually swallowed each syllable of the discourse as they fell alternately from the different speakers his feelings keeping equal pace with the increasing interest of the scene unused to such strange sensations he was turning his face on every side of him to avoid he knew not what until he saw the tears and heard the sobs of the old man when he sprang to his feet and grappling his guest fiercely by the throat he demanded by what authority he had made his aged companion weep a flash of recollection crossing his brain at the same instant he released his hold and stretching forth an arm in the very wantonness of gratification he seized the doctor by the hair which instantly revealed its artificial formation by cleaving to his hand leaving the white and shining poll of the naturalist with a covering no warmer than the skin  what think you of that mr buggatherer he rather shouted than cried is not this a strange bee to line into his hole  tis remarkable wonderful edifying returned the lover of nature goodhumouredly recovering his wig with twinkling eyes and a husky voice tis rare and commendable though i doubt not in the exact order of causes and effects  with this sudden outbreaking however the commotion instantly subsided the three spectators clustering around the trapper with a species of awe at beholding the tears of one so aged  it must be so or how could he be so familiar with a history that is little known beyond my own family at length the youth observed not ashamed to acknowledge how much he had been affected by unequivocally drying his own eyes  true echoed paul if you want any more evidence i will swear to it i know every word of it myself to be true as the gospel  and yet we had long supposed him dead continued the soldier my grandfather had filled his days with honour and he had believed himself the junior of the two  it is not often that youth has an opportunity of thus looking down on the weakness of age the trapper observed raising his head and looking around him with composure and dignity that i am still here young man is the pleasure of the lord who has spared me until i have seen fourscore long and laborious years for his own secret ends that i am the man i say you need not doubt for why should i go to my grave with so cheap a lie in my mouth  i do not hesitate to believe i only marvel that it should be so but why do i find you venerable and excellent friend of my parents in these wastes so far from the comforts and safety of the lower country  i have come into these plains to escape the sound of the axe for here surely the chopper can never follow but i may put the like question to yourself are you of the party which the states have sent into their new purchase to look after the natur of the bargain they have made  i am not lewis is making his way up the river some hundreds of miles from this i come on a private adventure  though it is no cause of wonder that a man whose strength and eyes have failed him as a hunter should be seen nigh the haunts of the beaver using a trap instead of a rifle it is strange that one so young and prosperous and bearing the commission of the great father should be moving among the prairies without even a campcolourman to do his biddings  you would think my reasons sufficient did you know them as know them you shall if you are disposed to listen to my story i think you all honest and men who would rather aid than betray one bent on a worthy object  come then and tell us at your leisure said the trapper seating himself and beckoning to the youth to follow his example the latter willingly complied and after paul and the doctor had disposed of themselves to their several likings the new comer entered into a narrative of the singular reasons which had led him so far into the deserts     chapter xi                so foul a sky clears not without a storm                                                     king john  in the mean time the industrious and irreclaimable hours continued their labours the sun which had been struggling through such masses of vapour throughout the day fell slowly in a streak of clear sky and thence sunk gloriously into the gloomy wastes as he is wont to settle into the waters of the ocean the vast herds which had been grazing among the wild pastures of the prairies gradually disappeared and the endless flocks of aquatic birds that were pursuing their customary annual journey from the virgin lakes of the north towards the gulf of mexico ceased to fan that air which had now become loaded with dew and vapour in short the shadows of night fell upon the rock adding the mantle of darkness to the other dreary accompaniments of the place  as the light began to fail esther collected her younger children at her side and placing herself on a projecting point of her insulated fortress she sat patiently awaiting the return of the hunters ellen wade was at no great distance seeming to keep a little aloof from the anxious circle as if willing to mark the distinction which existed in their characters  your uncle is and always will be a dull calculator nell observed the mother after a long pause in a conversation that had turned on the labours of the day a lazy hand at figures and foreknowledge is that said ishmael bush here he sat lolloping about the rock from light till noon doing nothing but schemeschemeschemewith seven as noble boys at his elbows as woman ever

what she was saying and it is setting a very bad example to his sons  hoity toity girl who has reared you up as a judge over your elders ay and your betters too i should like to see the man on the whole frontier who sets a more honest example to his children than this same ishmael bush show me if you can miss faultfinder but not faultmender a set of boys who will on occasion sooner chop a piece of logging and dress it for the crop than my own children though i say it myself who perhaps should be silent or a cradler that knows better how to lead a gang of hands through a field of wheat leaving a cleaner stubble in his track than my own good man then as a father he is as generous as a lord for his sons have only to name the spot where they would like to pitch and he gives em a deed of the plantation and no charge for papers is ever made  as the wife of the squatter concluded she raised a hollow taunting laugh that was echoed from the mouths of several juvenile imitators whom she was training to a life as shiftless and lawless as her own but which notwithstanding its uncertainty was not without its secret charms  holloa old eester shouted the wellknown voice of her husband from the plain beneath ar you keeping your junkets while we are finding you in venison and buffaloe beef come downcome down old girl with all your young and lend us a hand to carry up the meatwhy what a frolic you ar in woman come down come down for the boys are at hand and we have work here for double your number  ishmael might have spared his lungs more than a moiety of the effort they were compelled to make in order that he should be heard he had hardly uttered the name of his wife before the whole of the crouching circle rose in a body and tumbling over each other they precipitated themselves down the dangerous passes of the rock with ungovernable impatience esther followed the young fry with a more measured gait nor did ellen deem it wise or rather discreet to remain behind consequently the whole were soon assembled at the base of the citadel on the open plain  here the squatter was found staggering under the weight of a fine fat buck attended by one or two of his younger sons ahiram quickly appeared and before many minutes had elapsed most of the hunters dropped in singly and in pairs each man bringing with him some fruits of his prowess in the field  the plain is free from redskins tonight at least said ishmael after the bustle of reception had a little subsided for i have scoured the prairie for many long miles on my own feet and i call myself a judge of the print of an indian moccasin so old woman you can give us a few steaks of the venison and then we will sleep on the days work  ill not swear there are no savages near us said abiram i too know something of the trail of a redskin and unless my eyes have lost some of their sight i would swear boldly that there ar indians at hand but wait till asa comes in he passd the spot where i found the marks and the boy knows something of such matters too  ay the boy knows too much of many things returned ishmael gloomily it will be better for him when he thinks he knows less but what matters it hetty if all the sioux tribes west of the big river are within a mile of us they will find it no easy matter to scale this rock in the teeth of ten bold men  call em twelve at once ishmael call em twelve cried his termagant assistant for if your mothgathering bughunting friend can be counted a man i beg you will set me down as two i will not turn my back to him with the rifle or the shotgun and for couragethe yearling heifer that them skulking devils the tetons stole was the biggest coward among us all and after her came your drivelling doctor ah ishmael you rarely attempt a regular trade but you come out the loser and this man i reckon is the hardest bargain among them all would you think it the fellow ordered me a blister around my mouth because i complained of a pain in the foot  it is a pity eester the husband coolly answered that you did not take it i reckon it would have done considerable good but boys if it should turn out as ahiram thinks that there are indians near us we may have to scamper up the rock and lose our suppers after all therefore we will make sure of the game and talk over the performances of the doctor when we have nothing better to do  the hint was taken and in a few minutes the exposed situation in which the family was collected was exchanged for the more secure elevation of the rock here esther busied herself working and scolding with equal industry until the repast was prepared when she summoned her husband to his meal in a voice as sonorous as that with which the imam reminds the faithful of a more important duty  when each had assumed his proper and customary place around the smoking viands the squatter set the example by beginning to partake of a delicious venison steak prepared like the hump of the bison with a skill that rather increased than concealed its natural properties a painter would gladly have seized the moment to transfer the wild and characteristic scene to the canvass  the reader will remember that the citadel of ishmael stood insulated lofty ragged and nearly inaccessible a bright flashing fire that was burning on the centre of its summit and around which the busy group was clustered lent it the appearance of some tall pharos placed in the centre of the deserts to light such adventurers as wandered through their broad wastes the flashing flame gleamed from one sunburnt countenance to another exhibiting every variety of expression from the juvenile simplicity of the children mingled as it was with a shade of the wildness peculiar to their semibarbarous lives to the dull and immovable apathy that dwelt on the features of the squatter when unexcited occasionally a gust of wind would fan the embers and as a brighter light shot upwards the little solitary tent was seen as it were suspended in the gloom of the upper air all beyond was enveloped as usual at that hour in an impenetrable body of darkness  it is unaccountable that asa should choose to be out of the way at such a time as this esther pettishly observed when all is finished and to rights we shall have the boy coming up grumbling for his meal and hungry as a bear after his winters nap his stomach is as true as the best clock in kentucky and seldom wants winding up to tell the time whether of day or night a desperate eater is asa when ahungered by a little work  ishmael looked sternly around the circle of his silent sons as if to see whether any among them would presume to say aught in favour of the absent delinquent but now when no exciting causes existed to arouse their slumbering tempers it seemed to be too great an effort to enter on the defence of their rebellious brother abiram however who since the pacification either felt or affected to feel a more generous interest in his late adversary saw fit to express an anxiety to which the others were strangers  it will be well if the boy has escaped the tetons he muttered i should be sorry to have asa who is one of the stoutest of our party both in heart and hand fall into the power of the red devils  look to yourself abiram and spare your breath if you can use it only to frighten the woman and her huddling girls you have whitened the face of ellen wade already who looks as pale as if she was staring today at the very indians you name when i was forced to speak to her through the rifle because i couldnt reach her ears with my tongue how was it nell you have never given the reason of your deafness  the colour of ellens cheek changed as suddenly as the squatters piece had flashed on the occasion to which he alluded the burning glow suffusing her features until it even mantled her throat with its fine healthful tinge she hung her head abashed but did not seem to think it necessary to reply  ishmael too sluggish to pursue the subject or content with the pointed allusion he had just made rose from his seat on the rock and stretching his heavy frame like a wellfed and fattened ox he announced his intention to sleep among a race who lived chiefly for the indulgence of the natural wants such a declaration could not fail of meeting with sympathetic dispositions one after another disappeared each seeking his or her rude dormitory and before many minutes esther who by this time had scolded the younger fry to sleep found herself if we except the usual watchman below in solitary possession of the naked rock  whatever less valuable fruits had been produced in this uneducated woman by her migratory habits the great principle of female nature was too deeply rooted ever to be entirely eradicated of a powerful not to say fierce temperament her passions were violent and difficult to be smothered but however she might and did abuse the accidental prerogatives of her situation love for her offspring while it often slumbered could never be said to become extinct she liked not the protracted absence of asa too fearless herself to have hesitated an instant on her own account about crossing the dark abyss into which she now sat looking with longing eyes her busy imagination in obedience to this inextinguishable sentiment began to conjure nameless evils on account of her son it might be true as abiram had hinted that he had become a captive to some of the tribes who were hunting the buffaloe in that vicinity or even a still more dreadful calamity might have befallen so thought the mother while silence and darkness lent their aid to the secret impulses of nature  agitated by these reflections which put sleep at defiance esther continued at her post listening with that sort of acuteness which is termed instinct in the animals a few degrees below her in the scale of intelligence for any of those noises which might indicate the approach of footsteps at length her wishes had an appearance of being realised for the long desired sounds were distinctly audible and presently she distinguished the dim form of a man at the base of the rock  now asa richly do you deserve to be left with an earthen bed this blessed night the woman began to mutter with a revolution in her feelings that will not be surprising to those who have made the contradictions that give variety to the human character a study and a hard one ive a mind it shall be why abner abner you abner do you sleep let me not see you dare to open the hole till i get down i will know who it is that wishes to disturb a peaceable ay and an honest family too at such a time in the night as this  woman exclaimed a voice that intended to bluster while the speaker was manifestly a little apprehensive of the consequences woman i forbid you on pain of the law to project any of your infernal missiles i am a citizen and a freeholder and a graduate of two universities and i stand upon my rights beware of malice prepense of chancemedley and of manslaughter it is iyour amicus a friend and inmate idr obed battius  who demanded esther in a voice that nearly refused to convey her words to the ears of the anxious listener beneath did you say it was not asa  nay i am neither asa nor absalom nor any of the hebrew princes but obed the root and stock of them all have i not said woman that you keep one in attendance who is entitled to a peaceable as well as an honourable admission do you take me for an animal of the class amphibia and that i can play with my lungs as a blacksmith does with his bellows  the naturalist might have expended his breath much longer without producing any desirable result had esther been his only auditor disappointed and alarmed the woman had already sought her pallet and was preparing with a sort of desperate indifference to compose herself to sleep abner the sentinel below however had been aroused from an exceedingly equivocal situation by the outcry and as he had now regained sufficient consciousness to recognise the voice of the physician the latter was admitted with the least possible delay dr battius bustled through the narrow entrance with an air of singular impatience and was already beginning to mount the difficult ascent when catching a view of the porter he paused to observe with an air that he intended should be impressively admonitory  abner there are dangerous symptoms of somnolency about thee it is sufficiently exhibited in the tendency to hiation and may prove dangerous not only to yourself but to all thy fathers family  you never made a greater mistake doctor returned the youth gaping like an indolent lion i havent a symptom as you call it about any part of me and as to father and the children i reckon the smallpox and the measles have been thoroughly through the breed these many months ago  content with his brief admonition the naturalist had surmounted half the difficulties of the ascent before the deliberate abner ended his justification on the summit obed fully expected to encounter esther of whose linguacious powers he had too often been furnished with the most sinister reproofs and of which he stood in an awe too salutary to covet a repetition of the attacks the reader can foresee that he was to be agreeably disappointed treading lightly and looking timidly over his shoulder as if he apprehended a shower of something even more formidable than words the doctor proceeded to the place which had been allotted to himself in the general disposition of the dormitories  instead of sleeping the worthy naturalist sat ruminating over what he had both seen and heard that day until the tossing and mutterings which proceeded from the cabin of esther who was his nearest neighbour advertised him of the wakeful situation of its inmate perceiving the necessity of doing something to disarm this female cerberus before his own purpose could be accomplished the doctor reluctant as he was to encounter her tongue found himself compelled to invite a colloquial communication  you appear not to sleep my very kind and worthy mrs bush he said determined to commence his applications with a plaster that was usually found to adhere you appear to rest badly my excellent hostess can i administer to your ailings  what would you give me man grumbled esther a blister to make me sleep  say rather a cataplasm but if you are in pain here are some cordial drops which taken in a glass of my own cognac will give you rest if i know aught of the materia medica  the doctor as he very well knew had assailed esther on her weak side and as he doubted not of the acceptable quality of his prescription he sat himself at work without unnecessary delay to prepare it when he made his offering it was received in a snappish and threatening manner but swallowed with a facility that sufficiently proclaimed how much it was relished the woman muttered her thanks and her leech reseated himself in silence to await the operation of the dose in less than half an hour the breathing of esther became so profound and as the doctor himself might have termed it so very abstracted that had he not known how easy it was to ascribe this new instance of somnolency to the powerful dose of opium with which he had garnished the brandy he might have seen reason to distrust his own prescription with the sleep of the restless woman the stillness became profound and general  then dr battius saw fit to arise with the silence and caution of the midnight robber and to steal out of his own cabin or rather kennel for it deserved no better name towards the adjoining dormitories here he took time to assure himself that all his neighbours were buried in deep sleep once advised of this important fact he hesitated no longer but commenced the difficult ascent which led to the upper pinnacle of the rock his advance though abundantly guarded was not entirely noiseless but while he was felicitating himself on having successfully effected his object and he was in the very act of placing his foot on the highest ledge a hand was laid upon the skirts of his coat which as effectually put an end to his advance as if the gigantic strength of ishmael himself had pinned him to the earth  is there sickness in the tent whispered a soft voice in his very ear that dr battius is called to visit it at such an hour  so soon as the heart of the naturalist had returned from its hasty expedition into his throat as one less skilled than dr battius in the formation of the animal would have been apt to have accounted for the extraordinary sensation with which he received this unlookedfor interruption he found resolution to reply using as much in terror as in prudence the same precaution in the indulgence of his voice  my worthy nelly i am greatly rejoiced to find it is no other than thee hist child hist should ishmael gain a knowledge of our plans he would not hesitate to cast us both from this rock upon the plain beneath hist nelly hist  as the doctor delivered his injunctions between the intervals of his ascent by the time they were concluded both he and his auditor had gained the upper level  and now dr battius the girl gravely demanded may i know the reason why you have run so great a risk of flying from this place without wings and at the certain expense of your neck  nothing shall be concealed from thee worthy and trusty nellybut are you certain that ishmael will not awake  no fear of him he will sleep until the sun scorches his eyelids the danger is from my aunt  esther sleepeth the doctor sententiously replied ellen you have been watching on this rock today  i was ordered to do so  and you have seen the bison and the antelope and the wolf and the deer as usual animals of the orders pecora belluae and ferae  i have seen the creatures you named in english but i know nothing of the indian languages  there is still an order that i have not named which you have also seen the primatesis it not true  i cannot say i know no animal by that name  nay ellen you confer with a friend of the genus homo child  whatever else i may have had in view i have not seen the vespertilio horribi  hush nelly thy vivacity will betray us tell me girl have you not seen certain bipeds called men wandering about the prairies  surely my uncle and his sons have been hunting the buffaloe since the sun began to fall  i must speak in the vernacular to be comprehended ellen i would say of the species kentucky  though ellen reddened like the rose her blushes were concealed by the darkness she hesitated an instant and then summoned sufficient spirit to say decidedly  if you wish to speak in parables doctor battius you must find another listener put your questions plainly in english and i will answer them honestly in the same tongue  i have been journeying in this desert as thou knowest nelly in quest of animals that have been hidden from the eyes of science until now among others i have discovered a primates of the genus homo species kentucky which i term paul  hist for the sake of mercy said ellen speak lower doctor or we shall be ruined  hover by profession a collector of the apes or bee continued the other do i use the vernacular nowam i understood  perfectly perfectly returned the girl breathing with difficulty in her surprise but what of him did he tell you to mount this rockhe knows nothing himself for the oath i gave my uncle has shut my mouth  ay but there is one that has taken no oath who has revealed all i would that the mantle which is wrapped around the mysteries of nature were as effectually withdrawn from its hidden treasures ellen ellen the man with whom i have unwittingly formed a compactum or agreement is sadly forgetful of the obligations of honesty thy uncle child  you mean ishmael bush my fathers brothers widows husband returned the offended girl a little proudlyindeed indeed it is cruel to reproach me with a tie that chance has formed and which i would rejoice so much to break for ever  the humbled ellen could utter no more but sinking on a projection of the rock she began to sob in a manner that rendered their situation doubly critical the doctor muttered a few words which he intended as an apologetic explanation but before he had time to complete his laboured vindication she arose and said with decision  i did not come here to pass my time in foolish tears nor you to try to stop them what then has brought you hither  i must see the inmate of that tent  you know what it contains  i am taught to believe i do and i bear a letter which i must deliver with my own hands if the animal prove a quadruped ishmael is a true manif a biped fledged or unfledged i care not he is false and our compactum at an end  ellen made a sign for the doctor to remain where he was and to be silent she then glided into the tent where she continued many minutes that proved exceedingly weary and anxious to the expectant without but the instant she returned she took him by the arm and together they entered beneath the folds of the mysterious cloth     chapter xii                pray god the duke of york excuse himself                                                 king henry vi  the mustering of the borderers on the following morning was silent sullen and gloomy the repast of that hour was wanting in the inharmonious accompaniment with which esther ordinarily enlivened their meals for the effects of the powerful opiate the doctor had administered still muddled her intellects the young men brooded over the absence of their elder brother and the brows of ishmael himself were knit as he cast his scowling eyes from one to the other like a man preparing to meet and to repel an expected assault on his authority in the midst of this family distrust ellen and her midnight confederate the naturalist took their usual places among the children without awakening suspicion or exciting comment the only apparent fruits of the adventure in which they had been engaged were occasional upliftings of the eyes on the part of the doctor which were mistaken by the observers for some of his scientific contemplations of the heavens but which in reality were no other than furtive glances at the fluttering walls of the proscribed tent  at length the squatter who had waited in vain for some more decided manifestation of the expected rising among his sons resolved to make a demonstration of his own intentions  asa shall account to me for this undutiful conduct he observed here has the livelong night gone by and he outlying on the prairie when his hand and his rifle might both have been wanted in a brush with the siouxes for any right he had to know the contrary  spare your breath good man retorted his wife be saving of your breath for you may have to call long enough for the boy before he will answer  it ar a fact that some men be so womanish as to let the young master the old but you old esther should know better than to think such will ever be the nature of things in the family of ishmael bush  ah you are a hectorer with the boys when need calls i know it well ishmael and one of your sons have you driven from you by your temper and that too at a time when he is most wanted  father said abner whose sluggish nature had gradually been stimulating itself to the exertion of taking so bold a stand the boys and i have pretty generally concluded to go out on the search of asa we are disagreeable about his camping on the prairie instead of coming in to his own bed as we all know he would like to do  pshaw muttered abiram the boy has killed a buck or perhaps a buffaloe and he is sleeping by the carcass to keep off the wolves till day we shall soon see him or hear him bawling for help to bring in his load  tis little help that a son of mine will call for to shoulder a buck or to quarter your wildbeef returned the mother and you abiram to say so uncertain a thing you who said yourself that the redskins had been prowling around this place no later than the yesterday  i exclaimed her brother hastily as if anxious to retract an error i said it then and i say it now and so you will find it to be the tetons are in our neighbourhood and happy will it prove for the boy if he is well shut of them  it seems to me said dr battius speaking with the sort of deliberation and dignity one is apt to use after having thoroughly ripened his opinions by sufficient reflectionit seems to me a man but little skilled in the signs and tokens of indian warfare especially as practised in these remote plains but one who i may say without vanity has some insight into the mysteries of natureit seems then to me thus humbly qualified that when doubts exist in a matter of moment it would always be the wisest course to appease them  no more of your doctoring for me cried the grum esther no more of your quiddities in a healthy family say i here was i doing well only a little out of sorts with over instructing the young and you dosd me with a drug that hangs about my tongue like a pound weight on a hummingbirds wing  is the medicine out drily demanded ishmael it must be a rare dose that gives a heavy feel to the tongue of old eester  friend continued the doctor waving his hand for the angry wife to maintain the peace that it cannot perform all that is said of it the very charge of good mrs bush is a sufficient proof but to speak of the absent asa there is doubt as to his fate and there is a proposition to solve it now in the natural sciences truth is always a desideratum and i confess it would seem to be equally so in the present case of domestic uncertainty which may be called a vacuum where according to the laws of physic there should exist some pretty palpable proofs of materiality  dont mind him dont mind him cried esther observing that the rest of his auditors listened with an attention which might proceed equally from acquiescence in his proposal or ignorance of its meaning there is a drug in every word he utters  dr battius wishes to say ellen modestly interposed that as some of us think asa is in danger and some think otherwise the whole family might pass an hour or two in looking for him  does he interrupted the woman then dr battius has more sense in him than i believed she is right ishmael and what she says shall be done i will shoulder a rifle myself and woe betide the redskin that crosses my path i have pulled a trigger before today ay and heard an indian yell too to my sorrow  the spirit of esther diffused itself like the stimulus which attends a warcry among her sons they arose in a body and declared their determination to second so bold a resolution ishmael prudently yielded to an impulse he could not resist and in a few minutes the woman appeared shouldering her arms prepared to lead forth in person such of her descendants as chose to follow  let them stay with the children that please she said and them follow me who ar not chickenhearted  abiram it will not do to leave the huts without some guard ishmael whispered glancing his eye upward  the man whom he addressed started and betrayed extraordinary eagerness in his reply  i will tarry and watch the camp  a dozen voices were instantly raised in objections to this proposal he was wanted to point out the places where the hostile tracks had been seen and his termagant sister openly scouted at the idea as unworthy of his manhood the reluctant abiram was compelled to yield and ishmael made a new disposition for the defence of the place which was admitted by every one to be allimportant to their security and comfort  he offered the post of commandant to dr battius who however peremptorily and somewhat haughtily declined the doubtful honour exchanging looks of intelligence with ellen as he did so in this dilemma the squatter was obliged to constitute the girl herself castellan taking care however in deputing this important trust to omit no words of caution and instruction when this preliminary point was settled the young men proceeded to arrange certain means of defence and signals of alarm that were adapted to the weakness and character of the garrison several masses of rock were drawn to the edge of the upper level and so placed as to leave it at the discretion of the feeble ellen and her associates to cast them or not as they might choose on the heads of any invaders who would of necessity be obliged to mount the eminence by the difficult and narrow passage already so often mentioned in addition to this formidable obstruction the barriers were strengthened and rendered nearly impassable smaller missiles that might be hurled even by the hands of the younger children but which would prove from the elevation of the place exceedingly dangerous were provided in profusion a pile of dried leaves and splinters were placed as a beacon on the upper rock and then even in the jealous judgment of the squatter the post was deemed competent to maintain a creditable siege  the moment the rock was thought to be in a state of sufficient security the party who composed what might be called the sortie sallied forth on their anxious expedition the advance was led by esther in person who attired in a dress half masculine and bearing a weapon like the rest seemed no unfit leader for the group of wildly clad frontiermen that followed in her rear  now abiram cried the amazon in a voice that was cracked and harsh for the simple reason of being used too often on a strained and unnatural key now abiram run with your nose low show yourself a hound of the true breed and do some credit to your training you it was that saw the prints of the indian moccasin and it behoves you to let others be as wise as yourself come come to the front man and give us a bold lead  the brother who appeared at all times to stand in awe of his sisters authority complied though it was with a reluctance so evident as to excite sneers even among the unobservant and indolent sons of the squatter ishmael himself moved among his tall children like one who expected nothing from the search and who was indifferent alike to its success or failure in this manner the party proceeded until their distant fortress had sunk so low as to present an object no larger nor more distinct than a hazy point on the margin of the prairie hitherto their progress had been silent and somewhat rapid for as swell after swell was mounted and passed without varying or discovering a living object to enliven the monotony of the view even the tongue of esther was hushed in increasing anxiety here however ishmael chose to pause and casting the butt of his rifle from his shoulder to the ground he observed  this is enough buffaloe signs and deer signs ar plenty but where ar thy indian footsteps abiram  still farther west returned the other pointing in the direction he named this was the spot where i struck the tracks of the buck it was after i took the deer that i fell upon the teton trail  and a bloody piece of work you made of it man cried the squatter pointing tauntily to the soiled garments of his kinsman and then directing the attention of the spectators to his own by the way of a triumphant contrast here have i cut the throats of two lively does and a scampering fawn without spot or stain while you blundering dog as you ar have made as much work for eester and her girls as though butchering was your regular calling come boys it is enough i am too old not to know the signs of the frontiers no indian has been here since the last fall of water follow me and i will make a turn that shall give us at least the beef of a fallow cow for our trouble  follow me echoed esther stepping undauntedly forward i am leader today and i will be followed who so proper let me know as a mother to head a search for her own lost child  ishmael regarded his intractable mate with a smile of indulgent pity observing that she had already struck out a path for herself different both from that of abiram and the one he had seen fit to choose and being unwilling to draw the cord of authority too tight just at that moment he submitted to her will but dr battius who had hitherto been a silent and thoughtful attendant on the woman now saw fit to raise his feeble voice in the way of remonstrance  i agree with thy partner in life worthy and gentle mrs bush he said in believing that some ignis fatuus of the imagination has deceived abiram in the signs or symptoms of which he has spoken  symptoms yourself interrupted the termagant this is no time for bookish words nor is this a place to stop and swallow medicines if you are alegweary say so as a plainspeaking man should then seat yourself on the prairie like a hound that is footsore and take your natural rest  i accord in the opinion the naturalist calmly replied complying literally with the opinion of the deriding esther by taking his seat very coolly by the side of an indigenous shrub the examination of which he commenced on the instant in order that science might not loose any of its just and important dues i honour your excellent advice mistress esther as you may perceive go thou in quest of thy offspring while i tarry here in pursuit of that which is better viz an insight into the arcana of natures volume  the woman answered with a hollow unnatural and scornful laugh and even her heavy sons as they slowly passed the seat of the already abstracted naturalist did not disdain to manifest their contempt in smiles in a few minutes the train mounted the nearest eminence and as it turned the rounded acclivity the doctor was left to pursue his profitable investigations in entire solitude  another halfhour passed during which esther continued to advance on her seemingly fruitless search her pauses however were becoming frequent and her looks wandering and uncertain when footsteps were heard clattering through the bottom and at the next instant a buck was seen to bound up the ascent and to dart from before their eyes in the direction of the naturalist so sudden and unlooked for had been the passage of the animal and so much had he been favoured by the shape of the ground that before any one of the foresters had time to bring his rifle to his shoulder it was already beyond the range of a bullet  look out for the wolf shouted abner shaking his head in vexation at being a single moment too late a wolfs skin will be no bad gift in a winters night ay yonder the hungry devil comes  hold cried ishmael knocking up the levelled weapon of his too eager son tis not a wolf but a hound of thorough blood and bottom ha we have hunters nigh there ar two of them  he was still speaking when the animals in question came leaping on the track of the deer striving with noble ardour to outdo each other one was an aged dog whose strength seemed to be sustained purely by generous emulation and the other a pup that gambolled even while he pressed most warmly on the chase they both ran however with clean and powerful leaps carrying their noses high like animals of the most keen and subtle scent they had passed and in another minute they would have been running openmouthed with the deer in view had not the younger dog suddenly bounded from the course and uttered a cry of surprise his aged companion stopped also and returned panting and exhausted to the place where the other was whirling around in swift and apparently in mad evolutions circling the spot in his own footsteps and continuing his outcry in a short snappish barking but when the elder hound had reached the spot he seated himself and lifting his nose high into the air he raised a long loud and wailing howl  it must be a strong scent said abner who had been with the rest of the family an admiring observer of the movements of the dogs that can break off two such creaturs so suddenly from their trail  murder them cried abiram ill swear to the old hound tis the dog of the trapper whom we now know to be our mortal enemy  though the brother of esther gave so hostile advice he appeared in no way ready to put it in execution himself the surprise which had taken possession of the whole party exhibited itself in his own vacant wondering stare as strongly as in any of the admiring visages by whom he was surrounded his denunciation therefore notwithstanding its dire import was disregarded and the dogs were left to obey the impulses of their mysterious instinct without let or hinderance  it was long before any of the spectators broke the silence but the squatter at length so far recollected his authority as to take on himself the right to control the movements of his children  come away boys come away and leave the hounds to sing their tunes for their own amusement ishmael said in his coldest manner i scorn to take the life of a beast because its master has pitched himself too nigh my clearing come away boys come away we have enough of our own work before us without turning aside to do that of the whole neighbourhood  come not away cried esther in tones that sounded like the admonitions of some sibyl i say come not away my children there is a meaning and a warning in this and as i am a woman and a mother will i know the truth of it all  so saying the awakened wife brandished her weapon with an air that was not without its wild and secret influence and led the way towards the spot where the dogs still remained filling the air with their longdrawn and piteous complaints the whole party followed in her steps some too indolent to oppose others obedient to her will and all more or less excited by the uncommon character of the scene  tell me you abnerabiramishmael the woman cried standing over a spot where the earth was trampled and beaten and plainly sprinkled with blood tell me you who ar hunters what sort of animal has here met his deathspeakye ar men and used to the signs of the plains is it the blood of wolf or panther  a buffaloeand a noble and powerful creatur has it been returned the squatter who looked down calmly on the fatal signs which so strangely affected his wife here are the marks of the spot where he has struck his hoofs into the earth in the deathstruggle and yonder he has plunged and torn the ground with his horns ay a buffaloe bull of wonderful strength and courage has he been  and who has slain him continued esther man where are the offalswolvesthey devour not the hide tell me ye men and hunters is this the blood of a beast  the creatur has plunged over the hillock said abner who had proceeded a short distance beyond the rest of the party ah there you will find it in yon swale of alders look a thousand carrion birds ar hovering above the carcass  the animal has still life in him returned the squatter or the buzzards would settle upon their prey by the action of the dogs it must be something ravenous i reckon it is the white bear from the upper falls they are said to cling desperately to life  let us go back said abiram there may be danger and there can be no good in attacking a ravenous beast remember ishmael twill be a risky job and one of small profit  the young men smiled at this new proof of the well known pusillanimity of their uncle the oldest even proceeded so far as to express his contempt by bluntly saying  it will do to cage with the other animal we carry then we may go back doublehanded into the settlements and set up for showmen around the courthouses and gaols of kentucky  the threatening frown which gathered on the brow of his father admonished the young man to forbear exchanging looks that were half rebellious with his brethren he saw fit to be silent but instead of observing the caution recommended by abiram they proceeded in a body until they again came to a halt within a few yards of the matted cover of the thicket  the scene had now indeed become wild and striking enough to have produced a powerful effect on minds better prepared than those of the unnurtured family of the squatter to resist the impressions of so exciting a spectacle the heavens were as usual at the season covered with dark driving clouds beneath which interminable flocks of aquatic birds were again on the wing holding their toilsome and heavy way towards the distant waters of the south the wind had risen and was once more sweeping over the prairie in gusts which it was often vain to oppose and then again the blasts would seem to mount into the upper air as if to sport with the drifting vapour whirling and rolling vast masses of the dusky and ragged volumes over each other in a terrific and yet grand disorder above the little brake the flocks of birds still held their flight circling with heavy wings about the spot struggling at times against the torrent of wind and then favoured by their position and height making bold swoops upon the thicket away from which however they never failed to sail screaming in terror as if apprised either by sight or instinct that the hour of their voracious dominion had not yet fully arrived  ishmael stood for many minutes with his wife and children clustered together in an amazement with which awe was singularly mingled gazing in deathlike stillness on the sight the voice of esther at length broke the charm and reminded the spectators of the necessity of resolving their doubts in some manner more worthy of their manhood than by dull and inactive observation  call in the dogs she said call in the hounds and put them into the thicket there ar men enough of ye if ye have not lost the spirit with which i know ye were born to tame the tempers of all the bears west of the big river call in the dogs i say you enoch abner gabriel has wonder made ye deaf  one of the young men complied and having succeeded in detaching the hounds from the place around which until then they had not ceased to hover he led them down to the margin of the thicket  put them in boy put them in continued the woman and you ishmael and abiram if any thing wicked or hurtful comes forth show them the use of your rifles like frontiermen if ye ar wanting in spirit before the eyes of my children will i put ye both to shame  the youths who until now had detained the hounds let slip the thongs of skin by which they had been held and urged them to the attack by their voices but it would seem that the elder dog was restrained by some extraordinary sensation or that he was much too experienced to attempt the rash adventure after proceeding a few yards to the very verge of the brake he made a sudden pause and stood trembling in all his aged limbs apparently as unable to recede as to advance the encouraging calls of the young men were disregarded or only answered by a low and plaintive whining for a minute the pup also was similarly affected but less sage or more easily excited he was induced at length to leap forward and finally to dash into the cover an alarmed and startling howl was heard and at the next minute he broke out of the thicket and commenced circling the spot in the same wild and unsteady manner as before  have i a man among my children demanded esther give me a truer piece than a childish shotgun and i will show ye what the courage of a frontierwoman can do  stay mother exclaimed abner and enoch if you will see the creatur let us drive it into view  this was quite as much as the youths were accustomed to utter even on more important occasions but having given a pledge of their intentions they were far from being backward in redeeming it preparing their arms with the utmost care they advanced with steadiness to the brake nerves less often tried than those of the young borderers might have shrunk before the dangers of so uncertain an undertaking as they proceeded the howls of the dogs became more shrill and plaintive the vultures and buzzards settled so low as to flap the bushes with their heavy wings and the wind came hoarsely sweeping along the naked prairie as if the spirits of the air had also descended to witness the approaching development  there was a breathless moment when the blood of the undaunted esther flowed backward to her heart as she saw her sons push aside the matted branches of the thicket and bury themselves in its labyrinth a deep and solemn pause succeeded then arose two loud and piercing cries in quick succession which were followed by a quiet still more awful and appalling  come back come back my children cried the woman the feelings of a mother getting the ascendency  but her voice was hushed and every faculty seemed frozen with horror as at that instant the bushes once more parted and the two adventurers reappeared pale and nearly insensible themselves and laid at her feet the stiff and motionless body of the lost asa with the marks of a violent death but too plainly stamped on every pallid lineament  the dogs uttered a long and closing howl and then breaking off together they disappeared on the forsaken trail of the deer the flight of birds wheeled upward into the heavens filling the air with their complaints at having been robbed of a victim which frightful and disgusting as it was still bore too much of the impression of humanity to become the prey of their obscene appetites     chapter xiii                     a pickaxe and a spade a spade                    forand a shrouding sheet                    o a pit of clay for to be made                    for such a guest is meet                                                song in hamlet  stand back stand off the whole of ye said esther hoarsely to the crowd which pressed too closely on the corpse i am his mother and my right is better than that of ye all who has done this tell me ishmael abiram abner open your mouths and your hearts and let gods truth and no other issue from them who has done this bloody deed  her husband made no reply but stood leaning on his rifle looking sadly but with an unaltered eye at the mangled remains of his son not so the mother she threw herself on the earth and receiving the cold and ghastly head into her lap she sat contemplating those muscular features on which the deathagony was still horridly impressed in a silence far more expressive than any language of lamentation could have proved  the voice of the woman was frozen in grief in vain ishmael attempted a few words of rude consolation she neither listened nor answered her sons gathered about her in a circle and expressed after their uncouth manner their sympathy in her sorrow as well as their sense of their own loss but she motioned them away impatiently with her hand at times her fingers played in the matted hair of the dead and at others they lightly attempted to smooth the painfully expressive muscles of its ghastly visage as the hand of the mother is seen lingering fondly about the features of her sleeping child then starting from their revolting office her hands would flutter around her and seem to seek some fruitless remedy against the violent blow which had thus suddenly destroyed the child in whom she had not only placed her greatest hopes but so much of her maternal pride while engaged in the latter incomprehensible manner the lethargic abner turned aside and swallowing the unwonted emotions which were rising in his own throat he observed  mother means that we should look for the signs that we may know in what manner asa has come by his end  we owe it to the accursed siouxes answered ishmael twice have they put me deeply in their debt the third time the score shall be cleared  but not content with this plausible explanation and perhaps secretly glad to avert their eyes from a spectacle which awakened so extraordinary and unusual sensations in their sluggish bosoms the sons of the squatter turned away in a body from their mother and the corpse and proceeded to make the enquiries which they fancied the former had so repeatedly demanded ishmael made no objections but though he accompanied his children while they proceeded in the investigation it was more with the appearance of complying with their wishes at a time when resistance might not be seemly than with any visible interest in the result as the borderers notwithstanding their usual dulness were well instructed in most things connected with their habits of life an enquiry the success of which depended so much on signs and evidences that bore so strong a resemblance to a forest trail was likely to be conducted with skill and acuteness accordingly they proceeded to the melancholy task with great readiness and intelligence  abner and enoch agreed in their accounts as to the position in which they had found the body it was seated nearly upright the back supported by a mass of matted brush and one hand still grasping a broken twig of the alders it was most probably owing to the former circumstance that the body had escaped the rapacity of the carrion birds which had been seen hovering above the thicket and the latter proved that life had not yet entirely abandoned the hapless victim when he entered the brake the opinion now became general that the youth had received his deathwound in the open prairie and had dragged his enfeebled form into the cover of the thicket for the purpose of concealment a trail through the bushes confirmed this opinion it also appeared on examination that a desperate struggle had taken place on the very margin of the thicket this was sufficiently apparent by the trodden branches the deep impressions on the moist ground and the lavish flow of blood  he has been shot in the open ground and come here for a cover said abiram these marks would clearly prove it the boy has been set upon by the savages in a body and has fout like a hero as he was until they have mastered his strength and then drawn him to the bushes  to this probable opinion there was now but one dissenting voice that of the slowminded ishmael who demanded that the corpse itself should be examined in order to obtain a more accurate knowledge of its injuries on examination it appeared that a rifle bullet had passed directly through the body of the deceased entering beneath one of his brawny shoulders and making its exit by the breast it required some knowledge in gunshot wounds to decide this delicate point but the experience of the borderers was quite equal to the scrutiny and a smile of wild and certainly of singular satisfaction passed among the sons of ishmael when abner confidently announced that the enemies of asa had assailed him in the rear  it must be so said the gloomy but attentive squatter he was of too good a stock and too well trained knowingly to turn the weak side to man or beast remember boys that while the front of manhood is to your enemy let him be who or what he may you ar safe from cowardly surprise why eester woman you ar getting beside yourself with picking at the hair and the garments of the child little good can you do him now old girl  see interrupted enoch extricating from the fragments of cloth the morsel of lead which had prostrated the strength of one so powerful here is the very bullet  ishmael took it in his hand and eyed it long and closely  theres no mistake at length he muttered through his compressed teeth it is from the pouch of that accursed trapper like many of the hunters he has a mark in his mould in order to know the work his rifle performs and here you see it plainlysix little holes laid crossways  ill swear to it cried abiram triumphantly he showd me his private mark himself and boasted of the number of deer he had laid upon the prairies with these very bullets now ishmael will you believe me when i tell you the old knave is a spy of the redskins  the lead passed from the hand of one to that of another and unfortunately for the reputation of the old man several among them remembered also to have seen the aforesaid private bulletmarks during the curious examination which all had made of his accoutrements in addition to this wound however were many others of a less dangerous nature all of which were supposed to confirm the supposed guilt of the trapper  the traces of many different struggles were to be seen between the spot where the first blood was spilt and the thicket to which it was now generally believed asa had retreated as a place of refuge these were interpreted into so many proofs of the weakness of the murderer who would have sooner despatched his victim had not even the dying strength of the youth rendered him formidable to the infirmities of one so old the danger of drawing some others of the hunters to the spot by repeated firing was deemed a sufficient reason for not again resorting to the rifle after it had performed the important duty of disabling the victim the weapon of the dead man was not to be found and had doubtless together with many other less valuable and lighter articles that he was accustomed to carry about his person become a prize to his destroyer  but what in addition to the telltale bullet appeared to fix the ruthless deed with peculiar certainty on the trapper was the accumulated evidence furnished by the trail which proved notwithstanding his deadly hurt that the wounded man had still been able to make a long and desperate resistance to the subsequent efforts of his murderer ishmael seemed to press this proof with a singular mixture of sorrow and pride sorrow at the loss of a son whom in their moments of amity he highly valued and pride at the courage and power he had manifested to his last and weakest breath  he died as a son of mine should die said the squatter gleaning a hollow consolation from so unnatural an exultation a dread to his enemy to the last and without help from the law come children we have the grave to make and then to hunt his murderer  the sons of the squatter set about their melancholy office in silence and in sadness an excavation was made in the hard earth at a great expense of toil and time and the body was wrapped in such spare vestments as could be collected among the labourers when these arrangements were completed ishmael approached the seemingly unconscious esther and announced his intention to inter the dead she heard him and quietly relinquished her grasp of the corpse rising in silence to follow it to its narrow resting place here she seated herself again at the head of the grave watching each movement of the youths with eager and jealous eyes when a sufficiency of earth was laid upon the senseless clay of asa to protect it from injury enoch and abner entered the cavity and trode it into a solid mass by the weight of their huge frames with an appearance of a strange not to say savage mixture of care and indifference this wellknown precaution was adopted to prevent the speedy exhumation of the body by some of the carnivorous beasts of the prairie whose instinct was sure to guide them to the spot even the rapacious birds appeared to comprehend the nature of the ceremony for mysteriously apprised that the miserable victim was now about to be abandoned by the human race they once more began to make their airy circuits above the place screaming as if to frighten the kinsmen from their labour of caution and love  ishmael stood with folded arms steadily watching the manner in which this necessary duty was performed and when the whole was completed he lifted his cap to his sons to thank them for their services with a dignity that would have become one much better nurtured throughout the whole of a ceremony which is ever solemn and admonitory the squatter had maintained a grave and serious deportment his vast features were visibly stamped with an expression of deep concern but at no time did they falter until he turned his back as he believed for ever on the grave of his firstborn nature was then stirring powerfully within him and the muscles of his stern visage began to work perceptibly his children fastened their eyes on his as if to seek a direction to the strange emotions which were moving their own heavy natures when the struggle in the bosom of the squatter suddenly ceased and taking his wife by the arm he raised her to her feet as if she had been an infant saying in a voice that was perfectly steady though a nice observer would have discovered that it was kinder than usual  eester we have now done all that man and woman can do we raised the boy and made him such as few others were like on the frontiers of america and we have given him a grave let us go our way  the woman turned her eyes slowly from the fresh earth and laying her hands on the shoulders of her husband stood looking him anxiously in the eyes  ishmael ishmael she said you parted from the boy in your wrath  may the lord pardon his sins freely as i have forgiven his worst misdeeds calmly returned the squatter woman go you back to the rock and read your bible a chapter in that book always does you good you can read eester which is a privilege i never did enjoy  yes yes muttered the woman yielding to his strength and suffering herself to be led though with strong reluctance from the spot i can read and how have i used the knowledge but he ishmael he has not the sin of wasted larning to answer for we have spared him that at least whether it be in mercy or in cruelty i know not  her husband made no reply but continued steadily to lead her in the direction of their temporary abode when they reached the summit of the swell of land which they knew was the last spot from which the situation of the grave of asa could be seen they all turned as by common concurrence to take a farewell view of the place the little mound itself was not visible but it was frightfully indicated by the flock of screaming birds which hovered above in the opposite direction a low blue hillock in the skirts of the horizon pointed out the place where esther had left the rest of her young and served as an attraction to draw her reluctant steps from the last abode of her eldest born nature quickened in the bosom of the mother at the sight and she finally yielded the rights of the dead to the more urgent claims of the living  the foregoing occurrences had struck a spark from the stern tempers of a set of beings so singularly moulded in the habits of their uncultivated lives which served to keep alive among them the dying embers of family affection united to their parents by ties no stronger than those which use had created there had been great danger as ishmael had foreseen that the overloaded hive would swarm and leave him saddled with the difficulties of a young and helpless brood unsupported by the exertions of those whom he had already brought to a state of maturity the spirit of insubordination which emanated from the unfortunate asa had spread among his juniors and the squatter had been made painfully to remember the time when in the wantonness of his youth and vigour he had reversing the order of the brutes cast off his own aged and failing parents to enter into the world unshackled and free but the danger had now abated for a time at least and if his authority was not restored with all its former influence it was admitted to exist and to maintain its ascendency a little longer  it is true that his slowminded sons even while they submitted to the impressions of the recent event had glimmerings of terrible distrusts as to the manner in which their elder brother had met with his death there were faint and indistinct images in the minds of two or three of the oldest which portrayed the father himself as ready to imitate the example of abraham without the justification of the sacred authority which commanded the holy man to attempt the revolting office but then these images were so transient and so much obscured in intellectual mists as to leave no very strong impressions and the tendency of the whole transaction as we have already said was rather to strengthen than to weaken the authority of ishmael  in this disposition of mind the party continued their route towards the place whence they had that morning issued on a search which had been crowned with so melancholy a success the long and fruitless march which they had made under the direction of abiram the discovery of the body and its subsequent interment had so far consumed the day that by the time their steps were retraced across the broad track of waste which lay between the grave of asa and the rock the sun had fallen far below his meridian altitude the hill had gradually risen as they approached like some tower emerging from the bosom of the sea and when within a mile the minuter objects that crowned its height came dimly into view  it will be a sad meeting for the girls said ishmael who from time to time did not cease to utter something which he intended should be consolatory to the bruised spirit of his partner asa was much regarded by all the young and seldom failed to bring in from his hunts something that they loved  he did he did murmured esther the boy was the pride of the family my other children are as nothing to him  say not so good woman returned the father glancing his eye a little proudly at the athletic train which followed at no great distance in the rear say not so old eester for few fathers and mothers have greater reason to be boastful than ourselves  thankful thankful muttered the humbled woman ye mean thankful ishmael  then thankful let it be if you like the word better my good girlbut what has become of nelly and the young the child has forgotten the charge i gave her and has not only suffered the children to sleep but i warrant you is dreaming of the fields of tennessee at this very moment the mind of your niece is mainly fixed on the settlements i reckon  ay she is not for us i said it and thought it when i took her because death had stripped her of all other friends death is a sad worker in the bosom of families ishmael asa had a kind feeling to the child and they might have come one day into our places had things been so ordered  nay she is not gifted for a frontier wife if this is the manner she is to keep house while the husband is on the hunt abner let off your rifle that they may know we ar coming i fear nelly and the young ar asleep the young man complied with an alacrity that manifested how gladly he would see the rounded active figure of ellen enlivening the ragged summit of the rock but the report was succeeded by neither signal nor answer of any sort for a moment the whole party stood in suspense awaiting the result and then a simultaneous impulse caused the whole to let off their pieces at the same instant producing a noise which might not fail to reach the ears of all within so short a distance  ah there they come at last cried abiram who was usually among the first to seize on any circumstance which promised relief from disagreeable apprehensions  it is a petticoat fluttering on the line said esther i put it there myself  you ar right but now she comes the jade has been taking her comfort in the tent  it is not so said ishmael whose usually inflexible features were beginning to manifest the uneasiness he felt it is the tent itself blowing about loosely in the wind they have loosened the bottom like silly children as they ar and unless care is had the whole will come down  the words were scarcely uttered before a rushing blast of wind swept by the spot where they stood raising the dust in little eddies in its progress and then as if guided by a master hand it quitted the earth and mounted to the precise spot on which all eyes were just then riveted the loosened linen felt its influence and tottered but regained its poise and for a moment it became tranquil the cloud of leaves next played in circling revolutions around the place and then descended with the velocity of a swooping hawk and sailed away into the prairie in long straight lines like a flight of swallows resting on their expanded wings they were followed for some distance by the snowwhite tent which however soon fell behind the rock leaving its highest peak as naked as when it lay in the entire solitude of the desert  the murderers have been here moaned esther my babes my babes  for a moment even ishmael faltered before the weight of so unexpected a blow but shaking himself like an awakened lion he sprang forward and pushing aside the impediments of the barrier as if they had been feathers he rushed up the ascent with an impetuosity which proved how formidable a sluggish nature may become when thoroughly aroused     chapter xiv                  whose party do the townsmen yet admit                                                     king john  in order to preserve an even pace between the incidents of the tale it becomes necessary to revert to such events as occurred during the ward of ellen wade  for the few first hours the cares of the honest and warmhearted girl were confined to the simple offices of satisfying the oftenrepeated demands which her younger associates made on her time and patience under the pretences of hunger thirst and all the other ceaseless wants of captious and inconsiderate childhood she had seized a moment from their importunities to steal into the tent where she was administering to the comforts of one far more deserving of her tenderness when an outcry among the children recalled her to the duties she had momentarily forgotten  see nelly see exclaimed half a dozen eager voices yonder ar men and phoebe says that they ar siouxindians  ellen turned her eyes in the direction in which so many arms were already extended and to her consternation beheld several men advancing manifestly and swiftly in a straight line towards the rock she counted four but was unable to make out any thing concerning their characters except that they were not any of those who of right were entitled to admission into the fortress it was a fearful moment for ellen looking around at the juvenile and frightened flock that pressed upon the skirts of her garments she endeavoured to recall to her confused faculties some one of the many tales of female heroism with which the history of the western frontier abounded in one a stockade had been successfully defended by a single man supported by three or four women for days against the assaults of a hundred enemies in another the women alone had been able to protect the children and the less valuable effects of their absent husbands and a third was not wanting in which a solitary female had destroyed her sleeping captors and given liberty not only to herself but to a brood of helpless young this was the case most nearly assimilated to the situation in which ellen now found herself and with flushing cheeks and kindling eyes the girl began to consider and to prepare her slender means of defence  she posted the larger girls at the little levers that were to cast the rocks on the assailants the smaller were to be used more for show than any positive service they could perform while like any other leader she reserved her own person as a superintendent and encourager of the whole when these dispositions were made she endeavoured to await the issue with an air of composure that she intended should inspire her assistants with the confidence necessary to ensure success  although ellen was vastly their superior in that spirit which emanates from moral qualities she was by no means the equal of the two eldest daughters of esther in the important military property of insensibility to danger reared in the hardihood of a migrating life on the skirts of society where they had become familiarised to the sights and dangers of the wilderness these girls promised fairly to become at some future day no less distinguished than their mother for daring and for that singular mixture of good and evil which in a wider sphere of action would probably have enabled the wife of the squatter to enrol her name among the remarkable females of her time esther had already on one occasion made good the log tenement of ishmael against an inroad of savages and on another she had been left for dead by her enemies after a defence that with a more civilised foe would have entitled her to the honours of a liberal capitulation these facts and sundry others of a similar nature had often been recapitulated with suitable exultation in the presence of her daughters and the bosoms of the young amazons were now strangely fluctuating between natural terror and the ambitious wish to do something that might render them worthy of being the children of such a mother it appeared that the opportunity for distinction of this wild character was no longer to be denied them  the party of strangers was already within a hundred rods of the rock either consulting their usual wary method of advancing or admonished by the threatening attitudes of two figures who had thrust forth the barrels of as many old muskets from behind the stone entrenchment the new comers halted under favour of an inequality in the ground where a growth of grass thicker than common offered the advantage of concealment from this spot they reconnoitred the fortress for several anxious and to ellen interminable minutes then one advanced singly and apparently more in the character of a herald than of an assailant  phoebe do you fire and no hetty you were beginning to be heard between the halffrightened and yet eager daughters of the squatter when ellen probably saved the advancing stranger from some imminent alarm if from no greater danger by exclaiming  lay down the muskets it is dr battius  her subordinates so far complied as to withdraw their hands from the locks though the threatening barrels still maintained the portentous levels the naturalist who had advanced with sufficient deliberation to note the smallest hostile demonstration of the garrison now raised a white handkerchief on the end of his fusee and came within speaking distance of the fortress then assuming what he intended should be an imposing and dignified semblance of authority he blustered forth in a voice that might have been heard at a much greater distance  what ho i summon ye all in the name of the confederacy of the united sovereign states of north america to submit yourselves to the laws  doctor or no doctor he is an enemy nelly hear him hear him he talks of the law  stop stay till i hear his answer said the nearly breathless ellen pushing aside the dangerous weapons which were again pointed in the direction of the shrinking person of the herald  i admonish and forewarn ye all continued the startled doctor that i am a peaceful citizen of the before named confederacy or to speak with greater accuracy union a supporter of the social compact and a lover of good order and amity then perceiving that the danger was at least temporarily removed he once more raised his voice to the hostile pitchi charge ye all therefore to submit to the laws  i thought you were a friend ellen replied and that you travelled with my uncle in virtue of an agreement  it is void i have been deceived in the very premises and i hereby pronounce a certain compactum entered into and concluded between ishmael bush squatter and obed battius md to be incontinently null and of noneffect nay children to be null is merely a negative property and is fraught with no evil to your worthy parent so lay aside the firearms and listen to the admonitions of reason i declare it viciousnullabrogated as for thee nelly my feelings towards thee are not at all given to hostility therefore listen to that which i have to utter nor turn away thine ears in the wantonness of security thou knowest the character of the man with whom thou dwellest young woman and thou also knowest the danger of being found in evil company abandon then the trifling advantages of thy situation and yield the rock peaceably to the will of those who accompany mea legion young womani do assure you an invincible and powerful legion render therefore the effects of this lawless and wicked squatternay children such disregard of human life is frightful in those who have so recently received the gift in their own persons point those dangerous weapons aside i entreat of you more for your own sakes than for mine hetty hast thou forgotten who appeased thine anguish when thy auricular nerves were tortured by the colds and damps of the naked earth and thou phoebe ungrateful and forgetful phoebe but for this very arm which you would prostrate with an endless paralysis thy incisores would still be giving thee pain and sorrow lay then aside thy weapons and hearken to the advice of one who has always been thy friend and now young woman still keeping a jealous eye on the muskets which the girl had suffered to be diverted a little from their aimand now young woman for the last and therefore the most solemn asking i demand of thee the surrender of this rock without delay or resistance in the joint names of power of justice and of the law he would have added but recollecting that this ominous word would again provoke the hostility of the squatters children he succeeded in swallowing it in good season and concluded with the less dangerous and more convertible term of reason  this extraordinary summons failed however of producing the desired effect it proved utterly unintelligible to his younger listeners with the exception of the few offensive terms already sufficiently distinguished and though ellen better comprehended the meaning of the herald she appeared as little moved by his rhetoric as her companions at those passages which he intended should be tender and affecting the intelligent girl though tortured by painful feelings had even manifested a disposition to laugh while to the threats she turned an utterly insensible ear  i know not the meaning of all you wish to say dr battius she quietly replied when he had ended but i am sure if it would teach me to betray my trust it is what i ought not to hear i caution you to attempt no violence for let my wishes be what they may you see i am surrounded by a force that can easily put me down and you know or ought to know too well the temper of this family to trifle in such a matter with any of its members let them be of what sex or age they may  i am not entirely ignorant of human character returned the naturalist prudently receding a little from the position which he had until now stoutly maintained at the very base of the hill but here comes one who may know its secret windings still better than i  ellen ellen wade cried paul hover who had advanced to his elbow without betraying any of that sensitiveness which had so manifestly discomposed the doctor i didnt expect to find an enemy in you  nor shall you when you ask that which i can grant without treachery you know that my uncle has trusted his family to my care and shall i so far betray the trust as to let in his bitterest enemies to murder his children perhaps and to rob him of the little which the indians have left  am i a murdereris this old manthis officer of the states pointing to the trapper and his newly discovered friend both of whom by this time stood at his side is either of these likely to do the things you name  what is it then you ask of me said ellen wringing her hands in excessive doubt  the beast nothing more nor less than the squatters hidden ravenous dangerous beast  excellent young woman commenced the young stranger who had so lately joined himself to the party on the prairiebut his mouth was immediately stopped by a significant sign from the trapper who whispered in his ear  let the lad be our spokesman natur will work in the bosom of the child and we shall gain our object in good time  the whole truth is out ellen paul continued and we have lined the squatter into his most secret misdoings we have come to right the wronged and to free the imprisoned now if you are the girl of a true heart as i have always believed so far from throwing straws in our way you will join in the general swarming and leave old ishmael and his hive to the bees of his own breed  i have sworn a solemn oath  a compactum which is entered into through ignorance or in duresse is null in the sight of all good moralists cried the doctor  hush hush again the trapper whispered leave it all to natur and the lad  i have sworn in the sight and by the name of him who is the founder and ruler of all that is good whether it be in morals or in religion ellen continued neither to reveal the contents of that tent nor to help its prisoner to escape we are both solemnly terribly sworn our lives perhaps have been the gift we received for the promises it is true you are masters of the secret but not through any means of ours nor do i know that i can justify myself for even being neutral while you attempt to invade the dwelling of my uncle in this hostile manner  i can prove beyond the power of refutation the naturalist eagerly exclaimed by paley berkeley ay even by the immortal binkerschoek that a compactum concluded while one of the parties be it a state or be it an individual is in durance  you will ruffle the temper of the child with your abusive language said the cautious trapper while the lad if left to human feelings will bring her down to the meekness of a fawn ah you are like myself little knowing in the natur of hidden kindnesses  is this the only vow you have taken ellen paul continued in a tone which for the gay lighthearted beehunter sounded dolorous and reproachful have you sworn only to this are the words which the squatter says to be as honey in your mouth and all other promises like so much useless comb  the paleness which had taken possession of the usually cheerful countenance of ellen was hid in a bright glow that was plainly visible even at the distance at which she stood she hesitated a moment as if struggling to repress something very like resentment before she answered with all her native spirit  i know not what right any one has to question me about oaths and promises which can only concern her who has made them if indeed any of the sort you mention have ever been made at all i shall hold no further discourse with one who thinks so much of himself and takes advice merely of his own feelings  now old trapper do you hear that said the unsophisticated beehunter turning abruptly to his aged friend the meanest insect that skims the heavens when it has got its load flies straight and honestly to its nest or hive according to its kind but the ways of a womans mind are as knotty as a gnarled oak and more crooked than the windings of the mississippi  nay nay child said the trapper goodnaturedly interfering in behalf of the offending paul you are to consider that youth is hasty and not overgiven to thought but then a promise is a promise and not to be thrown aside and forgotten like the hoofs and horns of a buffaloe  i thank you for reminding me of my oath said the still resentful ellen biting her pretty nether lip with vexation i might else have proved forgetful  ah female natur is awakened in her said the old man shaking his head in a manner to show how much he was disappointed in the result but it manifests itself against the true spirit  ellen cried the young stranger who until now had been an attentive listener to the parley since ellen is the name by which you are known  they often add to it another i am sometimes called by the name of my father  call her nelly wade at once muttered paul it is her rightful name and i care not if she keeps it for ever  wade i should have added continued the youth you will acknowledge that though bound by no oath myself i at least have known how to respect those of others you are a witness yourself that i have forborne to utter a single call while i am certain it could reach those ears it would gladden so much permit me then to ascend the rock singly i promise a perfect indemnity to your kinsman against any injury his effects may sustain  ellen seemed to hesitate but catching a glimpse of paul who stood leaning proudly on his rifle whistling with an appearance of the utmost indifference the air of a boating song she recovered her recollection in time to answer  i have been left the captain of the rock while my uncle and his sons hunt and captain will i remain till he returns to receive back the charge  this is wasting moments that will not soon return and neglecting an opportunity that may never occur again the young soldier gravely remarked the sun is beginning to fall already and many minutes cannot elapse before the squatter and his savage brood will be returning to their huts  doctor battius cast a glance behind him and took up the discourse by saying  perfection is always found in maturity whether it be in the animal or in the intellectual world reflection is the mother of wisdom and wisdom the parent of success i propose that we retire to a discreet distance from this impregnable position and there hold a convocation or council to deliberate on what manner we may sit down regularly before the place or perhaps by postponing the siege to another season gain the aid of auxiliaries from the inhabited countries and thus secure the dignity of the laws from any danger of a repulse  a storm would be better the soldier smilingly answered measuring the height and scanning all its difficulties with a deliberate eye twould be but a broken arm or a bruised head at the worst  then have at it shouted the impetuous beehunter making a spring that at once put him out of danger from shot by carrying him beneath the projecting ledge on which the garrison was posted now do your worst young devils of a wicked breed you have but a moment to work your mischief  paul rash paul shrieked ellen another step and the rocks will crush you they hang by but a thread and these girls are ready and willing to let them fall  then drive the accursed swarm from the hive for scale the rock i will though i find it covered with hornets  let her if she dare tauntingly cried the eldest of the girls brandishing a musket with a mien and resolution that would have done credit to her amazonian dam i know you nelly wade you are with the lawyers in your heart and if you come a foot nigher you shall have frontier punishment put in another pry girls in with it i should like to see the man of them all that dare come up into the camp of ishmael bush without asking leave of his children  stir not paul for your life keep beneath the rock  ellen was interrupted by the same bright vision which on the preceding day had stayed another scarcely less portentous tumult by exhibiting itself on the same giddy height where it was now seen  in the name of him who commandeth all i implore you to pauseboth you who so madly incur the risk and you who so rashly offer to take that which you never can return said a voice in a slightly foreign accent that instantly drew all eyes upward  inez cried the officer do i again see you mine shall you now be though a million devils were posted on this rock push up brave woodsman and give room for another  the sudden appearance of the figure from the tent had created a momentary stupor among the defendants of the rock which might with suitable forbearance have been happily improved but startled by the voice of middleton the surprised phoebe discharged her musket at the female scarcely knowing whether she aimed at the life of a mortal or at some being which belonged to another world ellen uttered a cry of horror and then sprang after her alarmed or wounded friend she knew not which into the tent  during this moment of dangerous byplay the sounds of a serious attack were very distinctly audible beneath paul had profited by the commotion over his head to change his place so far as to make room for middleton the latter was followed by the naturalist who in a state of mental aberration produced by the report of the musket had instinctively rushed towards the rocks for cover the trapper remained where he was last seen an unmoved but close observer of the several proceedings though averse to enter into actual hostilities the old man was however far from being useless favoured by his position he was enabled to apprise his friends of the movements of those who plotted their destruction above and to advise and control their advance accordingly  in the mean time the children of esther were true to the spirit they had inherited from their redoubtable mother the instant they found themselves delivered from the presence of ellen and her unknown companion they bestowed an undivided attention on their more masculine and certainly more dangerous assailants who by this time had made a complete lodgment among the crags of the citadel the repeated summons to surrender which paul uttered in a voice that he intended should strike terror in their young bosoms were as little heeded as were the calls of the trapper to abandon a resistance which might prove fatal to some among them without offering the smallest probability of eventual success encouraging each other to persevere they poised the fragments of rocks prepared the lighter missiles for immediate service and thrust forward the barrels of the muskets with a businesslike air and a coolness that would have done credit to men practised in warfare  keep under the ledge said the trapper pointing out to paul the manner in which he should proceed keep in your foot more ladah you see the warning was not amiss had the stone struck it the bees would have had the prairies to themselves now namesake of my friend uncas in name and spirit now if you have the activity of le cerf agile you may make a far leap to the right and gain twenty feet without danger beware the bushbeware the bush twill prove a treacherous hold ah he has done it safely and bravely has he done it your turn comes next friend that follows the fruits of natur push you to the left and divide the attention of the children nay girls firemy old ears are used to the whistling of lead and little reason have i to prove a doeheart with fourscore years on my back he shook his head with a melancholy smile but without flinching in a muscle as the bullet which the exasperated hetty fired passed innocently at no great distance from the spot where he stood it is safer keeping in your track than dodging when a weak finger pulls the trigger he continued but it is a solemn sight to witness how much human natur is inclined to evil in one so young well done my man of beasts and plants another such leap and you may laugh at all the squatters bars and walls the doctor has got his temper up i see it in his eye and something good will come of him keep closer mankeep closer  the trapper though he was not deceived as to the state of dr battius mind was however greatly in error as to the exciting cause while imitating the movements of his companions and toiling his way upward with the utmost caution and not without great inward tribulation the eye of the naturalist had caught a glimpse of an unknown plant a few yards above his head and in a situation more than commonly exposed to the missiles which the girls were unceasingly hurling in the direction of the assailants forgetting in an instant every thing but the glory of being the first to give this jewel to the catalogues of science he sprang upward at the prize with the avidity with which the sparrow darts upon the butterfly the rocks which instantly came thundering down announced that he was seen and for a moment while his form was concealed in the cloud of dust and fragments which followed the furious descent the trapper gave him up for lost but the next instant he was seen safely seated in a cavity formed by some of the projecting stones which had yielded to the shock holding triumphantly in his hand the captured stem which he was already devouring with delighted and certainly not unskilful eyes paul profited by the opportunity turning his course with the quickness of thought he sprang to the post which obed thus securely occupied and unceremoniously making a footstool of his shoulder as the latter stooped over his treasure he bounded through the breach left by the fallen rock and gained the level he was followed by middleton who joined him in seizing and disarming the girls in this manner a bloodless and complete victory was obtained over that citadel which ishmael had vainly flattered himself might prove impregnable     chapter xv                so smile the heavens upon this holy act               that afterhours with sorrow chide us not                                                    shakspeare  it is proper that the course of the narrative should be stayed while we revert to those causes which have brought in their train of consequences the singular contest just related the interruption must necessarily be as brief as we hope it may prove satisfactory to that class of readers who require that no gap should be left by those who assume the office of historians for their own fertile imaginations to fill  among the troops sent by the government of the united states to take possession of its newly acquired territory in the west was a detachment led by a young soldier who has become so busy an actor in the scenes of our legend the mild and indolent descendants of the ancient colonists received their new compatriots without distrust well knowing that the transfer raised them from the condition of subjects to the more enviable distinction of citizens in a government of laws the new rulers exercised their functions with discretion and wielded their delegated authority without offence in such a novel intermixture however of men born and nurtured in freedom and the compliant minions of absolute power the catholic and the protestant the active and the indolent some little time was necessary to blend the discrepant elements of society in attaining so desirable an end woman was made to perform her accustomed and grateful office the barriers of prejudice and religion were broken through by the irresistible power of the masterpassion and family unions ere long began to cement the political tie which had made a forced conjunction between people so opposite in their habits their educations and their opinions  middleton was among the first of the new possessors of the soil who became captive to the charms of a louisianian lady in the immediate vicinity of the post he had been directed to occupy dwelt the chief of one of those ancient colonial families which had been content to slumber for ages amid the ease indolence and wealth of the spanish provinces he was an officer of the crown and had been induced to remove from the floridas among the french of the adjoining province by a rich succession of which he had become the inheritor the name of don augustin de certavallos was scarcely known beyond the limits of the little town in which he resided though he found a secret pleasure himself in pointing it out in large scrolls of musty documents to an only child as enrolled among the former heroes and grandees of old and of new spain this fact so important to himself and of so little moment to any body else was the principal reason that while his more vivacious gallic neighbours were not slow to open a frank communion with their visiters he chose to keep aloof seemingly content with the society of his daughter who was a girl just emerging from the condition of childhood into that of a woman  the curiosity of the youthful inez however was not so inactive she had not heard the martial music of the garrison melting on the evening air nor seen the strange banner which fluttered over the heights that rose at no great distance from her fathers extensive grounds without experiencing some of those secret impulses which are thought to distinguish the sex natural timidity and that retiring and perhaps peculiar lassitude which forms the very groundwork of female fascination in the tropical provinces of spain held her in their seemingly indissoluble bonds and it is more than probable that had not an accident occurred in which middleton was of some personal service to her father so long a time would have elapsed before they met that another direction might have been given to the wishes of one who was just of an age to be alive to all the power of youth and beauty  providenceor if that imposing word is too just to be classical fatehad otherwise decreed the haughty and reserved don augustin was by far too observant of the forms of that station on which he so much valued himself to forget the duties of a gentleman gratitude for the kindness of middleton induced him to open his doors to the officers of the garrison and to admit of a guarded but polite intercourse reserve gradually gave way before the propriety and candour of their spirited young leader and it was not long ere the affluent planter rejoiced as much as his daughter whenever the well known signal at the gate announced one of these agreeable visits from the commander of the post  it is unnecessary to dwell on the impression which the charms of inez produced on the soldier or to delay the tale in order to write a wiredrawn account of the progressive influence that elegance of deportment manly beauty and undivided assiduity and intelligence were likely to produce on the sensitive mind of a romantic warmhearted and secluded girl of sixteen it is sufficient for our purpose to say that they loved that the youth was not backward to declare his feelings that he prevailed with some facility over the scruples of the maiden and with no little difficulty over the objections of her father and that before the province of louisiana had been six months in the possession of the states the officer of the latter was the affianced husband of the richest heiress on the banks of the mississippi  although we have presumed the reader to be acquainted with the manner in which such results are commonly attained it is not to be supposed that the triumph of middleton either over the prejudices of the father or over those of the daughter was achieved without difficulty religion formed a stubborn and nearly irremovable obstacle with both the devoted man patiently submitted to a formidable essay father ignatius was deputed to make in order to convert him to the true faith the effort on the part of the worthy priest was systematic vigorous and long sustained a dozen times it was at those moments when glimpses of the light sylphlike form of inez flitted like some fairy being past the scene of their conferences the good father fancied he was on the eve of a glorious triumph over infidelity but all his hopes were frustrated by some unlookedfor opposition on the part of the subject of his pious labours so long as the assault on his faith was distant and feeble middleton who was no great proficient in polemics submitted to its effects with the patience and humility of a martyr but the moment the good father who felt such concern in his future happiness was tempted to improve his vantage ground by calling in the aid of some of the peculiar subtilties of his own creed the young man was too good a soldier not to make head against the hot attack he came to the contest it is true with no weapons more formidable than common sense and some little knowledge of the habits of his country as contrasted with that of his adversary but with these homebred implements he never failed to repulse the father with something of the power with which a nervous cudgel player would deal with a skilful master of the rapier setting at nought his passados by the direct and unanswerable arguments of a broken head and a shivered weapon  before the controversy was terminated an inroad of protestants had come to aid the soldier the reckless freedom of such among them as thought only of this life and the consistent and tempered piety of others caused the honest priest to look about him in concern the influence of example on one hand and the contamination of too free an intercourse on the other began to manifest themselves even in that portion of his own flock which he had supposed to be too thoroughly folded in spiritual government ever to stray it was time to turn his thoughts from the offensive and to prepare his followers to resist the lawless deluge of opinion which threatened to break down the barriers of their faith like a wise commander who finds he has occupied too much ground for the amount of his force he began to curtail his outworks the relics were concealed from profane eyes his people were admonished not to speak of miracles before a race that not only denied their existence but who had even the desperate hardihood to challenge their proofs and even the bible itself was prohibited with terrible denunciations for the triumphant reason that it was liable to be misinterpreted  in the mean time it became necessary to report to don augustin the effects his arguments and prayers had produced on the heretical disposition of the young soldier no man is prone to confess his weakness at the very moment when circumstances demand the utmost efforts of his strength by a species of pious fraud for which no doubt the worthy priest found his absolution in the purity of his motives he declared that while no positive change was actually wrought in the mind of middleton there was every reason to hope the entering wedge of argument had been driven to its head and that in consequence an opening was left through which it might rationally be hoped the blessed seeds of a religious fructification would find their way especially if the subject was left uninterruptedly to enjoy the advantage of catholic communion  don augustin himself was now seized with the desire of proselyting even the soft and amiable inez thought it would be a glorious consummation of her wishes to be a humble instrument of bringing her lover into the bosom of the true church the offers of middleton were promptly accepted and while the father looked forward impatiently to the day assigned for the nuptials as to the pledge of his own success the daughter thought of it with feelings in which the holy emotions of her faith were blended with the softer sensations of her years and situation  the sun rose the morning of her nuptials on a day so bright and cloudless that inez hailed it as a harbinger of future happiness father ignatius performed the offices of the church in a little chapel attached to the estate of don augustin and long ere the sun had begun to fall middleton pressed the blushing and timid young creole to his bosom his acknowledged and unalienable wife it had pleased the parties to pass the day of the wedding in retirement dedicating it solely to the best and purest affections aloof from the noisy and heartless rejoicings of a compelled festivity  middleton was returning through the grounds of don augustin from a visit of duty to his encampment at that hour in which the light of the sun begins to melt into the shadows of evening when a glimpse of a robe similar to that in which inez had accompanied him to the altar caught his eye through the foliage of a retired arbour he approached the spot with a delicacy that was rather increased than diminished by the claim she had perhaps given him to intrude on her private moments but the sounds of her soft voice which was offering up prayers in which he heard himself named by the dearest of all appellations overcame his scruples and induced him to take a position where he might listen without the fear of detection it was certainly grateful to the feelings of a husband to be able in this manner to lay bare the spotless soul of his wife and to find that his own image lay enshrined amid its purest and holiest aspirations his selfesteem was too much flattered not to induce him to overlook the immediate object of the petitioner while she prayed that she might become the humble instrument of bringing him into the flock of the faithful she petitioned for forgiveness on her own behalf if presumption or indifference to the counsel of the church had caused her to set too high a value on her influence and led her into the dangerous error of hazarding her own soul by espousing a heretic there was so much of fervent piety mingled with so strong a burst of natural feeling so much of the woman blended with the angel in her prayers that middleton could have forgiven her had she termed him a pagan for the sweetness and interest with which she petitioned in his favour  the young man waited until his bride arose from her knees and then he joined her as if entirely ignorant of what had occurred  it is getting late my inez he said and don augustin would be apt to reproach you with inattention to your health in being abroad at such an hour what then am i to do who am charged with all his authority and twice his love  be like him in every thing she answered looking up in his face with tears in her eyes and speaking with emphasis in every thing imitate my father middleton and i can ask no more of you  nor for me inez i doubt not that i should be all you can wish were i to become as good as the worthy and respectable don augustin but you are to make some allowances for the infirmities and habits of a soldier now let us go and join this excellent father  not yet said his bride gently extricating herself from the arm that he had thrown around her slight form while he urged her from the place i have still another duty to perform before i can submit so implicitly to your orders soldier though you are i promised the worthy inesella my faithful nurse she who as you heard has so long been a mother to me middletoni promised her a visit at this hour it is the last as she thinks that she can receive from her own child and i cannot disappoint her go you then to don augustin in one short hour i will rejoin you  remember it is but an hour  one hour repeated inez as she kissed her hand to him and then blushing ashamed at her own boldness she darted from the arbour and was seen for an instant gliding towards the cottage of her nurse in which at the next moment she disappeared  middleton returned slowly and thoughtfully to the house often bending his eyes in the direction in which he had last seen his wife as if he would fain trace her lovely form in the gloom of the evening still floating through the vacant space don augustin received him with warmth and for many minutes his mind was amused by relating to his new kinsman plans for the future the exclusive old spaniard listened to his glowing but true account of the prosperity and happiness of those states of which he had been an ignorant neighbour half his life partly in wonder and partly with that sort of incredulity with which one attends to what he fancies are the exaggerated descriptions of a too partial friendship  in this manner the hour for which inez had conditioned passed away much sooner than her husband could have thought possible in her absence at length his looks began to wander to the clock and then the minutes were counted as one rolled by after another and inez did not appear the hand had already made half of another circuit around the face of the dial when middleton arose and announced his determination to go and offer himself as an escort to the absentee he found the night dark and the heavens charged with threatening vapour which in that climate was the infallible forerunner of a gust stimulated no less by the unpropitious aspect of the skies than by his secret uneasiness he quickened his pace making long and rapid strides in the direction of the cottage of inesella twenty times he stopped fancying that he caught glimpses of the fairy form of inez tripping across the grounds on her return to the mansionhouse and as often he was obliged to resume his course in disappointment he reached the gate of the cottage knocked opened the door entered and even stood in the presence of the aged nurse without meeting the person of her he sought she had already left the place on her return to her fathers house believing that he must have passed her in the darkness middleton retraced his steps to meet with another disappointment inez had not been seen without communicating his intention to any one the bridegroom proceeded with a palpitating heart to the little sequestered arbour where he had overheard his bride offering up those petitions for his happiness and conversion here too he was disappointed and then all was afloat in the painful incertitude of doubt and conjecture  for many hours a secret distrust of the motives of his wife caused middleton to proceed in the search with delicacy and caution but as day dawned without restoring her to the arms of her father or her husband reserve was thrown aside and her unaccountable absence was loudly proclaimed the enquiries after the lost inez were now direct and open but they proved equally fruitless no one had seen her or heard of her from the moment that she left the cottage of her nurse  day succeeded day and still no tidings rewarded the search that was immediately instituted until she was finally given over by most of her relations and friends as irretrievably lost  an event of so extraordinary a character was not likely to be soon forgotten it excited speculation gave rise to an infinity of rumours and not a few inventions the prevalent opinion among such of those emigrants who were overrunning the country as had time in the multitude of their employments to think of any foreign concerns was the simple and direct conclusion that the absent bride was no more nor less than a felo de se father ignatius had many doubts and much secret compunction of conscience but like a wise chief he endeavoured to turn the sad event to some account in the impending warfare of faith changing his battery he whispered in the ears of a few of his oldest parishioners that he had been deceived in the state of middletons mind which he was now compelled to believe was completely stranded on the quicksands of heresy he began to show his relics again and was even heard to allude once more to the delicate and nearly forgotten subject of modern miracles in consequence of these demonstrations on the part of the venerable priest it came to be whispered among the faithful and finally it was adopted as part of the parish creed that inez had been translated to heaven  don augustin had all the feelings of a father but they were smothered in the lassitude of a creole like his spiritual governor he began to think that they had been wrong in consigning one so pure so young so lovely and above all so pious to the arms of a heretic and he was fain to believe that the calamity which had befallen his age was a judgment on his presumption and want of adherence to established forms it is true that as the whispers of the congregation came to his ears he found present consolation in their belief but then nature was too powerful and had too strong a hold of the old mans heart not to give rise to the rebellious thought that the succession of his daughter to the heavenly inheritance was a little premature  but middleton the lover the husband the bridegroommiddleton was nearly crushed by the weight of the unexpected and terrible blow educated himself under the dominion of a simple and rational faith in which nothing is attempted to be concealed from the believers he could have no other apprehensions for the fate of inez than such as grew out of his knowledge of the superstitious opinions she entertained of his own church it is needless to dwell on the mental tortures that he endured or all the various surmises hopes and disappointments that he was fated to experience in the first few weeks of his misery a jealous distrust of the motives of inez and a secret lingering hope that he should yet find her had tempered his enquiries without however causing him to abandon them entirely but time was beginning to deprive him even of the mortifying reflection that he was intentionally though perhaps temporarily deserted and he was gradually yielding to the more painful conviction that she was dead when his hopes were suddenly revived in a new and singular manner  the young commander was slowly and sorrowfully returning from an evening parade of his troops to his own quarters which stood at some little distance from the place of the encampment and on the same high bluff of land when his vacant eyes fell on the figure of a man who by the regulations of the place was not entitled to be there at that forbidden hour the stranger was meanly dressed with every appearance about his person and countenance of squalid poverty and of the most dissolute habits sorrow had softened the military pride of middleton and as he passed the crouching form of the intruder he said in tones of great mildness or rather of kindness  you will be given a night in the guardhouse friend should the patrol find you herethere is a dollargo and get a better place to sleep in and something to eat  i swallow all my food captain without chewing returned the vagabond with the low exultation of an accomplished villain as he eagerly seized the silver make this mexican twenty and i will sell you a secret  go go said the other with a little of a soldiers severity returning to his manner go before i order the guard to seize you  well go i willbut if i do go captain i shall take my knowledge with me and then you may live a widower bewitched till the tattoo of life is beat off  what mean you fellow exclaimed middleton turning quickly towards the wretch who was already dragging his diseased limbs from the place  i mean to have the value of this dollar in spanish brandy and then come back and sell you my secret for enough to buy a barrel  if you have any thing to say speak now continued middleton restraining with difficulty the impatience that urged him to betray his feelings  i am adry and i can never talk with elegance when my throat is husky captain how much will you give to know what i can tell you let it be something handsome such as one gentleman can offer to another  i believe it would be better justice to order the drummer to pay you a visit fellow to what does your boasted secret relate  matrimony a wife and no wife a pretty face and a rich bride do i speak plain now captain  if you know any thing relating to my wife say it at once you need not fear for your reward  ay captain i have drove many a bargain in my time and sometimes i have been paid in money and sometimes i have been paid in promises now the last are what i call pinching food  name your price  twentyno damn it its worth thirty dollars if its worth a cent  here then is your money but remember if you tell me nothing worth knowing i have a force that can easily deprive you of it again and punish your insolence in the bargain  the fellow examined the bankbills he received with a jealous eye and then pocketed them apparently well satisfied of their being genuine  i like a northern note he said very coolly they have a character to lose like myself no fear of me captain i am a man of honour and i shall not tell you a word more nor a word less than i know of my own knowledge to be true  proceed then without further delay or i may repent and order you to be deprived of all your gains the silver as well as the notes  honour if you die for it returned the miscreant holding up a hand in affected horror at so treacherous a threat well captain you must know that gentlemen dont all live by the same calling some keep what theyve got and some get what they can  you have been a thief  i scorn the word i have been a humanity hunter do you know what that means ay it has many interpretations some people think the woollyheads are miserable working on hot plantations under a broiling sunand all such sorts of inconveniences well captain i have been in my time a man who has been willing to give them the pleasures of variety at least by changing the scene for them you understand me  you are in plain language a kidnapper  have been my worthy captainhave been but just now a little reduced like a merchant who leaves off selling tobacco by the hogshead to deal in it by the yard i have been a soldier too in my day what is said to be the great secret of our trade can you tell me that  i know not said middleton beginning to tire of the fellows trifling courage  no legslegs to fight with and legs to run away withand therein you see my two callings agreed my legs are none of the best just now and without legs a kidnapper would carry on a losing trade but then there are men enough left better provided than i am  stolen groaned the horrorstruck husband  on her travels as sure as you are standing still  villain what reason have you for believing a thing so shocking  hands offhands offdo you think my tongue can do its work the better for a little squeezing of the throat have patience and you shall know it all but if you treat me so ungenteelly again i shall be obliged to call in the assistance of the lawyers  say on but if you utter a single word more or less than the truth expect instant vengeance  are you fool enough to believe what such a scoundrel as i am tells you captain unless it has probability to back it i know you are not therefore i will give my facts and my opinions and then leave you to chew on them while i go and drink of your generosity i know a man who is called abiram whitei believe the knave took that name to show his enmity to the race of blacks but this gentleman is now and has been for years to my certain knowledge a regular translator of the human body from one state to another i have dealt with him in my time and a cheating dog he is no more honour in him than meat in my stomach i saw him here in this very town the day of your wedding he was in company with his wifes brother and pretended to be a settler on the hunt for new land a noble set they were to carry on businessseven sons each of them as tall as your sergeant with his cap on well the moment i heard that your wife was lost i saw at once that abiram had laid his hands on her  do you know thiscan this be true what reason have you to fancy a thing so wild  reason enough i know abiram white now will you add a trifle just to keep my throat from parching  go go you are stupified with drink already miserable man and know not what you say go go and beware the drummer  experience is a good guidethe fellow called after the retiring middleton and then turning with a chuckling laugh like one well satisfied with himself he made the best of his way towards the shop of the suttler  a hundred times in the course of that night did middleton fancy that the communication of the miscreant was entitled to some attention and as often did he reject the idea as too wild and visionary for another thought he was awakened early on the following morning after passing a restless and nearly sleepless night by his orderly who came to report that a man was found dead on the parade at no great distance from his quarters throwing on his clothes he proceeded to the spot and beheld the individual with whom he had held the preceding conference in the precise situation in which he had first been found  the miserable wretch had fallen a victim to his intemperance this revolting fact was sufficiently proclaimed by his obtruding eyeballs his bloated countenance and the nearly insufferable odours that were even then exhaling from his carcass disgusted with the odious spectacle the youth was turning from the sight after ordering the corpse to be removed when the position of one of the dead mans hands struck him on examination he found the forefinger extended as if in the act of writing in the sand with the following incomplete sentence nearly illegible but yet in a state to be deciphered captain it is true as i am a gentle he had either died or fallen into a sleep the forerunner of his death before the latter word was finished  concealing this fact from the others middleton repeated his orders and departed the pertinacity of the deceased and all the circumstances united induced him to set on foot some secret enquiries he found that a family answering the description which had been given him had in fact passed the place the day of his nuptials they were traced along the margin of the mississippi for some distance until they took boat and ascended the river to its confluence with the missouri here they had disappeared like hundreds of others in pursuit of the hidden wealth of the interior  furnished with these facts middleton detailed a small guard of his most trusty men took leave of don augustin without declaring his hopes or his fears and having arrived at the indicated point he pushed into the wilderness in pursuit it was not difficult to trace a train like that of ishmael until he was well assured its object lay far beyond the usual limits of the settlements this circumstance in itself quickened his suspicions and gave additional force to his hopes of final success  after getting beyond the assistance of verbal directions the anxious husband had recourse to the usual signs of a trail in order to follow the fugitives this he also found a task of no difficulty until he reached the hard and unyielding soil of the rolling prairies here indeed he was completely at fault he found himself at length compelled to divide his followers appointing a place of rendezvous at a distant day and to endeavour to find the lost trail by multiplying as much as possible the number of his eyes he had been alone a week when accident brought him in contact with the trapper and the beehunter part of their interview has been related and the reader can readily imagine the explanations that succeeded the tale he recounted and which led as has already been seen to the recovery of his bride     chapter xvi             these likelihoods confirm her flight from hence            therefore i pray you stay not to discourse            but mount you presently                                                    shakspeare  an hour had slid by in hasty and nearly incoherent questions and answers before middleton hanging over his recovered treasure with that sort of jealous watchfulness with which a miser would regard his hoards closed the disjointed narrative of his own proceedings by demanding  and you my inez in what manner were you treated  in every thing but the great injustice they did in separating me so forcibly from my friends as well perhaps as the circumstances of my captors would allow i think the man who is certainly the master here is but a new beginner in wickedness he quarrelled frightfully in my presence with the wretch who seized me and then they made an impious bargain to which i was compelled to acquiesce and to which they bound me as well as themselves by oaths ah middleton i fear the heretics are not so heedful of their vows as we who are nurtured in the bosom of the true church  believe it not these villains are of no religion did they forswear themselves  no not perjured but was it not awful to call upon the good god to witness so sinful a compact  and so we think inez as truly as the most virtuous cardinal of rome but how did they observe their oath and what was its purport  they conditioned to leave me unmolested and free from their odious presence provided i would give a pledge to make no effort to escape and that i would not even show myself until a time that my masters saw fit to name  and that time demanded the impatient middleton who so well knew the religious scruples of his wifethat time  it is already passed i was sworn by my patron saint and faithfully did i keep the vow until the man they call ishmael forgot the terms by offering violence i then made my appearance on the rock for the time too was passed though i even think father ignatius would have absolved me from the vow on account of the treachery of my keepers  if he had not muttered the youth between his compressed teeth i would have absolved him for ever from his spiritual care of your conscience  you middleton returned his wife looking up into his flushed face while a bright blush suffused her own sweet countenance you may receive my vows but surely you can have no power to absolve me from their observance  no no no inez you are right i know but little of these conscientious subtilties and i am any thing but a priest yet tell me what has induced these monsters to play this desperate gameto trifle thus with my happiness  you know my ignorance of the world and how ill i am qualified to furnish reasons for the conduct of beings so different from any i have ever seen before but does not love of money drive men to acts even worse than this i believe they thought that an aged and wealthy father could be tempted to pay them a rich ransom for his child and perhaps she added stealing an enquiring glance through her tears at the attentive middleton they counted something on the fresh affections of a bridegroom  they might have extracted the blood from my heart drop by drop  yes resumed his young and timid wife instantly withdrawing the stolen look she had hazarded and hurriedly pursuing the train of the discourse as if glad to make him forget the liberty she had just taken i have been told there are men so base as to perjure themselves at the altar in order to command the gold of ignorant and confiding girls and if love of money will lead to such baseness we may surely expect it will hurry those who devote themselves to gain into acts of lesser fraud  it must be so and now inez though i am here to guard you with my life and we are in possession of this rock our difficulties perhaps our dangers are not ended you will summon all your courage to meet the trial and prove yourself a soldiers wife my inez  i am ready to depart this instant the letter you sent by the physician had prepared me to hope for the best and i have every thing arranged for flight at the shortest warning  let us then leave this place and join our friends  friends interrupted inez glancing her eyes around the little tent in quest of the form of ellen i too have a friend who must not be forgotten but who is pledged to pass the remainder of her life with us she is gone  middleton gently led her from the spot as he smilingly answered  she may have had like myself her own private communications for some favoured ear  the young man had not however done justice to the motives of ellen wade the sensitive and intelligent girl had readily perceived how little her presence was necessary in the interview that has just been related and had retired with that intuitive delicacy of feeling which seems to belong more properly to her sex she was now to be seen seated on a point of the rock with her person so entirely enveloped in her dress as to conceal her features here she had remained for near an hour no one approaching to address her and as it appeared to her own quick and jealous eyes totally unobserved in the latter particular however even the vigilance of the quicksighted ellen was deceived  the first act of paul hover on finding himself the master of ishmaels citadel had been to sound the note of victory after the quaint and ludicrous manner that is so often practised among the borderers of the west flapping his sides with his hands as the conquering gamecock is wont to do with his wings he raised a loud and laughable imitation of the exultation of this bird a cry which might have proved a dangerous challenge had any one of the athletic sons of the squatter been within hearing  this has been a regular knockdown and dragout he cried and no bones broke how now old trapper you have been one of your training platoon rank and file soldiers in your day and have seen forts taken and batteries stormed before thisam i right  ay ay that have i answered the old man who still maintained his post at the foot of the rock so little disturbed by what he had just witnessed as to return the grin of paul with a hearty indulgence in his own silent and peculiar laughter you have gone through the exploit like men  now tell me is it not in rule to call over the names of the living and to bury the dead after every bloody battle  some did and other some didnt when sir william pushd the german dieskau thro the defiles at the foot of the hori  your sir william was a drone to sir paul and knew nothing of regularity so here begins the rollcallby the by old man what between beehunting and buffaloe humps and certain other matters i have been too busy to ask your name for i intend to begin with my rearguard well knowing that my man in front is too busy to answer  lord lad ive been called in my time by as many names as there are people among whom ive dwelt now the delawares namd me for my eyes and i was called after the farsighted hawk then agin the settlers in the otsego hills christened me anew from the fashion of my leggings and various have been the names by which i have gone through life but little will it matter when the time shall come that all are to be musterd face to face by what titles a mortal has played his part i humbly trust i shall be able to answer to any of mine in a loud and manly voice  paul paid little or no attention to this reply more than half of which was lost in the distance but pursuing the humour of the moment he called out in a stentorian voice to the naturalist to answer to his name dr battius had not thought it necessary to push his success beyond the comfortable niche which accident had so opportunely formed for his protection and in which he now reposed from his labours with a pleasing consciousness of security added to great exultation at the possession of the botanical treasure already mentioned  mount mount my worthy molecatcher come and behold the prospect of skirting ishmael come and look nature boldly in the face and not go sneaking any longer among the prairie grass and mullein tops like a gobbler nibbling for grasshoppers  the mouth of the lighthearted and reckless beehunter was instantly closed and he was rendered as mute as he had just been boisterous and talkative by the appearance of ellen wade when the melancholy maiden took her seat on the point of the rock as mentioned paul affected to employ himself in conducting a close inspection of the household effects of the squatter he rummaged the drawers of esther with no delicate hands scattered the rustic finery of her girls on the ground without the least deference to its quality or elegance and tossed her pots and kettles here and there as though they had been vessels of wood instead of iron all this industry was however manifestly without an object he reserved nothing for himself not even appearing conscious of the nature of the articles which suffered by his familiarity when he had examined the inside of every cabin taken a fresh survey of the spot where he had confined the children and where he had thoroughly secured them with cords and kicked one of the pails of the woman like a football fifty feet into the air in sheer wantonness he returned to the edge of the rock and thrusting both his hands through his wampum belt he began to whistle the kentucky hunters as diligently as if he had been hired to supply his auditors with music by the hour in this manner passed the remainder of the time until middleton as has been related led inez forth from the tent and gave a new direction to the thoughts of the whole party he summoned paul from his flourish of music tore the doctor from the study of his plant and as acknowledged leader gave the necessary orders for immediate departure  in the bustle and confusion that were likely to succeed such a mandate there was little opportunity to indulge in complaints or reflections as the adventurers had not come unprepared for victory each individual employed himself in such offices as were best adapted to his strength and situation the trapper had already made himself master of the patient asinus who was quietly feeding at no great distance from the rock and he was now busy in fitting his back with the complicated machinery that dr battius saw fit to term a saddle of his own invention the naturalist himself seized upon his portfolios herbals and collection of insects which he quickly transferred from the encampment of the squatter to certain pockets in the aforesaid ingenious invention and which the trapper as uniformly cast away the moment his back was turned paul showed his dexterity in removing such light articles as inez and ellen had prepared for their flight to the foot of the citadel while middleton after mingling threats and promises in order to induce the children to remain quietly in their bondage assisted the females to descend as time began to press upon them and there was great danger of ishmaels returning these several movements were made with singular industry and despatch  the trapper bestowed such articles as he conceived were necessary to the comfort of the weaker and more delicate members of the party in those pockets from which he had so unceremoniously expelled the treasures of the unconscious naturalist and then gave way for middleton to place inez in one of those seats which he had prepared on the back of the animal for her and her companion  go child the old man said motioning to ellen to follow the example of the lady and turning his head a little anxiously to examine the waste behind him it cannot be long afore the owner of this place will be coming to look after his household and he is not a man to give up his property however obtained without complaint  it is true cried middleton we have wasted moments that are precious and have the utmost need of industry  ay ay i thought it and would have said it captain but i remembered how your grandther used to love to look upon the face of her he led away for a wife in the days of his youth and his happiness tis natur tis natur and tis wiser to give way a little before its feelings than to try to stop a current that will have its course  ellen advanced to the side of the beast and seizing inez by the hand she said with heartfelt warmth after struggling to suppress an emotion that nearly choked her  god bless you sweet lady i hope you will forget and forgive the wrongs you have received from my uncle  the humbled and sorrowful girl could say no more her voice becoming entirely inaudible in an ungovernable burst of grief  how is this cried middleton did you not say inez that this excellent young woman was to accompany us and to live with us for the remainder of her life or at least until she found some more agreeable residence for herself  i did and i still hope it she has always given me reason to believe that after having shown so much commiseration and friendship in my misery she would not desert me should happier times return  i cannoti ought not continued ellen getting the better of her momentary weakness it has pleased god to cast my lot among these people and i ought not to quit them it would be adding the appearance of treachery to what will already seem bad enough with one of his opinions he has been kind to me an orphan after his rough customs and i cannot steal from him at such a moment  she is just as much a relation of skirting ishmael as i am a bishop said paul with a loud hem as if his throat wanted clearing if the old fellow has done the honest thing by her in giving her a morsel of venison now and then or a spoon around his homminy dish hasnt she payd him in teaching the young devils to read their bible or in helping old esther to put her finery in shape and fashion tell me that a drone has a sting and ill believe you as easily as i will that this young woman is a debtor to any of the tribe of bush  it is but little matter who owes me or where i am in debt there are none to care for a girl who is fatherless and motherless and whose nearest kin are the offcasts of all honest people no no go lady and heaven for ever bless you i am better here in this desert where there are none to know my shame  now old trapper retorted paul this is what i call knowing which way the wind blows you ar a man that has seen life and you know something of fashions i put it to your judgment plainly isnt it in the nature of things for the hive to swarm when the young get their growth and if children will quit their parents ought one who is of no kith or kin  hist interrupted the man he addressed hector is discontented say it out plainly pup what is it dogwhat is it  the venerable hound had risen and was scenting the fresh breeze which continued to sweep heavily over the prairie at the words of his master he growled and contracted the muscles of his lips as if half disposed to threaten with the remnants of his teeth the younger dog who was resting after the chase of the morning also made some signs that his nose detected a taint in the air and then the two resumed their slumbers as if they had done enough  the trapper seized the bridle of the ass and cried urging the beast onward  there is no time for words the squatter and his brood are within a mile or two of this blessed spot  middleton lost all recollection of ellen in the danger which now so eminently beset his recovered bride nor is it necessary to add that dr battius did not wait for a second admonition to commence his retreat  following the route indicated by the old man they turned the rock in a body and pursued their way as fast as possible across the prairie under the favour of the cover it afforded  paul hover however remained in his tracks sullenly leaning on his rifle near a minute had elapsed before he was observed by ellen who had buried her face in her hands to conceal her fancied desolation from herself  why do you not fly the weeping girl exclaimed the instant she perceived she was not alone  im not used to it  my uncle will soon be here you have nothing to hope from his pity  nor from that of his niece i reckon let him come he can only knock me on the head  paul paul if you love me fly  aloneif i do may i be  if you value your life fly  i value it not compared to you  paul  ellen  she extended both her hands and burst into another and a still more violent flood of tears the beehunter put one of his sturdy arms around her waist and in another moment he was urging her over the plain in rapid pursuit of their flying friends     chapter xvii               approach the chamber and destroy your sight              with a new gorgondo not bid me speak              see and then speak yourselves                                                    shakspeare  the little run which supplied the family of the squatter with water and nourished the trees and bushes that grew near the base of the rocky eminence took its rise at no great distance from the latter in a small thicket of cottonwood and vines hither then the trapper directed the flight as to the place affording the only available cover in so pressing an emergency it will be remembered that the sagacity of the old man which from long practice in similar scenes amounted nearly to an instinct in all cases of sudden danger had first induced him to take this course as it placed the hill between them and the approaching party favoured by this circumstance he succeeded in reaching the bushes in sufficient time and paul hover had just hurried the breathless ellen into the tangled bush as ishmael gained the summit of the rock in the manner already described where he stood like a man momentarily bereft of sense gazing at the confusion which had been created among his chattels or at his gagged and bound children who had been safely bestowed by the forethought of the beehunter under the cover of a bark roof in a sort of irregular pile a long rifle would have thrown a bullet from the height on which the squatter now stood into the very cover where the fugitives who had wrought all this mischief were clustered  the trapper was the first to speak as the man on whose intelligence and experience they all depended for counsel after running his eye over the different individuals who gathered about him in order to see that none were missing  ah natur is natur and has done its work he said nodding to the exulting paul with a smile of approbation i thought it would be hard for those who had so often met in fair and foul by starlight and under the clouded moon to part at last in anger now is there little time to lose in talk and every thing to gain by industry it cannot be long afore some of yonder brood will be nosing along the arth for our trail and should they find it as find it they surely will and should they push us to a stand on our courage the dispute must be settled with the rifle which may he in heaven forbid captain can you lead us to the place where any of your warriors liefor the stout sons of the squatter will make a manly brush of it or i am but little of a judge in warlike dispositions  the place of rendezvous is many leagues from this on the banks of la platte  it is badit is bad if fighting is to be done it is always wise to enter on it on equal terms but what has one so near his time to do with illblood and hotblood at his heart listen to what a grey head and some experience have to offer and then if any among you can point out a wiser fashion for a retreat we can just follow his design and forget that i have spoken this thicket stretches for near a mile as it may be slanting from the rock and leads towards the sunset instead of the settlements  enough enough cried middleton too impatient to wait until the deliberative and perhaps loquacious old man could end his minute explanation time is too precious for words let us fly  the trapper made a gesture of compliance and turning in his tracks he led asinus across the trembling earth of the swale and quickly emerged on the hard ground on the side opposite to the encampment of the squatter  if old ishmael gets a squint at that highway through the brush cried paul casting as he left the place a hasty glance at the broad trail the party had made through the thicket hell need no fingerboard to tell him which way his road lies but let him follow i know the vagabond would gladly cross his breed with a little honest blood but if any son of his ever gets to be the husband of  hush paul hush said the terrified young woman who leaned on his arm for support your voice might be heard  the beehunter was silent though he did not cease to cast ominous looks behind him as they flew along the edge of the run which sufficiently betrayed the belligerent condition of his mind as each one was busy for himself but a few minutes elapsed before the party rose a swell of the prairie and descending without a moments delay on the opposite side they were at once removed from every danger of being seen by the sons of ishmael unless the pursuers should happen to fall upon their trail the old man now profited by the formation of the land to take another direction with a view to elude pursuit as a vessel changes her course in fogs and darkness to escape from the vigilance of her enemies  two hours passed in the utmost diligence enabled them to make a half circuit around the rock and to reach a point that was exactly opposite to the original direction of their flight to most of the fugitives their situation was as entirely unknown as is that of a ship in the middle of the ocean to the uninstructed voyager but the old man proceeded at every turn and through every bottom with a decision that inspired his followers with confidence as it spoke favourably of his own knowledge of the localities his hound stopping now and then to catch the expression of his eye had preceded the trapper throughout the whole distance with as much certainty as though a previous and intelligible communion between them had established the route by which they were to proceed but at the expiration of the time just named the dog suddenly came to a stand and then seating himself on the prairie he snuffed the air a moment and began a low and piteous whining  aypupay i know the spoti know the spot and reason there is to remember it well said the old man stopping by the side of his uneasy associate until those who followed had time to come up now yonder is a thicket before us he continued pointing forward where we may lie till tall trees grow on these naked fields afore any of the squatters kin will venture to molest us  this is the spot where the body of the dead man lay cried middleton examining the place with an eye that revolted at the recollection  the very same but whether his friends have put him in the bosom of the ground or not remains to be seen the hound knows the scent but seems to be a little at a loss too it is therefore necessary that you advance friend beehunter to examine while i tarry to keep the dogs from complaining in too loud a voice  i exclaimed paul thrusting his hand into his shaggy locks like one who thought it prudent to hesitate before he undertook so formidable an adventure now hearkee old trapper ive stood in my thinnest cottons in the midst of many a swarm that has lost its queenbee without winking and let me tell you the man who can do that is not likely to fear any living son of skirting ishmael but as to meddling with dead mens bones why it is neither my calling nor my inclination so after thanking you for the favour of your choice as they say when they make a man a corporal in kentucky i decline serving  the old man turned a disappointed look towards middleton who was too much occupied in solacing inez to observe his embarrassment which was however suddenly relieved from a quarter whence from previous circumstances there was little reason to expect such a demonstration of fortitude  doctor battius had rendered himself a little remarkable throughout the whole of the preceding retreat for the exceeding diligence with which he had laboured to effect that desirable object so very conspicuous was his zeal indeed as to have entirely gotten the better of all his ordinary predilections the worthy naturalist belonged to that species of discoverers who make the worst possible travelling companions to a man who has reason to be in a hurry no stone no bush no plant is ever suffered to escape the examination of their vigilant eyes and thunder may mutter and rain fall without disturbing the abstraction of their reveries not so however with the disciple of linnaeus during the momentous period that it remained a mooted point at the tribunal of his better judgment whether the stout descendants of the squatter were not likely to dispute his right to traverse the prairie in freedom the highest blooded and best trained hound with his game in view could not have run with an eye more riveted than that with which the doctor had pursued his curvilinear course it was perhaps lucky for his fortitude that he was ignorant of the artifice of the trapper in leading them around the citadel of ishmael and that he had imbibed the soothing impression that every inch of prairie he traversed was just so much added to the distance between his own person and the detested rock notwithstanding the momentary shock he certainly experienced when he discovered this error he now boldly volunteered to enter the thicket in which there was some reason to believe the body of the murdered asa still lay perhaps the naturalist was urged to show his spirit on this occasion by some secret consciousness that his excessive industry in the retreat might be liable to misconstruction and it is certain that whatever might be his peculiar notions of danger from the quick his habits and his knowledge had placed him far above the apprehension of suffering harm from any communication with the dead  if there is any service to be performed which requires the perfect command of the nervous system said the man of science with a look that was slightly blustering you have only to give a direction to his intellectual faculties and here stands one on whose physical powers you may depend  the man is given to speak in parables muttered the singleminded trapper but i conclude there is always some meaning hidden in his words though it is as hard to find sense in his speeches as to discover three eagles on the same tree it will be wise friend to make a cover lest the sons of the squatter should be out skirting on our trail and as you well know there is some reason to fear yonder thicket contains a sight that may horrify a womans mind are you man enough to look death in the face or shall i run the risk of the hounds raising an outcry and go in myself you see the pup is willing to run with an open mouth already  am i man enough venerable trapper our communications have a recent origin or thy interrogatory might have a tendency to embroil us in angry disputation am i man enough i claim to be of the class mammalia order primates genus homo such are my physical attributes of my moral properties let posterity speak it becomes me to be mute  physic may do for such as relish it to my taste and judgment it is neither palatable nor healthy but morals never did harm to any living mortal be it that he was a sojourner in the forest or a dweller in the midst of glazed windows and smoking chimneys it is only a few hard words that divide us friend for i am of an opinion that with use and freedom we should come to understand one another and mainly settle down into the same judgments of mankind and of the ways of world quiet hector quiet what ruffles your temper pup is it not used to the scent of human blood  the doctor bestowed a gracious but commiserating smile on the philosopher of nature as he retrograded a step or two from the place whither he had been impelled by his excess of spirit in order to reply with less expenditure of breath and with a greater freedom of air and attitude  a homo is certainly a homo he said stretching forth an arm in an argumentative manner so far as the animal functions extend there are the connecting links of harmony order conformity and design between the whole genus but there the resemblance ends man may be degraded to the very margin of the line which separates him from the brute by ignorance or he may be elevated to a communion with the great masterspirit of all by knowledge nay i know not if time and opportunity were given him but he might become the master of all learning and consequently equal to the great moving principle  the old man who stood leaning on his rifle in a thoughtful attitude shook his head as he answered with a native steadiness that entirely eclipsed the imposing air which his antagonist had seen fit to assume  this is neither more nor less than mortal wickedness here have i been a dweller on the earth for fourscore and six changes of the seasons and all that time have i lookd at the growing and the dying trees and yet do i not know the reasons why the bud starts under the summer sun or the leaf falls when it is pinchd by the frosts your larning though it is mans boast is folly in the eyes of him who sits in the clouds and looks down in sorrow at the pride and vanity of his creaturs many is the hour that ive passed lying in the shades of the woods or stretchd upon the hills of these open fields looking up into the blue skies where i could fancy the great one had taken his stand and was solemnising on the waywardness of man and brute below as i myself had often lookd at the ants tumbling over each other in their eagerness though in a way and a fashion more suited to his mightiness and power knowledge it is his plaything say you who think it so easy to climb into the judgmentseat above can you tell me any thing of the beginning and the end nay youre a dealer in ailings and cures what is life and what is death why does the eagle live so long and why is the time of the butterfly so short tell me a simpler thing why is this hound so uneasy while you who have passed your days in looking into books can see no reason to be disturbed  the doctor who had been a little astounded by the dignity and energy of the old man drew a long breath like a sullen wrestler who is just released from the throttling grasp of his antagonist and seized on the opportunity of the pause to reply  it is his instinct  and what is the gift of instinct  an inferior gradation of reason a sort of mysterious combination of thought and matter  and what is that which you call thought  venerable venator this is a method of reasoning which sets at nought the uses of definitions and such as i do assure you is not at all tolerated in the schools  then is there more cunning in your schools than i had thought for it is a certain method of showing them their vanity returned the trapper suddenly abandoning a discussion from which the naturalist was just beginning to anticipate great delight by turning to his dog whose restlessness he attempted to appease by playing with his ears this is foolish hector more like an untrained pup than a sensible hound one who has got his education by hard experience and not by nosing over the trails of other dogs as a boy in the settlements follows on the track of his masters be it right or be it wrong well friend you who can do so much are you equal to looking into the thicket or must i go in myself  the doctor again assumed his air of resolution and without further parlance proceeded to do as desired the dogs were so far restrained by the remonstrances of the old man as to confine their noise to low but oftenrepeated whinings when they saw the naturalist advance the pup however broke through all restraint and made a swift circuit around his person scenting the earth as he proceeded and then returning to his companion he howled aloud  the squatter and his brood have left a strong scent on the earth said the old man watching as he spoke for some signal from his learned pioneer to follow i hope yonder schoolbred man knows enough to remember the errand on which i have sent him  doctor battius had already disappeared in the bushes and the trapper was beginning to betray additional evidences of impatience when the person of the former was seen retiring from the thicket backwards with his face fastened on the place he had just left as if his look was bound in the thraldom of some charm  here is something skeery by the wildness of the creaturs countenance exclaimed the old man relinquishing his hold of hector and moving stoutly to the side of the totally unconscious naturalist how is it friend have you found a new leaf in your book of wisdom  it is a basilisk muttered the doctor whose altered visage betrayed the utter confusion which beset his faculties an animal of the order serpens i had thought its attributes were fabulous but mighty nature is equal to all that man can imagine  what ist what ist the snakes of the prairies are harmless unless it be now and then an angered rattler and he always gives you notice with his tail afore he works his mischief with his fangs lord lord what a humbling thing is fear here is one who in common delivers words too big for a humble mouth to hold so much beside himself that his voice is as shrill as the whistle of the whippoorwill couragewhat is it manwhat is it  a prodigy a lusus naturae a monster that nature has delighted to form in order to exhibit her power never before have i witnessed such an utter confusion in her laws or a specimen that so completely bids defiance to the distinctions of class and genera let me record its appearance fumbling for his tablets with hands that trembled too much to perform their office while time and opportunity are allowedeyes enthralling colour various complex and profound  one would think the man was crazd with his enthralling looks and pieballd colours interrupted the discontented trapper who began to grow a little uneasy that his party was all this time neglecting to seek the protection of some cover if there is a reptile in the brush show me the creatur and should it refuse to depart peaceably why there must be a quarrel for the possession of the place  there said the doctor pointing into a dense mass of the thicket to a spot within fifty feet of that where they both stood the trapper turned his look with perfect composure in the required direction but the instant his practised glance met the object which had so utterly upset the philosophy of the naturalist he gave a start himself threw his rifle rapidly forward and as instantly recovered it as if a second flash of thought convinced him he was wrong neither the instinctive movement nor the sudden recollection was without a sufficient object at the very margin of the thicket and in absolute contact with the earth lay an animate ball that might easily by the singularity and fierceness of its aspect have justified the disturbed condition of the naturalists mind it were difficult to describe the shape or colours of this extraordinary substance except to say in general terms that it was nearly spherical and exhibited all the hues of the rainbow intermingled without reference to harmony and without any very ostensible design the predominant hues were a black and a bright vermilion with these however the several tints of white yellow and crimson were strangely and wildly blended had this been all it would have been difficult to have pronounced that the object was possessed of life for it lay motionless as any stone but a pair of dark glaring and moving eyeballs which watched with jealousy the smallest movement of the trapper and his companion sufficiently established the important fact of its possessing vitality  your reptile is a scouter or im no judge of indian paints and indian deviltries muttered the old man dropping the butt of his weapon to the ground and gazing with a steady eye at the frightful object as he leaned on its barrel in an attitude of great composure he wants to face us out of sight and reason and make us think the head of a redskin is a stone covered with the autumn leaf or he has some other devilish artifice in his mind  is the animal human demanded the doctor of the genus homo i had fancied it a nondescript  its as human and as mortal too as a warrior of these prairies is ever known to be i have seen the time when a redskin would have shown a foolish daring to peep out of his ambushment in that fashion on a hunter i could name but who is too old now and too near his time to be any thing better than a miserable trapper it will be well to speak to the imp and to let him know he deals with men whose beards are grown come forth from your cover friend he continued in the language of the extensive tribes of the dahcotahs there is room on the prairie for another warrior  the eyes appeared to glare more fiercely than ever but the mass which according to the trappers opinion was neither more nor less than a human head shorn as usual among the warriors of the west of its hair still continued without motion or any other sign of life  it is a mistake exclaimed the doctor the animal is not even of the class mammalia much less a man  so much for your knowledge returned the trapper laughing with great exultation so much for the larning of one who has lookd into so many books that his eyes are not able to tell a moose from a wildcat now my hector here is a dog of education after his fashion and though the meanest primmer in the settlements would puzzle his information you could not cheat the hound in a matter like this as you think the object no man you shall see his whole formation and then let an ignorant old trapper who never willingly passd a day within reach of a spellingbook in his life know by what name to call it mind i mean no violence but just to start the devil from his ambushment  the trapper very deliberately examined the priming of his rifle taking care to make as great a parade as possible of his hostile intentions in going through the necessary evolutions with the weapon when he thought the stranger began to apprehend some danger he very deliberately presented the piece and called aloud  now friend i am all for peace or all for war as you may say no well it is no man as the wiser one here says and there can be no harm in just firing into a bunch of leaves  the muzzle of the rifle fell as he concluded and the weapon was gradually settling into a steady and what would easily have proved a fatal aim when a tall indian sprang from beneath that bed of leaves and brush which he had collected about his person at the approach of the party and stood upright uttering the exclamation  wagh     chapter xviii          my visor is philemons roof within the house is jove                                                    shakspeare  the trapper who had meditated no violence dropped his rifle again and laughing at the success of his experiment with great seeming selfcomplacency he drew the astounded gaze of the naturalist from the person of the savage to himself by saying  the imps will lie for hours like sleeping alligators brooding their deviltries in dreams and other craftiness until such time as they see some real danger is at hand and then they look to themselves the same as other mortals but this is a scouter in his warpaint there should be more of his tribe at no great distance let us draw the truth out of him for an unlucky warparty may prove more dangerous to us than a visit from the whole family of the squatter  it is truly a desperate and a dangerous species said the doctor relieving his amazement by a breath that seemed to exhaust his lungs of air a violent race and one that it is difficult to define or class within the usual boundaries of definitions speak to him therefore but let thy words be strong in amity  the old man cast a keen eye on every side of him to ascertain the important particular whether the stranger was supported by any associates and then making the usual signs of peace by exhibiting the palm of his naked hand he boldly advanced in the mean time the indian betrayed no evidence of uneasiness he suffered the trapper to draw nigh maintaining by his own mien and attitude a striking air of dignity and fearlessness perhaps the wary warrior also knew that owing to the difference in their weapons he should be placed more on an equality by being brought nearer to the strangers  as a description of this individual may furnish some idea of the personal appearance of a whole race it may be well to detain the narrative in order to present it to the reader in our hasty and imperfect manner would the truant eyes of alston or greenough turn but for a time from their gaze at the models of antiquity to contemplate this wronged and humbled people little would be left for such inferior artists as ourselves to delineate  the indian in question was in every particular a warrior of fine stature and admirable proportions as he cast aside his mask composed of such partycoloured leaves as he had hurriedly collected his countenance appeared in all the gravity the dignity and it may be added in the terror of his profession the outlines of his lineaments were strikingly noble and nearly approaching to roman though the secondary features of his face were slightly marked with the wellknown traces of his asiatic origin the peculiar tint of the skin which in itself is so well designed to aid the effect of a martial expression had received an additional aspect of wild ferocity from the colours of the warpaint but as if he disdained the usual artifices of his people he bore none of those strange and horrid devices with which the children of the forest are accustomed like the more civilised heroes of the moustache to back their reputation for courage contenting himself with a broad and deep shadowing of black that served as a sufficient and an admirable foil to the brighter gleamings of his native swarthiness his head was as usual shaved to the crown where a large and gallant scalplock seemed to challenge the grasp of his enemies the ornaments that were ordinarily pendant from the cartilages of his ears had been removed on account of his present pursuit his body notwithstanding the lateness of the season was nearly naked and the portion which was clad bore a vestment no warmer than a light robe of the finest dressed deerskin beautifully stained with the rude design of some daring exploit and which was carelessly worn as if more in pride than from any unmanly regard to comfort his leggings were of bright scarlet cloth the only evidence about his person that he had held communion with the traders of the palefaces but as if to furnish some offset to this solitary submission to a womanish vanity they were fearfully fringed from the gartered knee to the bottom of the moccasin with the hair of human scalps he leaned lightly with one hand on a short hickory bow while the other rather touched than sought support from the long delicate handle of an ashen lance a quiver made of the cougar skin from which the tail of the animal depended as a characteristic ornament was slung at his back and a shield of hides quaintly emblazoned with another of his warlike deeds was suspended from his neck by a thong of sinews  as the trapper approached this warrior maintained his calm upright attitude discovering neither an eagerness to ascertain the character of those who advanced upon him nor the smallest wish to avoid a scrutiny in his own person an eye that was darker and more shining than that of the stag was incessantly glancing however from one to another of the stranger party seemingly never knowing rest for an instant  is my brother far from his village demanded the old man in the pawnee language after examining the paint and those other little signs by which a practised eye knows the tribe of the warrior he encounters in the american deserts with the same readiness and by the same sort of mysterious observation as that by which the seaman knows the distant sail  it is farther to the towns of the bigknives was the laconic reply  why is a pawneeloup so far from the fork of his own river without a horse to journey on and in a spot empty as this  can the women and children of a paleface live without the meat of the bison there was hunger in my lodge  my brother is very young to be already the master of a lodge returned the trapper looking steadily into the unmoved countenance of the youthful warrior but i dare say he is brave and that many a chief has offered him his daughters for wives but he has been mistaken pointing to the arrow which was dangling from the hand that held the bow in bringing a loose and barbed arrowhead to kill the buffaloe do the pawnees wish the wounds they give their game to rankle  it is good to be ready for the sioux though not in sight a bush may hide him  the man is a living proof of the truth of his words muttered the trapper in english and a closejointed and gallant looking lad he is but far too young for a chief of any importance it is wise however to speak him fair for a single arm thrown into either party if we come to blows with the squatter and his brood may turn the day you see my children are weary he continued in the dialect of the prairies pointing as he spoke to the rest of the party who by this time were also approaching we wish to camp and eat does my brother claim this spot  the runners from the people on the bigriver tell us that your nation have traded with the tawneyfaces who live beyond the saltlake and that the prairies are now the hunting grounds of the bigknives  it is true as i hear also from the hunters and trappers on la platte though it is with the frenchers and not with the men who claim to own the mexicos that my people have bargained  and warriors are going up the longriver to see that they have not been cheated in what they have bought  ay that is partly true too i fear and it will not be long before an accursed band of choppers and loggers will be following on their heels to humble the wilderness which lies so broad and rich on the western banks of the mississippi and then the land will be a peopled desert from the shores of the main sea to the foot of the rocky mountains filld with all the abominations and craft of man and stript of the comforts and loveliness it received from the hands of the lord  and where were the chiefs of the pawneeloups when this bargain was made suddenly demanded the youthful warrior a look of startling fierceness gleaming at the same instant athwart his dark visage is a nation to be sold like the skin of a beaver  right enoughright enough and where were truth and honesty also but might is right according to the fashions of the arth and what the strong choose to do the weak must call justice if the law of the wahcondah was as much hearkened to pawnee as the laws of the longknives your right to the prairies would be as good as that of the greatest chief in the settlements to the house which covers his head  the skin of the traveller is white said the young native laying a finger impressively on the hard and wrinkled hand of the trapper does his heart say one thing and his tongue another  the wahcondah of a white man has ears and he shuts them to a lie look at my head it is like a frosted pine and must soon be laid in the ground why then should i wish to meet the great spirit face to face while his countenance is dark upon me  the pawnee gracefully threw his shield over one shoulder and placing a hand on his chest he bent his head in deference to the grey locks exhibited by the trapper after which his eye became more steady and his countenance less fierce still he maintained every appearance of a distrust and watchfulness that were rather tempered and subdued than forgotten when this equivocal species of amity was established between the warrior of the prairies and the experienced old trapper the latter proceeded to give his directions to paul concerning the arrangements of the contemplated halt while inez and ellen were dismounting and middleton and the beehunter were attending to their comforts the discourse was continued sometimes in the language of the natives but often as paul and the doctor mingled their opinions with the two principal speakers in the english tongue there was a keen and subtle trial of skill between the pawnee and the trapper in which each endeavoured to discover the objects of the other without betraying his own interest in the investigation as might be expected when the struggle was between adversaries so equal the result of the encounter answered the expectations of neither the latter had put all the interrogatories his ingenuity and practice could suggest concerning the state of the tribe of the loups their crops their store of provisions for the ensuing winter and their relations with their different warlike neighbours without extorting any answer which in the slightest degree elucidated the cause of his finding a solitary warrior so far from his people on the other hand while the questions of the indian were far more dignified and delicate they were equally ingenious he commented on the state of the trade in peltries spoke of the good or ill success of many white hunters whom he had either encountered or heard named and even alluded to the steady march which the nation of his great father as he cautiously termed the government of the states was making towards the huntinggrounds of his tribe it was apparent however by the singular mixture of interest contempt and indignation that were occasionally gleaming through the reserved manner of this warrior that he knew the strange people who were thus trespassing on his native rights much more by report than by any actual intercourse this personal ignorance of the whites was as much betrayed by the manner in which he regarded the females as by the brief but energetic expressions which occasionally escaped him  while speaking to the trapper he suffered his wandering glances to stray towards the intellectual and nearly infantile beauty of inez as one might be supposed to gaze upon the loveliness of an ethereal being it was very evident that he now saw for the first time one of those females of whom the fathers of his tribe so often spoke and who were considered of such rare excellence as to equal all that savage ingenuity could imagine in the way of loveliness his observation of ellen was less marked but notwithstanding the warlike and chastened expression of his eye there was much of the homage which man is made to pay to woman even in the more cursory look he sometimes turned on her maturer and perhaps more animated beauty this admiration however was so tempered by his habits and so smothered in the pride of a warrior as completely to elude every eye but that of the trapper who was too well skilled in indian customs and was too well instructed in the importance of rightly conceiving the character of the stranger to let the smallest trait or the most trifling of his movements escape him in the mean time the unconscious ellen herself moved about the feeble and less resolute inez with her accustomed assiduity and tenderness exhibiting in her frank features those changing emotions of joy and regret which occasionally beset her as her active mind dwelt on the decided step she had just taken with the contending doubts and hopes and possibly with some of the mental vacillation that was natural to her situation and sex  not so paul conceiving himself to have obtained the two things dearest to his heart the possession of ellen and a triumph over the sons of ishmael he now enacted his part in the business of the moment with as much coolness as though he was already leading his willing bride from solemnising their nuptials before a border magistrate to the security of his own dwelling he had hovered around the moving family during the tedious period of their weary march concealing himself by day and seeking interviews with his betrothed as opportunities offered in the manner already described until fortune and his own intrepidity had united to render him successful at the very moment when he was beginning to despair and he now cared neither for distance nor violence nor hardships to his sanguine fancy and determined resolution all the rest was easily to be achieved such were his feelings and such in truth they seemed to be with his cap cast on one side and whistling a low air he thrashed among the bushes in order to make a place suitable for the females to repose on while from time to time he cast an approving glance at the agile form of ellen as she tripped past him engaged in her own share of the duty  and so the wolftribe of the pawnees have buried the hatchet with their neighbours the konzas said the trapper pursuing a discourse which he had scarcely permitted to flag though it had been occasionally interrupted by the different directions with which he occasionally saw fit to interrupt it the reader will remember that while he spoke to the native warrior in his own tongue he necessarily addressed his white companions in english the loups and the lightfacd redskins are again friends doctor that is a tribe of which ill engage youve often read and of which many a round lie has been whispered in the ears of the ignorant people who live in the settlements there was a story of a nation of welshers that livd hereaway in the prairies and how they came into the land afore the uneasy minded man who first let in the christians to rob the heathens of their inheritance had ever dreamt that the sun set on a country as big as that it rose from and how they knew the white ways and spoke with white tongues and a thousand other follies and idle conceits  have i not heard of them exclaimed the naturalist dropping a piece of jerked bisons meat which he was rather roughly discussing at the moment i should be greatly ignorant not to have often dwelt with delight on so beautiful a theory and one which so triumphantly establishes two positions which i have often maintained are unanswerable even without such living testimony in their favourviz that this continent can claim a more remote affinity with civilisation than the time of columbus and that colour is the fruit of climate and condition and not a regulation of nature propound the latter question to this indian gentleman venerable hunter he is of a reddish tint himself and his opinion may be said to make us masters of the two sides of the disputed point  do you think a pawnee is a reader of books and a believer of printed lies like the idlers in the towns retorted the old man laughing but it may be as well to humour the likings of the man which after all it is quite possible are neither more nor less than his natural gift and therefore to be followed although they may be pitied what does my brother think all whom he sees here have pale skins but the pawnee warriors are red does he believe that man changes with the season and that the son is not like his father  the young warrior regarded his interrogator for a moment with a steady and deliberating eye then raising his finger upward he answered with dignity  the wahcondah pours the rain from his clouds when he speaks he shakes the lulls and the fire which scorches the trees is the anger of his eye but he fashioned his children with care and thought what he has thus made never alters  ay tis in the reason of natur that it should be so doctor continued the trapper when he had interpreted this answer to the disappointed naturalist the pawnees are a wise and a great people and ill engage they abound in many a wholesome and honest tradition the hunters and trappers that i sometimes see speak of a great warrior of your race  my tribe are not women a brave is no stranger in my village  ay but he they speak of most is a chief far beyond the renown of common warriors and one that might have done credit to that once mighty but now fallen people the delawares of the hills  such a warrior should have a name  they call him hardheart from the stoutness of his resolution and well is he named if all i have heard of his deeds be true  the stranger cast a glance which seemed to read the guileless soul of the old man as he demanded  has the paleface seen the partisan of my people  never it is not with me now as it used to be some forty years ago when warfare and bloodshed were my calling and my gifts  a loud shout from the reckless paul interrupted his speech and at the next moment the beehunter appeared leading an indian warhorse from the side of the thicket opposite to the one occupied by the party  here is a beast for a redskin to straddle he cried as he made the animal go through some of its wild paces theres not a brigadier in all kentucky that can call himself master of so sleek and welljointed a nag a spanish saddle too like a grandee of the mexicos and look at the mane and tail braided and platted down with little silver balls as if it were ellen herself getting her shining hair ready for a dance or a husking frolic isnt this a real trotter old trapper to eat out of the manger of a savage  softly lad softly the loups are famous for their horses and it is often that you see a warrior on the prairies far better mounted than a congressman in the settlements but this indeed is a beast that none but a powerful chief should ride the saddle as you rightly think has been sit upon in its day by a great spanish captain who has lost it and his life together in some of the battles which this people often fight against the southern provinces i warrant me i warrant me the youngster is the son of a great chief may be of the mighty hardheart himself  during this rude interruption to the discourse the young pawnee manifested neither impatience nor displeasure but when he thought his beast had been the subject of sufficient comment he very coolly and with the air of one accustomed to have his will respected relieved paul of the bridle and throwing the reins on the neck of the animal he sprang upon his back with the activity of a professor of the equestrian art nothing could be finer or firmer than the seat of the savage the highly wrought and cumbrous saddle was evidently more for show than use indeed it impeded rather than aided the action of limbs which disdained to seek assistance or admit of restraint from so womanish inventions as stirrups the horse which immediately began to prance was like its rider wild and untutored in all his motions but while there was so little of art there was all the freedom and grace of nature in the movements of both the animal was probably indebted to the blood of araby for its excellence through a long pedigree that embraced the steed of mexico the spanish barb and the moorish charger the rider in obtaining his steed from the provinces of centralamerica had also obtained that spirit and grace in controlling him which unite to form the most intrepid and perhaps the most skilful horseman in the world  notwithstanding this sudden occupation of his animal the pawnee discovered no hasty wish to depart more at his ease and possibly more independent now he found himself secure of the means of retreat he rode back and forth eyeing the different individuals of the party with far greater freedom than before but at each extremity of his ride just as the sagacious trapper expected to see him profit by his advantage and fly he would turn his horse and pass over the same ground sometimes with the rapidity of the flying deer and at others more slowly and with greater dignity of mien and attitude anxious to ascertain such facts as might have an influence on his future movements the old man determined to invite him to a renewal of their conference he therefore made a gesture expressive at the same time of his wish to resume the interrupted discourse and of his own pacific intentions the quick eye of the stranger was not slow to note the action but it was not until a sufficient time had passed to allow him to debate the prudence of the measure in his own mind that he seemed willing to trust himself again so near a party that was so much superior to himself in physical power and consequently one that was able at any instant to command his life or control his personal liberty when he did approach nigh enough to converse with facility it was with a singular mixture of haughtiness and of distrust  it is far to the village of the loups he said stretching his arm in a direction contrary to that in which the trapper well knew the tribe dwelt and the road is crooked what has the bigknife to say  ay crooked enough muttered the old man in english if you are to set out on your journey by that path but not half so winding as the cunning of an indians mind say my brother do the chiefs of the pawnees love to see strange faces in their lodges  the young warrior bent his body gracefully though but slightly over the saddlebow as he replied  when have my people forgotten to give food to the stranger  if i lead my daughters to the doors of the loups will the women take them by the hand and will the warriors smoke with my young men  the country of the palefaces is behind them why do they journey so far towards the setting sun have they lost the path or are these the women of the white warriors that i hear are wading up the river of the troubled waters  neither they who wade the missouri are the warriors of my great father who has sent them on his message but we are peacerunners the white men and the red are neighbours and they wish to be friendsdo not the omahaws visit the loups when the tomahawk is buried in the path between the two nations  the omahaws are welcome  and the yanktons and the burntwood tetons who live in the elbow of the river with muddy water do they not come into the lodges of the loups and smoke  the tetons are liars exclaimed the other they dare not shut their eyes in the night no they sleep in the sun see he added pointing with fierce triumph to the frightful ornaments of his leggings their scalps are so plenty that the pawnees tread on them go let a sioux live in banks of snow the plains and buffaloes are for men  ah the secret is out said the trapper to middleton who was an attentive because a deeply interested observer of what was passing this goodlooking young indian is scouting on the track of the siouxesyou may see it by his arrowheads and his paint ay and by his eye too for a redskin lets his natur follow the business he is on be it for peace or be it for warquiet hector quiet have you never scented a pawnee afore pupkeep down dogkeep downmy brother is right the siouxes are thieves men of all colours and nations say it of them and say it truly but the people from the rising sun are not siouxes and they wish to visit the lodges of the loups  the head of my brother is white returned the pawnee throwing one of those glances at the trapper which were so remarkably expressive of distrust intelligence and pride and then pointing as he continued towards the eastern horizon and his eyes have looked on many thingscan he tell me the name of what he sees yonderis it a buffaloe  it looks more like a cloud peeping above the skirt of the plain with the sunshine lighting its edges it is the smoke of the heavens  it is a hill of the earth and on its top are the lodges of palefaces let the women of my brother wash their feet among the people of their own colour  the eyes of a pawnee are good if he can see a whiteskin so far  the indian turned slowly towards the speaker and after a pause of a moment he sternly demanded  can my brother hunt  alas i claim to be no better than a miserable trapper  when the plain is covered with the buffaloes can he see them  no doubt no doubtit is far easier to see than to take a scampering bull  and when the birds are flying from the cold and the clouds are black with their feathers can he see them too  ay ay it is not hard to find a duck or a goose when millions are darkening the heavens  when the snow falls and covers the lodges of the longknives can the stranger see flakes in the air  my eyes are none of the best now returned the old man a little resentfully but the time has been when i had a name for my sight  the redskins find the bigknives as easily as the strangers see the buffaloe or the travelling birds or the falling snow your warriors think the master of life has made the whole earth white they are mistaken they are pale and it is their own faces that they see go a pawnee is not blind that he need look long for your people  the warrior suddenly paused and bent his face aside like one who listened with all his faculties absorbed in the act then turning the head of his horse he rode to the nearest angle of the thicket and looked intently across the bleak prairie in a direction opposite to the side on which the party stood returning slowly from this unaccountable and to his observers startling procedure he riveted his eyes on inez and paced back and forth several times with the air of one who maintained a warm struggle on some difficult point in the recesses of his own thoughts he had drawn the reins of his impatient steed and was seemingly about to speak when his head again sunk on his chest and he resumed his former attitude of attention galloping like a deer to the place of his former observations he rode for a moment swiftly in short and rapid circles as if still uncertain of his course and then darted away like a bird that had been fluttering around its nest before it takes a distant flight after scouring the plain for a minute he was lost to the eye behind a swell of the land  the hounds who had also manifested great uneasiness for some time followed him for a little distance and then terminated their chase by seating themselves on the ground and raising their usual low whining and warning howls     chapter xix                        how if he will not stand                                                    shakspeare  the several movements related in the close of the preceding chapter had passed in so short a space of time that the old man while he neglected not to note the smallest incident had no opportunity of expressing his opinion concerning the strangers motives after the pawnee had disappeared however he shook his head and muttered while he walked slowly to the angle of the thicket that the indian had just quitted  there are both scents and sounds in the air though my miserable senses are not good enough to hear the one or to catch the taint of the other  there is nothing to be seen cried middleton who kept close at his side my eyes and my ears are good and yet i can assure you that i neither hear nor see any thing  your eyes are good and you are not deaf returned the other with a slight air of contempt no lad no they may be good to see across a church or to hear a townbell but afore you had passed a year in these prairies you would find yourself taking a turkey for a buffaloe or conceiting fifty times that the roar of a buffaloe bull was the thunder of the lord there is a deception of natur in these naked plains in which the air throws up the images like water and then it is hard to tell the prairies from a sea but yonder is a sign that a hunter never fails to know  the trapper pointed to a flight of vultures that were sailing over the plain at no great distance and apparently in the direction in which the pawnee had riveted his eye at first middleton could not distinguish the small dark objects that were dotting the dusky clouds but as they came swiftly onward first their forms and then their heavy waving wings became distinctly visible  listen said the trapper when he had succeeded in making middleton see the moving column of birds now you hear the buffaloes or bisons as your knowing doctor sees fit to call them though buffaloes is their name among all the hunters of these regions and i conclude that a hunter is a better judge of a beast and of its name he added winking to the young soldier than any man who has turned over the leaves of a book instead of travelling over the face of the arth in order to find out the naturs of its inhabitants  of their habits i will grant you cried the naturalist who rarely missed an opportunity to agitate any disputed point in his favourite studies that is provided always deference is had to the proper use of definitions and that they are contemplated with scientific eyes  eyes of a mole as if mans eyes were not as good for names as the eyes of any other creatur who named the works of his hand can you tell me that with your books and college wisdom was it not the first man in the garden and is it not a plain consequence that his children inherit his gifts  that is certainly the mosaic account of the event said the doctor though your reading is by far too literal  my reading nay if you suppose that i have wasted my time in schools you do such a wrong to my knowledge as one mortal should never lay to the door of another without sufficient reason if i have ever craved the art of reading it has been that i might better know the sayings of the book you name for it is a book which speaks in every line according to human feelings and therein according to reason  and do you then believe said the doctor a little provoked by the dogmatism of his stubborn adversary and perhaps secretly too confident in his own more liberal though scarcely as profitable attainmentsdo you then believe that all these beasts were literally collected in a garden to be enrolled in the nomenclature of the first man  why not i understand your meaning for it is not needful to live in towns to hear all the devilish devices that the conceit of man can invent to upset his own happiness what does it prove except indeed it may be said to prove that the garden he made was not after the miserable fashions of our times thereby directly giving the lie to what the world calls its civilising no no the garden of the lord was the forest then and is the forest now where the fruits do grow and the birds do sing according to his own wise ordering now lady you may see the mystery of the vultures there come the buffaloes themselves and a noble herd it is i warrant me that pawnee has a troop of his people in some of the hollows nigh by and as he has gone scampering after them you are about to see a glorious chase it will serve to keep the squatter and his brood under cover and for ourselves there is little reason to fear a pawnee is not apt to be a malicious savage  every eye was now drawn to the striking spectacle that succeeded even the timid inez hastened to the side of middleton to gaze at the sight and paul summoned ellen from her culinary labours to become a witness of the lively scene  throughout the whole of those moving events which it has been our duty to record the prairies had lain in the majesty of perfect solitude the heavens had been blackened with the passage of the migratory birds it is true but the dogs of the party and the ass of the doctor were the only quadrupeds that had enlivened the broad surface of the waste beneath there was now a sudden exhibition of animal life which changed the scene as it were by magic to the very opposite extreme  a few enormous bison bulls were first observed scouring along the most distant roll of the prairie and then succeeded long files of single beasts which in their turns were followed by a dark mass of bodies until the duncoloured herbage of the plain was entirely lost in the deeper hue of their shaggy coats the herd as the column spread and thickened was like the endless flocks of the smaller birds whose extended flanks are so often seen to heave up out of the abyss of the heavens until they appear as countless as the leaves in those forests over which they wing their endless flight clouds of dust shot up in little columns from the centre of the mass as some animal more furious than the rest ploughed the plain with his horns and from time to time a deep hollow bellowing was borne along on the wind as if a thousand throats vented their plaints in a discordant murmuring  a long and musing silence reigned in the party as they gazed on this spectacle of wild and peculiar grandeur it was at length broken by the trapper who having been long accustomed to similar sights felt less of its influence or rather felt it in a less thrilling and absorbing manner than those to whom the scene was more novel  there go ten thousand oxen in one drove without keeper or master except him who made them and gave them these open plains for their pasture ay it is here that man may see the proofs of his wantonness and folly can the proudest governor in all the states go into his fields and slaughter a nobler bullock than is here offered to the meanest hand and when he has gotten his sirloin or his steak can he eat it with as good a relish as he who has sweetened his food with wholesome toil and earned it according to the law of natur by honestly mastering that which the lord hath put before him  if the prairie platter is smoking with a buffaloes hump i answer no interrupted the luxurious beehunter  ay boy you have tasted and you feel the genuine reasoning of the thing but the herd is heading a little thisaway and it behoves us to make ready for their visit if we hide ourselves altogether the horned brutes will break through the place and trample us beneath their feet like so many creeping worms so we will just put the weak ones apart and take post as becomes men and hunters in the van  as there was but little time to make the necessary arrangements the whole party set about them in good earnest inez and ellen were placed in the edge of the thicket on the side farthest from the approaching herd asinus was posted in the centre in consideration of his nerves and then the old man with his three male companions divided themselves in such a manner as they thought would enable them to turn the head of the rushing column should it chance to approach too nigh their position by the vacillating movements of some fifty or a hundred bulls that led the advance it remained questionable for many moments what course they intended to pursue but a tremendous and painful roar which came from behind the cloud of dust that rose in the centre of the herd and which was horridly answered by the screams of the carrion birds that were greedily sailing directly above the flying drove appeared to give a new impulse to their flight and at once to remove every symptom of indecision as if glad to seek the smallest signs of the forest the whole of the affrighted herd became steady in its direction rushing in a straight line toward the little cover of bushes which has already been so often named  the appearance of danger was now in reality of a character to try the stoutest nerves the flanks of the dark moving mass were advanced in such a manner as to make a concave line of the front and every fierce eye that was glaring from the shaggy wilderness of hair in which the entire heads of the males were enveloped was riveted with mad anxiety on the thicket it seemed as if each beast strove to outstrip his neighbour in gaining this desired cover and as thousands in the rear pressed blindly on those in front there was the appearance of an imminent risk that the leaders of the herd would be precipitated on the concealed party in which case the destruction of every one of them was certain each of our adventurers felt the danger of his situation in a manner peculiar to his individual character and circumstances  middleton wavered at times he felt inclined to rush through the bushes and seizing inez attempt to fly then recollecting the impossibility of outstripping the furious speed of an alarmed bison he felt for his arms determined to make head against the countless drove the faculties of dr battius were quickly wrought up to the very summit of mental delusion the dark forms of the herd lost their distinctness and then the naturalist began to fancy he beheld a wild collection of all the creatures of the world rushing upon him in a body as if to revenge the various injuries which in the course of a life of indefatigable labour in behalf of the natural sciences he had inflicted on their several genera the paralysis it occasioned in his system was like the effect of the incubus equally unable to fly or to advance he stood riveted to the spot until the infatuation became so complete that the worthy naturalist was beginning by a desperate effort of scientific resolution even to class the different specimens on the other hand paul shouted and called on ellen to come and assist him in shouting but his voice was lost in the bellowings and trampling of the herd furious and yet strangely excited by the obstinacy of the brutes and the wildness of the sight and nearly maddened by sympathy and a species of unconscious apprehension in which the claims of nature were singularly mingled with concern for his mistress he nearly split his throat in exhorting his aged friend to interfere  come forth old trapper he shouted with your prairie inventions or we shall be all smothered under a mountain of buffaloe humps  the old man who had stood all this while leaning on his rifle and regarding the movements of the herd with a steady eye now deemed it time to strike his blow levelling his piece at the foremost bull with an agility that would have done credit to his youth he fired the animal received the bullet on the matted hair between his horns and fell to his knees but shaking his head he instantly arose the very shock seeming to increase his exertions there was now no longer time to hesitate throwing down his rifle the trapper stretched forth his arms and advanced from the cover with naked hands directly towards the rushing column of the beasts  the figure of a man when sustained by the firmness and steadiness that intellect can only impart rarely fails of commanding respect from all the inferior animals of the creation the leading bulls recoiled and for a single instant there was a sudden stop to their speed a dense mass of bodies rolling up in front until hundreds were seen floundering and tumbling on the plain then came another of those hollow bellowings from the rear and set the herd again in motion the head of the column however divided the immovable form of the trapper cutting it as it were into two gliding streams of life middleton and paul instantly profited by his example and extended the feeble barrier by a similar exhibition of their own persons  for a few moments the new impulse given to the animals in front served to protect the thicket but as the body of the herd pressed more and more upon the open line of its defenders and the dust thickened so as to obscure their persons there was at each instant a renewed danger of the beasts breaking through it became necessary for the trapper and his companions to become still more and more alert and they were gradually yielding before the headlong multitude when a furious bull darted by middleton so near as to brush his person and at the next instant swept through the thicket with the velocity of the wind  close and die for the ground shouted the old man or a thousand of the devils will be at his heels  all their efforts would have proved fruitless however against the living torrent had not asinus whose domains had just been so rudely entered lifted his voice in the midst of the uproar the most sturdy and furious of the bulls trembled at the alarming and unknown cry and then each individual brute was seen madly pressing from that very thicket which the moment before he had endeavoured to reach with the eagerness with which the murderer seeks the sanctuary  as the stream divided the place became clear the two dark columns moving obliquely from the copse to unite again at the distance of a mile on its opposite side the instant the old man saw the sudden effect which the voice of asinus had produced he coolly commenced reloading his rifle indulging at the same time in a heartfelt fit of his silent and peculiar merriment  there they go like dogs with so many halffilled shotpouches dangling at their tails and no fear of their breaking their order for what the brutes in the rear didnt hear with their own ears theyll conceit they did besides if they change their minds it may be no hard matter to get the jack to sing the rest of his tune  the ass has spoken but balaam is silent cried the beehunter catching his breath after a repeated burst of noisy mirth that might possibly have added to the panic of the buffaloes by its vociferation the man is as completely dumbfounded as if a swarm of young bees had settled on the end of his tongue and he not willing to speak for fear of their answer  how now friend continued the trapper addressing the still motionless and entranced naturalist how now friend are you who make your livelihood by booking the names and naturs of the beasts of the fields and the fowls of the air frightened at a herd of scampering buffaloes though perhaps you are ready to dispute my right to call them by a word that is in the mouth of every hunter and trader on the frontier  the old man was however mistaken in supposing he could excite the benumbed faculties of the doctor by provoking a discussion from that time henceforth he was never known except on one occasion to utter a word that indicated either the species or the genus of the animal he obstinately refused the nutritious food of the whole ox family and even to the present hour now that he is established in all the scientific dignity and security of a savant in one of the maritime towns he turns his back with a shudder on those delicious and unrivalled viands that are so often seen at the suppers of the craft and which are unequalled by any thing that is served under the same name at the boasted chophouses of london or at the most renowned of the parisian restaurants in short the distaste of the worthy naturalist for beef was not unlike that which the shepherd sometimes produces by first muzzling and fettering his delinquent dog and then leaving him as a stepping stone for the whole flock to use in its transit over a wall or through the opening of a sheepfold a process which is said to produce in the culprit a species of surfeit on the subject of mutton for ever after by the time paul and the trapper saw fit to terminate the fresh bursts of merriment which the continued abstraction of their learned companion did not fail to excite he commenced breathing again as if the suspended action of his lungs had been renewed by the application of a pair of artificial bellows and was heard to make use of the ever afterwards proscribed term on that solitary occasion to which we have just alluded  boves americani horridi exclaimed the doctor laying great stress on the latter word after which he continued mute like one who pondered on strange and unaccountable events  ay horrid eyes enough i will willingly allow returned the trapper and altogether the creatur has a frightful look to one unused to the sights and bustle of a natural life but then the courage of the beast is in no way equal to its countenance lord man if you should once get fairly beset by a brood of grizzly bears as happened to hector and i at the great falls of the missah here comes the tail of the herd and yonder goes a pack of hungry wolves ready to pick up the sick or such as get a disjointed neck by a tumble ha there are mounted men on their trail or im no sinner here lad you may see them hereaway just where the dust is scattering afore the wind they are hovering around a wounded buffaloe making an end of the surly devil with their arrows  middleton and paul soon caught a glimpse of the dark group that the quick eye of the old man had so readily detected some fifteen or twenty horsemen were in truth to be seen riding in quick circuits about a noble bull which stood at bay too grievously hurt to fly and yet seeming to disdain to fall notwithstanding his hardy body had already been the target for a hundred arrows a thrust from the lance of a powerful indian however completed his conquest and the brute gave up his obstinate hold of life with a roar that passed bellowing over the place where our adventurers stood and reaching the ears of the affrighted herd added a new impulse to their flight  how well the pawnee knew the philosophy of a buffaloe hunt said the old man after he had stood regarding the animated scene for a few moments with evident satisfaction you saw how he went off like the wind before the drove it was in order that he might not taint the air and that he might turn the flank and joinha how is this yonder redskins are no pawnees the feathers in their heads are from the wings and tails of owlsah as i am but a miserable halfsighted trapper it is a band of the accursed siouxes to cover lads to cover a single cast of an eye thisaway would strip us of every rag of clothes as surely as the lightning scorches the bush and it might be that our very lives would be far from safe  middleton had already turned from the spectacle to seek that which pleased him better the sight of his young and beautiful bride paul seized the doctor by the arm and as the trapper followed with the smallest possible delay the whole party was quickly collected within the cover of the thicket after a few short explanations concerning the character of this new danger the old man on whom the whole duty of directing their movements was devolved in deference to his great experience continued his discourse as follows  this is a region as you must all know where a strong arm is far better than the right and where the white law is as little known as needed therefore does every thing now depend on judgment and power if he continued laying his finger on his cheek like one who considered deeply all sides of the embarrassing situation in which he found himselfif an invention could be framed which would set these siouxes and the brood of the squatter by the ears then might we come in like the buzzards after a fight atween the beasts and pick up the gleanings of the groundthere are pawnees nigh us too it is a certain matter for yonder lad is not so far from his village without an errand here are therefore four parties within sound of a cannon not one of whom can trust the other all which makes movement a little difficult in a district where covers are far from plenty but we are three wellarmed and i think i may see three stouthearted men  four interrupted paul  anan said the old man looking up simply at his companion  four repeated the beehunter pointing to the naturalist  every army has its hangerson and idlers rejoined the blunt borderman friend it will be necessary to slaughter this ass  to slay asinus such a deed would be an act of supererogatory cruelty  i know nothing of your words which hide their meaning in sound but that is cruel which sacrifices a christian to a brute this is what i call the reason of mercy it would be just as safe to blow a trumpet as to let the animal raise his voice again inasmuch as it would prove a manifest challenge to the siouxes  i will answer for the discretion of asinus who seldom speaks without a reason  they say a man can be known by the company he keeps retorted the old man and why not a brute i once made a forced march and went through a great deal of jeopardy with a companion who never opened his mouth but to sing and trouble enough and great concern of mind did the fellow give me it was in that very business with your grandther captain but then he had a human throat and well did he know how to use it on occasion though he didnt always stop to regard the time and seasons fit for such outcries ahs me if i was now as i was then it wouldnt be a band of thieving siouxes that should easily drive me from such a lodgment as this but what signifies boasting when sight and strength are both failing the warrior that the delawares once saw fit to call after the hawk for the goodness of his eyes would now be better termed the mole in my judgment therefore it will be well to slay the brute  theres argument and good logic in it said paul music is music and its always noisy whether it comes from a fiddle or a jackass therefore i agree with the old man and say kill the beast  friends said the naturalist looking with a sorrowful eye from one to another of his bloodily disposed companions slay not asinus he is a specimen of his kind of whom much good and little evil can be said hardy and docile for his genus abstemious and patient even for his humble species we have journeyed much together and his death would grieve me how would it trouble thy spirit venerable venator to separate in such an untimely manner from your faithful hound  the animal shall not die said the old man suddenly clearing his throat in a manner that proved he felt the force of the appeal but his voice must be smothered bind his jaws with the halter and then i think we may trust the rest to providence  with this double security for the discretion of asinus for paul instantly bound the muzzle of the ass in the manner required the trapper seemed content after which he proceeded to the margin of the thicket to reconnoitre  the uproar which attended the passage of the herd was now gone or rather it was heard rolling along the prairie at the distance of a mile the clouds of dust were already blown away by the wind and a clear range was left to the eye in that place where ten minutes before there existed a scene of so much wildness and confusion  the siouxes had completed their conquest and apparently satisfied with this addition to the numerous previous captures they had made they now seemed content to let the remainder of the herd escape a dozen remained around the carcass over which a few buzzards were balancing themselves with steady wings and greedy eyes while the rest were riding about in quest of such further booty as might come in their way on the trail of so vast a drove the trapper measured the proportions and scanned the equipments of such individuals as drew nearer to the side of the thicket with careful eyes at length he pointed out one among them to middleton as weucha  now know we not only who they are but their errand the old man continued deliberately shaking his head they have lost the trail of the squatter and are on its hunt these buffaloes have crossed their path and in chasing the animals bad luck has led them in open sight of the hill on which the brood of ishmael have harboured do you see yon birds watching for the offals of the beast they have killed therein is a moral which teaches the manner of a prairie life a band of pawnees are outlying for these very siouxes as you see the buzzards looking down for their food and it behoves us as christian men who have so much at stake to look down upon them both ha what brings yonder two skirting reptiles to a stand as you live they have found the place where the miserable son of the squatter met his death  the old man was not mistaken weucha and a savage who accompanied him had reached that spot which has already been mentioned as furnishing the frightful evidences of violence and bloodshed there they sat on their horses examining the wellknown signs with the intelligence that distinguishes the habits of indians their scrutiny was long and apparently not without distrust at length they raised a cry that was scarcely less piteous and startling than that which the hounds had before made over the same fatal signs and which did not fail to draw the whole band immediately around them as the fell bark of the jackal is said to gather his comrades to the chase     chapter xx                         welcome ancient pistol                                                    shakspeare  it was not long before the trapper pointed out the commanding person of mahtoree as the leader of the siouxes this chief who had been among the last to obey the vociferous summons of weucha no sooner reached the spot where his whole party was now gathered than he threw himself from his horse and proceeded to examine the marks of the extraordinary trail with that degree of dignity and attention which became his high and responsible station the warriors for it was but too evident that they were to a man of that fearless and ruthless class awaited the result of his investigation with patient reserve none but a few of the principal braves presuming even to speak while their leader was thus gravely occupied it was several minutes before mahtoree seemed satisfied he then directed his eyes along the ground to those several places where ishmael had found the same revolting evidences of the passage of some bloody struggle and motioned to his people to follow  the whole band advanced in a body towards the thicket until they came to a halt within a few yards of the precise spot where esther had stimulated her sluggish sons to break into the cover the reader will readily imagine that the trapper and his companions were not indifferent observers of so threatening a movement the old man summoned all who were capable of bearing arms to his side and demanded in very unequivocal terms though in a voice that was suitably lowered in order to escape the ears of their dangerous neighbours whether they were disposed to make battle for their liberty or whether they should try the milder expedient of conciliation as it was a subject in which all had an equal interest he put the question as to a council of war and not without some slight exhibition of the lingering vestiges of a nearly extinct military pride paul and the doctor were diametrically opposed to each other in opinion the former declaring for an immediate appeal to arms and the latter was warmly espousing the policy of pacific measures middleton who saw that there was great danger of a hot verbal dispute between two men who were governed by feelings so diametrically opposed saw fit to assume the office of arbiter or rather to decide the question his situation making him a sort of umpire he also leaned to the side of peace for he evidently saw that in consequence of the vast superiority of their enemies violence would irretrievably lead to their destruction  the trapper listened to the reasons of the young soldier with great attention and as they were given with the steadiness of one who did not suffer apprehension to blind his judgment they did not fail to produce a suitable impression  it is rational rejoined the trapper when the other had delivered his reasons it is very rational for what man cannot move with his strength he must circumvent with his wits it is reason that makes him stronger than the buffaloe and swifter than the moose now stay you here and keep yourselves close my life and my traps are but of little value when the welfare of so many human souls are concerned and moreover i may say that i know the windings of indian cunning therefore will i go alone upon the prairie it may so happen that i can yet draw the eyes of a sioux from this spot and give you time and room to fly  as if resolved to listen to no remonstrance the old man quietly shouldered his rifle and moving leisurely through the thicket he issued on the plain at a point whence he might first appear before the eyes of the siouxes without exciting their suspicions that he came from its cover  the instant that the figure of a man dressed in the garb of a hunter and bearing the well known and much dreaded rifle appeared before the eyes of the siouxes there was a sensible though a suppressed sensation in the band the artifice of the trapper had so far succeeded as to render it extremely doubtful whether he came from some point on the open prairie or from the thicket though the indians still continued to cast frequent and suspicious glances at the cover they had made their halt at the distance of an arrowflight from the bushes but when the stranger came sufficiently nigh to show that the deep coating of red and brown which time and exposure had given to his features was laid upon the original colour of a paleface they slowly receded from the spot until they reached a distance that might defeat the aim of firearms  in the mean time the old man continued to advance until he had got nigh enough to make himself heard without difficulty here he stopped and dropping his rifle to the earth he raised his hand with the palm outward in token of peace after uttering a few words of reproach to his hound who watched the savage group with eyes that seemed to recognise them he spoke in the sioux tongue  my brothers are welcome he said cunningly constituting himself the master of the region in which they had met and assuming the offices of hospitality they are far from their villages and are hungry will they follow to my lodge to eat and sleep  no sooner was his voice heard than the yell of pleasure which burst from a dozen mouths convinced the sagacious trapper that he also was recognised feeling that it was too late to retreat he profited by the confusion which prevailed among them while weucha was explaining his character to advance until he was again face to face with the redoubtable mahtoree the second interview between these two men each of whom was extraordinary in his way was marked by the usual caution of the frontiers they stood for nearly a minute examining each other without speaking  where are your young men sternly demanded the teton chieftain after he found that the immovable features of the trapper refused to betray any of their masters secrets under his intimidating look  the longknives do not come in bands to trap the beaver i am alone  your head is white but you have a forked tongue mahtoree has been in your camp he knows that you are not alone where is your young wife and the warrior that i found upon the prairie  i have no wife i have told my brother that the woman and her friend were strangers the words of a grey head should be heard and not forgotten the dahcotahs found travellers asleep and they thought they had no need of horses the women and children of a paleface are not used to go far on foot let them be sought where you left them  the eyes of the teton flashed fire as he answered  they are gone but mahtoree is a wise chief and his eyes can see a great distance  does the partisan of the tetons see men on these naked fields retorted the trapper with great steadiness of mien i am very old and my eyes grow dim where do they stand the chief remained silent a moment as if he disdained to contest any further the truth of a fact concerning which he was already satisfied then pointing to the traces on the earth he said with a sudden transition to mildness in his eye and manner  my father has learnt wisdom in many winters can he tell me whose moccasin has left this trail  there have been wolves and buffaloes on the prairies and there may have been cougars too  mahtoree glanced his eye at the thicket as if he thought the latter suggestion not impossible pointing to the place he ordered his young men to reconnoitre it more closely cautioning them at the same time with a stern look at the trapper to beware of treachery from the bigknives three or four halfnaked eagerlooking youths lashed their horses at the word and darted away to obey the mandate the old man trembled a little for the discretion of paul when he saw this demonstration the tetons encircled the place two or three times approaching nigher and nigher at each circuit and then galloped back to their leader to report that the copse seemed empty notwithstanding the trapper watched the eye of mahtoree to detect the inward movements of his mind and if possible to anticipate in order to direct his suspicions the utmost sagacity of one so long accustomed to study the cold habits of the indian race could however detect no symptom or expression that denoted how far he credited or distrusted this intelligence instead of replying to the information of his scouts he spoke kindly to his horse and motioning to a youth to receive the bridle or rather halter by which he governed the animal he took the trapper by the arm and led him a little apart from the rest of the band  has my brother been a warrior said the wily teton in a tone that he intended should be conciliating  do the leaves cover the trees in the season of fruits go the dahcotahs have not seen as many warriors living as i have looked on in their blood but what signifies idle remembrancing he added in english when limbs grow stiff and sight is failing  the chief regarded him a moment with a severe look as if he would lay bare the falsehood he had heard but meeting in the calm eye and steady mien of the trapper a confirmation of the truth of what he said he took the hand of the old man and laid it gently on his head in token of the respect that was due to the others years and experience  why then do the bigknives tell their red brethren to bury the tomahawk he said when their own young men never forget that they are braves and meet each other so often with bloody hands  my nation is more numerous than the buffaloes on the prairies or the pigeons in the air their quarrels are frequent yet their warriors are few none go out on the warpath but they who are gifted with the qualities of a brave and therefore such see many battles  it is not somy father is mistaken returned mahtoree indulging in a smile of exulting penetration at the very instant he corrected the force of his denial in deference to the years and services of one so aged the bigknives are very wise and they are men all of them would be warriors they would leave the redskins to dig roots and hoe the corn but a dahcotah is not born to live like a woman he must strike the pawnee and the omahaw or he will lose the name of his fathers  the master of life looks with an open eye on his children who die in a battle that is fought for the right but he is blind and his ears are shut to the cries of an indian who is killed when plundering or doing evil to his neighbour  my father is old said mahtoree looking at his aged companion with an expression of irony that sufficiently denoted he was one of those who overstep the trammels of education and who are perhaps a little given to abuse the mental liberty they thus obtain he is very old has he made a journey to the far country and has he been at the trouble to come back to tell the young men what he has seen  teton returned the trapper throwing the breach of his rifle to the earth with startling vehemence and regarding his companion with steady serenity i have heard that there are men among my people who study their great medicines until they believe themselves to be gods and who laugh at all faith except in their own vanities it may be true it is true for i have seen them when man is shut up in towns and schools with his own follies it may be easy to believe himself greater than the master of life but a warrior who lives in a house with the clouds for its roof where he can at any moment look both at the heavens and at the earth and who daily sees the power of the great spirit should be more humble a dahcotah chieftain ought to be too wise to laugh at justice  the crafty mahtoree who saw that his freethinking was not likely to produce a favourable impression on the old man instantly changed his ground by alluding to the more immediate subject of their interview laying his hand gently on the shoulder of the trapper he led him forward until they both stood within fifty feet of the margin of the thicket here he fastened his penetrating eyes on the others honest countenance and continued the discourse  if my father has hid his young men in the bush let him tell them to come forth you see that a dahcotah is not afraid mahtoree is a great chief a warrior whose head is white and who is about to go to the land of spirits cannot have a tongue with two ends like a serpent  dahcotah i have told no lie since the great spirit made me a man i have lived in the wilderness or on these naked plains without lodge or family i am a hunter and go on my path alone  my father has a good carabine let him point it in the bush and fire  the old man hesitated a moment and then slowly prepared himself to give this delicate assurance of the truth of what he said without which he plainly perceived the suspicions of his crafty companion could not be lulled as he lowered his rifle his eye although greatly dimmed and weakened by age ran over the confused collection of objects that lay embedded amid the partycoloured foliage of the thicket until it succeeded in catching a glimpse of the brown covering of the stem of a small tree with this object in view he raised the piece to a level and fired the bullet had no sooner glided from the barrel than a tremor seized the hands of the trapper which had it occurred a moment sooner would have utterly disqualified him for so hazardous an experiment a frightful silence succeeded the report during which he expected to hear the shrieks of the females and then as the smoke whirled away in the wind he caught a view of the fluttering bark and felt assured that all his former skill was not entirely departed from him dropping the piece to the earth he turned again to his companion with an air of the utmost composure and demanded  is my brother satisfied  mahtoree is a chief of the dahcotahs returned the cunning teton laying his hand on his chest in acknowledgment of the others sincerity he knows that a warrior who has smoked at so many councilfires until his head has grown white would not be found in wicked company but did not my father once ride on a horse like a rich chief of the palefaces instead of travelling on foot like a hungry konza  never the wahcondah has given me legs and he has given me resolution to use them for sixty summers and winters did i journey in the woods of america and ten tiresome years have i dwelt on these open fields without finding need to call often upon the gifts of the other creaturs of the lord to carry me from place to place  if my father has so long lived in the shade why has he come upon the prairies the sun will scorch him  the old man looked sorrowfully about for a moment and then turning with a confidential air to the other he replied  i passed the spring summer and autumn of life among the trees the winter of my days had come and found me where i loved to be in the quietay and in the honesty of the woods teton then i slept happily where my eyes could look up through the branches of the pines and the beeches to the very dwelling of the good spirit of my people if i had need to open my heart to him while his fires were burning above my head the door was open and before my eyes but the axes of the choppers awoke me for a long time my ears heard nothing but the uproar of clearings i bore it like a warrior and a man there was a reason that i should bear it but when that reason was ended i bethought me to get beyond the accursed sounds it was trying to the courage and to the habits but i had heard of these vast and naked fields and i came hither to escape the wasteful temper of my people tell me dahcotah have i not done well  the trapper laid his long lean finger on the naked shoulder of the indian as he ended and seemed to demand his felicitations on his ingenuity and success with a ghastly smile in which triumph was singularly blended with regret his companion listened intently and replied to the question by saying in the sententious manner of his race  the head of my father is very grey he has always lived with men and he has seen everything what he does is good what he speaks is wise now let him say is he sure that he is a stranger to the bigknives who are looking for their beasts on every side of the prairies and cannot find them  dahcotah what i have said is true i live alone and never do i mingle with men whose skins are white if  his mouth was suddenly closed by an interruption that was as mortifying as it was unexpected the words were still on his tongue when the bushes on the side of the thicket where they stood opened and the whole of the party whom he had just left and in whose behalf he was endeavouring to reconcile his love of truth to the necessity of prevaricating came openly into view a pause of mute astonishment succeeded this unlookedfor spectacle then mahtoree who did not suffer a muscle or a joint to betray the wonder and surprise he actually experienced motioned towards the advancing friends of the trapper with an air of assumed civility and a smile that lighted his fierce dark visage as the glare of the setting sun reveals the volume and load of the cloud that is charged to bursting with the electric fluid he however disdained to speak or to give any other evidence of his intentions than by calling to his side the distant band who sprang forward at his beck with the alacrity of willing subordinates  in the mean time the friends of the old man continued to advance middleton himself was foremost supporting the light and aerial looking figure of inez on whose anxious countenance he cast such occasional glances of tender interest as in similar circumstances a father would have given to his child paul led ellen close in their rear but while the eye of the beehunter did not neglect his blooming companion it scowled angrily resembling more the aspect of the sullen and retreating bear than the soft intelligence of a favoured suitor obed and asinus came last the former leading his companion with a degree of fondness that could hardly be said to be exceeded by any other of the party the approach of the naturalist was far less rapid than that of those who preceded him his feet seemed equally reluctant to advance or to remain stationary his position bearing a great analogy to that of mahomets coffin with the exception that the quality of repulsion rather than that of attraction held him in a state of rest the repulsive power in his rear however appeared to predominate and by a singular exception as he would have said himself to all philosophical principles it rather increased than diminished by distance as the eyes of the naturalist steadily maintained a position that was the opposite of his route they served to give a direction to those of the observers of all these movements and at once furnished a sufficient clue by which to unravel the mystery of so sudden a debouchement from the cover  another cluster of stout and armed men was seen at no great distance just rounding a point of the thicket and moving directly though cautiously towards the place where the band of the siouxes was posted as a squadron of cruisers is often seen to steer across the waste of waters towards the rich but wellprotected convoy in short the family of the squatter or at least such among them as were capable of bearing arms appeared in view on the broad prairie evidently bent on revenging their wrongs  mahtoree and his party slowly retired from the thicket the moment they caught a view of the strangers until they halted on a swell that commanded a wide and unobstructed view of the naked fields on which they stood here the dahcotah appeared disposed to make his stand and to bring matters to an issue notwithstanding this retreat in which he compelled the trapper to accompany him middleton still advanced until he too halted on the same elevation and within speaking distance of the warlike siouxes the borderers in their turn took a favourable position though at a much greater distance the three groups now resembled so many fleets at sea lying with their topsails to the masts with the commendable precaution of reconnoitring before each could ascertain who among the strangers might be considered as friends and who as foes  during this moment of suspense the dark threatening eye of mahtoree rolled from one of the strange parties to the other in keen and hasty examination and then it turned its withering look on the old man as the chief said in a tone of high and bitter scorn  the bigknives are fools it is easier to catch the cougar asleep than to find a blind dahcotah did the white head think to ride on the horse of a sioux  the trapper who had found time to collect his perplexed faculties saw at once that middleton having perceived ishmael on the trail by which they had fled preferred trusting to the hospitality of the savages than to the treatment he would be likely to receive from the hands of the squatter he therefore disposed himself to clear the way for the favourable reception of his friends since he found that the unnatural coalition became necessary to secure the liberty if not the lives of the party  did my brother ever go on a warpath to strike my people he calmly demanded of the indignant chief who still awaited his reply  the lowering aspect of the teton warrior so far lost its severity as to suffer a gleam of pleasure and triumph to lighten its ferocity as sweeping his arm in an entire circle around his person he answered  what tribe or nation has not felt the blows of the dahcotahs mahtoree is their partisan  and has he found the bigknives women or has he found them men  a multitude of fierce passions were struggling in the tawny countenance of the indian for a moment inextinguishable hatred seemed to hold the mastery and then a nobler expression and one that better became the character of a brave got possession of his features and maintained itself until first throwing aside his light robe of pictured deerskin and pointing to the scar of a bayonet in his breast he replied  it was given as it was taken face to face  it is enough my brother is a brave chief and he should be wise let him look is that a warrior of the palefaces was it one such as that who gave the great dahcotah his hurt  the eyes of mahtoree followed the direction of the old mans extended arm until they rested on the drooping form of inez the look of the teton was long riveted and admiring like that of the young pawnee it resembled more the gaze of a mortal on some heavenly image than the admiration with which man is wont to contemplate even the loveliness of woman starting as if suddenly selfconvicted of forgetfulness the chief next turned his eyes on ellen where they lingered an instant with a much more intelligible expression of admiration and then pursued their course until they had taken another glance at each individual of the party  my brother sees that my tongue is not forked continued the trapper watching the emotions the other betrayed with a readiness of comprehension little inferior to that of the teton himself the bigknives do not send their women to war i know that the dahcotahs will smoke with the strangers  mahtoree is a great chief the bigknives are welcome said the teton laying his hand on his breast with an air of lofty politeness that would have done credit to any state of society the arrows of my young men are in their quivers  the trapper motioned to middleton to approach and in a few moments the two parties were blended in one each of the males having exchanged friendly greetings after the fashions of the prairie warriors but even while engaged in this hospitable manner the dahcotah did not fail to keep a strict watch on the more distant party of white men as if he still distrusted an artifice or sought further explanation the old man in his turn perceived the necessity of being more explicit and of securing the slight and equivocal advantage he had already obtained while affecting to examine the group which still lingered at the spot where it had first halted as if to discover the characters of those who composed it he plainly saw that ishmael contemplated immediate hostilities the result of a conflict on the open prairie between a dozen resolute border men and the halfarmed natives even though seconded by their white allies was in his experienced judgment a point of great uncertainty and though far from reluctant to engage in the struggle on account of himself the aged trapper thought it far more worthy of his years and his character to avoid than to court the contest his feelings were for obvious reasons in accordance with those of paul and middleton who had lives still more precious than their own to watch over and protect in this dilemma the three consulted on the means of escaping the frightful consequences which might immediately follow a single act of hostility on the part of the borderers the old man taking care that their communication should in the eyes of those who noted the expression of their countenances with jealous watchfulness bear the appearance of explanations as to the reason why such a party of travellers was met so far in the deserts  i know that the dahcotahs are a wise and great people at length the trapper commenced again addressing himself to the chief but does not their partisan know a single brother who is base  the eye of mahtoree wandered proudly around his band but rested a moment reluctantly on weucha as he answered  the master of life has made chiefs and warriors and women conceiving that he thus embraced all the gradations of human excellence from the highest to the lowest  and he has also made palefaces who are wicked such are they whom my brother sees yonder  do they go on foot to do wrong demanded the teton with a wild gleam from his eyes that sufficiently betrayed how well he knew the reason why they were reduced to so humble an expedient  their beasts are gone but their powder and their lead and their blankets remain  do they carry their riches in their hands like miserable konzas or are they brave and leave them with the women as men should do who know where to find what they lose  my brother sees the spot of blue across the prairie look the sun has touched it for the last time today  mahtoree is not a mole  it is a rock on it are the goods of the bigknives  an expression of savage joy shot into the dark countenance of the teton as he listened turning to the old man he seemed to read his soul as if to assure himself he was not deceived then he bent his look on the party of ishmael and counted its number  one warrior is wanting he said  does my brother see the buzzards there is his grave did he find blood on the prairie it was his  enough mahtoree is a wise chief put your women on the horses of the dahcotahs we shall see for our eyes are open very wide  the trapper wasted no unnecessary words in explanation familiar with the brevity and promptitude of the natives he immediately communicated the result to his companions paul was mounted in an instant with ellen at his back a few more moments were necessary to assure middleton of the security and ease of inez while he was thus engaged mahtoree advanced to the side of the beast he had allotted to this service which was his own and manifested an intention to occupy his customary place on its back the young soldier seized the reins of the animal and glances of sudden anger and lofty pride were exchanged between them  no man takes this seat but myself said middleton sternly in english  mahtoree is a great chief retorted the savage neither comprehending the meaning of the others words  the dahcotah will be too late whispered the old man at his elbow see the bigknives are afraid and they will soon run  the teton chief instantly abandoned his claim and threw himself on another horse directing one of his young men to furnish a similar accommodation for the trapper the warriors who were dismounted got up behind as many of their companions doctor battius bestrode asinus and notwithstanding the brief interruption in half the time we have taken to relate it the whole party was prepared to move  when he saw that all were ready mahtoree gave the signal to advance a few of the best mounted of the warriors the chief himself included moved a little in front and made a threatening demonstration as if they intended to attack the strangers the squatter who was in truth slowly retiring instantly halted his party and showed a willing front instead however of coming within reach of the dangerous aim of the western rifle the subtle savages kept wheeling about the strangers until they had made a half circuit keeping the latter in constant expectation of an assault then perfectly secure of their object the tetons raised a loud shout and darted across the prairie in a line for the distant rock with the directness and nearly with the velocity of the arrow that has just been shot from its bow     chapter xxi               dally not with the gods but get thee gone                                                    shakspeare  mahtoree had scarcely given the first intimation of his real design before a general discharge from the borderers proved how well they understood it the distance and the rapidity of the flight however rendered the fire harmless as a proof how little he regarded the hostility of their party the dahcotah chieftain answered the report with a yell and flourishing his carabine above his head he made a circuit on the plain followed by his chosen warriors in scorn of the impotent attempt of his enemies as the main body continued the direct course this little band of the elite in returning from its wild exhibition of savage contempt took its place in the rear with a dexterity and a concert of action that showed the manoeuvre had been contemplated  volley swiftly succeeded volley until the enraged squatter was reluctantly compelled to abandon the idea of injuring his enemies by means so feeble relinquishing his fruitless attempt he commenced a rapid pursuit occasionally discharging a rifle in order to give the alarm to the garrison which he had prudently left under the command of the redoubtable esther herself in this manner the chase was continued for many minutes the horsemen gradually gaining on their pursuers who maintained the race however with an incredible power of foot  as the little speck of blue rose against the heavens like an island issuing from the deep the savages occasionally raised a yell of triumph but the mists of evening were already gathering along the whole of the eastern margin of the prairie and before the band had made half of the necessary distance the dim outline of the rock had melted into the haze of the back ground indifferent to this circumstance which rather favoured than disconcerted his plans mahtoree who had again ridden in front held on his course with the accuracy of a hound of the truest scent merely slackening his speed a little as the horses of his party were by this time thoroughly blown it was at this stage of the enterprise that the old man rode up to the side of middleton and addressed him as follows in english  here is likely to be a thieving business and one in which i must say i have but little wish to be a partner  what would you do it would be fatal to trust ourselves in the hands of the miscreants in our rear  tut for miscreants be they red or be they white look ahead lad as if ye were talking of our medicines or perhaps praising the teton beasts for the knaves love to hear their horses commended the same as a foolish mother in the settlements is fond of hearing the praises of her wilful child so pat the animal and lay your hand on the gewgaws with which the redskins have ornamented his mane giving your eye as it were to one thing and your mind to another listen if matters are managed with judgment we may leave these tetons as the night sets in  a blessed thought exclaimed middleton who retained a painful remembrance of the look of admiration with which mahtoree had contemplated the loveliness of inez as well as of his subsequent presumption in daring to wish to take the office of her protector on himself  lord lord what a weak creatur is man when the gifts of natur are smothered in bookish knowledge and womanly manners such another start would tell these imps at our elbows that we were plotting against them just as plainly as if it were whispered in their ears by a sioux tongue ay ay i know the devils they look as innocent as so many frisky fawns but there is not one among them all that has not an eye on our smallest motions therefore what is to be done is to be done in wisdom in order to circumvent their cunning that is right pat his neck and smile as if you praised the horse and keep the ear on my side open to my words be careful not to worry your beast for though but little skilled in horses reason teaches that breath is needful in a hard push and that a weary leg makes a dull race be ready to mind the signal when you hear a whine from old hector the first will be to make ready the second to edge out of the crowd and the third to goam i understood  perfectly perfectly said middleton trembling in his excessive eagerness to put the plan in instant execution and pressing the little arm which encircled his body to his heart perfectly hasten hasten  ay the beast is no sloth continued the trapper in the teton language as if he continued the discourse edging cautiously through the dusky throng at the same time until he found himself riding at the side of paul he communicated his intentions in the same guarded manner as before the highspirited and fearless beehunter received the intelligence with delight declaring his readiness to engage the whole of the savage band should it become necessary to effect their object when the old man drew off from the side of this pair also he cast his eyes about him to discover the situation occupied by the naturalist  the doctor with infinite labour to himself and asinus had maintained a position in the very centre of the siouxes so long as there existed the smallest reason for believing that any of the missiles of ishmael might arrive in contact with his person after this danger had diminished or rather disappeared entirely his own courage revived while that of his steed began to droop to this mutual but very material change was owing the fact that the rider and the ass were now to be sought among that portion of the band who formed a sort of rearguard hither then the trapper contrived to turn his steed without exciting the suspicions of any of his subtle companions  friend commenced the old man when he found himself in a situation favourable to discourse should you like to pass a dozen years among the savages with a shaved head and a painted countenance with perhaps a couple of wives and five or six children of the half breed to call you father  impossible exclaimed the startled naturalist i am indisposed to matrimony in general and more especially to all admixture of the varieties of species which only tend to tarnish the beauty and to interrupt the harmony of nature moreover it is a painful innovation on the order of all nomenclatures  ay ay you have reason enough for your distaste to such a life but should these siouxes get you fairly into their village such would be your luck as certain as that the sun rises and sets at the pleasure of the lord  marry me to a woman who is not adorned with the comeliness of the species responded the doctor of what crime have i been guilty that so grievous a punishment should await the offence to marry a man against the movements of his will is to do a violence to human nature  now that you speak of natur i have hopes that the gift of reason has not altogether deserted your brain returned the old man with a covert expression playing about the angles of his deep set eyes which betrayed he was not entirely destitute of humour nay they may conceive you a remarkable subject for their kindness and for that matter marry you to five or six i have known in my days favoured chiefs who had numberless wives  but why should they meditate this vengeance demanded the doctor whose hair began to rise as if each fibre was possessed of sensibility what evil have i done  it is the fashion of their kindness when they come to learn that you are a great medicine they will adopt you in the tribe and some mighty chief will give you his name and perhaps his daughter or it may be a wife or two of his own who have dwelt long in his lodge and of whose value he is a judge by experience  the governor and founder of natural harmony protect me ejaculated the doctor i have no affinity to a single consort much less to duplicates and triplicates of the class i shall certainly essay a flight from their abodes before i mingle in so violent a conjunction  there is reason in your words but why not attempt the race you speak of now  the naturalist looked fearfully around as if he had an inclination to make an instant exhibition of his desperate intention but the dusky figures who were riding on every side of him seemed suddenly tripled in number and the darkness that was already thickening on the prairie appeared in his eyes to possess the glare of high noon  it would be premature and reason forbids it he answered leave me venerable venator to the council of my own thoughts and when my plans are properly classed i will advise you of my resolutions  resolutions repeated the old man shaking his head a little contemptuously as he gave the rein to his horse and allowed him to mingle with the steeds of the savages resolution is a word that is talked of in the settlements and felt on the borders does my brother know the beast on which the paleface rides he continued addressing a gloomy looking warrior in his own tongue and making a motion with his arm that at the same time directed his attention to the naturalist and the meek asinus  the teton turned his eyes for a minute on the animal but disdained to manifest the smallest portion of that wonder he had felt in common with all his companions on first viewing so rare a quadruped the trapper was not ignorant that while asses and mules were beginning to be known to those tribes who dwelt nearest the mexicos they were not usually encountered so far north as the waters of la platte he therefore managed to read the mute astonishment that lay so deeply concealed in the tawny visage of the savage and took his measures accordingly  does my brother think that the rider is a warrior of the palefaces he demanded when he believed that sufficient time had elapsed for a full examination of the pacific mien of the naturalist  the flash of scorn which shot across the features of the teton was visible even by the dim light of the stars  is a dahcotah a fool was the answer  they are a wise nation whose eyes are never shut much do i wonder that they have not seen the great medicine of the bigknives  wagh exclaimed his companion suffering the whole of his amazement to burst out of his dark rigid countenance at the surprise like a flash of lightning illuminating the gloom of midnight  the dahcotah knows that my tongue is not forked let him open his eyes wider does he not see a very great medicine  the light was not necessary to recall to the savage each feature in the really remarkable costume and equipage of dr battius in common with the rest of the band and in conformity with the universal practice of the indians this warrior while he had suffered no gaze of idle curiosity to disgrace his manhood had not permitted a single distinctive mark which might characterise any one of the strangers to escape his vigilance he knew the air the stature the dress and the features even to the colour of the eyes and of the hair of every one of the bigknives whom he had thus strangely encountered and deeply had he ruminated on the causes which could have led a party so singularly constituted into the haunts of the rude inhabitants of his native wastes he had already considered the several physical powers of the whole party and had duly compared their abilities with what he supposed might have been their intentions warriors they were not for the bigknives like the siouxes left their women in their villages when they went out on the bloody path the same objections applied to them as hunters and even as traders the two characters under which the white men commonly appeared in their villages he had heard of a great council at which the menahashah or longknives and the washsheomantiqua or spaniards had smoked together when the latter had sold to the former their incomprehensible rights over those vast regions through which his nation had roamed in freedom for so many ages his simple mind had not been able to embrace the reasons why one people should thus assume a superiority over the possessions of another and it will readily be perceived that at the hint just received from the trapper he was not indisposed to fancy that some of the hidden subtilty of that magical influence of which he was so firm a believer was about to be practised by the unsuspecting subject of their conversation in furtherance of these mysterious claims abandoning therefore all the reserve and dignity of his manner under the conscious helplessness of ignorance he turned to the old man and stretching forth his arms as if to denote how much he lay at his mercy he said  let my father look at me i am a wild man of the prairies my body is naked my hands empty my skin red i have struck the pawnees the konzas the omahaws the osages and even the longknives i am a man amid warriors but a woman among the conjurors let my father speak the ears of the teton are open he listens like a deer to the step of the cougar  such are the wise and unsarchable ways of one who alone knows good from evil exclaimed the trapper in english to some he grants cunning and on others he bestows the gift of manhood it is humbling and it is afflicting to see so noble a creatur as this who has fout in many a bloody fray truckling before his superstition like a beggar asking for the bones you would throw to the dogs the lord will forgive me for playing with the ignorance of the savage for he knows i do it in no mockery of his state or in idle vaunting of my own but in order to save mortal life and to give justice to the wronged while i defeat the deviltries of the wicked teton speaking again in the language of the listener i ask you is not that a wonderful medicine if the dahcotahs are wise they will not breathe the air he breathes nor touch his robes they know that the wahconshecheh bad spirit loves his own children and will not turn his back on him that does them harm  the old man delivered this opinion in an ominous and sententious manner and then rode apart as if he had said enough the result justified his expectations the warrior to whom he had addressed himself was not slow to communicate his important knowledge to the rest of the rearguard and in a very few moments the naturalist was the object of general observation and reverence the trapper who understood that the natives often worshipped with a view to propitiate the evil spirit awaited the workings of his artifice with the coolness of one who had not the smallest interest in its effects it was not long before he saw one dark figure after another lashing his horse and galloping ahead into the centre of the band until weucha alone remained nigh the persons of himself and obed the very dulness of this grovellingminded savage who continued gazing at the supposed conjuror with a sort of stupid admiration opposed now the only obstacle to the complete success of his artifice  thoroughly understanding the character of this indian the old man lost no time in getting rid of him also riding to his side he said in an affected whisper  has weucha drunk of the milk of the bigknives today  hugh exclaimed the savage every dull thought instantly recalled from heaven to earth by the question  because the great captain of my people who rides in front has a cow that is never empty i know it will not be long before he will say are any of my red brethren dry  the words were scarcely uttered before weucha in his turn quickened the gait of his beast and was soon blended with the rest of the dark group who were riding at a more moderate pace a few rods in advance the trapper who knew how fickle and sudden were the changes of a savage mind did not lose a moment in profiting by this advantage he loosened the reins of his own impatient steed and in an instant he was again at the side of obed  do you see the twinkling star that is may be the length of four rifles above the prairie hereaway to the north i mean  ay it is of the constellation  a tut for your constellations man do you see the star i mean tell me in the english of the land yes or no  yes  the moment my back is turned pull upon the rein of your ass until you lose sight of the savages then take the lord for your dependence and yonder star for your guide turn neither to the right hand nor to the left but make diligent use of your time for your beast is not quick of foot and every inch of prairie you gain is a day added to your liberty or to your life  without waiting to listen to the queries which the naturalist was about to put the old man again loosened the reins of his horse and presently he too was blended with the group in front  obed was now alone asinus willingly obeyed the hint which his master soon gave rather in desperation than with any very collected understanding of the orders he had received and checked his pace accordingly as the tetons however rode at a handgallop but a moment of time was necessary after the ass began to walk to remove them effectually from before the vision of his rider without plan expectation or hope of any sort except that of escaping from his dangerous neighbours the doctor first feeling to assure himself that the package which contained the miserable remnants of his specimens and notes was safe at his crupper turned the head of the beast in the required direction and kicking him with a species of fury he soon succeeded in exciting the speed of the patient animal into a smart run he had barely time to descend into a hollow and ascend the adjoining swell of the prairie before he heard or fancied he heard his name shouted in good english from the throats of twenty tetons the delusion gave a new impulse to his ardour and no professor of the saltant art ever applied himself with greater industry than the naturalist now used his heels on the ribs of asinus the conflict endured for several minutes without interruption and to all appearances it might have continued to the present moment had not the meek temper of the beast become unduly excited borrowing an idea from the manner in which his master exhibited his agitation asinus so far changed the application of his own heels as to raise them simultaneously with a certain indignant flourish into the air a measure that instantly decided the controversy in his favour obed took leave of his seat as of a position no longer tenable continuing however the direction of his flight while the ass like a conqueror took possession of the field of battle beginning to crop the dry herbage as the fruits of victory  when doctor battius had recovered his feet and rallied his faculties which were in a good deal of disorder from the hurried manner in which he had abandoned his former situation he returned in quest of his specimens and of his ass asinus displayed enough of magnanimity to render the interview amicable and thenceforth the naturalist continued the required route with very commendable industry but with a much more tempered discretion  in the mean time the old trapper had not lost sight of the important movements that he had undertaken to control obed had not been mistaken in supposing that he was already missed and sought though his imagination had corrupted certain savage cries into the wellknown sounds that composed his own latinized name the truth was simply this the warriors of the rearguard had not failed to apprise those in front of the mysterious character with which it had pleased the trapper to invest the unsuspecting naturalist the same untutored admiration which on the receipt of this intelligence had driven those in the rear to the front now drove many of the front to the rear the doctor was of course absent and the outcry was no more than the wild yells which were raised in the first burst of savage disappointment  but the authority of mahtoree was prompt to aid the ingenuity of the trapper in suppressing these dangerous sounds when order was restored and the former was made acquainted with the reason why his young men had betrayed so strong a mark of indiscretion the old man who had taken a post at his elbow saw with alarm the gleam of keen distrust that flashed in his swarthy visage  where is your conjuror demanded the chief turning suddenly to the trapper as if he meant to make him responsible for the reappearance of obed  can i tell my brother the number of the stars the ways of a great medicine are not like the ways of other men  listen to me greyhead and count my words continued the other bending on his rude saddlebow like some chevalier of a more civilised race and speaking in the haughty tones of absolute power the dahcotahs have not chosen a woman for their chief when mahtoree feels the power of a great medicine he will tremble until then he will look with his own eyes without borrowing sight from a paleface if your conjuror is not with his friends in the morning my young men shall look for him your ears are open enough  the trapper was not sorry to find that so long a respite was granted he had before found reason to believe that the teton partisan was one of those bold spirits who overstep the limits which use and education fix to the opinions of man in every state of society and he now saw plainly that he must adopt some artifice to deceive him different from that which had succeeded so well with his followers the sudden appearance of the rock however which hove up a bleak and ragged mass out of the darkness ahead put an end for the present to the discourse mahtoree giving all his thoughts to the execution of his designs on the rest of the squatters movables a murmur ran through the band as each dark warrior caught a glimpse of the desired haven after which the nicest ear might have listened in vain to catch a sound louder than the rustling of feet among the tall grass of the prairie  but the vigilance of esther was not easily deceived she had long listened anxiously to the suspicious sounds which approached the rock across the naked waste nor had the sudden outcry been unheard by the unwearied sentinels of the rock the savages who had dismounted at some little distance had not time to draw around the base of the hill in their customary silent and insidious manner before the voice of the amazon was raised demanding  who is beneath answer for your lives siouxes or devils i fear ye not  no answer was given to this challenge every warrior halting where he stood confident that his dusky form was blended with the shadows of the plain it was at this moment that the trapper determined to escape he had been left with the rest of his friends under the surveillance of those who were assigned to the duty of watching the horses and as they all continued mounted the moment appeared favourable to his project the attention of the guards was drawn to the rock and a heavy cloud driving above them at that instant obscured even the feeble light which fell from the stars leaning on the neck of his horse the old man muttered  where is my pup where is ithectorwhere is it dog  the hound caught the wellknown sounds and answered by a whine of friendship which threatened to break out into one of his piercing howls the trapper was in the act of raising himself from this successful exploit when he felt the hand of weucha grasping his throat as if determined to suppress his voice by the very unequivocal process of strangulation profiting by the circumstance he raised another low sound as in the natural effort of breathing which drew a second responsive cry from the faithful hound weucha instantly abandoned his hold of the master in order to wreak his vengeance on the dog but the voice of esther was again heard and every other design was abandoned in order to listen  ay whine and deform your throats as you may ye imps of darkness she said with a cracked but scornful laugh i know ye tarry and ye shall have light for your misdeeds put in the coal phoebe put in the coal your father and the boys shall see that they are wanted at home to welcome their guests  as she spoke a strong light like that of a brilliant star was seen on the very pinnacle of the rock then followed a forked flame which curled for a moment amid the windings of an enormous pile of brush and flashing upward in an united sheet it wavered to and fro in the passing air shedding a bright glare on every object within its influence a taunting laugh was heard from the height in which the voices of all ages mingled as though they triumphed at having so successfully exposed the treacherous intentions of the tetons  the trapper looked about him to ascertain in what situations he might find his friends true to the signals middleton and paul had drawn a little apart and now stood ready by every appearance to commence their flight at the third repetition of the cry hector had escaped his savage pursuer and was again crouching at the heels of his masters horse but the broad circle of light was gradually increasing in extent and power and the old man whose eye and judgment so rarely failed him patiently awaited a more propitious moment for his enterprise  now ishmael my man if sight and hand ar true as ever now is the time to work upon these redskins who claim to own all your property even to wife and children now my good man prove both breed and character  a distant shout was heard in the direction of the approaching party of the squatter assuring the female garrison that succour was not far distant esther answered to the grateful sounds by a cracked cry of her own lifting her form in the first burst of exultation above the rock in a manner to be visible to all below not content with this dangerous exposure of her person she was in the act of tossing her arms in triumph when the dark figure of mahtoree shot into the light and pinioned them to her side the forms of three other warriors glided across the top of the rock looking like naked demons flitting among the clouds the air was filled with the brands of the beacon and a heavy darkness succeeded not unlike that of the appalling instant when the last rays of the sun are excluded by the intervening mass of the moon a yell of triumph burst from the savages in their turn and was rather accompanied than followed by a long loud whine from hector  in an instant the old man was between the horses of middleton and paul extending a hand to the bridle of each in order to check the impatience of their riders  softly softly he whispered their eyes are as marvellously shut for the minute as if the lord had stricken them blind but their ears are open softly softly for fifty rods at least we must move no faster than a walk  the five minutes of doubt that succeeded appeared like an age to all but the trapper as their sight was gradually restored it seemed to each that the momentary gloom which followed the extinction of the beacon was to be replaced by as broad a light as that of noonday gradually the old man however suffered the animals to quicken their steps until they had gained the centre of one of the prairie bottoms then laughing in his quiet manner he released the reins and said  now let them give play to their legs but keep on the old fog to deaden the sounds  it is needless to say how cheerfully he was obeyed in a few more minutes they ascended and crossed a swell of the land after which the flight was continued at the top of their horses speed keeping the indicated star in view as the labouring bark steers for the light which points the way to a haven and security     chapter xxii                the clouds and sunbeams oer his eye               that once their shades and glories threw               have left in yonder silent sky               no vestige where they flew                                                    montgomery  a stillness as deep as that which marked the gloomy wastes in their front was observed by the fugitives to distinguish the spot they had just abandoned even the trapper lent his practised faculties in vain to detect any of the wellknown signs which might establish the important fact that hostilities had actually commenced between the parties of mahtoree and ishmael but their horses carried them out of the reach of sounds without the occurrence of the smallest evidence of the sort the old man from time to time muttered his discontent but manifested the uneasiness he actually entertained in no other manner unless it might be in exhibiting a growing anxiety to urge the animals to increase their speed he pointed out in passing the deserted swale where the family of the squatter had encamped the night they were introduced to the reader and afterwards he maintained an ominous silence ominous because his companions had already seen enough of his character to be convinced that the circumstances must be critical indeed which possessed the power to disturb the well regulated tranquillity of the old mans mind  have we not done enough middleton demanded in tenderness to the inability of inez and ellen to endure so much fatigue at the end of some hours we have ridden hard and have crossed a wide tract of plain it is time to seek a place of rest  you must seek it then in heaven if you find yourselves unequal to a longer march murmured the old trapper had the tetons and the squatter come to blows as any one might see in the natur of things they were bound to do there would be time to look about us and to calculate not only the chances but the comforts of the journey but as the case actually is i should consider it certain death or endless captivity to trust our eyes with sleep until our heads are fairly hid in some uncommon cover  i know not returned the youth who reflected more on the sufferings of the fragile being he supported than on the experience of his companion i know not we have ridden leagues and i can see no extraordinary signs of dangerif you fear for yourself my good friend believe me you are wrong for  your grandther were he living and here interrupted the old man stretching forth a hand and laying a finger impressively on the arm of middleton would have spared those words he had some reason to think that in the prime of my days when my eye was quicker than the hawks and my limbs were as active as the legs of the fallowdeer i never clung too eagerly and fondly to life then why should i now feel such a childish affection for a thing that i know to be vain and the companion of pain and sorrow let the tetons do their worst they will not find a miserable and worn out trapper the loudest in his complaints or his prayers  pardon me my worthy my inestimable friend exclaimed the repentant young man warmly grasping the hand which the other was in the act of withdrawing i knew not what i saidor rather i thought only of those whose tenderness we are most bound to consider  enough it is natur and it is right therein your grandther would have done the very same ahs me what a number of seasons hot and cold wet and dry have rolled over my poor head since the time we worried it out together among the red hurons of the lakes back in those rugged mountains of old york and many a noble buck has since that day fallen by my hand ay and many a thieving mingo too tell me lad did the general for general i know he got to be did he ever tell you of the deer we took that night the outlyers of the accursed tribe drove us to the caves on the island and how we feasted and drunk in security  i have often heard him mention the smallest circumstance of the night you mean but  and the singer and his open throat and his shoutings in the fights continued the old man laughing joyously at the strength of his own recollections  allallhe forgot nothing even to the most trifling incident do you not  what did he tell you of the imp behind the log and of the miserable devil who went over the fallor of the wretch in the tree  of each and all with every thing that concerned them i should think       they who have read the preceding books in which the trapper     appears as a hunter and a scout will readily understand the     allusions  ay continued the old man in a voice which betrayed how powerfully his own faculties retained the impression of the spectacle i have been a dweller in forests and in the wilderness for threescore and ten years and if any can pretend to know the world or to have seen scary sights it is myself but never before nor since have i seen human man in such a state of mortal despair as that very savage and yet he scorned to speak or to cry out or to own his forlorn condition it is their gift and nobly did he maintain it  harkee old trapper interrupted paul who content with the knowledge that his waist was grasped by one of the arms of ellen had hitherto ridden in unusual silence my eyes are as true and as delicate as a hummingbirds in the day but they are nothing worth boasting of by starlight is that a sick buffaloe crawling along in the bottom there or is it one of the stray cattle of the savages  the whole party drew up in order to examine the object which paul had pointed out during most of the time they had ridden in the little vales in order to seek the protection of the shadows but just at that moment they had ascended a roll of the prairie in order to cross into the very bottom where this unknown animal was now seen  let us descend said middleton be it beast or man we are too strong to have any cause of fear  now if the thing was not morally impossible cried the trapper who the reader must have already discovered was not always exact in the use of qualifying words if the thing was not morally impossible i should say that was the man who journeys in search of reptiles and insects our fellowtraveller the doctor  why impossible did you not direct him to pursue this course in order to rejoin us  ay but i did not tell him to make an ass outdo the speed of a horseyou are rightyou are right said the trapper interrupting himself as by gradually lessening the distance between them his eyes assured him it was obed and asinus whom he saw you are right as certainly as the thing is a miracle lord what a thing is fear how now friend you have been industrious to have got so far ahead in so short a time i marvel at the speed of the ass  asinus is overcome returned the naturalist mournfully the animal has certainly not been idle since we separated but he declines all my admonitions and invitations to proceed i hope there is no instant fear from the savages  i cannot say that i cannot say that matters are not as they should be atween the squatter and the tetons nor will i answer as yet for the safety of any scalp among us the beast is broken down you have urged him beyond his natural gifts and he is like a worried hound there is pity and discretion in all things even though a man be riding for his life  you indicated the star returned the doctor and i deemed it expedient to use great diligence in pursuing the direction  did you expect to reach it by such haste go go you talk boldly of the creaturs of the lord though i plainly see you are but a child in matters that concern their gifts and instincts what a plight would you now be in if there was need for a long and a quick push with our heels  the fault exists in the formation of the quadruped said obed whose placid temper began to revolt under so many scandalous imputations had there been rotary levers for two of the members a moiety of the fatigue would have been saved for one item  that for your moietys and rotaries and items man a jaded ass is a jaded ass and he who denies it is but a brother of the beast itself now captain are we driven to choose one of two evils we must either abandon this man who has been too much with us through good and bad to be easily cast away or we must seek a cover to let the animal rest  venerable venator exclaimed the alarmed obed i conjure you by all the secret sympathies of our common nature by all the hidden  ah fear has brought him to talk a little rational sense it is not natur truly to abandon a brother in distress and the lord he knows that i have never yet done the shameful deed you are right friend you are right we must all be hidden and that speedily but what to do with the ass friend doctor do you truly value the life of the creatur  he is an ancient and faithful servant returned the disconsolate obed and with pain should i see him come to any harm fetter his lower limbs and leave him to repose in this bed of herbage i will engage he shall be found where he is left in the morning  and the siouxes what would become of the beast should any of the red imps catch a peep at his ears growing up out of the grass like to mulleintops cried the beehunter they would stick him as full of arrows as a womans cushion is full of pins and then believe they had done the job for the father of all rabbits my word for it out they would find out their blunder at the first mouthful  middleton who began to grow impatient under the protracted discussion interposed and as a good deal of deference was paid to his rank he quickly prevailed in his efforts to effect a sort of compromise the humble asinus too meek and too weary to make any resistance was soon tethered and deposited in his bed of dying grass where he was left with a perfect confidence on the part of his master of finding him again at the expiration of a few hours the old man strongly remonstrated against this arrangement and more than once hinted that the knife was much more certain than the tether but the petitions of obed aided perhaps by the secret reluctance of the trapper to destroy the beast were the means of saving its life when asinus was thus secured and as his master believed secreted the whole party proceeded to find some place where they might rest themselves during the time required for the repose of the animal  according to the calculations of the trapper they had ridden twenty miles since the commencement of their flight the delicate frame of inez began to droop under the excessive fatigue nor was the more robust but still feminine person of ellen insensible to the extraordinary effort she had made middleton himself was not sorry to repose nor did the vigorous and highspirited paul hesitate to confess that he should be all the better for a little rest the old man alone seemed indifferent to the usual claims of nature although but little accustomed to the unusual description of exercise he had just been taking he appeared to bid defiance to all the usual attacks of human infirmities though evidently so near its dissolution his attenuated frame still stood like the shaft of seasoned oak dry naked and tempestdriven but unbending and apparently indurated to the consistency of stone on the present occasion he conducted the search for a restingplace which was immediately commenced with all the energy of youth tempered by the discretion and experience of his great age  the bed of grass in which the doctor had been met and in which his ass had just been left was followed a little distance until it was found that the rolling swells of the prairie were melting away into one vast level plain that was covered for miles on miles with the same species of herbage  ah this may do this may do said the old man when they arrived on the borders of this sea of withered grass i know the spot and often have i lain in its secret holes for days at a time while the savages have been hunting the buffaloes on the open ground we must enter it with great care for a broad trail might be seen and indian curiosity is a dangerous neighbour  leading the way himself he selected a spot where the tall coarse herbage stood most erect growing not unlike a bed of reeds both in height and density here he entered singly directing the others to follow as nearly as possible in his own footsteps when they had paused for some hundred or two feet into the wilderness of weeds he gave his directions to paul and middleton who continued a direct route deeper into the place while he dismounted and returned on his tracks to the margin of the meadow here he passed many minutes in replacing the trodden grass and in effacing as far as possible every evidence of their passage  in the mean time the rest of the party continued their progress not without toil and consequently at a very moderate gait until they had penetrated a mile into the place here they found a spot suited to their circumstances and dismounting they began to make their dispositions to pass the remainder of the night by this time the trapper had rejoined the party and again resumed the direction of their proceedings  the weeds and grass were soon plucked and cut from an area of sufficient extent and a bed for inez and ellen was speedily made a little apart which for sweetness and ease might have rivalled one of down the exhausted females after receiving some light refreshments from the provident stores of paul and the old man now sought their repose leaving their more stout companions at liberty to provide for their own necessities middleton and paul were not long in following the example of their betrothed leaving the trapper and the naturalist still seated around a savoury dish of bisons meat which had been cooked at a previous halt and which was as usual eaten cold  a certain lingering sensation which had so long been uppermost in the mind of obed temporarily banished sleep and as for the old man his wants were rendered by habit and necessity as seemingly subject to his will as if they altogether depended on the pleasure of the moment like his companion he chose therefore to watch instead of sleeping  if the children of ease and security knew the hardships and dangers the students of nature encounter in their behalf said obed after a moment of silence when middleton took his leave for the night pillars of silver and statues of brass would be reared as the everlasting monuments of their glory  i know not i know not returned his companion silver is far from plenty at least in the wilderness and your brazen idols are forbidden in the commandments of the lord  such indeed was the opinion of the great lawgiver of the jews but the egyptians and the chaldeans the greeks and the romans were wont to manifest their gratitude in these types of the human form indeed many of the illustrious masters of antiquity have by the aid of science and skill even outdone the works of nature and exhibited a beauty and perfection in the human form that are difficult to be found in the rarest living specimens of any of the species genus homo  can your idols walk or speak or have they the glorious gift of reason demanded the trapper with some indignation in his voice though but little given to run into the noise and chatter of the settlements yet have i been into the towns in my day to barter the peltry for lead and powder and often have i seen your waxen dolls with their tawdry clothes and glass eyes  waxen dolls interrupted obed it is profanation in the view of the arts to liken the miserable handywork of the dealers in wax to the pure models of antiquity  it is profanation in the eyes of the lord retorted the old man to liken the works of his creaturs to the power of his own hand  venerable venator resumed the naturalist clearing his throat like one who was much in earnest let us discuss understandingly and in amity you speak of the dross of ignorance whereas my memory dwells on those precious jewels which it was my happy fortune formerly to witness among the treasured glories of the old world  old world retorted the trapper that is the miserable cry of all the halfstarved miscreants that have come into this blessed land since the days of my boyhood they tell you of the old world as if the lord had not the power and the will to create the universe in a day or as if he had not bestowed his gifts with an equal hand though not with an equal mind or equal wisdom have they been received and used were they to say a worn out and an abused and a sacrilegious world they might not be so far from the truth  doctor battius who found it quite as arduous a task to maintain any of his favourite positions with so irregular an antagonist as he would have found it difficult to keep his feet within the hug of a western wrestler hemmed aloud and profited by the new opening the trapper had made to shift the grounds of the discussion  by old and new world my excellent associate he said it is not to be understood that the hills and the valleys the rocks and the rivers of our own moiety of the earth do not physically speaking bear a date as ancient as the spot on which the bricks of babylon are found it merely signifies that its moral existence is not coequal with its physical or geological formation  anan said the old man looking up enquiringly into the face of the philosopher  merely that it has not been so long known in morals as the other countries of christendom  so much the better so much the better i am no great admirator of your old morals as you call them for i have ever found and i have livd long as it were in the very heart of natur that your old morals are none of the best mankind twist and turn the rules of the lord to suit their own wickedness when their devilish cunning has had too much time to trifle with his commands  nay venerable hunter still am i not comprehended by morals i do not mean the limited and literal signification of the term such as is conveyed in its synonyme morality but the practices of men as connected with their daily intercourse their institutions and their laws  and such i call barefaced and downright wantonness and waste interrupted his sturdy disputant  well be it so returned the doctor abandoning the explanation in despair perhaps i have conceded too much he then instantly added fancying that he still saw the glimmerings of an argument through another chink in the discourse perhaps i have conceded too much in saying that this hemisphere is literally as old in its formation as that which embraces the venerable quarters of europe asia and africa  it is easy to say a pine is not so tall as an alder but it would be hard to prove can you give a reason for such a belief  the reasons are numerous and powerful returned the doctor delighted by this encouraging opening look into the plains of egypt and arabia their sandy deserts teem with the monuments of their antiquity and then we have also recorded documents of their glory doubling the proofs of their former greatness now that they lie stripped of their fertility while we look in vain for similar evidences that man has ever reached the summit of civilisation on this continent or search without our reward for the path by which he has made the downward journey to his present condition of second childhood  and what see you in all this demanded the trapper who though a little confused by the terms of his companion seized the thread of his ideas  a demonstration of my problem that nature did not make so vast a region to lie an uninhabited waste so many ages this is merely the moral view of the subject as to the more exact and geological  your morals are exact enough for me returned the old man for i think i see in them the very pride of folly i am but little gifted in the fables of what you call the old world seeing that my time has been mainly passed looking natur steadily in the face and in reasoning on what ive seen rather than on what ive heard in traditions but i have never shut my ears to the words of the good book and many is the long winter evening that i have passed in the wigwams of the delawares listening to the good moravians as they dealt forth the history and doctrines of the elder times to the people of the lenape it was pleasant to hearken to such wisdom after a weary hunt right pleasant did i find it and often have i talked the matter over with the great serpent of the delawares in the more peaceful hours of our outlyings whether it might be on the trail of a warparty of the mingoes or on the watch for a york deer i remember to have heard it then and there said that the blessed land was once fertile as the bottoms of the mississippi and groaning with its stores of grain and fruits but that the judgment has since fallen upon it and that it is now more remarkable for its barrenness than any qualities to boast of  it is true but egyptnay much of africa furnishes still more striking proofs of this exhaustion of nature  tell me interrupted the old man is it a certain truth that buildings are still standing in that land of pharaoh which may be likened in their stature to the hills of the arth  it is as true as that nature never refuses to bestow her incisores on the animals mammalia genus homo  it is very marvellous and it proves how great he must be when his miserable creaturs can accomplish such wonders many men must have been needed to finish such an edifice ay and men gifted with strength and skill too does the land abound with such a race to this hour  far from it most of the country is a desert and but for a mighty river all would be so  yes rivers are rare gifts to such as till the ground as any one may see who journeys far atween the rocky mountains and the mississippi but how do you account for these changes on the face of the arth itself and for this downfall of nations you men of the schools  it is to be ascribed to moral cau  youre rightit is their morals their wickedness and their pride and chiefly their waste that has done it all now listen to what the experience of an old man teaches him i have lived long as these grey hairs and wrinkled hands will show even though my tongue should fail in the wisdom of my years and i have seen much of the folly of man for his natur is the same be he born in the wilderness or be he born in the towns to my weak judgment it hath ever seemed that his gifts are not equal to his wishes that he would mount into the heavens with all his deformities about him if he only knew the road no one will gainsay that witnesses his bitter strivings upon arth if his power is not equal to his will it is because the wisdom of the lord hath set bounds to his evil workings  it is much too certain that certain facts will warrant a theory which teaches the natural depravity of the genus but if science could be fairly brought to bear on a whole species at once for instance education might eradicate the evil principle  that for your education the time has been when i have thought it possible to make a companion of a beast many are the cubs and many are the speckled fawns that i have reared with these old hands until i have even fancied them rational and altered beingsbut what did it amount to the bear would bite and the deer would run notwithstanding my wicked conceit in fancying i could change a temper that the lord himself had seen fit to bestow now if man is so blinded in his folly as to go on ages on ages doing harm chiefly to himself there is the same reason to think that he has wrought his evil here as in the countries you call so old look about you man where are the multitudes that once peopled these prairies the kings and the palaces the riches and the mightinesses of this desert  where are the monuments that would prove the truth of so vague a theory  i know not what you call a monument  the works of man the glories of thebes and balbeccolumns catacombs and pyramids standing amid the sands of the east like wrecks on a rocky shore to testify to the storms of ages  they are gone time has lasted too long for them for why time was made by the lord and they were made by man this very spot of reeds and grass on which you now sit may once have been the garden of some mighty king it is the fate of all things to ripen and then to decay the tree blossoms and bears its fruit which falls rots withers and even the seed is lost go count the rings of the oak and of the sycamore they lie in circles one about another until the eye is blinded in striving to make out their numbers and yet a full change of the seasons comes round while the stem is winding one of these little lines about itself like the buffaloe changing his coat or the buck his horns and what does it all amount to there does the noble tree fill its place in the forest loftier and grander and richer and more difficult to imitate than any of your pitiful pillars for a thousand years until the time which the lord hath given it is full then come the winds that you cannot see to rive its bark and the waters from the heavens to soften its pores and the rot which all can feel and none can understand to humble its pride and bring it to the ground from that moment its beauty begins to perish it lies another hundred years a mouldering log and then a mound of moss and arth a sad effigy of a human grave this is one of your genuine monuments though made by a very different power than such as belongs to your chiseling masonry and after all the cunningest scout of the whole dahcotah nation might pass his life in searching for the spot where it fell and be no wiser when his eyes grew dim than when they were first opened as if that was not enough to convince man of his ignorance and as though it were put there in mockery of his conceit a pine shoots up from the roots of the oak just as barrenness comes after fertility or as these wastes have been spread where a garden may have been created tell me not of your worlds that are old it is blasphemous to set bounds and seasons in this manner to the works of the almighty like a woman counting the ages of her young  friend hunter or trapper returned the naturalist clearing his throat in some intellectual confusion at the vigorous attack of his companion your deductions if admitted by the world would sadly circumscribe the efforts of reason and much abridge the boundaries of knowledge  so much the betterso much the better for i have always found that a conceited man never knows content all things prove it why have we not the wings of the pigeon the eyes of the eagle and the legs of the moose if it had been intended that man should be equal to all his wishes  there are certain physical defects venerable trapper in which i am always ready to admit great and happy alterations might be suggested for example in my own order of phalangacru  cruel enough would be the order that should come from miserable hands like thine a touch from such a finger would destroy the mocking deformity of a monkey go go human folly is not needed to fill up the great design of god there is no stature no beauty no proportions nor any colours in which man himself can well be fashioned that is not already done to his hands  that is touching another great and much disputed question exclaimed the doctor who seized upon every distinct idea that the ardent and somewhat dogmatic old man left exposed to his mental grasp with the vain hope of inducing a logical discussion in which he might bring his battery of syllogisms to annihilate the unscientific defences of his antagonist  it is however unnecessary to our narrative to relate the erratic discourse that ensued the old man eluded the annihilating blows of his adversary as the light armed soldier is wont to escape the efforts of the more regular warrior even while he annoys him most and an hour passed away without bringing any of the numerous subjects on which they touched to a satisfactory conclusion the arguments acted however on the nervous system of the doctor like so many soothing soporifics and by the time his aged companion was disposed to lay his head on his pack obed refreshed by his recent mental joust was in a condition to seek his natural rest without enduring the torments of the incubus in the shapes of teton warriors and bloody tomahawks     chapter xxiii                             save you sir                                                    shakspeare  the sleep of the fugitives lasted for several hours the trapper was the first to shake off its influence as he had been the last to court its refreshment rising just as the grey light of day began to brighten that portion of the studded vault which rested on the eastern margin of the plain he summoned his companions from their warm lairs and pointed out the necessity of their being once more on the alert while middleton attended to the arrangements necessary to the comforts of inez and ellen in the long and painful journey which lay before them the old man and paul prepared the meal which the former had advised them to take before they proceeded to horse these several dispositions were not long in making and the little group was soon seated about a repast which though it might want the elegancies to which the bride of middleton had been accustomed was not deficient in the more important requisites of savour and nutriment  when we get lower into the huntinggrounds of the pawnees said the trapper laying a morsel of delicate venison before inez on a little trencher neatly made of horn and expressly for his own use we shall find the buffaloes fatter and sweeter the deer in more abundance and all the gifts of the lord abounding to satisfy our wants perhaps we may even strike a beaver and get a morsel from his tail by way of a rare mouthful       the american hunters consider the tail of the beaver the most     nourishing of all food  what course do you mean to pursue when you have once thrown these bloodhounds from the chase demanded middleton  if i might advise said paul it would be to strike a watercourse and get upon its downward current as soon as may be give me a cottonwood and i will turn you out a canoe that shall carry us all the jackass excepted in perhaps the work of a day and a night ellen here is a lively girl enough but then she is no great racerider and it would be far more comfortable to boat six or eight hundred miles than to go loping along like so many elks measuring the prairies besides water leaves no trail  i will not swear to that returned the trapper i have often thought the eyes of a redskin would find a trail in air  see middleton exclaimed inez in a sudden burst of youthful pleasure that caused her for a moment to forget her situation how lovely is that sky surely it contains a promise of happier times  it is glorious returned her husband glorious and heavenly is that streak of vivid red and here is a still brighter crimson rarely have i seen a richer rising of the sun  rising of the sun slowly repeated the old man lifting his tall person from its seat with a deliberate and abstracted air while he kept his eye riveted on the changing and certainly beautiful tints that were garnishing the vault of heaven rising of the sun i like not such risings of the sun ahs me the imps have circumvented us with a vengeance the prairie is on fire  god in heaven protect us cried middleton catching inez to his bosom under the instant impression of the imminence of their danger there is no time to lose old man each instant is a day let us fly  whither demanded the trapper motioning him with calmness and dignity to arrest his steps in this wilderness of grass and reeds you are like a vessel in the broad lakes without a compass a single step on the wrong course might prove the destruction of us all it is seldom danger is so pressing that there is not time enough for reason to do its work young officer therefore let us await its biddings  for my own part said paul hover looking about him with no equivocal expression of concern i acknowledge that should this dry bed of weeds get fairly in a flame a bee would have to make a flight higher than common to prevent his wings from scorching therefore old trapper i agree with the captain and say mount and run  ye are wrongye are wrong man is not a beast to follow the gift of instinct and to snuff up his knowledge by a taint in the air or a rumbling in the sound but he must see and reason and then conclude so follow me a little to the left where there is a rise in the ground whence we may make our reconnoitrings  the old man waved his hand with authority and led the way without further parlance to the spot he had indicated followed by the whole of his alarmed companions an eye less practised than that of the trapper might have failed in discovering the gentle elevation to which he alluded and which looked on the surface of the meadow like a growth a little taller than common when they reached the place however the stinted grass itself announced the absence of that moisture which had fed the rank weeds of most of the plain and furnished a clue to the evidence by which he had judged of the formation of the ground hidden beneath here a few minutes were lost in breaking down the tops of the surrounding herbage which notwithstanding the advantage of their position rose even above the heads of middleton and paul and in obtaining a lookout that might command a view of the surrounding sea of fire  the frightful prospect added nothing to the hopes of those who had so fearful a stake in the result although the day was beginning to dawn the vivid colours of the sky continued to deepen as if the fierce element were bent on an impious rivalry of the light of the sun bright flashes of flame shot up here and there along the margin of the waste like the nimble coruscations of the north but far more angry and threatening in their colour and changes the anxiety on the rigid features of the trapper sensibly deepened as he leisurely traced these evidences of a conflagration which spread in a broad belt about their place of refuge until he had encircled the whole horizon  shaking his head as he again turned his face to the point where the danger seemed nighest and most rapidly approaching the old man said  now have we been cheating ourselves with the belief that we had thrown these tetons from our trail while here is proof enough that they not only know where we lie but that they intend to smoke us out like so many skulking beasts of prey see they have lighted the fire around the whole bottom at the same moment and we are as completely hemmed in by the devils as an island by its waters  let us mount and ride cried middleton is life not worth a struggle  whither would ye go is a teton horse a salamander that he can walk amid fiery flames unhurt or do you think the lord will show his might in your behalf as in the days of old and carry you harmless through such a furnace as you may see glowing beneath yonder red sky there are siouxes too hemming the fire with their arrows and knives on every side of us or i am no judge of their murderous deviltries  we will ride into the centre of the whole tribe returned the youth fiercely and put their manhood to the test  ay its well in words but what would it prove in deeds here is a dealer in bees who can teach you wisdom in a matter like this  now for that matter old trapper said paul stretching his athletic form like a mastiff conscious of his strength i am on the side of the captain and am clearly for a race against the fire though it line me into a teton wigwam here is ellen who will  of what use of what use are your stout hearts when the element of the lord is to be conquered as well as human men look about you friends the wreath of smoke that is rising from the bottoms plainly says that there is no outlet from this spot without crossing a belt of fire look for yourselves my men look for yourselves if you can find a single opening i will engage to follow  the examination which his companions so instantly and so intently made rather served to assure them of their desperate situation than to appease their fears huge columns of smoke were rolling up from the plain and thickening in gloomy masses around the horizon the red glow which gleamed upon their enormous folds now lighting their volumes with the glare of the conflagration and now flashing to another point as the flame beneath glided ahead leaving all behind enveloped in awful darkness and proclaiming louder than words the character of the imminent and approaching danger  this is terrible exclaimed middleton folding the trembling inez to his heart at such a time as this and in such a manner  the gates of heaven are open to all who truly believe murmured the pious devotee in his bosom  this resignation is maddening but we are men and will make a struggle for our lives how now my brave and spirited friend shall we yet mount and push across the flames or shall we stand here and see those we most love perish in this frightful manner without an effort  i am for a swarming time and a flight before the hive is too hot to hold us said the beehunter to whom it will be at once seen that middleton addressed himself come old trapper you must acknowledge this is but a slow way of getting out of danger if we tarry here much longer it will be in the fashion that the bees lie around the straw after the hive has been smoked for its honey you may hear the fire begin to roar already and i know by experience that when the flame once gets fairly into the prairie grass it is no sloth that can outrun it  think you returned the old man pointing scornfully at the mazes of the dry and matted grass which environed them that mortal feet can outstrip the speed of fire on such a path if i only knew now on which side these miscreants lay  what say you friend doctor cried the bewildered paul turning to the naturalist with that sort of helplessness with which the strong are often apt to seek aid of the weak when human power is baffled by the hand of a mightier being what say you have you no advice to give away in a case of life and death  the naturalist stood tablets in hand looking at the awful spectacle with as much composure as if the conflagration had been lighted in order to solve the difficulties of some scientific problem aroused by the question of his companion he turned to his equally calm though differently occupied associate the trapper demanding with the most provoking insensibility to the urgent nature of their situation  venerable hunter you have often witnessed similar prismatic experiments  he was rudely interrupted by paul who struck the tablets from his hands with a violence that betrayed the utter intellectual confusion which had overset the equanimity of his mind before time was allowed for remonstrance the old man who had continued during the whole scene like one much at a loss how to proceed though also like one who was rather perplexed than alarmed suddenly assumed a decided air as if he no longer doubted on the course it was most advisable to pursue  it is time to be doing he said interrupting the controversy that was about to ensue between the naturalist and the beehunter it is time to leave off books and moanings and to be doing  you have come to your recollections too late miserable old man cried middleton the flames are within a quarter of a mile of us and the wind is bringing them down in this quarter with dreadful rapidity  anan the flames i care but little for the flames if i only knew how to circumvent the cunning of the tetons as i know how to cheat the fire of its prey there would be nothing needed but thanks to the lord for our deliverance do you call this a fire if you had seen what i have witnessed in the eastern hills when mighty mountains were like the furnace of smith you would have known what it was to fear the flames and to be thankful that you were spared come lads come tis time to be doing now and to cease talking for yonder curling flame is truly coming on like a trotting moose put hands upon this short and withered grass where we stand and lay bare the arth  would you think to deprive the fire of its victims in this childish manner exclaimed middleton  a faint but solemn smile passed over the features of the old man as he answered  your grandther would have said that when the enemy was nigh a soldier could do no better than to obey  the captain felt the reproof and instantly began to imitate the industry of paul who was tearing the decayed herbage from the ground in a sort of desperate compliance with the trappers direction even ellen lent her hands to the labour nor was it long before inez was seen similarly employed though none amongst them knew why or wherefore when life is thought to be the reward of labour men are wont to be industrious a very few moments sufficed to lay bare a spot of some twenty feet in diameter into one edge of this little area the trapper brought the females directing middleton and paul to cover their light and inflammable dresses with the blankets of the party so soon as this precaution was observed the old man approached the opposite margin of the grass which still environed them in a tall and dangerous circle and selecting a handful of the driest of the herbage he placed it over the pan of his rifle the light combustible kindled at the flash then he placed the little flame in a bed of the standing fog and withdrawing from the spot to the centre of the ring he patiently awaited the result  the subtle element seized with avidity upon its new fuel and in a moment forked flames were gliding among the grass as the tongues of ruminating animals are seen rolling among their food apparently in quest of its sweetest portions  now said the old man holding up a finger and laughing in his peculiarly silent manner you shall see fire fight fire ahs me many is the time i have burnt a smooty path from wanton laziness to pick my way across a tangled bottom  but is this not fatal cried the amazed middleton are you not bringing the enemy nigher to us instead of avoiding it  do you scorch so easily your grandther had a tougher skin but we shall live to see we shall all live to see  the experience of the trapper was in the right as the fire gained strength and heat it began to spread on three sides dying of itself on the fourth for want of aliment as it increased and the sullen roaring announced its power it cleared every thing before it leaving the black and smoking soil far more naked than if the scythe had swept the place the situation of the fugitives would have still been hazardous had not the area enlarged as the flame encircled them but by advancing to the spot where the trapper had kindled the grass they avoided the heat and in a very few moments the flames began to recede in every quarter leaving them enveloped in a cloud of smoke but perfectly safe from the torrent of fire that was still furiously rolling onward  the spectators regarded the simple expedient of the trapper with that species of wonder with which the courtiers of ferdinand are said to have viewed the manner in which columbus made his egg stand on its end though with feelings that were filled with gratitude instead of envy  most wonderful said middleton when he saw the complete success of the means by which they had been rescued from a danger that he had conceived to be unavoidable the thought was a gift from heaven and the hand that executed it should be immortal  old trapper cried paul thrusting his fingers through his shaggy locks i have lined many a loaded bee into his hole and know something of the nature of the woods but this is robbing a hornet of his sting without touching the insect  it will doit will do returned the old man who after the first moment of his success seemed to think no more of the exploit now get the horses in readiness let the flames do their work for a short half hour and then we will mount that time is needed to cool the meadow for these unshod teton beasts are as tender on the hoof as a barefooted girl  middleton and paul who considered this unlookedfor escape as a species of resurrection patiently awaited the time the trapper mentioned with renewed confidence in the infallibility of his judgment the doctor regained his tablets a little the worse from having fallen among the grass which had been subject to the action of the flames and was consoling himself for this slight misfortune by recording uninterruptedly such different vacillations in light and shadow as he chose to consider phenomena  in the mean time the veteran on whose experience they all so implicitly relied for protection employed himself in reconnoitring objects in the distance through the openings which the air occasionally made in the immense bodies of smoke that by this time lay in enormous piles on every part of the plain  look you here lads the trapper said after a long and anxious examination your eyes are young and may prove better than my worthless sightthough the time has been when a wise and brave people saw reason to think me quick on a lookout but those times are gone and many a true and tried friend has passed away with them ahs me if i could choose a change in the orderings of providencewhich i cannot and which it would be blasphemy to attempt seeing that all things are governed by a wiser mind than belongs to mortal weaknessbut if i were to choose a change it would be to say that such as they who have lived long together in friendship and kindness and who have proved their fitness to go in company by many acts of suffering and daring in each others behalf should be permitted to give up life at such times as when the death of one leaves the other but little reason to wish to live  is it an indian that you see demanded the impatient middleton  redskin or whiteskin it is much the same friendship and use can tie men as strongly together in the woods as in the townsay and for that matter stronger here are the young warriors of the prairiesoften do they sort themselves in pairs and set apart their lives for deeds of friendship and well and truly do they act up to their promises the deathblow to one is commonly mortal to the other i have been a solitary man much of my time if he can be called solitary who has lived for seventy years in the very bosom of natur and where he could at any instant open his heart to god without having to strip it of the cares and wickednesses of the settlementsbut making that allowance have i been a solitary man and yet have i always found that intercourse with my kind was pleasant and painful to break off provided that the companion was brave and honest brave because a skeary comrade in the woods suffering his eyes inadvertently to rest a moment on the person of the abstracted naturalist is apt to make a short path long and honest inasmuch as craftiness is rather an instinct of the brutes than a gift becoming the reason of a human man  but the object that you sawwas it a sioux  what the world of america is coming to and where the machinations and inventions of its people are to have an end the lord he only knows i have seen in my day the chief who in his time had beheld the first christian that placed his wicked foot in the regions of york how much has the beauty of the wilderness been deformed in two short lives my own eyes were first opened on the shores of the eastern sea and well do i remember that i tried the virtues of the first rifle i ever bore after such a march from the door of my father to the forest as a stripling could make between sun and sun and that without offence to the rights or prejudices of any man who set himself up to be the owner of the beasts of the fields natur then lay in its glory along the whole coast giving a narrow stripe between the woods and the ocean to the greediness of the settlers and where am i now had i the wings of an eagle they would tire before a tenth of the distance which separates me from that sea could be passed and towns and villages farms and highways churches and schools in short all the inventions and deviltries of man are spread across the region i have known the time when a few redskins shouting along the borders could set the provinces in a fever and men were to be armed and troops were to be called to aid from a distant land and prayers were said and the women frighted and few slept in quiet because the iroquois were on the warpath or the accursed mingo had the tomahawk in hand how is it now the country sends out her ships to foreign lands to wage their battles cannon are plentier than the rifle used to be and trained soldiers are never wanting in tens of thousands when need calls for their services such is the difference atween a province and a state my men and i miserable and worn out as i seem have lived to see it all  that you must have seen many a chopper skimming the cream from the face of the earth and many a settler getting the very honey of nature old trapper said paul no reasonable man can or for that matter shall doubt but here is ellen getting uneasy about the siouxes and now you have opened your mind so freely concerning these matters if you will just put us on the line of our flight the swarm will make another move  anan  i say that ellen is getting uneasy and as the smoke is lifting from the plain it may be prudent to take another flight  the boy is reasonable i had forgotten we were in the midst of a raging fire and that siouxes were round about us like hungry wolves watching a drove of buffaloes but when memory is at work in my old brain on times long past it is apt to overlook the matters of the day you say right my children it is time to be moving and now comes the real nicety of our case it is easy to outwit a furnace for it is nothing but a raging element and it is not always difficult to throw a grizzly bear from his scent for the creatur is both enlightened and blinded by his instinct but to shut the eyes of a waking teton is a matter of greater judgment inasmuch as his deviltry is backed by reason  notwithstanding the old man appeared so conscious of the difficulty of the undertaking he set about its achievement with great steadiness and alacrity after completing the examination which had been interrupted by the melancholy wanderings of his mind he gave the signal to his companions to mount the horses which had continued passive and trembling amid the raging of the fire received their burdens with a satisfaction so very evident as to furnish a favourable augury of their future industry the trapper invited the doctor to take his own steed declaring his intention to proceed on foot  i am but little used to journeying with the feet of others he added as a reason for the measure and my legs are a weary of doing nothing besides should we light suddenly on an ambushment which is a thing far from impossible the horse will be in a better condition for a hard run with one man on his back than with two as for me what matters it whether my time is to be a day shorter or a day longer let the tetons take my scalp if it be gods pleasure they will find it covered with grey hairs and it is beyond the craft of man to cheat me of the knowledge and experience by which they have been whitened  as no one among the impatient listeners seemed disposed to dispute the arrangement it was acceded to in silence the doctor though he muttered a few mourning exclamations on behalf of the lost asinus was by far too well pleased in finding that his speed was likely to be sustained by four legs instead of two to be long in complying and consequently in a very few moments the beehunter who was never last to speak on such occasions vociferously announced that they were ready to proceed  now look off yonder to the east said the old man as he began to lead the way across the murky and still smoking plain little fear of cold feet in journeying such a path as this but look you off to the east and if you see a sheet of shining white glistening like a plate of beaten silver through the openings of the smoke why that is water a noble stream is running thereaway and i thought i got a glimpse of it a while since but other thoughts came and i lost it it is a broad and swift river such as the lord has made many of its fellows in this desert for here may natur be seen in all its richness trees alone excepted trees which are to the arth as fruits are to a garden without them nothing can be pleasant or thoroughly useful now watch all of you with open eyes for that stripe of glittering water we shall not be safe until it is flowing between our trail and these sharp sighted tetons  the latter declaration was enough to ensure a vigilant look out for the desired stream on the part of all the trappers followers with this object in view the party proceeded in profound silence the old man having admonished them of the necessity of caution as they entered the clouds of smoke which were rolling like masses of fog along the plain more particularly over those spots where the fire had encountered occasional pools of stagnant water  they travelled near a league in this manner without obtaining the desired glimpse of the river the fire was still raging in the distance and as the air swept away the first vapour of the conflagration fresh volumes rolled along the place limiting the view at length the old man who had begun to betray some little uneasiness which caused his followers to apprehend that even his acute faculties were beginning to be confused in the mazes of the smoke made a sudden pause and dropping his rifle to the ground he stood apparently musing over some object at his feet middleton and the rest rode up to his side and demanded the reason of the halt  look ye here returned the trapper pointing to the mutilated carcass of a horse that lay more than half consumed in a little hollow of the ground here may you see the power of a prairie conflagration the arth is moist hereaway and the grass has been taller than usual this miserable beast has been caught in his bed you see the bones the crackling and scorched hide and the grinning teeth a thousand winters could not wither an animal so thoroughly as the element has done it in a minute  and this might have been our fate said middleton had the flames come upon us in our sleep  nay i do not say that i do not say that not but that man will burn as well as tinder but that being more reasoning than a horse he would better know how to avoid the danger  perhaps this then has been but the carcass of an animal or he too would have fled  see you these marks in the damp soil here have been his hoofsand there is a moccasin print as im a sinner the owner of the beast has tried hard to move him from the place but it is in the instinct of the creatur to be fainthearted and obstinate in a fire  it is a wellknown fact but if the animal has had a rider where is he  ay therein lies the mystery returned the trapper stooping to examine the signs in the ground with a closer eye yes yes it is plain there has been a long struggle atween the two the master has tried hard to save his beast and the flames must have been very greedy or he would have had better success  harkee old trapper interrupted paul pointing to a little distance where the ground was drier and the herbage had in consequence been less luxuriant just call them two horses yonder lies another  the boy is right can it be that the tetons have been caught in their own snares such things do happen and here is an example to all evildoers ay look you here this is iron there have been some white inventions about the trappings of the beastit must be soit must be soa party of the knaves have been skirting in the grass after us while their friends have fired the prairie and look you at the consequences they have lost their beasts and happy have they been if their own souls are not now skirting along the path which leads to the indian heaven  they had the same expedient at command as yourself rejoined middleton as the party slowly proceeded approaching the other carcass which lay directly on their route  i know not that it is not every savage that carries his steel and flint or as good a riflepan as this old friend of mine it is slow making a fire with two sticks and little time was given to consider or invent just at this spot as you may see by yon streak of flame which is flashing along afore the wind as if it were on a trail of powder it is not many minutes since the fire has passed here away and it may be well to look at our primings not that i would willingly combat the tetons god forbid but if a fight needs be it is always wise to get the first shot  this has been a strange beast old man said paul who had pulled the bridle or rather halter of his steed over the second carcass while the rest of the party were already passing in their eagerness to proceed a strange horse do i call it it had neither head nor hoofs  the fire has not been idle returned the trapper keeping his eye vigilantly employed in profiting by those glimpses of the horizon which the whirling smoke offered to his examination it would soon bake you a buffaloe whole or for that matter powder his hoofs and horns into white ashes shame shame old hector as for the captains pup it is to be expected that he would show his want of years and i may say i hope without offence his want of education too but for a hound like you who have lived so long in the forest afore you came into these plains it is very disgraceful hector to be showing your teeth and growling at the carcass of a roasted horse the same as if you were telling your master that you had found the trail of a grizzly bear  i tell you old trapper this is no horse neither in hoofs head nor hide  anan not a horse your eyes are good for the bees and for the hollow trees my lad butbless me the boy is right that i should mistake the hide of a buffaloe scorched and crimpled as it is for the carcass of a horse ahs me the time has been my men when i would tell you the name of a beast as far as eye could reach and that too with most of the particulars of colour age and sex  an inestimable advantage have you then enjoyed venerable venator observed the attentive naturalist the man who can make these distinctions in a desert is saved the pain of many a weary walk and often of an enquiry that in its result proves useless pray tell me did your exceeding excellence of vision extend so far as to enable you to decide on their order or genus  i know not what you mean by your orders of genius  no interrupted the beehunter a little disdainfully for him when speaking to his aged friend now old trapper that is admitting your ignorance of the english language in a way i should not expect from a man of your experience and understanding by order our comrade means whether they go in promiscuous droves like a swarm that is following its queenbee or in single file as you often see the buffaloes trailing each other through a prairie and as for genius im sure that is a word well understood and in every bodys mouth there is the congressman in our district and that tonguey little fellow who puts out the paper in our county they are both so called for their smartness which is what the doctor means as i take it seeing that he seldom speaks without some considerable meaning  when paul finished this very clever explanation he looked behind him with an expression which rightly interpreted would have saidyou see though i dont often trouble myself in these matters i am no fool  ellen admired paul for anything but his learning there was enough in his frank fearless and manly character backed as it was by great personal attraction to awaken her sympathies without the necessity of prying into his mental attainments the poor girl reddened like a rose her pretty fingers played with the belt by which she sustained herself on the horse and she hurriedly observed as if anxious to direct the attentions of the other listeners from a weakness on which her own thoughts could not bear to dwell  and this is not a horse after all  it is nothing more nor less than the hide of a buffaloe continued the trapper who had been no less puzzled by the explanation of paul than by the language of the doctor the hair is beneath the fire has run over it as you see for being fresh the flames could take no hold the beast has not been long killed and it may be that some of the beef is still hereaway  lift the corner of the skin old trapper said paul with the tone of one who felt as if he had now proved his right to mingle his voice in any council if there is a morsel of the hump left it must be well cooked and it shall be welcome  the old man laughed heartily at the conceit of his companion thrusting his foot beneath the skin it moved then it was suddenly cast aside and an indian warrior sprang from its cover to his feet with an agility that bespoke how urgent he deemed the occasion     chapter xxiv               i would it were bedtime hal and all well                                                    shakspeare  a second glance sufficed to convince the whole of the startled party that the young pawnee whom they had already encountered again stood before them surprise kept both sides mute and more than a minute was passed in surveying each other with eyes of astonishment if not of distrust the wonder of the young warrior was however much more tempered and dignified than that of his christian acquaintances while middleton and paul felt the tremor which shook the persons of their dependant companions thrilling through their own quickened blood the glowing eye of the indian rolled from one to another as if it could never quail before the rudest assaults his gaze after making the circuit of every wondering countenance finally settled in a steady look on the equally immovable features of the trapper the silence was first broken by dr battius in the ejaculation oforder primates genus homo species prairie  ayaythe secret is out said the old trapper shaking his head like one who congratulated himself on having mastered the mystery of some knotty difficulty the lad has been in the grass for a cover the fire has come upon him in his sleep and having lost his horse he has been driven to save himself under that fresh hide of a buffaloe no bad invention when powder and flint were wanting to kindle a ring i warrant me now this is a clever youth and one that it would be safe to journey with i will speak to him kindly for anger can at least serve no turn of ours my brother is welcome again using the language which the other understood the tetons have been smoking him as they would a racoon  the young pawnee rolled his eye over the place as if he were examining the terrific danger from which he had just escaped but he disdained to betray the smallest emotion at its imminency his brow contracted as he answered to the remark of the trapper by saying  a teton is a dog when the pawnee warwhoop is in their ears the whole nation howls  it is true the imps are on our trail and i am glad to meet a warrior with the tomahawk in his hand who does not love them will my brother lead my children to his village if the siouxes follow on our path my young men shall help him to strike them  the young pawnee turned his eyes from one to another of the strangers in a keen scrutiny before he saw fit to answer so important an interrogatory his examination of the males was short and apparently satisfactory but his gaze was fastened long and admiringly as in their former interview on the surpassing and unwonted beauty of a being so fair and so unknown as inez though his glance wandered for moments from her countenance to the more intelligible and yet extraordinary charms of ellen it did not fail to return promptly to the study of a creature who in the view of his unpractised eye and untutored imagination was formed with all that perfection with which the youthful poet is apt to endow the glowing images of his brain nothing so fair so ideal so every way worthy to reward the courage and selfdevotion of a warrior had ever before been encountered on the prairies and the young brave appeared to be deeply and intuitively sensible to the influence of so rare a model of the loveliness of the sex perceiving however that his gaze gave uneasiness to the subject of his admiration he withdrew his eyes and laying his hand impressively on his chest he modestly answered  my father shall be welcome the young men of my nation shall hunt with his sons the chiefs shall smoke with the greyhead the pawnee girls will sing in the ears of his daughters  and if we meet the tetons demanded the trapper who wished to understand thoroughly the more important conditions of this new alliance  the enemy of the bigknives shall feel the blow of the pawnee  it is well now let my brother and i meet in council that we may not go on a crooked path but that our road to his village may be like the flight of the pigeons  the young pawnee made a significant gesture of assent and followed the other a little apart in order to be removed from all danger of interruption from the reckless paul or the abstracted naturalist their conference was short but as it was conducted in the sententious manner of the natives it served to make each of the parties acquainted with all the necessary information of the other when they rejoined their associates the old man saw fit to explain a portion of what had passed between them as follows  ay i was not mistaken he said this goodlooking young warriorfor goodlooking and noblelooking he is though a little horrified perhaps with paintthis goodlooking youth then tells me he is out on the scout for these very tetons his party was not strong enough to strike the devils who are down from their towns in great numbers to hunt the buffaloe and runners have gone to the pawnee villages for aid it would seem that this lad is a fearless boy for he has been hanging on their skirts alone until like ourselves he was driven to the grass for a cover but he tells me more my men and what i am mainly sorry to hear which is that the cunning mahtoree instead of going to blows with the squatter has become his friend and that both broods red and white are on our heels and outlying around this very burning plain to circumvent us to our destruction  how knows he all this to be true demanded middleton  anan  in what manner does he know that these things are so  in what manner do you think newspapers and town criers are needed to tell a scout what is doing on the prairies as they are in the bosom of the states no gossiping woman who hurries from house to house to spread evil of her neighbour can carry tidings with her tongue so fast as these people will spread their meaning by signs and warnings that they alone understand tis their larning and what is better it is got in the open air and not within the walls of a school i tell you captain that what he says is true  for that matter said paul im ready to swear to it it is reasonable and therefore it must be true  and well you might lad well you might he furthermore declares that my old eyes for once were true to me and that the river lies hereaway at about the distance of half a league you see the fire has done most of its work in that quarter and our path is clouded in smoke he also agrees that it is needful to wash our trail in water yes we must put that river atween us and the sioux eyes and then by the favour of the lord not forgetting our own industry we may gain the village of the loups  words will not forward us a foot said middleton let us move  the old man assented and the party once more prepared to renew its route the pawnee threw the skin of the buffaloe over his shoulder and led the advance casting many a stolen glance behind him as he proceeded in order to fix his gaze on the extraordinary and to him unaccountable loveliness of the unconscious inez  an hour sufficed to bring the fugitives to the bank of the stream which was one of the hundred rivers that serve to conduct through the mighty arteries of the missouri and mississippi the waters of that vast and still uninhabited region to the ocean the river was not deep but its current was troubled and rapid the flames had scorched the earth to its very margin and as the warm streams of the fluid mingled in the cooler air of the morning with the smoke of the raging conflagration most of its surface was wrapped in a mantle of moving vapour the trapper pointed out the circumstance with pleasure saying as he assisted inez to dismount on the margin of the watercourse  the knaves have outwitted themselves i am far from certain that i should not have fired the prairie to have got the benefit of this very smoke to hide our movements had not the heartless imps saved us the trouble ive known such things done in my day and done with success come lady put your tender foot upon the groundfor a fearful time has it been to one of your breeding and skeary qualities ahs me what have i not known the young and the delicate and the virtuous and the modest to undergo in my time among the horrifications and circumventions of indian warfare come it is a short quarter of a mile to the other bank and then our trail at least will be broken  paul had by this time assisted ellen to dismount and he now stood looking with rueful eyes at the naked banks of the river neither tree nor shrub grew along its borders with the exception of here and there a solitary thicket of low bushes from among which it would not have been an easy matter to have found a dozen stems of a size sufficient to make an ordinary walkingstick  harkee old trapper the moodylooking beehunter exclaimed it is very well to talk of the other side of this ripple of a river or brook or whatever you may call it but in my judgment it would be a smart rifle that would throw its lead across itthat is to any detriment to indian or deer  that it wouldthat it would though i carry a piece here that has done its work in time of need at as great a distance  and do you mean to shoot ellen and the captains lady across or do you intend them to go trout fashion with their mouths under water  is this river too deep to be forded asked middleton who like paul began to consider the impossibility of transporting her whose safety he valued more than his own to the opposite shore  when the mountains above feed it with their torrents it is as you see a swift and powerful stream yet have i crossed its sandy bed in my time without wetting a knee but we have the sioux horses i warrant me that the kicking imps will swim like so many deer  old trapper said paul thrusting his fingers into his mop of a head as was usual with him when any difficulty confounded his philosophy i have swam like a fish in my day and i can do it again when there is need nor do i much regard the weather but i question if you get nelly to sit a horse with this water whirling like a millrace before her eyes besides it is manifest the thing is not to be done dry shod  ah the lad is right we must to our inventions therefore or the river cannot be crossed then cutting the discourse short he turned to the pawnee and explained to him the difficulty which existed in relation to the women the young warrior listened gravely and throwing the buffaloeskin from his shoulder he immediately commenced assisted by the occasional aid of the understanding old man the preparations necessary to effect this desirable object  the hide was soon drawn into the shape of an umbrella top or an inverted parachute by thongs of deerskin with which both the labourers were well provided a few light sticks served to keep the parts from collapsing or falling in when this simple and natural expedient was arranged it was placed on the water the indian making a sign that it was ready to receive its freight both inez and ellen hesitated to trust themselves in a bark of so frail a construction nor would middleton or paul consent that they should do so until each had assured himself by actual experiment that the vessel was capable of sustaining a load much heavier than it was destined to receive then indeed their scruples were reluctantly overcome and the skin was made to receive its precious burden  now leave the pawnee to be the pilot said the trapper my hand is not so steady as it used to be but he has limbs like toughened hickory leave all to the wisdom of the pawnee  the husband and lover could not well do otherwise and they were fain to become deeply interested it is true but passive spectators of this primitive species of ferrying the pawnee selected the beast of mahtoree from among the three horses with a readiness that proved he was far from being ignorant of the properties of that noble animal and throwing himself upon its back he rode into the margin of the river thrusting an end of his lance into the hide he bore the light vessel up against the stream and giving his steed the rein they pushed boldly into the current middleton and paul followed pressing as nigh the bark as prudence would at all warrant in this manner the young warrior bore his precious cargo to the opposite bank in perfect safety without the slightest inconvenience to the passengers and with a steadiness and celerity which proved that both horse and rider were not unused to the operation when the shore was gained the young indian undid his work threw the skin over his shoulder placed the sticks under his arm and returned without speaking to transfer the remainder of the party in a similar manner to what was very justly considered the safer side of the river  now friend doctor said the old man when he saw the indian plunging into the river a second time do i know there is faith in yonder redskin he is a goodlooking ay and an honestlooking youth but the winds of heaven are not more deceitful than these savages when the devil has fairly beset them had the pawnee been a teton or one of them heartless mingoes that used to be prowling through the woods of york a time back that is some sixty years agone we should have seen his back and not his face turned towards us my heart had its misgivings when i saw the lad choose the better horse for it would be as easy to leave us with that beast as it would for a nimble pigeon to part company from a flock of noisy and heavy winged crows but you see that truth is in the boy and make a redskin once your friend he is yours so long as you deal honestly by him  what may be the distance to the sources of this stream demanded doctor battius whose eyes were rolling over the whirling eddies of the current with a very portentous expression of doubt at what distance may its secret springs be found  that may be as the weather proves i warrant me your legs would be aweary before you had followed its bed into the rocky mountains but then there are seasons when it might be done without wetting a foot  and in what particular divisions of the year do these periodical seasons occur  he that passes this spot a few months from this time will find that foaming watercourse a desert of drifting sand  the naturalist pondered deeply like most others who are not endowed with a superfluity of physical fortitude the worthy man had found the danger of passing the river in so simple a manner magnifying itself in his eyes so rapidly as the moment of adventure approached that he actually contemplated the desperate effort of going round the river in order to escape the hazard of crossing it it may not be necessary to dwell on the incredible ingenuity with which terror will at any time prop a tottering argument the worthy obed had gone over the whole subject with commendable diligence and had just arrived at the consoling conclusion that there was nearly as much glory in discerning the hidden sources of so considerable a stream as in adding a plant or an insect to the lists of the learned when the pawnee reached the shore for the second time the old man took his seat with the utmost deliberation in the vessel of skin so soon as it had been duly arranged for his reception and having carefully disposed of hector between his legs he beckoned to his companion to occupy the third place  the naturalist placed a foot in the frail vessel as an elephant will try a bridge or a horse is often seen to make a similar experiment before he will trust the whole of his corporeal treasure on the dreaded flat and then withdrew just as the old man believed he was about to seat himself  venerable venator he said mournfully this is a most unscientific bark there is an inward monitor which bids me distrust its security  anan said the old man who was pinching the ears of the hound as a father would play with the same member in a favourite child  i incline not to this irregular mode of experimenting on fluids the vessel has neither form nor proportions  it is not as handsomely turned as i have seen a canoe in birchen bark but comfort may be taken in a wigwam as well as in a palace  it is impossible that any vessel constructed on principles so repugnant to science can be safe this tub venerable hunter will never reach the opposite shore in safety  you are a witness of what it has done  ay but it was an anomaly in prosperity if exceptions were to be taken as rules in the government of things the human race would speedily be plunged in the abysses of ignorance venerable trapper this expedient in which you would repose your safety is in the annals of regular inventions what a lusus naturae may be termed in the lists of natural historya monster  how much longer doctor battius might have felt disposed to prolong the discourse it is difficult to say for in addition to the powerful personal considerations which induced him to procrastinate an experiment which was certainly not without its dangers the pride of reason was beginning to sustain him in the discussion but fortunately for the credit of the old mans forbearance when the naturalist reached the word with which he terminated his last speech a sound arose in the air that seemed a sort of supernatural echo to the idea itself the young pawnee who had awaited the termination of the incomprehensible discussion with grave and characteristic patience raised his head and listened to the unknown cry like a stag whose mysterious faculties had detected the footsteps of the distant hounds in the gale the trapper and the doctor were not however entirely so uninstructed as to the nature of the extraordinary sounds the latter recognised in them the wellknown voice of his own beast and he was about to rush up the little bank which confined the current with all the longings of strong affection when asinus himself galloped into view at no great distance urged to the unnatural gait by the impatient and brutal weucha who bestrode him  the eyes of the teton and those of the fugitives met the former raised a long loud and piercing yell in which the notes of exultation were fearfully blended with those of warning the signal served for a finishing blow to the discussion on the merits of the bark the doctor stepping as promptly to the side of the old man as if a mental mist had been miraculously removed from his eyes in another instant the steed of the young pawnee was struggling with the torrent  the utmost strength of the horse was needed to urge the fugitives beyond the flight of arrows that came sailing through the air at the next moment the cry of weucha had brought fifty of his comrades to the shore but fortunately among them all there was not one of a rank sufficient to entitle him to the privilege of bearing a fusee one half the stream however was not passed before the form of mahtoree himself was seen on its bank and an ineffectual discharge of firearms announced the rage and disappointment of the chief more than once the trapper had raised his rifle as if about to try its power on his enemies but he as often lowered it without firing the eyes of the pawnee warrior glared like those of the cougar at the sight of so many of the hostile tribe and he answered the impotent effort of their chief by tossing a hand into the air in contempt and raising the warcry of his nation the challenge was too taunting to be endured the tetons dashed into the stream in a body and the river became dotted with the dark forms of beasts and riders  there was now a fearful struggle for the friendly bank as the dahcotahs advanced with beasts which had not like that of the pawnee expended their strength in former efforts and as they moved unincumbered by any thing but their riders the speed of the pursuers greatly outstripped that of the fugitives the trapper who clearly comprehended the whole danger of their situation calmly turned his eyes from the tetons to his young indian associate in order to examine whether the resolution of the latter began to falter as the former lessened the distance between them instead of betraying fear however or any of that concern which might so readily have been excited by the peculiarity of his risk the brow of the young warrior contracted to a look which indicated high and deadly hostility  do you greatly value life friend doctor demanded the old man with a sort of philosophical calmness which made the question doubly appalling to his companion  not for itself returned the naturalist sipping some of the water of the river from the hollow of his hand in order to clear his husky throat not for itself but exceedingly inasmuch as natural history has so deep a stake in my existence therefore  ay resumed the other who mused too deeply to dissect the ideas of the doctor with his usual sagacity tis in truth the history of natur and a base and craven feeling it is now is life as precious to this young pawnee as to any governor in the states and he might save it or at least stand some chance of saving it by letting us go down the stream and yet you see he keeps his faith manfully and like an indian warrior for myself i am old and willing to take the fortune that the lord may see fit to give nor do i conceit that you are of much benefit to mankind and it is a crying shame if not a sin that so fine a youth as this should lose his scalp for two beings so worthless as ourselves i am therefore disposed provided that it shall prove agreeable to you to tell the lad to make the best of his way and to leave us to the mercy of the tetons  i repel the proposition as repugnant to nature and as treason to science exclaimed the alarmed naturalist our progress is miraculous and as this admirable invention moves with so wonderful a facility a few more minutes will serve to bring us to land  the old man regarded him intently for an instant and shaking his head he said  lord what a thing is fear it transforms the creaturs of the world and the craft of man making that which is ugly seemly in our eyes and that which is beautiful unsightly lord lord what a thing is fear  a termination was however put to the discussion by the increasing interest of the chase the horses of the dahcotahs had by this time gained the middle of the current and their riders were already filling the air with yells of triumph at this moment middleton and paul who had led the females to a little thicket appeared again on the margin of the stream menacing their enemies with the rifle  mount mount shouted the trapper the instant he beheld them mount and fly if you value those who lean on you for help mount and leave us in the hands of the lord  stoop your head old trapper returned the voice of paul down with ye both into your nest the teton devil is in your line down with your heads and make way for a kentucky bullet  the old man turned his head and saw that the eager mahtoree who preceded his party some distance had brought himself nearly in a line with the bark and the beehunter who stood perfectly ready to execute his hostile threat bending his body low the rifle was discharged and the swift lead whizzed harmlessly past him on its more distant errand but the eye of the teton chief was not less quick and certain than that of his enemy he threw himself from his horse the moment preceding the report and sunk into the water the beast snorted with terror and anguish throwing half his form out of the river in a desperate plunge then he was seen drifting away in the torrent and dyeing the turbid waters with his blood  the teton chief soon reappeared on the surface and understanding the nature of his loss he swam with vigorous strokes to the nearest of the young men who relinquished his steed as a matter of course to so renowned a warrior the incident however created a confusion in the whole of the dahcotah band who appeared to await the intention of their leader before they renewed their efforts to reach the shore in the mean time the vessel of skin had reached the land and the fugitives were once more united on the margin of the river  the savages were now swimming about in indecision as a flock of pigeons is often seen to hover in confusion after receiving a heavy discharge into its leading column apparently hesitating on the risk of storming a bank so formidably defended the wellknown precaution of indian warfare prevailed and mahtoree admonished by his recent adventure led his warriors back to the shore from which they had come in order to relieve their beasts which were already becoming unruly  now mount you with the tender ones and ride for yonder hillock said the trapper beyond it you will find another stream into which you must enter and turning to the sun follow its bed for a mile until you reach a high and sandy plain there will i meet you go mount this pawnee youth and i and my stout friend the physician who is a desperate warrior are men enough to keep the bank seeing that show and not use is all that is needed  middleton and paul saw no use in wasting their breath in remonstrances against this proposal glad to know that their rear was to be covered even in this imperfect manner they hastily got their horses in motion and soon disappeared on the required route some twenty or thirty minutes succeeded this movement before the tetons on the opposite shore seemed inclined to enter on any new enterprise mahtoree was distinctly visible in the midst of his warriors issuing his mandates and betraying his desire for vengeance by occasionally shaking an arm in the direction of the fugitives but no step was taken which appeared to threaten any further act of immediate hostility at length a yell arose among the savages which announced the occurrence of some fresh event then ishmael and his sluggish sons were seen in the distance and soon the whole of the united force moved down to the very limits of the stream the squatter proceeded to examine the position of his enemies with his usual coolness and as if to try the power of his rifle he sent a bullet among them with a force sufficient to do execution even at the distance at which he stood  now let us depart exclaimed obed endeavouring to catch a furtive glimpse of the lead which he fancied was whizzing at his very ear we have maintained the bank in a gallant manner for a sufficient length of time quite as much military skill is to be displayed in a retreat as in an advance  the old man cast a look behind him and seeing that the equestrians had reached the cover of the hill he made no objections to the proposal the remaining horse was given to the doctor with instructions to pursue the course just taken by middleton and paul when the naturalist was mounted and in full retreat the trapper and the young pawnee stole from the spot in such a manner as to leave their enemies some time in doubt as to their movements instead however of proceeding across the plain towards the hill a route on which they must have been in open view they took a shorter path covered by the formation of the ground and intersected the little watercourse at the point where middleton had been directed to leave it and just in season to join his party the doctor had used so much diligence in the retreat as to have already overtaken his friends and of course all the fugitives were again assembled  the trapper now looked about him for some convenient spot where the whole party might halt as he expressed it for some five or six hours  halt exclaimed the doctor when the alarming proposal reached his ears venerable hunter it would seem that on the contrary many days should be passed in industrious flight  middleton and paul were both of this opinion and each in his particular manner expressed as much  the old man heard them with patience but shook his head like one who was unconvinced and then answered all their arguments in one general and positive reply  why should we fly he asked can the legs of mortal men outstrip the speed of horses do you think the tetons will lie down and sleep or will they cross the water and nose for our trail thanks be to the lord we have washed it well in this stream and if we leave the place with discretion and wisdom we may yet throw them off its track but a prairie is not a wood there a man may journey long caring for nothing but the prints his moccasin leaves whereas in these open plains a runner placed on yonder hill for instance could see far on every side of him like a hovering hawk looking down on his prey no no night must come and darkness be upon us afore we leave this spot but listen to the words of the pawnee he is a lad of spirit and i warrant me many is the hard race that he has run with the sioux bands does my brother think our trail is long enough he demanded in the indian tongue  is a teton a fish that he can see it in the river  but my young men think we should stretch it until it reaches across the prairie  mahtoree has eyes he will see it  what does my brother counsel  the young warrior studied the heavens a moment and appeared to hesitate he mused some time with himself and then he replied like one whose opinion was fixed  the dahcotahs are not asleep he said we must lie in the grass  ah the lad is of my mind said the old man briefly explaining the opinion of his companion to his white friends middleton was obliged to acquiesce and as it was confessedly dangerous to remain upon their feet each one set about assisting in the means to be adopted for their security inez and ellen were quickly bestowed beneath the warm and not uncomfortable shelter of the buffaloe skins which formed a thick covering and tall grass was drawn over the place in such a manner as to evade any examination from a common eye paul and the pawnee fettered the beasts and cast them to the earth where after supplying them with food they were also left concealed in the fog of the prairie no time was lost when these several arrangements were completed before each of the others sought a place of rest and concealment and then the plain appeared again deserted to its solitude  the old man had advised his companions of the absolute necessity of their continuing for hours in this concealment all their hopes of escape depended on the success of the artifice if they might elude the cunning of their pursuers by this simple and therefore less suspected expedient they could renew their flight as the evening approached and by changing their course the chance of final success would be greatly increased influenced by these momentous considerations the whole party lay musing on their situation until thoughts grew weary and sleep finally settled on them all one after another  the deepest silence had prevailed for hours when the quick ears of the trapper and the pawnee were startled by a faint cry of surprise from inez springing to their feet like men who were about to struggle for their lives they found the vast plain the rolling swells the little hillock and the scattered thickets covered alike in one white dazzling sheet of snow  the lord have mercy on ye all exclaimed the old man regarding the prospect with a rueful eye now pawnee do i know the reason why you studied the clouds so closely but it is too late it is too late a squirrel would leave his trail on this light coating of the arth ha there come the imps to a certainty down with ye all down with ye your chance is but small and yet it must not be wilfully cast away  the whole party was instantly concealed again though many an anxious and stolen glance was directed through the tops of the grass on the movements of their enemies at the distance of half a mile the teton band was seen riding in a circuit which was gradually contracting itself and evidently closing upon the very spot where the fugitives lay there was but little difficulty in solving the mystery of this movement the snow had fallen in time to assure them that those they sought were in their rear and they were now employed with the unwearied perseverance and patience of indian warriors in circling the certain boundaries of their place of concealment  each minute added to the jeopardy of the fugitives paul and middleton deliberately prepared their rifles and as the occupied mahtoree came at length within fifty feet of them keeping his eyes riveted on the grass through which he rode they levelled them together and pulled the triggers the effort was answered by the mere snapping of the locks  enough said the old man rising with dignity i have cast away the priming for certain death would follow your rashness now let us meet our fates like men cringing and complaining find no favour in indian eyes  his appearance was greeted by a yell that spread far and wide over the plain and in a moment a hundred savages were seen riding madly to the spot mahtoree received his prisoners with great selfrestraint though a single gleam of fierce joy broke through his clouded brow and the heart of middleton grew cold as he caught the expression of that eye which the chief turned on the nearly insensible but still lovely inez  the exultation of receiving the white captives was so great as for a time to throw the dark and immovable form of their young indian companion entirely out of view he stood apart disdaining to turn an eye on his enemies as motionless as if he were frozen in that attitude of dignity and composure but when a little time had passed even this secondary object attracted the attention of the tetons then it was that the trapper first learned by the shout of triumph and the long drawn yell of delight which burst at once from a hundred throats as well as by the terrible name which filled the air that his youthful friend was no other than that redoubtable and hitherto invincible warrior hardheart     chapter xxv              what are ancient pistol and you friends yet                                                    shakspeare  the curtain of our imperfect drama must fall to rise upon another scene the time is advanced several days during which very material changes had occurred in the situation of the actors the hour is noon and the place an elevated plain that rose at no great distance from the water somewhat abruptly from a fertile bottom which stretched along the margin of one of the numberless watercourses of that region the river took its rise near the base of the rocky mountains and after washing a vast extent of plain it mingled its waters with a still larger stream to become finally lost in the turbid current of the missouri  the landscape was changed materially for the better though the hand which had impressed so much of the desert on the surrounding region had laid a portion of its power on this spot the appearance of vegetation was however less discouraging than in the more sterile wastes of the rolling prairies clusters of trees were scattered in greater profusion and a long outline of ragged forest marked the northern boundary of the view here and there on the bottom were to be seen the evidences of a hasty and imperfect culture of such indigenous vegetables as were of a quick growth and which were known to flourish without the aid of art in deep and alluvial soils on the very edge of what might be called the tableland were pitched the hundred lodges of a horde of wandering siouxes their light tenements were arranged without the least attention to order proximity to the water seemed to be the only consideration which had been consulted in their disposition nor had even this important convenience been always regarded while most of the lodges stood along the brow of the plain many were to be seen at greater distances occupying such places as had first pleased the capricious eyes of their untutored owners the encampment was not military nor in the slightest degree protected from surprise by its position or defences it was open on every side and on every side as accessible as any other point in those wastes if the imperfect and natural obstruction offered by the river be excepted in short the place bore the appearance of having been tenanted longer than its occupants had originally intended while it was not wanting in the signs of readiness for a hasty or even a compelled departure  this was the temporary encampment of that portion of his people who had long been hunting under the direction of mahtoree on those grounds which separated the stationary abodes of his nation from those of the warlike tribes of the pawnees the lodges were tents of skin high conical and of the most simple and primitive construction the shield the quiver the lance and the bow of its master were to be seen suspended from a light post before the opening or door of each habitation the different domestic implements of his one two or three wives as the brave was of greater or lesser renown were carelessly thrown at its side and here and there the round full patient countenance of an infant might be found peeping from its comfortless wrappers of bark as suspended by a deerskin thong from the same post it rocked in the passing air children of a larger growth were tumbling over each other in piles the males even at that early age making themselves distinguished for that species of domination which in after life was to mark the vast distinction between the sexes youths were in the bottom essaying their juvenile powers in curbing the wild steeds of their fathers while here and there a truant girl was to be seen stealing from her labours to admire their fierce and impatient daring  thus far the picture was the daily exhibition of an encampment confident in its security but immediately in front of the lodges was a gathering that seemed to forbode some movements of more than usual interest a few of the withered and remorseless crones of the band were clustering together in readiness to lend their fell voices if needed to aid in exciting their descendants to an exhibition which their depraved tastes coveted as the luxurious roman dame witnessed the struggles and the agony of the gladiator the men were subdivided into groups assorted according to the deeds and reputations of the several individuals of whom they were composed  they who were of that equivocal age which admitted them to the hunts while their discretion was still too doubtful to permit them to be trusted on the warpath hung around the skirts of the whole catching from the fierce models before them that gravity of demeanour and restraint of manner which in time was to become so deeply ingrafted in their own characters a few of the still older class and who had heard the whoop in anger were a little more presuming pressing nigher to the chiefs though far from presuming to mingle in their councils sufficiently distinguished by being permitted to catch the wisdom which fell from lips so venerated the ordinary warriors of the band were still less diffident not hesitating to mingle among the chiefs of lesser note though far from assuming the right to dispute the sentiments of any established brave or to call in question the prudence of measures that were recommended by the more gifted counsellors of the nation  among the chiefs themselves there was a singular compound of exterior they were divided into two classes those who were mainly indebted for their influence to physical causes and to deeds in arms and those who had become distinguished rather for their wisdom than for their services in the field the former was by far the most numerous and the most important class they were men of stature and mien whose stern countenances were often rendered doubly imposing by those evidences of their valour which had been roughly traced on their lineaments by the hands of their enemies that class which had gained its influence by a moral ascendency was extremely limited they were uniformly to be distinguished by the quick and lively expression of their eyes by the air of distrust that marked their movements and occasionally by the vehemence of their utterance in those sudden outbreakings of the mind by which their present consultations were from time to time distinguished  in the very centre of a ring formed by these chosen counsellors was to be seen the person of the disquieted but seemingly calm mahtoree there was a conjunction of all the several qualities of the others in his person and character mind as well as matter had contributed to establish his authority his scars were as numerous and deep as those of the whitest head in his nation his limbs were in their greatest vigour his courage at its fullest height endowed with this rare combination of moral and physical influence the keenest eye in all that assembly was wont to lower before his threatening glance courage and cunning had established his ascendency and it had been rendered in some degree sacred by time he knew so well how to unite the powers of reason and force that in a state of society which admitted of a greater display of his energies the teton would in all probability have been both a conqueror and a despot  a little apart from the gathering of the band was to be seen a set of beings of an entirely different origin taller and far more muscular in their persons the lingering vestiges of their saxon and norman ancestry were yet to be found beneath the swarthy complexions which had been bestowed by an american sun it would have been a curious investigation for one skilled in such an enquiry to have traced those points of difference by which the offspring of the most western european was still to be distinguished from the descendant of the most remote asiatic now that the two in the revolutions of the world were approximating in their habits their residence and not a little in their characters the group of whom we write was composed of the family of the squatter they stood indolent lounging and inert as usual when no immediate demand was made on their dormant energies clustered in front of some four or five habitations of skin for which they were indebted to the hospitality of their teton allies the terms of their unexpected confederation were sufficiently explained by the presence of the horses and domestic cattle that were quietly grazing on the bottom beneath under the jealous eyes of the spirited hetty their wagons were drawn about the lodges in a sort of irregular barrier which at once manifested that their confidence was not entirely restored while on the other hand their policy or indolence prevented any very positive exhibition of distrust there was a singular union of passive enjoyment and of dull curiosity slumbering in every dull countenance as each of the party stood leaning on his rifle regarding the movements of the sioux conference still no sign of expectation or interest escaped from the youngest among them the whole appearing to emulate the most phlegmatic of their savage allies in an exhibition of patience they rarely spoke and when they did it was in some short and contemptuous remark which served to put the physical superiority of a white man and that of an indian in a sufficiently striking point of view in short the family of ishmael appeared now to be in the plenitude of an enjoyment which depended on inactivity but which was not entirely free from certain confused glimmerings of a perspective in which their security stood in some little danger of a rude interruption from teton treachery abiram alone formed a solitary exception to this state of equivocal repose  after a life passed in the commission of a thousand mean and insignificant villanies the mind of the kidnapper had become hardy enough to attempt the desperate adventure which has been laid before the reader in the course of the narrative his influence over the bolder but less active spirit of ishmael was far from great and had not the latter been suddenly expelled from a fertile bottom of which he had taken possession with intent to keep it without much deference to the forms of law he would never have succeeded in enlisting the husband of his sister in an enterprise that required so much decision and forethought their original success and subsequent disappointment have been seen and abiram now sat apart plotting the means by which he might secure to himself the advantages of his undertaking which he perceived were each moment becoming more uncertain through the open admiration of mahtoree for the innocent subject of his villany we shall leave him to his vacillating and confused expedients in order to pass to the description of certain other personages in the drama  there was still another corner of the picture that was occupied on a little bank at the extreme right of the encampment lay the forms of middleton and paul their limbs were painfully bound with thongs cut from the skin of a bison while by a sort of refinement in cruelty they were so placed that each could see a reflection of his own misery in the case of his neighbour within a dozen yards of them a post was set firmly in the ground and against it was bound the light and apollolike person of hardheart between the two stood the trapper deprived of his rifle his pouch and his horn but otherwise left in a sort of contemptuous liberty some five or six young warriors however with quivers at their backs and long tough bows dangling from their shoulders who stood with grave watchfulness at no great distance from the spot sufficiently proclaimed how fruitless any attempt to escape on the part of one so aged and so feeble might prove unlike the other spectators of the important conference these individuals were engaged in a discourse that for them contained an interest of its own  captain said the beehunter with an expression of comical concern that no misfortune could depress in one of his buoyant feelings do you really find that accursed strap of untanned leather cutting into your shoulder or is it only the tickling in my own arm that i feel  when the spirit suffers so deeply the body is insensible to pain returned the more refined though scarcely so spirited middleton would to heaven that some of my trusty artillerists might fall upon this accursed encampment  you might as well wish that these teton lodges were so many hives of hornets and that the insects would come forth and battle with yonder tribe of half naked savages then chuckling with his own conceit the beehunter turned away from his companion and sought a momentary relief from his misery by imagining that so wild an idea might be realised and fancying the manner in which the attack would upset even the well established patience of an indian  middleton was glad to be silent but the old man who had listened to their words drew a little nigher and continued the discourse  here is likely to be a merciless and a hellish business he said shaking his head in a manner to prove that even his experience was at a loss for a remedy in so trying a dilemma our pawnee friend is already staked for the torture and i well know by the eye and the countenance of the great sioux that he is leading on the temper of his people to further enormities  harkee old trapper said paul writhing in his bonds to catch a glimpse of the others melancholy face you ar skilled in indian tongues and know somewhat of indian deviltries go you to the council and tell their chiefs in my name that is to say in the name of paul hover of the state of kentucky that provided they will guarantee the safe return of one ellen wade into the states they are welcome to take his scalp when and in such manner as best suits their amusements or ifsobe they will not trade on these conditions you may throw in an hour or two of torture before hand in order to sweeten the bargain to their damnable appetites  ah lad it is little they would hearken to such an offer knowing as they do that you are already like a bear in a trap as little able to fight as to fly but be not downhearted for the colour of a white man is sometimes his deathwarrant among these far tribes of savages and sometimes his shield though they love us not cunning often ties their hands could the red nations work their will trees would shortly be growing again on the ploughed fields of america and woods would be whitened with christian bones no one can doubt that who knows the quality of the love which a redskin bears a paleface but they have counted our numbers until their memories fail them and they are not without their policy therefore is our fate unsettled but i fear me there is small hope left for the pawnee  as the old man concluded he walked slowly towards the subject of his latter observation taking his post at no great distance from his side here he stood observing such a silence and mien as became him to manifest to a chief so renowned and so situated as his captive associate but the eye of hardheart was fastened on the distance and his whole air was that of one whose thoughts were entirely removed from the present scene  the siouxes are in council on my brother the trapper at length observed when he found he could only attract the others attention by speaking  the young partisan turned his head with a calm smile as he answered they are counting the scalps over the lodge of hardheart  no doubt no doubt their tempers begin to mount as they remember the number of tetons you have struck and better would it be for you now had more of your days been spent in chasing the deer and fewer on the warpath then some childless mother of this tribe might take you in the place of her lost son and your time would be filled in peace  does my father think that a warrior can ever die the master of life does not open his hand to take away his gifts again when he wants his young men he calls them and they go but the redskin he has once breathed on lives for ever  ay this is a more comfortable and a more humble faith than that which yonder heartless teton harbours there is something in these loups which opens my inmost heart to them they seem to have the courage ay and the honesty too of the delawares of the hills and this ladit is wonderful it is very wonderful but the age and the eye and the limbs are as if they might have been brothers tell me pawnee have you ever in your traditions heard of a mighty people who once lived on the shores of the saltlake hard by the rising sun  the earth is white by people of the colour of my father  nay nay i speak not now of any strollers who have crept into the land to rob the lawful owners of their birthright but of a people who are or rather were what with nature and what with paint red as the berry on the bush  i have heard the old men say that there were bands who hid themselves in the woods under the rising sun because they dared not come upon the open prairies to fight with men  do not your traditions tell you of the greatest the bravest and the wisest nation of redskins that the wahcondah has ever breathed upon  hardheart raised his head with a loftiness and dignity that even his bonds could not repress as he answered  has age blinded my father or does he see so many siouxes that he believes there are no longer any pawnees  ah such is mortal vanity and pride exclaimed the disappointed old man in english natur is as strong in a redskin as in the bosom of a man of white gifts now would a delaware conceit himself far mightier than a pawnee just as a pawnee boasts himself to be of the princes of the arth and so it was atween the frenchers of the canadas and the redcoated english that the king did use to send into the states when states they were not but outcrying and petitioning provinces they fout and they fout and what marvellous boastings did they give forth to the world of their own valour and victories while both parties forgot to name the humble soldier of the land who did the real service but who as he was not privileged then to smoke at the great council fire of his nation seldom heard of his deeds after they were once bravely done  when the old man had thus given vent to the nearly dormant but far from extinct military pride that had so unconsciously led him into the very error he deprecated his eye which had begun to quicken and glimmer with some of the ardour of his youth softened and turned its anxious look on the devoted captive whose countenance was also restored to its former cold look of abstraction and thought  young warrior he continued in a voice that was growing tremulous i have never been father or brother the wahcondah made me to live alone he never tied my heart to house or field by the cords with which the men of my race are bound to their lodges if he had i should not have journeyed so far and seen so much but i have tarried long among a people who lived in those woods you mention and much reason did i find to imitate their courage and love their honesty the master of life has made us all pawnee with a feeling for our kind i never was a father but well do i know what is the love of one you are like a lad i valued and i had even begun to fancy that some of his blood might be in your veins but what matters that you are a true man as i know by the way in which you keep your faith and honesty is a gift too rare to be forgotten my heart yearns to you boy and gladly would i do you good  the youthful warrior listened to the words which came from the lips of the other with a force and simplicity that established their truth and he bowed his head on his naked bosom in testimony of the respect with which he met the proffer then lifting his dark eye to the level of the view he seemed to be again considering of things removed from every personal consideration the trapper who well knew how high the pride of a warrior would sustain him in those moments he believed to be his last awaited the pleasure of his young friend with a meekness and patience that he had acquired by his association with that remarkable race at length the gaze of the pawnee began to waver and then quick flashing glances were turned from the countenance of the old man to the air and from the air to his deeply marked lineaments again as if the spirit which governed their movements was beginning to be troubled  father the young brave finally answered in a voice of confidence and kindness i have heard your words they have gone in at my ears and are now within me the whiteheaded longknife has no son the hardheart of the pawnees is young but he is already the oldest of his family he found the bones of his father on the hunting ground of the osages and he has sent them to the prairies of the good spirits no doubt the great chief his father has seen them and knows what is part of himself but the wahcondah will soon call to us both you because you have seen all that is to be seen in this country and hardheart because he has need of a warrior who is young there is no time for the pawnee to show the paleface the duty that a son owes to his father  old as i am and miserable and helpless as i now stand to what i once was i may live to see the sun go down in the prairie does my son expect to do as much  the tetons are counting the scalps on my lodge returned the young chief with a smile whose melancholy was singularly illuminated by a gleam of triumph  and they find them many too many for the safety of its owner while he is in their revengeful hands my son is not a woman and he looks on the path he is about to travel with a steady eye has he nothing to whisper in the ears of his people before he starts these legs are old but they may yet carry me to the forks of the loup river  tell them that hardheart has tied a knot in his wampum for every teton burst from the lips of the captive with that vehemence with which sudden passion is known to break through the barriers of artificial restraint if he meets one of them all in the prairies of the master of life his heart will become sioux  ah that feeling would be a dangerous companion for a man with white gifts to start with on so solemn a journey muttered the old man in english this is not what the good moravians said to the councils of the delawares nor what is so often preached to the whiteskins in the settlements though to the shame of the colour be it said it is so little heeded pawnee i love you but being a christian man i cannot be the runner to bear such a message  if my father is afraid the tetons will hear him let him whisper it softly to our old men  as for fear young warrior it is no more the shame of a paleface than of a redskin the wahcondah teaches us to love the life he gives but it is as men love their hunts and their dogs and their carabines and not with the doting that a mother looks upon her infant the master of life will not have to speak aloud twice when he calls my name i am as ready to answer to it now as i shall be tomorrow or at any time it may please his mighty will but what is a warrior without his traditions mine forbid me to carry your words  the chief made a dignified motion of assent and here there was great danger that those feelings of confidence which had been so singularly awakened would as suddenly subside but the heart of the old man had been too sensibly touched through long dormant but still living recollections to break off the communication so rudely he pondered for a minute and then bending his look wistfully on his young associate again continued  each warrior must be judged by his gifts i have told my son what i cannot but let him open his ears to what i can do an elk shall not measure the prairie much swifter than these old legs if the pawnee will give me a message that a white man may bear  let the paleface listen returned the other after hesitating a single instant longer under a lingering sensation of his former disappointment he will stay here till the siouxes have done counting the scalps of their dead warriors he will wait until they have tried to cover the heads of eighteen tetons with the skin of one pawnee he will open his eyes wide that he may see the place where they bury the bones of a warrior  all this will i and may i do noble boy  he will mark the spot that he may know it  no fear no fear that i shall forget the place interrupted the other whose fortitude began to give way under so trying an exhibition of calmness and resignation  then i know that my father will go to my people his head is grey and his words will not be blown away with the smoke let him get on my lodge and call the name of hardheart aloud no pawnee will be deaf then let my father ask for the colt that has never been ridden but which is sleeker than the buck and swifter than the elk  i understand you boy i understand you interrupted the attentive old man and what you say shall be done ay and well done too or im but little skilled in the wishes of a dying indian  and when my young men have given my father the halter of that colt he will lead him by a crooked path to the grave of hardheart  will i ay that i will brave youth though the winter covers these plains in banks of snow and the sun is hidden as much by day as by night to the head of the holy spot will i lead the beast and place him with his eyes looking towards the setting sun  and my father will speak to him and tell him that the master who has fed him since he was foaled has now need of him  that too will i do though the lord he knows that i shall hold discourse with a horse not with any vain conceit that my words will be understood but only to satisfy the cravings of indian superstition hector my pup what think you dog of talking to a horse  let the greybeard speak to him with the tongue of a pawnee interrupted the young victim perceiving that his companion had used an unknown language for the preceding speech  my sons will shall be done and with these old hands which i had hoped had nearly done with bloodshed whether it be of man or beast will i slay the animal on your grave  it is good returned the other a gleam of satisfaction flitting across his features hardheart will ride his horse to the blessed prairies and he will come before the master of life like a chief  the sudden and striking change which instantly occurred in the countenance of the indian caused the trapper to look aside when he perceived that the conference of the siouxes had ended and that mahtoree attended by one or two of the principal warriors was deliberately approaching his intended victim     chapter xxvi                i am not prone to weeping as our sex               commonly are                       but i have that honourable               grief lodged here which burns worse than               tears drown                                                    shakspeare  when within twenty feet of the prisoners the tetons stopped and their leader made a sign to the old man to draw nigh the trapper obeyed quitting the young pawnee with a significant look which was received as it was meant for an additional pledge that he would never forget his promise so soon as mahtoree found that the other had stopped within reach of him he stretched forth his arm and laying a hand upon the shoulder of the attentive old man he stood regarding him a minute with eyes that seemed willing to penetrate the recesses of his most secret thoughts  is a paleface always made with two tongues he demanded when he found that as usual with the subject of this examination he was as little intimidated by his present frown as moved by any apprehensions of the future  honesty lies deeper than the skin  it is so now let my father hear me mahtoree has but one tongue the greyhead has many they may be all straight and none of them forked a sioux is no more than a sioux but a paleface is every thing he can talk to the pawnee and the konza and the omawhaw and he can talk to his own people  ay there are linguists in the settlements that can do still more but what profits it all the master of life has an ear for every language  the greyhead has done wrong he has said one thing when he meant another he has looked before him with his eyes and behind him with his mind he has ridden the horse of a sioux too hard he has been the friend of a pawnee and the enemy of my people  teton i am your prisoner though my words are white they will not complain act your will  no mahtoree will not make a white hair red my father is free the prairie is open on every side of him but before the greyhead turns his back on the siouxes let him look well at them that he may tell his own chief how great is a dahcotah  i am not in a hurry to go on my path you see a man with a white head and no woman teton therefore shall i not run myself out of breath to tell the nations of the prairies what the siouxes are doing  it is good my father has smoked with the chiefs at many councils returned mahtoree who now thought himself sufficiently sure of the others favour to go more directly to his object mahtoree will speak with the tongue of his very dear friend and father a young paleface will listen when an old man of that nation opens his mouth go my father will make what a poor indian says fit for a white ear  speak aloud said the trapper who readily understood the metaphorical manner in which the teton expressed a desire that he should become an interpreter of his words into the english language speak my young men listen now captain and you too friend beehunter prepare yourselves to meet the deviltries of this savage with the stout hearts of white warriors if you find yourselves giving way under his threats just turn your eyes on that noblelooking pawnee whose time is measured with a hand as niggardly as that with which a trader in the towns gives forth the fruits of the lord inch by inch in order to satisfy his covetousness a single look at the boy will set you both up in resolution  my brother has turned his eyes on the wrong path interrupted mahtoree with a complacency that betrayed how unwilling he was to offend his intended interpreter  the dahcotah will speak to my young men  after he has sung in the ear of the flower of the palefaces  the lord forgive the desperate villain exclaimed the old man in english there are none so tender or so young or so innocent as to escape his ravenous wishes but hard words and cold looks will profit nothing therefore it will be wise to speak him fair let mahtoree open his mouth  would my father cry out that the women and children should hear the wisdom of chiefs we will go into the lodge and whisper  as the teton ended he pointed significantly towards a tent vividly emblazoned with the history of one of his own boldest and most commended exploits and which stood a little apart from the rest as if to denote it was the residence of some privileged individual of the band the shield and quiver at its entrance were richer than common and the high distinction of a fusee attested the importance of its proprietor in every other particular it was rather distinguished by signs of poverty than of wealth the domestic utensils were fewer in number and simpler in their forms than those to be seen about the openings of the meanest lodges nor was there a single one of those highprized articles of civilised life which were occasionally bought of the traders in bargains that bore so hard on the ignorant natives all these had been bestowed as they had been acquired by the generous chief on his subordinates to purchase an influence that might render him the master of their lives and persons a species of wealth that was certainly more noble in itself and far dearer to his ambition  the old man well knew this to be the lodge of mahtoree and in obedience to the sign of the chief he held his way towards it with slow and reluctant steps but there were others present who were equally interested in the approaching conference whose apprehensions were not to be so easily suppressed the watchful eye and jealous ears of middleton had taught him enough to fill his soul with horrible forebodings with an incredible effort he succeeded in gaining his feet and called aloud to the retiring trapper  i conjure you old man if the love you bore my parents was more than words or if the love you bear your god is that of a christian man utter not a syllable that may wound the ear of that innocent  exhausted in spirit and fettered in limbs he then fell like an inanimate log to the earth where he lay like one dead  paul had however caught the clue and completed the exhortation in his peculiar manner  harkee old trapper he shouted vainly endeavouring at the same time to make a gesture of defiance with his hand if you ar about to play the interpreter speak such words to the ears of that damnable savage as becomes a white man to use and a heathen to hear tell him from me that if he does or says the thing that is uncivil to the girl called nelly wade that ill curse him with my dying breath that ill pray for all good christians in kentucky to curse him sitting and standing eating and drinking fighting praying or at horseraces indoors and outdoors in summer or winter or in the month of march in short illay it ar a fact morally trueill haunt him if the ghost of a paleface can contrive to lift itself from a grave made by the hands of a redskin  having thus ventured the most terrible denunciation he could devise and the one which in the eyes of the honest beehunter there seemed the greatest likelihood of his being able to put in execution he was obliged to await the fruits of his threat with that resignation which would be apt to govern a western borderman who in addition to the prospects just named had the advantage of contemplating them in fetters and bondage we shall not detain the narrative to relate the quaint morals with which he next endeavoured to cheer the drooping spirits of his more sensitive companion or the occasional pithy and peculiar benedictions that he pronounced on all the bands of the dahcotahs commencing with those whom he accused of stealing or murdering on the banks of the distant mississippi and concluding in terms of suitable energy with the teton tribe the latter more than once received from his lips curses as sententious and as complicated as that celebrated anathema of the church for a knowledge of which most unlettered protestants are indebted to the pious researches of the worthy tristram shandy but as middleton recovered from his exhaustion he was fain to appease the boisterous temper of his associate by admonishing him of the uselessness of such denunciations and of the possibility of their hastening the very evil he deprecated by irritating the resentments of a race who were sufficiently fierce and lawless even in their most pacific moods  in the mean time the trapper and the sioux chief pursued their way to the lodge the former had watched with painful interest the expression of mahtorees eye while the words of middleton and paul were pursuing their footsteps but the mien of the indian was far too much restrained and selfguarded to permit the smallest of his emotions to escape through any of those ordinary outlets by which the condition of the human volcano is commonly betrayed his look was fastened on the little habitation they approached and for the moment his thoughts appeared to brood alone on the purposes of this extraordinary visit  the appearance of the interior of the lodge corresponded with its exterior it was larger than most of the others more finished in its form and finer in its materials but there its superiority ceased nothing could be more simple and republican than the form of living that the ambitious and powerful teton chose to exhibit to the eyes of his people a choice collection of weapons for the chase some three or four medals bestowed by the traders and political agents of the canadas as a homage to or rather as an acknowledgment of his rank with a few of the most indispensable articles of personal accommodation composed its furniture it abounded in neither venison nor the wildbeef of the prairies its crafty owner having well understood that the liberality of a single individual would be abundantly rewarded by the daily contributions of a band although as preeminent in the chase as in war a deer or a buffaloe was never seen to enter whole into his lodge in return an animal was rarely brought into the encampment that did not contribute to support the family of mahtoree but the policy of the chief seldom permitted more to remain than sufficed for the wants of the day perfectly assured that all must suffer before hunger the bane of savage life could lay its fell fangs on so important a victim  immediately beneath the favourite bow of the chief and encircled in a sort of magical ring of spears shields lances and arrows all of which had in their time done good service was suspended the mysterious and sacred medicinebag it was highlywrought in wampum and profusely ornamented with beads and porcupines quills after the most cunning devices of indian ingenuity the peculiar freedom of mahtorees religious creed has been more than once intimated and by a singular species of contradiction he appeared to have lavished his attentions on this emblem of a supernatural agency in a degree that was precisely inverse to his faith it was merely the manner in which the sioux imitated the wellknown expedient of the pharisees in order that they might be seen of men  the tent had not however been entered by its owner since his return from the recent expedition as the reader has already anticipated it had been made the prison of inez and ellen the bride of middleton was seated on a simple couch of sweetscented herbs covered with skins she had already suffered so much and witnessed so many wild and unlookedfor events within the short space of her captivity that every additional misfortune fell with a diminished force on her seemingly devoted head her cheeks were bloodless her dark and usually animated eye was contracted in an expression of settled concern and her form appeared shrinking and sensitive nearly to extinction but in the midst of these evidences of natural weakness there were at times such an air of pious resignation such gleams of meek but holy hope lighting her countenance as might well have rendered it a question whether the hapless captive was most a subject of pity or of admiration all the precepts of father ignatius were riveted in her faithful memory and not a few of his pious visions were floating before her imagination sustained by so sacred resolutions the mild the patient and the confiding girl was bowing her head to this new stroke of providence with the same sort of meekness as she would have submitted to any other prescribed penitence for her sins though nature at moments warred powerfully with so compelled a humility  on the other hand ellen had exhibited far more of the woman and consequently of the passions of the world she had wept until her eyes were swollen and red her cheeks were flushed and angry and her whole mien was distinguished by an air of spirit and resentment that was not a little however qualified by apprehensions for the future in short there was that about the eye and step of the betrothed of paul which gave a warranty that should happier times arrive and the constancy of the beehunter finally meet with its reward he would possess a partner every way worthy to cope with his own thoughtless and buoyant temperament  there was still another and a third figure in that little knot of females it was the youngest the most highly gifted and until now the most favoured of the wives of the teton her charms had not been without the most powerful attraction in the eyes of her husband until they had so unexpectedly opened on the surpassing loveliness of a woman of the palefaces from that hapless moment the graces the attachment the fidelity of the young indian had lost their power to please still the complexion of tachechana though less dazzling than that of her rival was for her race clear and healthy her hazel eye had the sweetness and playfulness of the antelopes her voice was soft and joyous as the song of the wren and her happy laugh was the very melody of the forest of all the sioux girls tachechana or the fawn was the lightesthearted and the most envied her father had been a distinguished brave and her brothers had already left their bones on a distant and dreary warpath numberless were the warriors who had sent presents to the lodge of her parents but none of them were listened to until a messenger from the great mahtoree had come she was his third wife it is true but she was confessedly the most favoured of them all their union had existed but two short seasons and its fruits now lay sleeping at her feet wrapped in the customary ligatures of skin and bark which form the swaddlings of an indian infant  at the moment when mahtoree and the trapper arrived at the opening of the lodge the young sioux wife was seated on a simple stool turning her soft eyes with looks that varied like her emotions with love and wonder from the unconscious child to those rare beings who had filled her youthful and uninstructed mind with so much admiration and astonishment though inez and ellen had passed an entire day in her sight it seemed as if the longings of her curiosity were increasing with each new gaze she regarded them as beings of an entirely different nature and condition from the females of the prairie even the mystery of their complicated attire had its secret influence on her simple mind though it was the grace and charms of sex to which nature has made every people so sensible that most attracted her admiration but while her ingenuous disposition freely admitted the superiority of the strangers over the less brilliant attractions of the dahcotah maidens she had seen no reason to deprecate their advantages the visit that she was now about to receive was the first which her husband had made to the tent since his return from the recent inroad and he was ever present to her thoughts as a successful warrior who was not ashamed in the moments of inaction to admit the softer feelings of a father and a husband  we have every where endeavoured to show that while mahtoree was in all essentials a warrior of the prairies he was much in advance of his people in those acquirements which announce the dawnings of civilisation he had held frequent communion with the traders and troops of the canadas and the intercourse had unsettled many of those wild opinions which were his birthright without perhaps substituting any others of a nature sufficiently definite to be profitable his reasoning was rather subtle than true and his philosophy far more audacious than profound like thousands of more enlightened beings who fancy they are able to go through the trials of human existence without any other support than their own resolutions his morals were accommodating and his motive selfish these several characteristics will be understood always with reference to the situation of the indian though little apology is needed for finding resemblances between men who essentially possess the same nature however it may be modified by circumstances  notwithstanding the presence of inez and ellen the entrance of the teton warrior into the lodge of his favourite wife was made with the tread and mien of a master the step of his moccasin was noiseless but the rattling of his bracelets and of the silver ornaments of his leggings sufficed to announce his approach as he pushed aside the skin covering of the opening of the tent and stood in the presence of its inmates a faint cry of pleasure burst from the lips of tachechana in the suddenness of her surprise but the emotion was instantly suppressed in that subdued demeanour which should characterise a matron of her tribe instead of returning the stolen glance of his youthful and secretly rejoicing wife mahtoree moved to the couch occupied by his prisoners and placed himself in the haughty upright attitude of an indian chief before their eyes the old man had glided past him and already taken a position suited to the office he had been commanded to fill  surprise kept the females silent and nearly breathless though accustomed to the sight of savage warriors in the horrid panoply of their terrible profession there was something so startling in the entrance and so audacious in the inexplicable look of their conqueror that the eyes of both sunk to the earth under a feeling of terror and embarrassment then inez recovered herself and addressing the trapper she demanded with the dignity of an offended gentlewoman though with her accustomed grace to what circumstance they owed this extraordinary and unexpected visit the old man hesitated but clearing his throat like one who was about to make an effort to which he was little used he ventured on the following reply  lady he said a savage is a savage and you are not to look for the uses and formalities of the settlements on a bleak and windy prairie as these indians would say fashions and courtesies are things so light that they would blow away as for myself though a man of the forest i have seen the ways of the great in my time and i am not to learn that they differ from the ways of the lowly i was long a servingman in my youth not one of your beckandnod runners about a household but a man that went through the servitude of the forest with his officer and well do i know in what manner to approach the wife of a captain now had i the ordering of this visit i would first have hemmed aloud at the door in order that you might hear that strangers were coming and then i  the manner is indifferent interrupted inez too anxious to await the prolix explanations of the old man why is the visit made  therein shall the savage speak for himself the daughters of the palefaces wish to know why the great teton has come into his lodge  mahtoree regarded his interrogator with a surprise which showed how extraordinary he deemed the question then placing himself in a posture of condescension after a moments delay he answered  sing in the ears of the darkeye tell her the lodge of mahtoree is very large and that it is not full she shall find room in it and none shall be greater than she tell the lighthair that she too may stay in the lodge of a brave and eat of his venison mahtoree is a great chief his hand is never shut  teton returned the trapper shaking his head in evidence of the strong disapprobation with which he heard this language the tongue of a redskin must be coloured white before it can make music in the ears of a paleface should your words be spoken my daughters would shut their ears and mahtoree would seem a trader to their eyes now listen to what comes from a greyhead and then speak accordingly my people is a mighty people the sun rises on their eastern and sets on their western border the land is filled with brighteyed and laughing girls like these you seeay teton i tell no lie observing his auditor to start with an air of distrustbrighteyed and pleasant to behold as these before you  has my father a hundred wives interrupted the savage laying his finger on the shoulder of the trapper with a look of curious interest in the reply  no dahcotah the master of life has said to me live alone your lodge shall be the forest the roof of your wigwam the clouds but though never bound in the secret faith which in my nation ties one man to one woman often have i seen the workings of that kindness which brings the two together go into the regions of my people you will see the daughters of the land fluttering through the towns like manycoloured and joyful birds in the season of blossoms you will meet them singing and rejoicing along the great paths of the country and you will hear the woods ringing with their laughter they are very excellent to behold and the young men find pleasure in looking at them  hugh ejaculated the attentive mahtoree  ay well may you put faith in what you hear for it is no lie but when a youth has found a maiden to please him he speaks to her in a voice so soft that none else can hear he does not say my lodge is empty and there is room for another but shall i build and will the virgin show me near what spring she would dwell his voice is sweeter than honey from the locust and goes into the ear thrilling like the song of a wren therefore if my brother wishes his words to be heard he must speak with a white tongue  mahtoree pondered deeply and in a wonder that he did not attempt to conceal it was reversing all the order of society and according to his established opinions endangering the dignity of a chief for a warrior thus to humble himself before a woman but as inez sat before him reserved and imposing in air utterly unconscious of his object and least of all suspecting the true purport of so extraordinary a visit the savage felt the influence of a manner to which he was unaccustomed bowing his head in acknowledgment of his error he stepped a little back and placing himself in an attitude of easy dignity he began to speak with the confidence of one who had been no less distinguished for eloquence than for deeds in arms keeping his eyes riveted on the unconscious bride of middleton he proceeded in the following words  i am a man with a red skin but my eyes are dark they have been open since many snows they have seen many thingsthey know a brave from a coward when a boy i saw nothing but the bison and the deer i went to the hunts and i saw the cougar and the bear this made mahtoree a man he talked with his mother no more his ears were open to the wisdom of the old men they told him every thingthey told him of the bigknives he went on the warpath he was then the last now he is the first what dahcotah dare say he will go before mahtoree into the hunting grounds of the pawnees the chiefs met him at their doors and they said my son is without a home they gave him their lodges they gave him their riches and they gave him their daughters then mahtoree became a chief as his fathers had been he struck the warriors of all the nations and he could have chosen wives from the pawnees the omawhaws and the konzas but he looked at the hunting grounds and not at his village he thought a horse was pleasanter than a dahcotah girl but he found a flower on the prairies and he plucked it and brought it into his lodge he forgets that he is the master of a single horse he gives them all to the stranger for mahtoree is not a thief he will only keep the flower he found on the prairie her feet are very tender she cannot walk to the door of her father she will stay in the lodge of a valiant warrior for ever  when he had finished this extraordinary address the teton awaited to have it translated with the air of a suitor who entertained no very disheartening doubts of his success the trapper had not lost a syllable of the speech and he now prepared himself to render it into english in such a manner as should leave its principal idea even more obscure than in the original but as his reluctant lips were in the act of parting ellen lifted a finger and with a keen glance from her quick eye at the still attentive inez she interrupted him  spare your breath she said all that a savage says is not to be repeated before a christian lady  inez started blushed and bowed with an air of reserve as she coldly thanked the old man for his intentions and observed that she could now wish to be alone  my daughters have no need of ears to understand what a great dahcotah says returned the trapper addressing himself to the expecting mahtoree the look he has given and the signs he has made are enough they understand him they wish to think of his words for the children of great braves such as their fathers are do nothing with out much thought  with this explanation so flattering to the energy of his eloquence and so promising to his future hopes the teton was every way content he made the customary ejaculation of assent and prepared to retire saluting the females in the cold but dignified manner of his people he drew his robe about him and moved from the spot where he had stood with an air of illconcealed triumph  but there had been a stricken though a motionless and unobserved auditor of the foregoing scene not a syllable had fallen from the lips of the long and anxiously expected husband that had not gone directly to the heart of his unoffending wife in this manner had he wooed her from the lodge of her father and it was to listen to similar pictures of the renown and deeds of the greatest brave in her tribe that she had shut her ears to the tender tales of so many of the sioux youths  as the teton turned to leave his lodge in the manner just mentioned he found this unexpected and halfforgotten object before him she stood in the humble guise and with the shrinking air of an indian girl holding the pledge of their former love in her arms directly in his path starting the chief regained the marblelike indifference of countenance which distinguished in so remarkable a degree the restrained or more artificial expression of his features and signed to her with an air of authority to give place  is not tachechana the daughter of a chief demanded a subdued voice in which pride struggled with anguish were not her brothers braves  go the men are calling their partisan he has no ears for a woman  no replied the supplicant it is not the voice of tachechana that you hear but this boy speaking with the tongue of his mother he is the son of a chief and his words will go up to his fathers ears listen to what he says when was mahtoree hungry and tachechana had not food for him when did he go on the path of the pawnees and find it empty that my mother did not weep when did he come back with the marks of their blows that she did not sing what sioux girl has given a brave a son like me look at me well that you may know me my eyes are the eagles i look at the sun and laugh in a little time the dahcotahs will follow me to the hunts and on the warpath why does my father turn his eyes from the woman that gives me milk why has he so soon forgotten the daughter of a mighty sioux  there was a single instant as the exulting father suffered his cold eye to wander to the face of the laughing boy that the stern nature of the teton seemed touched but shaking off the grateful sentiment like one who would gladly be rid of any painful because reproachful emotion he laid his hand calmly on the arm of his wife and led her directly in front of inez pointing to the sweet countenance that was beaming on her own with a look of tenderness and commiseration he paused to allow his wife to contemplate a loveliness which was quite as excellent to her ingenuous mind as it had proved dangerous to the character of her faithless husband when he thought abundant time had passed to make the contrast sufficiently striking he suddenly raised a small mirror that dangled at her breast an ornament he had himself bestowed in an hour of fondness as a compliment to her beauty and placed her own dark image in its place wrapping his robe again about him the teton motioned to the trapper to follow and stalked haughtily from the lodge muttering as he went  mahtoree is very wise what nation has so great a chief as the dahcotahs  tachechana stood frozen into a statue of humility her mild and usually joyous countenance worked as if the struggle within was about to dissolve the connection between her soul and that more material part whose deformity was becoming so loathsome inez and ellen were utterly ignorant of the nature of her interview with her husband though the quick and sharpened wits of the latter led her to suspect a truth to which the entire innocence of the former furnished no clue they were both however about to tender those sympathies which are so natural to and so graceful in the sex when their necessity seemed suddenly to cease the convulsions in the features of the young sioux disappeared and her countenance became cold and rigid like chiselled stone a single expression of subdued anguish which had made its impression on a brow that had rarely before contracted with sorrow alone remained it was never removed in all the changes of seasons fortunes and years which in the vicissitudes of a suffering female savage life she was subsequently doomed to endure as in the case of a premature blight let the plant quicken and revive as it may the effects of that withering touch were always present  tachechana first stripped her person of every vestige of those rude but highly prized ornaments which the liberality of her husband had been wont to lavish on her and she tendered them meekly and without a murmur as an offering to the superiority of inez the bracelets were forced from her wrists the complicated mazes of beads from her leggings and the broad silver band from her brow then she paused long and painfully but it would seem that the resolution she had once adopted was not to be conquered by the lingering emotions of any affection however natural the boy himself was next laid at the feet of her supposed rival and well might the selfabased wife of the teton believe that the burden of her sacrifice was now full  while inez and ellen stood regarding these several strange movements with eyes of wonder a low soft musical voice was heard saying in a language that to them was unintelligible  a strange tongue will tell my boy the manner to become a man he will hear sounds that are new but he will learn them and forget the voice of his mother it is the will of the wahcondah and a sioux girl should not complain speak to him softly for his ears are very little when he is big your words may be louder let him not be a girl for very sad is the life of a woman teach him to keep his eyes on the men show him how to strike them that do him wrong and let him never forget to return blow for blow when he goes to hunt the flower of the palefaces she concluded using in bitterness the metaphor which had been supplied by the imagination of her truant husband will whisper softly in his ears that the skin of his mother was red and that she was once the fawn of the dahcotahs  tachechana pressed a kiss on the lips of her son and withdrew to the farther side of the lodge here she drew her light calico robe over her head and took her seat in token of humility on the naked earth all efforts to attract her attention were fruitless she neither heard remonstrances nor felt the touch once or twice her voice rose in a sort of wailing song from beneath her quivering mantle but it never mounted into the wildness of savage music in this manner she remained unseen for hours while events were occurring without the lodge which not only materially changed the complexion of her own fortunes but left a lasting and deep impression on the future movements of the wandering sioux     chapter xxvii    ill no swaggerers i am in good name and fame with the very best   shut the doorthere come no swaggerers here i have not lived   all this while to have swaggering now shut the door i pray you                                                    shakspeare  mahtoree encountered at the door of his lodge ishmael abiram and esther the first glance of his eye at the countenance of the heavymoulded squatter served to tell the cunning teton that the treacherous truce he had made with these dupes of his superior sagacity was in some danger of a violent termination  look you here old greybeard said ishmael seizing the trapper and whirling him round as if he had been a top that i am tired of carrying on a discourse with fingers and thumbs instead of a tongue ar a natural fact so youll play linguister and put my words into indian without much caring whether they suit the stomach of a redskin or not  say on friend calmly returned the trapper they shall be given as plainly as you send them  friend repeated the squatter eyeing the other for an instant with an expression of indefinable meaning but it is no more than a word and sounds break no bones and survey no farms tell this thieving sioux then that i come to claim the conditions of our solemn bargain made at the foot of the rock  when the trapper had rendered his meaning into the sioux language mahtoree demanded with an air of surprise  is my brother cold buffaloe skins are plenty is he hungry let my young men carry venison into his lodges  the squatter elevated his clenched fist in a menacing manner and struck it with violence on the palm of his open hand by way of confirming his determination as he answered  tell the deceitful liar i have not come like a beggar to pick his bones but like a freeman asking for his own and have it i will and moreover tell him i claim that you too miserable sinner as you ar should be given up to justice theres no mistake my prisoner my niece and you i demand the three at his hands according to a sworn agreement  the immovable old man smiled with an expression of singular intelligence as he answered  friend squatter you ask what few men would be willing to grant you would first cut the tongue from mouth of the teton and then the heart from his bosom  it is little that ishmael bush regards who or what is damaged in claiming his own but put you the questions in straightgoing indian and when you speak of yourself make such a sign as a white man will understand in order that i may know there is no foul play  the trapper laughed in his silent fashion and muttered a few words to himself before he addressed the chief  let the dahcotah open his ears very wide he said that big words may have room to enter his friend the bigknife comes with an empty hand and he says that the teton must fill it  wagh mahtoree is a rich chief he is master of the prairies  he must give the darkhair  the brow of the chief contracted in an ominous frown that threatened instant destruction to the audacious squatter but as suddenly recollecting his policy he craftily replied  a girl is too light for the hand of such a brave i will fill it with buffaloes  he says he has need of the lighthair too who has his blood in her veins  she shall be the wife of mahtoree then the longknife will be the father of a chief  and me continued the trapper making one of those expressive signs by which the natives communicate with nearly the same facility as with their tongues and turning to the squatter at the same time in order that the latter might see he dealt fairly by him he asks for a miserable and wornout trapper  the dahcotah threw his arm over the shoulder of the old man with an air of great affection before he replied to this third and last demand  my friend is old he said and cannot travel far he will stay with the tetons that they may learn wisdom from his words what sioux has a tongue like my father no let his words be very soft but let them be very clear mahtoree will give skins and buffaloes he will give the young men of the palefaces wives but he cannot give away any who live in his own lodge  perfectly satisfied himself with this laconic reply the chief was moving towards his expecting counsellors when suddenly returning he interrupted the translation of the trapper by adding  tell the great buffaloe a name by which the tetons had already christened ishmael that mahtoree has a hand which is always open see he added pointing to the hard and wrinkled visage of the attentive esther his wife is too old for so great a chief let him put her out of his lodge mahtoree loves him as a brother he is his brother he shall have the youngest wife of the teton tachechana the pride of the sioux girls shall cook his venison and many braves will look at him with longing minds go a dahcotah is generous  the singular coolness with which the teton concluded this audacious proposal confounded even the practised trapper he stared after the retiring form of the indian with an astonishment he did not care to conceal nor did he renew his attempt at interpretation until the person of mahtoree was blended with the cluster of warriors who had so long and with so characteristic patience awaited his return  the teton chief has spoken very plainly the old man continued he will not give you the lady to whom the lord in heaven knows you have no claim unless it be such as the wolf has to the lamb he will not give you the child you call your niece and therein i acknowledge that i am far from certain he has the same justice on his side moreover neighbour squatter he flatly denies your demand for me miserable and worthless as i am nor do i think he has been unwise in so doing seeing that i should have many reasons against journeying far in your company but he makes you an offer which it is right and convenient you should know the teton says through me who am no more than a mouthpiece and therein not answerable for the sin of his words but he says as this good woman is getting past the comely age it is reasonable for you to tire of such a wife he therefore tells you to turn her out of your lodge and when it is empty he will send his own favourite or rather she that was his favourite the skipping fawn as the siouxes call her to fill her place you see neighbour though the redskin is minded to keep your property he is willing to give you wherewithal to make yourself some return  ishmael listened to these replies to his several demands with that species of gathering indignation with which the dullest tempers mount into the most violent paroxysms of rage he even affected to laugh at the conceit of exchanging his longtried partner for the more flexible support of the youthful tachechana though his voice was hollow and unnatural in the effort but esther was far from giving the proposal so facetious a reception lifting her voice to its most audible key she broke forth after catching her breath like one who had been in some imminent danger of strangulation as follows  hoitytoity who set an indian up for a maker and breaker of the rights of wedded wives does he think a woman is a beast of the prairie that she is to be chased from a village by dog and gun let the bravest squaw of them all come forth and boast of her doings can she show such a brood as mine a wicked tyrant is that thieving redskin and a bold rogue i warrant me he would be captain indoors as well as out an honest woman is no better in his eyes than one of your broomstick jumpers and you ishmael bush the father of seven sons and so many comely daughters to open your sinful mouth except to curse him would ye disgrace colour and family and nation by mixing white blood with red and would ye be the parent of a race of mules the devil has often tempted you my man but never before has he set so cunning a snare as this go back among your children friend go and remember that you are not a prowling bear but a christian man and thank god that you ar a lawful husband  the clamour of esther was anticipated by the judicious trapper he had easily foreseen that her meek temper would overflow at so scandalous a proposal as repudiation and he now profited by the tempest to retire to a place where he was at least safe from any immediate violence on the part of her less excited but certainly more dangerous husband ishmael who had made his demands with a stout determination to enforce them was diverted by the windy torrent like many a more obstinate husband from his purpose and in order to appease a jealousy that resembled the fury with which the bear defends her cubs was fain to retire to a distance from the lodge that was known to contain the unoffending object of the sudden uproar  let your coppercoloured minx come forth and show her tawney beauty before the face of a woman who has heard more than one church bell and seen a power of real quality cried esther flourishing her hand in triumph as she drove ishmael and abiram before her like two truant boys towards their own encampment i warrant me i warrant me here is one who would shortly talk her down never think to tarry here my men never think to shut an eye in a camp through which the devil walks as openly as if he were a gentleman and sure of his welcome here you abner enoch jesse where ar ye gotten to put to put to if that weakminded softfeeling man your father eats or drinks again in this neighbourhood we shall see him poisoned with the craft of the redskins not that i care i who comes into my place when it is once lawfully empty but ishmael i never thought that you who have had one woman with a white skin would find pleasure in looking on a brazenay that she is copper ar a fact you cant deny it and i warrant me brazen enough is she too  against this ebullition of wounded female pride the experienced husband made no other head than by an occasional exclamation which he intended to be precursor of a simple asseveration of his own innocence the fury of the woman would not be appeased she listened to nothing but her own voice and consequently nothing was heard but her mandates to depart  the squatter had collected his beasts and loaded his wagons as a measure of precaution before proceeding to the extremity he contemplated esther consequently found every thing favourable to her wishes the young men stared at each other as they witnessed the extraordinary excitement of their mother but took little interest in an event which in the course of their experience had found so many parallels by command of their father the tents were thrown into the vehicles as a sort of reprisal for the want of faith in their late ally and then the train left the spot in its usual listless and sluggish order  as a formidable division of wellarmed borderers protected the rear of the retiring party the siouxes saw it depart without manifesting the smallest evidence of surprise or resentment the savage like the tiger rarely makes his attack on an enemy who expects him and if the warriors of the tetons meditated any hostility it was in the still and patient manner with which the feline beasts watch for the incautious moment in order to ensure the blow the counsels of mahtoree however on whom so much of the policy of his people depended lay deep in the depository of his own thoughts perhaps he rejoiced at so easy a manner of getting rid of claims so troublesome perhaps he awaited a fitting time to exhibit his power or it even might be that matters of so much greater importance were pressing on his mind that it had not leisure to devote any of its faculties to an event of so much indifference  but it would seem that while ishmael made such a concession to the awakened feelings of esther he was far from abandoning his original intentions his train followed the course of the river for a mile and then it came to a halt on the brow of the elevated land and in a place which afforded the necessary facilities here he again pitched his tents unharnessed his teams sent his cattle on the bottom and in short made all the customary preparations to pass the night with the same coolness and deliberation as if he had not hurled an irritating defiance into the teeth of his dangerous neighbours  in the mean time the tetons proceeded to the more regular business of the hour a fierce and savage joy had existed in the camp from the instant when it had been announced that their own chief was returning with the longdreaded and hated partisan of their enemies for many hours the crones of the tribe had been going from lodge to lodge in order to stimulate the tempers of the warriors to such a pass as might leave but little room for mercy to one they spoke of a son whose scalp was drying in the smoke of a pawnee lodge to another they enumerated his own scars his disgraces and defeats with a third they dwelt on his losses of skins and horses and a fourth was reminded of vengeance by a significant question concerning some flagrant adventure in which he was known to have been a sufferer  by these means the men had been so far excited as to have assembled in the manner already related though it still remained a matter of doubt how far they intended to carry their revenge a variety of opinions prevailed on the policy of executing their prisoners and mahtoree had suspended the discussions in order to ascertain how far the measure might propitiate or retard his own particular views hitherto the consultations had merely been preliminary with a design that each chief might discover the number of supporters his particular views would be likely to obtain when the important subject should come before a more solemn council of the tribe the moment for the latter had now arrived and the preparations were made with a dignity and solemnity suited to the momentous interests of the occasion  with a refinement in cruelty that none but an indian would have imagined the place selected for this grave deliberation was immediately about the post to which the most important of its subjects was attached middleton and paul were brought in their bonds and laid at the feet of the pawnee then the men began to take their places according to their several claims to distinction as warrior after warrior approached he seated himself in the wide circle with a mien as composed and thoughtful as if his mind were actually in a condition to deal out justice tempered as it should be with the heavenly quality of mercy a place was reserved for three or four of the principal chiefs and a few of the oldest of the women as withered as age exposure hardships and lives of savage passions could make them thrust themselves into the foremost circle with a temerity to which they were impelled by their insatiable desire for cruelty and which nothing but their years and their long tried fidelity to the nation would have excused  all but the chiefs already named were now in their places these had delayed their appearance in the vain hope that their own unanimity might smooth the way to that of their respective factions for notwithstanding the superior influence of mahtoree his power was to be maintained only by constant appeals to the opinions of his inferiors as these important personages at length entered the circle in a body their sullen looks and clouded brows notwithstanding the time given to consultation sufficiently proclaimed the discontent which reigned among them the eye of mahtoree was varying in its expression from sudden gleams that seemed to kindle with the burning impulses of his soul to that cold and guarded steadiness which was thought more peculiarly to become a chief in council he took his seat with the studied simplicity of a demagogue though the keen and flashing glance that he immediately threw around the silent assembly betrayed the more predominant temper of a tyrant  when all were present an aged warrior lighted the great pipe of his people and blew the smoke towards the four quarters of the heavens so soon as this propitiatory offering was made he tendered it to mahtoree who in affected humility passed it to a greyheaded chief by his side after the influence of the soothing weed had been courted by all a grave silence succeeded as if each was not only qualified to but actually did think more deeply on the matters before them then an old indian arose and spoke as follows  the eagle at the falls of the endless river was in its egg many snows after my hand had struck a pawnee what my tongue says my eyes have seen bohrecheena is very old the hills have stood longer in their places than he has been in his tribe and the rivers were full and empty before he was born but where is the sioux that knows it besides himself what he says they will hear if any of his words fall to the ground they will pick them up and hold them to their ears if any blow away in the wind my young men who are very nimble will catch them now listen since water ran and trees grew the sioux has found the pawnee on his warpath as the cougar loves the antelope the dahcotah loves his enemy when the wolf finds the fawn does he lie down and sleep when the panther sees the doe at the spring does he shut his eyes you know that he does not he drinks too but it is of blood a sioux is a leaping panther a pawnee a trembling deer let my children hear me they will find my words good i have spoken  a deep guttural exclamation of assent broke from the lips of all the partisans of mahtoree as they listened to this sanguinary advice from one who was certainly among the most aged men of the nation that deeply seated love of vengeance which formed so prominent a feature in their characters was gratified by his metaphorical allusions and the chief himself augured favourably of the success of his own schemes by the number of supporters who manifested themselves to be in favour of the counsels of his friend but still unanimity was far from prevailing a long and decorous pause was suffered to succeed the words of the first speaker in order that all might duly deliberate on their wisdom before another chief took on himself the office of refutation the second orator though past the prime of his days was far less aged than the one who had preceded him he felt the disadvantage of this circumstance and endeavoured to counteract it as far as possible by the excess of his humility  i am but an infant he commenced looking furtively around him in order to detect how far his wellestablished character for prudence and courage contradicted his assertion i have lived with the women since my father has been a man if my head is getting grey it is not because i am old some of the snow which fell on it while i have been sleeping on the warpaths has frozen there and the hot sun near the osage villages has not been strong enough to melt it a low murmur was heard expressive of admiration of the services to which he thus artfully alluded the orator modestly awaited for the feeling to subside a little and then he continued with increasing energy encouraged by their commendations but the eyes of a young brave are good he can see very far he is a lynx look at me well i will turn my back that you may see both sides of me now do you know i am your friend for you look on a part that a pawnee never yet saw now look at my face not in this seam for there your eyes can never see into my spirit it is a hole cut by a konza but here is an opening made by the wahcondah through which you may look into the soul what am i a dahcotah within and without you know it therefore hear me the blood of every creature on the prairie is red who can tell the spot where a pawnee was struck from the place where my young men took a bison it is of the same colour the master of life made them for each other he made them alike but will the grass grow green where a paleface is killed my young men must not think that nation so numerous that it will not miss a warrior they call them over often and say where are my sons if they miss one they will send into the prairies to look for him if they cannot find him they will tell their runners to ask for him among the siouxes my brethren the bigknives are not fools there is a mighty medicine of their nation now among us who can tell how loud is his voice or how long is his arm  the speech of the orator who was beginning to enter into his subject with warmth was cut short by the impatient mahtoree who suddenly arose and exclaimed in a voice in which authority was mingled with contempt and at the close with a keen tone of irony also  let my young men lead the evil spirit of the palefaces to the council my brother shall see his medicine face to face  a deathlike and solemn stillness succeeded this extraordinary interruption it not only involved a deep offence against the sacred courtesy of debate but the mandate was likely to brave the unknown power of one of those incomprehensible beings whom few indians were enlightened enough at that day to regard without reverence or few hardy enough to oppose the subordinates however obeyed and obed was led forth from the lodge mounted on asinus with a ceremony and state which was certainly intended for derision but which nevertheless was greatly enhanced by fear as they entered the ring mahtoree who had foreseen and had endeavoured to anticipate the influence of the doctor by bringing him into contempt cast an eye around the assembly in order to gather his success in the various dark visages by which he was encircled  truly nature and art had combined to produce such an effect from the air and appointments of the naturalist as might have made him the subject of wonder in any place his head had been industriously shaved after the most approved fashion of sioux taste a gallant scalplock which would probably not have been spared had the doctor himself been consulted in the matter was all that remained of an exuberant and at that particular season of the year far from uncomfortable head of hair thick coats of paint had been laid on the naked poll and certain fanciful designs in the same material had even been extended into the neighbourhood of the eyes and mouth lending to the keen expression of the former a look of twinkling cunning and to the dogmatism of the latter not a little of the grimness of necromancy he had been despoiled of his upper garments and in their stead his body was sufficiently protected from the cold by a fantastically painted robe of dressed deerskin as if in mockery of his pursuit sundry toads frogs lizards butterflies c all duly prepared to take their places at some future day in his own private cabinet were attached to the solitary lock on his head to his ears and to various other conspicuous parts of his person if in addition to the effect produced by these quaint auxiliaries to his costume we add the portentous and troubled gleamings of doubt which rendered his visage doubly austere and proclaimed the misgivings of the worthy obeds mind as he beheld his personal dignity thus prostrated and what was of far greater moment in his eyes himself led forth as he firmly believed to be the victim of some heathenish sacrifice the reader will find no difficulty in giving credit to the sensation of awe that was excited by his appearance in a band already more than halfprepared to worship him as a powerful agent of the evil spirit  weucha led asinus directly into the centre of the circle and leaving them together for the legs of the naturalist were attached to the beast in such a manner that the two animals might be said to be incorporated and to form a new order he withdrew to his proper place gazing at the conjuror as he retired with a wonder and admiration that were natural to the groveling dulness of his mind  the astonishment seemed mutual between the spectators and the subject of this strange exhibition if the tetons contemplated the mysterious attributes of the medicine with awe and fear the doctor gazed on every side of him with a mixture of quite as many extraordinary emotions in which the latter sensation however formed no inconsiderable ingredient every where his eyes which just at that moment possessed a secret magnifying quality seemed to rest on several dark savage and obdurate countenances at once from none of which could he extract a solitary gleam of sympathy or commiseration at length his wandering gaze fell on the grave and decent features of the trapper who with hector at his feet stood in the edge of the circle leaning on that rifle which he had been permitted as an acknowledged friend to resume and apparently musing on the events that were likely to succeed a council marked by so many and such striking ceremonies  venerable venator or hunter or trapper said the disconsolate obed i rejoice greatly in meeting thee again i fear that the precious time which had been allotted me in order to complete a mighty labour is drawing to a premature close and i would gladly unburden my mind to one who if not a pupil of science has at least some of the knowledge which civilisation imparts to its meanest subjects doubtless many and earnest enquiries will be made after my fate by the learned societies of the world and perhaps expeditions will be sent into these regions to remove any doubts which may arise on so important a subject i esteem myself happy that a man who speaks the vernacular is present to preserve the record of my end you will say that after a wellspent and glorious life i died a martyr to science and a victim to mental darkness as i expect to be particularly calm and abstracted in my last moments if you add a few details concerning the fortitude and scholastic dignity with which i met my death it may serve to encourage future aspirants for similar honours and assuredly give offence to no one and now friend trapper as a duty i owe to human nature i will conclude by demanding if all hope has deserted me or if any means still exist by which so much valuable information may be rescued from the grasp of ignorance and preserved to the pages of natural history  the old man lent an attentive ear to this melancholy appeal and apparently he reflected on every side of the important question before he would presume to answer  i take it friend physicianer he at length gravely replied that the chances of life and death in your particular case depend altogether on the will of providence as it may be pleased to manifest it through the accursed windings of indian cunning for my own part i see no great difference in the main end to be gained inasmuch as it can matter no one greatly yourself excepted whether you live or die  would you account the fall of a cornerstone from the foundations of the edifice of learning a matter of indifference to contemporaries or to posterity interrupted obed besides my aged associate he reproachfully added the interest that a man has in his own existence is by no means trifling however it may be eclipsed by his devotion to more general and philanthropic feelings  what i would say is this resumed the trapper who was far from understanding all the subtle distinctions with which his more learned companion so often saw fit to embellish his discourse there is but one birth and one death to all things be it hound or be it deer be it red skin or be it white both are in the hands of the lord it being as unlawful for man to strive to hasten the one as impossible to prevent the other but i will not say that something may not be done to put the last moment aside for a while at least and therefore it is a question that any one has a right to put to his own wisdom how far he will go and how much pain he will suffer to lengthen out a time that may have been too long already many a dreary winter and scorching summer has gone by since i have turned to the right hand or to the left to add an hour to a life that has already stretched beyond fourscore years i keep myself as ready to answer to my name as a soldier at evening rollcall in my judgment if your cases are left to indian tempers the policy of the great sioux will lead his people to sacrifice you all nor do i put much dependence on his seeming love for me therefore it becomes a question whether you are ready for such a journey and if being ready whether this is not as good a time to start as another should my opinion be asked thus far will i give it in your favour that is to say it is my belief your life has been innocent enough touching any great offences that you may have committed though honesty compels me to add that i think all you can lay claim to on the score of activity in deeds will not amount to any thing worth naming in the great account  obed turned a rueful eye on the calm philosophic countenance of the other as he answered with so discouraging a statement of his case clearing his throat as he did so in order to conceal the desperate concern which began to beset his faculties with a vestige of that pride which rarely deserts poor human nature even in the greatest emergencies  i believe venerable hunter he replied considering the question in all its bearings and assuming that your theory is just it will be the safest to conclude that i am not prepared to make so hasty a departure and that measures of precaution should be forthwith resorted to  being in that mind returned the deliberate trapper i will act for you as i would for myself though as time has begun to roll down the hill with you i will just advise that you look to your case speedily for it may so happen that your name will be heard when quite as little prepared to answer to it as now  with this amicable understanding the old man drew back again into the ring where he stood musing on the course he should now adopt with the singular mixture of decision and resignation that proceeded from his habits and his humility and which united to form a character in which excessive energy and the most meek submission to the will of providence were oddly enough combined     chapter xxviii    the witch in smithfield shall be burned to ashes and you three   shall be strangled on the gallows                                                    shakspeare  the siouxes had awaited the issue of the foregoing dialogue with commendable patience most of the band were restrained by the secret awe with which they regarded the mysterious character of obed while a few of the more intelligent chiefs gladly profited by the opportunity to arrange their thoughts for the struggle that was plainly foreseen mahtoree influenced by neither of these feelings was content to show the trapper how much he conceded to his pleasure and when the old man discontinued the discourse he received from the chief a glance that was intended to remind him of the patience with which he had awaited his movements a profound and motionless silence succeeded the short interruption then mahtoree arose evidently prepared to speak first placing himself in an attitude of dignity he turned a steady and severe look on the whole assembly the expression of his eye however changed as it glanced across the different countenances of his supporters and of his opponents to the former the look though stern was not threatening while it seemed to tell the latter all the hazards they incurred in daring to brave the resentment of one so powerful  still in the midst of so much hauteur and confidence the sagacity and cunning of the teton did not desert him when he had thrown the gauntlet as it were to the whole tribe and sufficiently asserted his claim to superiority his mien became more affable and his eye less angry then it was that he raised his voice in the midst of a deathlike stillness varying its tones to suit the changing character of his images and of his eloquence  what is a sioux the chief sagaciously began he is ruler of the prairies and master of its beasts the fishes in the river of troubled waters know him and come at his call he is a fox in counsel an eagle in sight a grizzly bear in combat a dahcotah is a man after waiting for the low murmur of approbation which followed this flattering portrait of his people to subside the teton continuedwhat is a pawnee a thief who only steals from women a redskin who is not brave a hunter that begs for his venison in counsel he is a squirrel hopping from place to place he is an owl that goes on the prairies at night in battle he is an elk whose legs are long a pawnee is a woman another pause succeeded during which a yell of delight broke from several mouths and a demand was made that the taunting words should be translated to the unconscious subject of their biting contempt the old man took his cue from the eyes of mahtoree and complied hardheart listened gravely and then as if apprized that his time to speak had not arrived he once more bent his look on the vacant air the orator watched his countenance with an expression that manifested how inextinguishable was the hatred he felt for the only chief far and near whose fame might advantageously be compared with his own though disappointed in not having touched the pride of one whom he regarded as a boy he proceeded what he considered as far more important to quicken the tempers of the men of his own tribe in order that they might be prepared to work his savage purposes if the earth was covered with rats which are good for nothing he said there would be no room for buffaloes which give food and clothes to an indian if the prairies were covered with pawnees there would be no room for the foot of a dahcotah a loup is a rat a sioux a heavy buffaloe let the buffaloes tread upon the rats and make room for themselves  my brothers a little child has spoken to you he tells you his hair is not grey but frozenthat the grass will not grow where a paleface has died does he know the colour of the blood of a bigknife no i know he does not he has never seen it what dahcotah besides mahtoree has ever struck a paleface not one but mahtoree must be silent every teton will shut his ears when he speaks the scalps over his lodge were taken by the women they were taken by mahtoree and he is a woman his mouth is shut he waits for the feasts to sing among the girls  notwithstanding the exclamations of regret and resentment which followed so abasing a declaration the chief took his seat as if determined to speak no more but the murmurs grew louder and more general and there were threatening symptoms that the council would dissolve itself in confusion and he arose and resumed his speech by changing his manner to the fierce and hurried enunciation of a warrior bent on revenge  let my young men go look for tetao he cried they will find his scalp drying in pawnee smoke where is the son of bohrecheena his bones are whiter than the faces of his murderers is mahhah asleep in his lodge you know it is many moons since he started for the blessed prairies would he were here that he might say of what colour was the hand that took his scalp  in this strain the artful chief continued for many minutes calling those warriors by name who were known to have met their deaths in battle with the pawnees or in some of those lawless frays which so often occurred between the sioux bands and a class of white men who were but little removed from them in the qualities of civilisation time was not given to reflect on the merits or rather the demerits of most of the different individuals to whom he alluded in consequence of the rapid manner in which he ran over their names but so cunningly did he time his events and so thrillingly did he make his appeals aided as they were by the power of his deeptoned and stirring voice that each of them struck an answering chord in the breast of some one of his auditors  it was in the midst of one of his highest flights of eloquence that a man so aged as to walk with the greatest difficulty entered the very centre of the circle and took his stand directly in front of the speaker an ear of great acuteness might possibly have detected that the tones of the orator faltered a little as his flashing look first fell on this unexpected object though the change was so trifling that none but such as thoroughly knew the parties would have suspected it the stranger had once been as distinguished for his beauty and proportions as had been his eagle eye for its irresistible and terrible glance but his skin was now wrinkled and his features furrowed with so many scars as to have obtained for him half a century before from the french of the canadas a title which has been borne by so many of the heroes of france and which had now been adopted into the language of the wild horde of whom we are writing as the one most expressive of the deeds of their own brave the murmur of le balafre that ran through the assembly when he appeared announced not only his name and the high estimation of his character but how extraordinary his visit was considered as he neither spoke nor moved however the sensation created by his appearance soon subsided and then every eye was again turned upon the speaker and every ear once more drunk in the intoxication of his maddening appeals  it would have been easy to have traced the triumph of mahtoree in the reflecting countenances of his auditors it was not long before a look of ferocity and of revenge was to be seen seated on the grim visages of most of the warriors and each new and crafty allusion to the policy of extinguishing their enemies was followed by fresh and less restrained bursts of approbation in the height of this success the teton closed his speech by a rapid appeal to the pride and hardihood of his native band and suddenly took his seat  in the midst of the murmurs of applause which succeeded so remarkable an effort of eloquence a low feeble and hollow voice was heard rising on the ear as if it rolled from the inmost cavities of the human chest and gathered strength and energy as it issued into the air a solemn stillness followed the sounds and then the lips of the aged man were first seen to move  the day of le balafre is near its end were the first words that were distinctly audible he is like a buffaloe on whom the hair will grow no longer he will soon be ready to leave his lodge to go in search of another that is far from the villages of the siouxes therefore what he has to say concerns not him but those he leaves behind him his words are like the fruit on the tree ripe and fit to be given to chiefs  many snows have fallen since le balafre has been found on the warpath his blood has been very hot but it has had time to cool the wahcondah gives him dreams of war no longer he sees that it is better to live in peace  my brothers one foot is turned to the happy huntinggrounds the other will soon follow and then an old chief will be seen looking for the prints of his fathers moccasins that he may make no mistake but be sure to come before the master of life by the same path as so many good indians have already travelled but who will follow le balafre has no son his oldest has ridden too many pawnee horses the bones of the youngest have been gnawed by konza dogs le balafre has come to look for a young arm on which he may lean and to find a son that when he is gone his lodge may not be empty tachechana the skipping fawn of the tetons is too weak to prop a warrior who is old she looks before her and not backwards her mind is in the lodge of her husband  the enunciation of the veteran warrior had been calm but distinct and decided his declaration was received in silence and though several of the chiefs who were in the counsels of mahtoree turned their eyes on their leader none presumed to oppose so aged and so venerated a brave in a resolution that was strictly in conformity to the usages of the nation the teton himself was content to await the result with seeming composure though the gleams of ferocity that played about his eye occasionally betrayed the nature of those feelings with which he witnessed a procedure that was likely to rob him of that one of all his intended victims whom he most hated  in the mean time le balafre moved with a slow and painful step towards the captives he stopped before the person of hardheart whose faultless form unchanging eye and lofty mien he contemplated long with high and evident satisfaction then making a gesture of authority he awaited until his order had been obeyed and the youth was released from the post and his bonds by the same blow of the knife when the young warrior was led nearer to his dimmed and failing sight the examination was renewed with strictness of scrutiny and that admiration which physical excellence is so apt to excite in the breast of a savage  it is good the wary veteran murmured when he found that all his skill in the requisites of a brave could detect no blemish this is a leaping panther does my son speak with the tongue of a teton  the intelligence which lighted the eyes of the captive betrayed how well he understood the question but still he was far too haughty to communicate his ideas through the medium of a language that belonged to a hostile people some of the surrounding warriors explained to the old chief that the captive was a pawneeloup  my son opened his eyes on the waters of the wolves said le balafre in the language of that nation but he will shut them in the bend of the river with a troubled stream he was born a pawnee but he will die a dahcotah look at me i am a sycamore that once covered many with my shadow the leaves are fallen and the branches begin to drop but a single sucker is springing from my roots it is a little vine and it winds itself about a tree that is green i have long looked for one fit to grow by my side now have i found him le balafre is no longer without a son his name will not be forgotten when he is gone men of the tetons i take this youth into my lodge  no one was bold enough to dispute a right that had so often been exercised by warriors far inferior to the present speaker and the adoption was listened to in grave and respectful silence le balafre took his intended son by the arm and leading him into the very centre of the circle he stepped aside with an air of triumph in order that the spectators might approve of his choice mahtoree betrayed no evidence of his intentions but rather seemed to await a moment better suited to the crafty policy of his character the more experienced and sagacious chiefs distinctly foresaw the utter impossibility of two partisans so renowned so hostile and who had so long been rivals in fame as their prisoner and their native leader existing amicably in the same tribe still the character of le balafre was so imposing and the custom to which he had resorted so sacred that none dared to lift a voice in opposition to the measure they watched the result with increasing interest but with a coldness of demeanour that concealed the nature of their inquietude from this state of embarrassment and as it might readily have proved of disorganisation the tribe was unexpectedly relieved by the decision of the one most interested in the success of the aged chiefs designs  during the whole of the foregoing scene it would have been difficult to have traced a single distinct emotion in the lineaments of the captive he had heard his release proclaimed with the same indifference as the order to bind him to the stake but now that the moment had arrived when it became necessary to make his election he spoke in a way to prove that the fortitude which had bought him so distinguished a name had in no degree deserted him  my father is very old but he has not yet looked upon every thing said hardheart in a voice so clear as to be heard by all in presence he has never seen a buffaloe change to a bat he will never see a pawnee become a sioux  there was a suddenness and yet a calmness in the manner of delivering this decision which assured most of the auditors that it was unalterable the heart of le balafre however was yearning towards the youth and the fondness of age was not so readily repulsed reproving the burst of admiration and triumph to which the boldness of the declaration and the freshened hopes of revenge had given rise by turning his gleaming eye around the band the veteran again addressed his adopted child as if his purpose was not to be denied  it is well he said such are the words a brave should use that the warriors may see his heart the day has been when the voice of le balafre was loudest among the lodges of the konzas but the root of a white hair is wisdom my child will show the tetons that he is brave by striking their enemies men of the dahcotahs this is my son  the pawnee hesitated a moment and then stepping in front of the chief he took his hard and wrinkled hand and laid it with reverence on his head as if to acknowledge the extent of his obligation then recoiling a step he raised his person to its greatest elevation and looked upon the hostile band by whom he was environed with an air of loftiness and disdain as he spoke aloud in the language of the siouxes  hardheart has looked at himself within and without he has thought of all he has done in the hunts and in the wars every where he is the same there is no change he is in all things a pawnee he has struck so many tetons that he could never eat in their lodges his arrows would fly backwards the point of his lance would be on the wrong end their friends would weep at every whoop he gave their enemies would laugh do the tetons know a loup let them look at him again his head is painted his arm is flesh his heart is rock when the tetons see the sun come from the rocky mountains and move towards the land of the palefaces the mind of hardheart will soften and his spirit will become sioux until that day he will live and die a pawnee  a yell of delight in which admiration and ferocity were strangely mingled interrupted the speaker and but too clearly announced the character of his fate the captive awaited a moment for the commotion to subside and then turning again to le balafre he continued in tones conciliating and kind as if he felt the propriety of softening his refusal in a manner not to wound the pride of one who would so gladly be his benefactor  let my father lean heavier on the fawn of the dahcotahs he said she is weak now but as her lodge fills with young she will be stronger see he added directing the eyes of the other to the earnest countenance of the attentive trapper hardheart is not without a greyhead to show him the path to the blessed prairies if he ever has another father it shall be that just warrior  le balafre turned away in disappointment from the youth and approached the stranger who had thus anticipated his design the examination between these two aged men was long mutual and curious it was not easy to detect the real character of the trapper through the mask which the hardships of so many years had laid upon his features especially when aided by his wild and peculiar attire some moments elapsed before the teton spoke and then it was in doubt whether he addressed one like himself or some wanderer of that race who he had heard were spreading themselves like hungry locusts throughout the land  the head of my brother is very white he said but the eye of le balafre is no longer like the eagles of what colour is his skin  the wahcondah made me like these you see waiting for a dahcotah judgment but fair and foul has coloured me darker than the skin of a fox what of that though the bark is ragged and riven the heart of the tree is sound  my brother is a bigknife let him turn his face towards the setting sun and open his eyes does he see the salt lake beyond the mountains  the time has been teton when few could see the white on the eagles head farther than i but the glare of fourscore and seven winters has dimmed my eyes and but little can i boast of sight in my latter days does the sioux think a paleface is a god that he can look through hills  then let my brother look at me i am nigh him and he can see that i am a foolish redman why cannot his people see every thing since they crave all  i understand you chief nor will i gainsay the justice of your words seeing that they are too much founded in truth but though born of the race you love so little my worst enemy not even a lying mingo would dare to say that i ever laid hands on the goods of another except such as were taken in manful warfare or that i ever coveted more ground than the lord has intended each man to fill  and yet my brother has come among the redskins to find a son  the trapper laid a finger on the naked shoulder of le balafre and looked into his scarred countenance with a wistful and confidential expression as he answered  ay but it was only that i might do good to the boy if you think dahcotah that i adopted the youth in order to prop my age you do as much injustice to my goodwill as you seem to know little of the merciless intentions of your own people i have made him my son that he may know that one is left behind him peace hector peace is this decent pup when greyheads are counselling together to break in upon their discourse with the whinings of a hound the dog is old teton and though well taught in respect of behaviour he is getting like ourselves i fancy something forgetful of the fashions of his youth  further discourse between these veterans was interrupted by a discordant yell which burst at that moment from the lips of the dozen withered crones who have already been mentioned as having forced themselves into a conspicuous part of the circle the outcry was excited by a sudden change in the air of hardheart when the old men turned towards the youth they saw him standing in the very centre of the ring with his head erect his eye fixed on vacancy one leg advanced and an arm a little raised as if all his faculties were absorbed in the act of listening a smile lighted his countenance for a single moment and then the whole man sunk again into his former look of dignity and coldness suddenly recalled to selfpossession the movement had been construed into contempt and even the tempers of the chiefs began to be excited unable to restrain their fury the women broke into the circle in a body and commenced their attack by loading the captive with the most bitter revilings they boasted of the various exploits which their sons had achieved at the expense of the different tribes of the pawnees they undervalued his own reputation and told him to look at mahtoree if he had never yet seen a warrior they accused him of having been suckled by a doe and of having drunk in cowardice with his mothers milk in short they lavished upon their unmoved captive a torrent of that vindictive abuse in which the women of the savages are so well known to excel but which has been too often described to need a repetition here  the effect of this outbreaking was inevitable le balafre turned away disappointed and hid himself in the crowd while the trapper whose honest features were working with inward emotion pressed nigher to his young friend as those who are linked to the criminal by ties so strong as to brave the opinions of men are often seen to stand about the place of execution to support his dying moments the excitement soon spread among the inferior warriors though the chiefs still forbore to make the signal which committed the victim to their mercy mahtoree who had awaited such a movement among his fellows with the wary design of concealing his own jealous hatred soon grew weary of delay and by a glance of his eye encouraged the tormentors to proceed  weucha who eager for this sanction had long stood watching the countenance of the chief bounded forward at the signal like a bloodhound loosened from the leash forcing his way into the centre of the hags who were already proceeding from abuse to violence he reproved their impatience and bade them wait until a warrior had begun to torment and then they should see their victim shed tears like a woman  the heartless savage commenced his efforts by flourishing his tomahawk about the head of the captive in such a manner as to give reason to suppose that each blow would bury the weapon in the flesh while it was so governed as not to touch the skin to this customary expedient hardheart was perfectly insensible his eye kept the same steady riveted look on the air though the glittering axe described in its evolutions a bright circle of light before his countenance frustrated in this attempt the callous sioux laid the cold edge on the naked head of his victim and began to describe the different manners in which a prisoner might be flayed the women kept time to his cruelties with their taunts and endeavoured to force some expression of the lingerings of nature from the insensible features of the pawnee but he evidently reserved himself for the chiefs and for those moments of extreme anguish when the loftiness of his spirit might evince itself in a manner better becoming his high and untarnished reputation  the eyes of the trapper followed every movement of the tomahawk with the interest of a real father until at length unable to command his indignation he exclaimed  my son has forgotten his cunning this is a lowminded indian and one easily hurried into folly i cannot do the thing myself for my traditions forbid a dying warrior to revile his persecutors but the gifts of a redskin are different let the pawnee say the bitter words and purchase an easy death i will answer for his success provided he speaks before the grave men set their wisdom to back the folly of this fool  the savage sioux who heard his words without comprehending their meaning turned to the speaker and menaced him with death for his temerity  ay work your will said the unflinching old man i am as ready now as i shall be tomorrow though it would be a death that an honest man might not wish to die look at that noble pawnee teton and see what a redskin may become who fears the master of life and follows his laws how many of your people has he sent to the distant prairies he continued in a sort of pious fraud thinking that while the danger menaced himself there could surely be no sin in extolling the merits of another how many howling siouxes has he struck like a warrior in open combat while arrows were sailing in the air plentier than flakes of falling snow go will weucha speak the name of one enemy he has ever struck  hardheart shouted the sioux turning in his fury and aiming a deadly blow at the head of his victim his arm fell into the hollow of the captives hand for a single moment the two stood as if entranced in that attitude the one paralysed by so unexpected a resistance and the other bending his head not to meet his death but in the act of the most intense attention the women screamed with triumph for they thought the nerves of the captive had at length failed him the trapper trembled for the honour of his friend and hector as if conscious of what was passing raised his nose into the air and uttered a piteous howl  but the pawnee hesitated only for that moment raising the other hand like lightning the tomahawk flashed in the air and weucha sunk to his feet brained to the eye then cutting a way with the bloody weapon he darted through the opening left by the frightened women and seemed to descend the declivity at a single bound  had a bolt from heaven fallen in the midst of the teton band it would not have occasioned greater consternation than this act of desperate hardihood a shrill plaintive cry burst from the lips of all the women and there was a moment that even the oldest warriors appeared to have lost their faculties this stupor endured only for the instant it was succeeded by a yell of revenge that burst from a hundred throats while as many warriors started forward at the cry bent on the most bloody retribution but a powerful and authoritative call from mahtoree arrested every foot the chief in whose countenance disappointment and rage were struggling with the affected composure of his station extended an arm towards the river and the whole mystery was explained  hardheart had already crossed half the bottom which lay between the acclivity and the water at this precise moment a band of armed and mounted pawnees turned a swell and galloped to the margin of the stream into which the plunge of the fugitive was distinctly heard a few minutes sufficed for his vigorous arm to conquer the passage and then the shout from the opposite shore told the humbled tetons the whole extent of the triumph of their adversaries     chapter xxix    if that shepherd be not in handfast let him fly the curses he   shall have the tortures he shall feel will break the back of   man the heart of monster                                                    shakspeare  it will readily be seen that the event just related was attended by an extraordinary sensation among the siouxes in leading the hunters of the band back to the encampment their chief had neglected none of the customary precautions of indian prudence in order that his trail might escape the eyes of his enemies it would seem however that the pawnees had not only made the dangerous discovery but had managed with great art to draw nigh the place by the only side on which it was thought unnecessary to guard the approaches with the usual line of sentinels the latter who were scattered along the different little eminences which lay in the rear of the lodges were among the last to be apprized of the danger  in such a crisis there was little time for deliberation it was by exhibiting the force of his character in scenes of similar difficulty that mahtoree had obtained and strengthened his ascendency among his people nor did he seem likely to lose it by the manifestation of any indecision on the present occasion in the midst of the screams of the young the shrieks of the women and the wild howlings of the crones which were sufficient of themselves to have created a chaos in the thoughts of one less accustomed to act in emergencies he promptly asserted his authority issuing his orders with the coolness of a veteran  while the warriors were arming the boys were despatched to the bottom for the horses the tents were hastily struck by the women and disposed of on such of the beasts are were not deemed fit to be trusted in combat the infants were cast upon the backs of their mothers and those children who were of a size to march were driven to the rear like a herd of less reasoning animals though these several movements were made amid outcries and a clamour that likened the place to another babel they were executed with incredible alacrity and intelligence  in the mean time mahtoree neglected no duty that belonged to his responsible station from the elevation on which he stood he could command a perfect view of the force and evolutions of the hostile party a grim smile lighted his visage when he found that in point of numbers his own band was greatly the superior notwithstanding this advantage however there were other points of inequality which would probably have a tendency to render his success in the approaching conflict exceedingly doubtful his people were the inhabitants of a more northern and less hospitable region than their enemies and were far from being rich in that species of property horses and arms which constitutes the most highly prized wealth of a western indian the band in view was mounted to a man and as it had come so far to rescue or to revenge their greatest partisan he had no reason to doubt its being composed entirely of braves on the other hand many of his followers were far better in a hunt than in a combat men who might serve to divert the attention of his foes but from whom he could expect little desperate service still his flashing eye glanced over a body of warriors on whom he had often relied and who had never deceived him and though in the precise position in which he found himself he felt no disposition to precipitate the conflict he certainly would have had no intention to avoid it had not the presence of his women and children placed the option altogether in the power of his adversaries  on the other hand the pawnees so unexpectedly successful in their first and greatest object manifested no intention to drive matters to an issue the river was a dangerous barrier to pass in the face of a determined foe and it would now have been in perfect accordance with their cautious policy to have retired for a season in order that their onset might be made in the hours of darkness and of seeming security but there was a spirit in their chief that elevated him for the moment above the ordinary expedients of savage warfare his bosom burned with the desire to wipe out that disgrace of which he had been the subject and it is possible that he believed the retiring camp of the siouxes contained a prize that began to have a value in his eyes far exceeding any that could be found in fifty teton scalps let that be as it might hardheart had no sooner received the brief congratulations of his band and communicated to the chiefs such facts as were important to be known than he prepared himself to act such a part in the coming conflict as would at once maintain his wellearned reputation and gratify his secret wishes a led horse one that had been long trained in the hunts had been brought to receive his master with but little hope that his services would ever be needed again in this life with a delicacy and consideration that proved how much the generous qualities of the youth had touched the feelings of his people a bow a lance and a quiver were thrown across the animal which it had been intended to immolate on the grave of the young brave a species of care that would have superseded the necessity for the pious duty that the trapper had pledged himself to perform  though hardheart was sensible of the kindness of his warriors and believed that a chief furnished with such appointments might depart with credit for the distant huntinggrounds of the master of life he seemed equally disposed to think that they might be rendered quite as useful in the actual state of things his countenance lighted with stern pleasure as he tried the elasticity of the bow and poised the wellbalanced spear the glance he bestowed on the shield was more cursory and indifferent but the exultation with which he threw himself on the back of his favoured warhorse was so great as to break through the forms of indian reserve he rode to and fro among his scarcely less delighted warriors managing the animal with a grace and address that no artificial rules can ever supply at times flourishing his lance as if to assure himself of his seat and at others examining critically into the condition of the fusee with which he had also been furnished with the fondness of one who was miraculously restored to the possession of treasures that constituted his pride and his happiness  at this particular moment mahtoree having completed the necessary arrangements prepared to make a more decisive movement the teton had found no little embarrassment in disposing of his captives the tents of the squatter were still in sight and his wary cunning did not fail to apprise him that it was quite as necessary to guard against an attack from that quarter as to watch the motions of his more open and more active foes his first impulse had been to make the tomahawk suffice for the men and to trust the females under the same protection as the women of his band but the manner in which many of his braves continued to regard the imaginary medicine of the longknives forewarned him of the danger of so hazardous an experiment on the eve of a battle it might be deemed the omen of defeat in this dilemma he motioned to a superannuated warrior to whom he had confided the charge of the noncombatants and leading him apart he placed a finger significantly on his shoulder as he said in a tone in which authority was tempered by confidence  when my young men are striking the pawnees give the women knives enough my father is very old he does not want to hear wisdom from a boy  the grim old savage returned a look of ferocious assent and then the mind of the chief appeared to be at rest on this important subject from that moment he bestowed all his care on the achievement of his revenge and the maintenance of his martial character throwing himself on his horse he made a sign with the air of a prince to his followers to imitate his example interrupting without ceremony the war songs and solemn rites by which many among them were stimulating their spirits to deeds of daring when all were in order the whole moved with great steadiness and silence towards the margin of the river  the hostile bands were now separated by the water the width of the stream was too great to admit of the use of the ordinary indian missiles but a few useless shots were exchanged from the fusees of the chiefs more in bravado than with any expectation of doing execution as some time was suffered to elapse in demonstrations and abortive efforts we shall leave them for that period to return to such of our characters as remained in the hands of the savages  we have shed much ink in vain and wasted quires that might possibly have been better employed if it be necessary now to tell the reader that few of the foregoing movements escaped the observation of the experienced trapper he had been in common with the rest astonished at the sudden act of hardheart and there was a single moment when a feeling of regret and mortification got the better of his longings to save the life of the youth the simple and wellintentioned old man would have felt at witnessing any failure of firmness on the part of a warrior who had so strongly excited his sympathies the same species of sorrow that a christian parent would suffer in hanging over the dying moments of an impious child but when instead of an impotent and unmanly struggle for existence he found that his friend had forborne with the customary and dignified submission of an indian warrior until an opportunity had offered to escape and that he had then manifested the spirit and decision of the most gifted brave his gratification became nearly too powerful to be concealed in the midst of the wailing and commotion which succeeded the death of weucha and the escape of the captive he placed himself nigh the persons of his white associates with a determination of interfering at every hazard should the fury of the savages take that direction the appearance of the hostile band spared him however so desperate and probably so fruitless an effort and left him to pursue his observations and to mature his plans more at leisure  he particularly remarked that while by far the greater part of the women and all the children together with the effects of the party were hurried to the rear probably with an order to secrete themselves in some of the adjacent woods the tent of mahtoree himself was left standing and its contents undisturbed two chosen horses however stood near by held by a couple of youths who were too young to go into the conflict and yet of an age to understand the management of the beasts the trapper perceived in this arrangement the reluctance of mahtoree to trust his newlyfound flowers beyond the reach of his eye and at the same time his forethought in providing against a reverse of fortune neither had the manner of the teton in giving his commission to the old savage nor the fierce pleasure with which the latter had received the bloody charge escaped his observation from all these mysterious movements the old man was aware that a crisis was at hand and he summoned the utmost knowledge he had acquired in so long a life to aid him in the desperate conjuncture while musing on the means to be employed the doctor again attracted his attention to himself by a piteous appeal for assistance  venerable trapper or as i may now say liberator commenced the dolorous obed it would seem that a fitting time has at length arrived to dissever the unnatural and altogether irregular connection which exists between my inferior members and the body of asinus perhaps if such a portion of my limbs were released as might leave me master of the remainder and this favourable opportunity were suitably improved by making a forced march towards the settlements all hopes of preserving the treasures of knowledge of which i am the unworthy receptacle would not be lost the importance of the results is surely worth the hazard of the experiment  i know not i know not returned the deliberate old man the vermin and reptiles which you bear about you were intended by the lord for the prairies and i see no good in sending them into regions that may not suit their naturs and moreover you may be of great and particular use as you now sit on the ass though it creates no wonder in my mind to perceive that you are ignorant of it seeing that usefulness is altogether a new calling to so bookish a man  of what service can i be in this painful thraldom in which the animal functions are in a manner suspended and the spiritual or intellectual blinded by the secret sympathy that unites mind to matter there is likely to be blood spilt between yonder adverse hosts of heathens and though but little desiring the office it would be better that i should employ myself in surgical experiments than in thus wasting the precious moments mortifying both soul and body  it is little that a redskin would care to have a physician at his hurts while the whoop is ringing in his ears patience is a virtue in an indian and can be no shame to a christian white man look at these hags of squaws friend doctor i have no judgment in savage tempers if they are not bloody minded and ready to work their accursed pleasures on us all now so long as you keep upon the ass and maintain the fierce look which is far from being your natural gift fear of so great a medicine may serve to keep down their courage i am placed here like a general at the opening of the battle and it has become my duty to make such use of all my force as in my judgment each is best fitted to perform if i know these niceties you will be more serviceable for your countenance just now than in any more stirring exploits  harkee old trapper shouted paul whose patience could no longer maintain itself under the calculating and prolix explanations of the other suppose you cut two things i can name short off that is to say your conversation which is agreeable enough over a well baked buffaloes hump and these damnable thongs of hide which according to my experience can be pleasant nowhere a single stroke of your knife would be of more service just now than the longest speech that was ever made in a kentucky courthouse  ay courthouses are the happy huntinggrounds as a redskin would say for them that are born with gifts no better than such as lie in the tongue i was carried into one of the lawless holes myself once and it was all about a thing of no more value than the skin of a deer the lord forgive themthe lord forgive themthey knew no better and they did according to their weak judgments and therefore the more are they to be pitied and yet it was a solemn sight to see an aged man who had always lived in the air laid neck and heels by the law and held up as a spectacle for the women and boys of a wasteful settlement to point their fingers at  if such be your opinions of confinement honest friend you had better manifest the same by putting us at liberty with as little delay as possible said middleton who like his companion began to find the tardiness of his oftentried companion quite as extraordinary as it was disagreeable  i should greatly like to do the same especially in your behalf captain who being a soldier might find not only pleasure but profit in examining more at your ease into the circumventions and cunning of an indian fight as to our friend here it is of but little matter how much of this affair he examines or how little seeing that a bee is not to be overcome in the same manner as an indian  old man this trifling with our misery is inconsiderate to give it a name no harsher  ay your grandther was of a hot and hurrying mind and one must not expect that the young of a panther will crawl the arth like the litter of a porcupine now keep you both silent and what i say shall have the appearance of being spoken concerning the movements that are going on in the bottom all of which will serve to put jealousy to sleep and to shut the eyes of such as rarely close them on wickedness and cruelty in the first place then you must know that i have reason to think yonder treacherous teton has left an order to put us all to death so soon as he thinks the deed may be done secretly and without tumult  great heaven will you suffer us to be butchered like unresisting sheep  hist captain hist a hot temper is none of the best when cunning is more needed than blows ah the pawnee is a noble boy it would do your heart good to see how he draws off from the river in order to invite his enemies to cross and yet according to my failing sight they count two warriors to his one but as i was saying little good comes of haste and thoughtlessness the facts are so plain that any child may see into their wisdom the savages are of many minds as to the manner of our treatment some fear us for colour and would gladly let us go and other some would show us the mercy that the doe receives from the hungry wolf when opposition gets fairly into the councils of a tribe it is rarely that humanity is the gainer now see you these wrinkled and cruelminded squawsno you cannot see them as you lie but nevertheless they are here ready and willing like so many raging shebears to work their will upon us so soon as the proper time shall come  harkee old gentleman trapper interrupted paul with a little bitterness in his manner do you tell us these matters for our amusement or for your own if for ours you may keep your breath for the next race you run as i am tickled nearly to suffocation already with my part of the fun  histsaid the trapper cutting with great dexterity and rapidity the thong which bound one of the arms of paul to his body and dropping his knife at the same time within reach of the liberated hand hist boy hist that was a lucky moment the yell from the bottom drew the eyes of these bloodsuckers in another quarter and so far we are safe now make a proper use of your advantages but be careful that what you do is done without being seen  thank you for this small favour old deliberation muttered the beehunter though it comes like a snow in may somewhat out of season  foolish boy reproachfully exclaimed the other who had moved to a little distance from his friends and appeared to be attentively regarding the movements of the hostile parties will you never learn to know the wisdom of patience and you too captain though a man myself that seldom ruffles his temper by vain feelings i see that you are silent because you scorn to ask favours any longer from one you think too slow to grant them no doubt ye are both young and filled with the pride of your strength and manhood and i dare say you thought it only needful to cut the thongs to leave you masters of the ground but he that has seen much is apt to think much had i run like a bustling woman to have given you freedom these hags of the siouxes would have seen the same and then where would you both have found yourselves under the tomahawk and the knife like helpless and outcrying children though gifted with the size and beards of men ask our friend the beehunter in what condition he finds himself to struggle with a teton boy after so many hours of bondage much less with a dozen merciless and bloodthirsty squaws  truly old trapper returned paul stretching his limbs which were by this time entirely released and endeavouring to restore the suspended circulation you have some judgmatical notions in these matters now here am i paul hover a man who will give in to few at wrestle or race nearly as helpless as the day i paid my first visit to the house of old paul who is dead and gonethe lord forgive him any little blunders he may have made while he tarried in kentucky now there is my foot on the ground so far as eyesight has any virtue and yet it would take no great temptation to make me swear it didnt touch the earth by six inches i say honest friend since you have done so much have the goodness to keep these damnable squaws of whom you say so many interesting things at a little distance till i have got the blood of this arm in motion and am ready to receive them  the trapper made a sign that he perfectly understood the case and he walked towards the superannuated savage who began to manifest an intention of commencing his assigned task leaving the beehunter to recover the use of his limbs as well as he could and to put middleton in a similar situation to defend himself  mahtoree had not mistaken his man in selecting the one he did to execute his bloody purpose he had chosen one of those ruthless savages more or less of whom are to be found in every tribe who had purchased a certain share of military reputation by the exhibition of a hardihood that found its impulses in an innate love of cruelty contrary to the high and chivalrous sentiment which among the indians of the prairies renders it a deed of even greater merit to bear off the trophy of victory from a fallen foe than to slay him he had been remarkable for preferring the pleasure of destroying life to the glory of striking the dead while the more selfdevoted and ambitious braves were intent on personal honour he had always been seen established behind some favourable cover depriving the wounded of hope by finishing that which a more gallant warrior had begun in all the cruelties of the tribe he had ever been foremost and no sioux was so uniformly found on the side of merciless councils  he had awaited with an impatience which his long practised restraint could with difficulty subdue for the moment to arrive when he might proceed to execute the wishes of the great chief without whose approbation and powerful protection he would not have dared to undertake a step that had so many opposers in the nation but events had been hastening to an issue between the hostile parties and the time had now arrived greatly to his secret and malignant joy when he was free to act his will  the trapper found him distributing knives to the ferocious hags who received the presents chanting a low monotonous song that recalled the losses of their people in various conflicts with the whites and which extolled the pleasures and glory of revenge the appearance of such a group was enough of itself to have deterred one less accustomed to such sights than the old man from trusting himself within the circle of their wild and repulsive rites  each of the crones as she received the weapon commenced a slow and measured but ungainly step around the savage until the whole were circling him in a sort of magic dance the movements were timed in some degree by the words of their songs as were their gestures by the ideas when they spoke of their own losses they tossed their long straight locks of grey into the air or suffered them to fall in confusion upon their withered necks but as the sweetness of returning blow for blow was touched upon by any among them it was answered by a common howl as well as by gestures that were sufficiently expressive of the manner in which they were exciting themselves to the necessary state of fury  into the very centre of this ring of seeming demons the trapper now stalked with the same calmness and observation as he would have walked into a village church no other change was made by his appearance than a renewal of the threatening gestures with if possible a still less equivocal display of their remorseless intentions making a sign for them to cease the old man demanded  why do the mothers of the tetons sing with bitter tongues the pawnee prisoners are not yet in their village their young men have not come back loaded with scalps  he was answered by a general howl and a few of the boldest of the furies even ventured to approach him flourishing their knives within a dangerous proximity of his own steady eyeballs  it is a warrior you see and no runner of the longknives whose face grows paler at the sight of a tomahawk returned the trapper without moving a muscle let the sioux women think if one whiteskin dies a hundred spring up where he falls  still the hags made no other answer than by increasing their speed in the circle and occasionally raising the threatening expressions of their chant into louder and more intelligible strains suddenly one of the oldest and the most ferocious of them all broke out of the ring and skirred away in the direction of her victims like a rapacious bird that having wheeled on poised wings for the time necessary to ensure its object makes the final dart upon its prey the others followed a disorderly and screaming flock fearful of being too late to reap their portion of the sanguinary pleasure  mighty medicine of my people shouted the old man in the teton tongue lift your voice and speak that the sioux nation may hear  whether asinus had acquired so much knowledge by his recent experience as to know the value of his sonorous properties or the strange spectacle of a dozen hags flitting past him filling the air with such sounds as were even grating to the ears of an ass most moved his temper it is certain that the animal did that which obed was requested to do and probably with far greater effect than if the naturalist had strove with his mightiest effort to be heard it was the first time the strange beast had spoken since his arrival in the encampment admonished by so terrible a warning the hags scattered themselves like vultures frightened from their prey still screaming and but half diverted from their purpose  in the mean time the sudden appearance and the imminency of the danger quickened the blood in the veins of paul and middleton more than all their laborious frictions and physical expedients the former had actually risen to his feet and assumed an attitude which perhaps threatened more than the worthy beehunter was able to perform and even the latter had mounted to his knees and shown a disposition to do good service for his life the unaccountable release of the captives from their bonds was attributed by the hags to the incantations of the medicine and the mistake was probably of as much service as the miraculous and timely interposition of asinus in their favour  now is the time to come out of our ambushment exclaimed the old man hastening to join his friends and to make open and manful war it would have been policy to have kept back the struggle until the captain was in better condition to join but as we have unmasked our battery why we must maintain the ground  he was interrupted by feeling a gigantic hand on his shoulder turning under a sort of confused impression that necromancy was actually abroad in the place he found that he was in the hands of a sorcerer no less dangerous and powerful than ishmael bush the file of the squatters wellarmed sons that was seen issuing from behind the still standing tent of mahtoree explained at once not only the manner in which their rear had been turned while their attention had been so earnestly bestowed on matters in front but the utter impossibility of resistance  neither ishmael nor his sons deemed it necessary to enter into prolix explanations middleton and paul were bound again with extraordinary silence and despatch and this time not even the aged trapper was exempt from a similar fortune the tent was struck the females placed upon the horses and the whole were on the way towards the squatters encampment with a celerity that might well have served to keep alive the idea of magic  during this summary and brief disposition of things the disappointed agent of mahtoree and his callous associates were seen flying across the plain in the direction of the retiring families and when ishmael left the spot with his prisoners and his booty the ground which had so lately been alive with the bustle and life of an extensive indian encampment was as still and empty as any other spot in those extensive wastes     chapter xxx                 is this proceeding just and honourable                                                    shakspeare  during the occurrence of these events on the upland plain the warriors on the bottom had not been idle we left the adverse bands watching one another on the opposite banks of the stream each endeavouring to excite its enemy to some act of indiscretion by the most reproachful taunts and revilings but the pawnee chief was not slow to discover that his crafty antagonist had no objection to waste the time so idly and as they mutually proved in expedients that were so entirely useless he changed his plans accordingly and withdrew from the bank as has been already explained through the mouth of the trapper in order to invite the more numerous host of the siouxes to cross the challenge was not accepted and the loups were compelled to frame some other method to attain their end  instead of any longer throwing away the precious moments in fruitless endeavours to induce his foe to cross the stream the young partisan of the pawnees led his troops at a swift gallop along its margin in quest of some favourable spot where by a sudden push he might throw his own band without loss to the opposite shore the instant his object was discovered each mounted teton received a footman behind him and mahtoree was still enabled to concentrate his whole force against the effort perceiving that his design was anticipated and unwilling to blow his horses by a race that would disqualify them for service even after they had succeeded in outstripping the more heavilyburdened cattle of the siouxes hardheart drew up and came to a dead halt on the very margin of the watercourse  as the country was too open for any of the usual devices of savage warfare and time was so pressing the chivalrous pawnee resolved to bring on the result by one of those acts of personal daring for which the indian braves are so remarkable and by which they often purchase their highest and dearest renown the spot he had selected was favourable to such a project the river which throughout most of its course was deep and rapid had expanded there to more than twice its customary width and the rippling of its waters proved that it flowed over a shallow bottom in the centre of the current there was an extensive and naked bed of sand but a little raised above the level of the stream and of a colour and consistency which warranted to a practised eye that it afforded a firm and safe foundation for the foot to this spot the partisan now turned his wistful gaze nor was he long in making his decision first speaking to his warriors and apprising them of his intentions he dashed into the current and partly by swimming and more by the use of his horses feet he reached the island in safety  the experience of hardheart had not deceived him when his snorting steed issued from the water he found himself on a tremendous but damp and compact bed of sand that was admirably adapted to the exhibition of the finest powers of the animal the horse seemed conscious of the advantage and bore his warlike rider with an elasticity of step and a loftiness of air that would have done no discredit to the highest trained and most generous charger the blood of the chief himself quickened with the excitement of his situation he sat the beast as if conscious that the eyes of two tribes were on his movements and as nothing could be more acceptable and grateful to his own band than this display of native grace and courage so nothing could be more taunting and humiliating to their enemies  the sudden appearance of the pawnee on the sands was announced among the tetons by a general yell of savage anger a rush was made to the shore followed by a discharge of fifty arrows and a few fusees and on the part of several braves there was a plain manifestation of a desire to plunge into the water in order to punish the temerity of their insolent foe but a call and a mandate from mahtoree checked the rising and nearly ungovernable temper of his band so far from allowing a single foot to be wet or a repetition of the fruitless efforts of his people to drive away their foe with missiles the whole of the party was commanded to retire from the shore while he himself communicated his intentions to one or two of his most favoured followers  when the pawnees observed the rush of their enemies twenty warriors rode into the stream but so soon as they perceived that the tetons had withdrawn they fell back to a man leaving the young chief to the support of his own oftentried skill and wellestablished courage the instructions of hardheart on quitting his band had been worthy of the selfdevotion and daring of his character so long as single warriors came against him he was to be left to the keeping of the wahcondah and his own arm but should the siouxes attack him in numbers he was to be sustained man for man even to the extent of his whole force these generous orders were strictly obeyed and though so many hearts in the troop panted to share in the glory and danger of their partisan not a warrior was found among them all who did not know how to conceal his impatience under the usual mask of indian selfrestraint they watched the issue with quick and jealous eyes nor did a single exclamation of surprise escape them when they saw as will soon be apparent that the experiment of their chief was as likely to conduce to peace as to war  mahtoree was not long in communicating his plans to his confidants whom he as quickly dismissed to join their fellows in the rear the teton entered a short distance into the stream and halted here he raised his hand several times with the palm outwards and made several of those other signs which are construed into a pledge of amicable intentions among the inhabitants of those regions then as if to confirm the sincerity of his faith he cast his fusee to the shore and entered deeper into the water where he again came to a stand in order to see in what manner the pawnee would receive his pledges of peace  the crafty sioux had not made his calculations on the noble and honest nature of his more youthful rival in vain hardheart had continued galloping across the sands during the discharge of missiles and the appearance of a general onset with the same proud and confident mien as that with which he had first braved the danger when he saw the wellknown person of the teton partisan enter the river he waved his hand in triumph and flourishing his lance he raised the thrilling warcry of his people as a challenge for him to come on but when he saw the signs of a truce though deeply practised in the treachery of savage combats he disdained to show a less manly reliance on himself than that which his enemy had seen fit to exhibit riding to the farthest extremity of the sands he cast his own fusee from him and returned to the point whence he had started  the two chiefs were now armed alike each had his spear his bow his quiver his little battleaxe and his knife and each had also a shield of hides which might serve as a means of defence against a surprise from any of these weapons the sioux no longer hesitated but advanced deeper into the stream and soon landed on a point of the island which his courteous adversary had left free for that purpose had one been there to watch the countenance of mahtoree as he crossed the water that separated him from the most formidable and the most hated of all his rivals he might have fancied that he could trace the gleamings of a secret joy breaking through the cloud which deep cunning and heartless treachery had drawn before his swarthy visage and yet there would have been moments when he might have believed that the flashings of the tetons eye and the expansion of his nostrils had their origin in a nobler sentiment and one more worthy of an indian chief  the pawnee awaited the time of his enemy with calmness and dignity the teton made a short run or two to curb the impatience of his steed and to recover his seat after the effort of crossing and then he rode into the centre of the place and invited the other by a courteous gesture to approach hardheart drew nigh until he found himself at a distance equally suited to advance or to retreat and in his turn he came to a stand keeping his glowing eye riveted on that of his enemy a long and grave pause succeeded this movement during which these two distinguished braves who were now for the first time confronted with arms in their hands sat regarding each other like warriors who knew how to value the merits of a gallant foe however hated but the mien of mahtoree was far less stern and warlike than that of the partisan of the loups throwing his shield over his shoulder as if to invite the confidence of the other he made a gesture of salutation and was the first to speak  let the pawnees go upon the hills he said and look from the morning to the evening sun from the country of snows to the land of many flowers and they will see that the earth is very large why cannot the redmen find room on it for all their villages  has the teton ever known a warrior of the loups come to his towns to beg a place for his lodge returned the young brave with a look in which pride and contempt were not attempted to be concealed when the pawnees hunt do they send runners to ask mahtoree if there are no siouxes on the prairies  when there is hunger in the lodge of a warrior he looks for the buffaloe which is given him for food the teton continued struggling to keep down the ire excited by the others scorn the wahcondah has made more of them than he has made indians he has not said this buffaloe shall be for a pawnee and that for a dahcotah this beaver for konza and that for an omawhaw no he said there are enough i love my red children and i have given them great riches the swiftest horse shall not go from the village of the tetons to the village of the loups in many suns it is far from the towns of the pawnees to the river of the osages there is room for all that i love why then should a redman strike his brother  hardheart dropped one end of his lance to the earth and having also cast his shield across his shoulder he sat leaning lightly on the weapon as he answered with a smile of no doubtful expression  are the tetons weary of the hunts and of the warpath do they wish to cook the venison and not to kill it do they intend to let the hair cover their heads that their enemies shall not know where to find their scalps go a pawnee warrior will never come among such sioux squaws for a wife  a frightful gleam of ferocity broke out of the restraint of the dahcotahs countenance as he listened to this biting insult but he was quick in subduing the telltale feeling in an expression much better suited to his present purpose  this is the way a young chief should talk of war he answered with singular composure but mahtoree has seen the misery of more winters than his brother when the nights have been long and darkness has been in his lodge while the young men slept he has thought of the hardships of his people he has said to himself teton count the scalps in your smoke they are all red but two does the wolf destroy the wolf or the rattler strike his brother you know they do not therefore teton are you wrong to go on a path that leads to the village of a redskin with a tomahawk in your hand  the sioux would rob the warrior of his fame he would say to his young men go dig roots in the prairies and find holes to bury your tomahawks in you are no longer braves  if the tongue of mahtoree ever says thus returned the crafty chief with an appearance of strong indignation let his women cut it out and burn it with the offals of the buffaloe no he added advancing a few feet nigher to the immovable hardheart as if in the sincerity of confidence the redman can never want an enemy they are plentier than the leaves on the trees the birds in the heavens or the buffaloes on the prairies let my brother open his eyes wide does he no where see an enemy he would strike  how long is it since the teton counted the scalps of his warriors that were drying in the smoke of a pawnee lodge the hand that took them is here and ready to make eighteen twenty  now let not the mind of my brother go on a crooked path if a redskin strikes a redskin for ever who will be masters of the prairies when no warriors are left to say they are mine hear the voices of the old men they tell us that in their days many indians have come out of the woods under the rising sun and that they have filled the prairies with their complaints of the robberies of the longknives where a paleface comes a redman cannot stay the land is too small they are always hungry see they are here already  as the teton spoke he pointed towards the tents of ishmael which were in plain sight and then he paused to await the effect of his words on the mind of his ingenuous foe hardheart listened like one in whom a train of novel ideas had been excited by the reasoning of the other he mused for a minute before he demanded  what do the wise chiefs of the sioux say must be done  they think that the moccasin of every paleface should be followed like the track of the bear that the longknife who comes upon the prairie should never go back that the path shall be open to those who come and shut to those who go yonder are many they have horses and guns they are rich but we are poor will the pawnees meet the tetons in council and when the sun is gone behind the rocky mountains they will say this is for a loup and this for a sioux  tetonno hardheart has never struck the stranger they come into his lodge and eat and they go out in safety a mighty chief is their friend when my people call the young men to go on the warpath the moccasin of hardheart is the last but his village is no sooner hid by the trees than it is the first no teton his arm will never be lifted against the stranger  fool die with empty hands mahtoree exclaimed setting an arrow to his bow and sending it with a sudden and deadly aim full at the naked bosom of his generous and confiding enemy  the action of the treacherous teton was too quick and too well matured to admit of any of the ordinary means of defence on the part of the pawnee his shield was hanging at his shoulder and even the arrow had been suffered to fall from its place and lay in the hollow of the hand which grasped his bow but the quick eye of the brave had time to see the movement and his ready thoughts did not desert him pulling hard and with a jerk upon the rein his steed reared his forward legs into the air and as the rider bent his body low the horse served for a shield against the danger so true however was the aim and so powerful the force by which it was sent that the arrow entered the neck of the animal and broke the skin on the opposite side  quicker than thought hardheart sent back an answering arrow the shield of the teton was transfixed but his person was untouched for a few moments the twang of the bow and the glancing of arrows were incessant notwithstanding the combatants were compelled to give so large a portion of their care to the means of defence the quivers were soon exhausted and though blood had been drawn it was not in sufficient quantities to impair the energy of the combat  a series of masterly and rapid evolutions with the horses now commenced the wheelings the charges the advances and the circuitous retreats were like the flights of circling swallows blows were struck with the lance the sand was scattered in the air and the shocks often seemed to be unavoidably fatal but still each party kept his seat and still each rein was managed with a steady hand at length the teton was driven to the necessity of throwing himself from his horse to escape a thrust that would otherwise have proved fatal the pawnee passed his lance through the beast uttering a shout of triumph as he galloped by turning in his tracks he was about to push the advantage when his own mettled steed staggered and fell under a burden that he could no longer sustain mahtoree answered his premature cry of victory and rushed upon the entangled youth with knife and tomahawk the utmost agility of hardheart had not sufficed to extricate himself in season from the fallen beast he saw that his case was desperate feeling for his knife he took the blade between a finger and thumb and cast it with admirable coolness at his advancing foe the keen weapon whirled a few times in the air and its point meeting the naked breast of the impetuous sioux the blade was buried to the buckhorn haft  mahtoree laid his hand on the weapon and seemed to hesitate whether to withdraw it or not for a moment his countenance darkened with the most inextinguishable hatred and ferocity and then as if inwardly admonished how little time he had to lose he staggered to the edge of the sands and halted with his feet in the water the cunning and duplicity which had so long obscured the brighter and nobler traits of his character were lost in the never dying sentiment of pride which he had imbibed in youth  boy of the loups he said with a smile of grim satisfaction the scalp of a mighty dahcotah shall never dry in pawnee smoke  drawing the knife from the wound he hurled it towards the enemy in disdain then shaking his arm at his successful foe his swarthy countenance appearing to struggle with volumes of scorn and hatred that he could not utter with the tongue he cast himself headlong into one of the most rapid veins of the current his hand still waving in triumph above the fluid even after his body had sunk into the tide for ever hardheart was by this time free the silence which had hitherto reigned in the bands was suddenly broken by general and tumultuous shouts fifty of the adverse warriors were already in the river hastening to destroy or to defend the conqueror and the combat was rather on the eve of its commencement than near its termination but to all these signs of danger and need the young victor was insensible he sprang for the knife and bounded with the foot of an antelope along the sands looking for the receding fluid which concealed his prize a dark bloody spot indicated the place and armed with the knife he plunged into the stream resolute to die in the flood or to return with his trophy  in the mean time the sands became a scene of bloodshed and violence better mounted and perhaps more ardent the pawnees had however reached the spot in sufficient numbers to force their enemies to retire the victors pushed their success to the opposite shore and gained the solid ground in the melee of the fight here they were met by all the unmounted tetons and in their turn they were forced to give way  the combat now became more characteristic and circumspect as the hot impulses which had driven both parties to mingle in so deadly a struggle began to cool the chiefs were enabled to exercise their influence and to temper the assaults with prudence in consequence of the admonitions of their leaders the siouxes sought such covers as the grass afforded or here and there some bush or slight inequality of the ground and the charges of the pawnee warriors necessarily became more wary and of course less fatal  in this manner the contest continued with a varied success and without much loss the siouxes had succeeded in forcing themselves into a thick growth of rank grass where the horses of their enemies could not enter or where when entered they were worse than useless it became necessary to dislodge the tetons from this cover or the object of the combat must be abandoned several desperate efforts had been repulsed and the disheartened pawnees were beginning to think of a retreat when the wellknown warcry of hardheart was heard at hand and at the next instant the chief appeared in their centre flourishing the scalp of the great sioux as a banner that would lead to victory  he was greeted by a shout of delight and followed into the cover with an impetuosity that for the moment drove all before it but the bloody trophy in the hand of the partisan served as an incentive to the attacked as well as to the assailants mahtoree had left many a daring brave behind him in his band and the orator who in the debates of that day had manifested such pacific thoughts now exhibited the most generous selfdevotion in order to wrest the memorial of a man he had never loved from the hands of the avowed enemies of his people  the result was in favour of numbers after a severe struggle in which the finest displays of personal intrepidity were exhibited by all the chiefs the pawnees were compelled to retire upon the open bottom closely pressed by the siouxes who failed not to seize each foot of ground ceded by their enemies had the tetons stayed their efforts on the margin of the grass it is probable that the honour of the day would have been theirs notwithstanding the irretrievable loss they had sustained in the death of mahtoree but the more reckless braves of the band were guilty of an indiscretion that entirely changed the fortunes of the fight and suddenly stripped them of their hardearned advantages  a pawnee chief had sunk under the numerous wounds he had received and he fell a target for a dozen arrows in the very last group of his retiring party regardless alike of inflicting further injury on their foes and of the temerity of the act the sioux braves bounded forward with a whoop each man burning with the wish to reap the high renown of striking the body of the dead they were met by hardheart and a chosen knot of warriors all of whom were just as stoutly bent on saving the honour of their nation from so foul a stain the struggle was hand to hand and blood began to flow more freely as the pawnees retired with the body the siouxes pressed upon their footsteps and at length the whole of the latter broke out of the cover with a common yell and threatened to bear down all opposition by sheer physical superiority  the fate of hardheart and his companions all of whom would have died rather than relinquish their object would have been quickly sealed but for a powerful and unlookedfor interposition in their favour a shout was heard from a little brake on the left and a volley from the fatal western rifle immediately succeeded some five or six siouxes leaped forward in the death agony and every arm among them was as suddenly suspended as if the lightning had flashed from the clouds to aid the cause of the loups then came ishmael and his stout sons in open view bearing down upon their late treacherous allies with looks and voices that proclaimed the character of the succour  the shock was too much for the fortitude of the tetons several of their bravest chiefs had already fallen and those that remained were instantly abandoned by the whole of the inferior herd a few of the most desperate braves still lingered nigh the fatal symbol of their honour and there nobly met their deaths under the blows of the reencouraged pawnees a second discharge from the rifles of the squatter and his party completed the victory  the siouxes were now to be seen flying to more distant covers with the same eagerness and desperation as a few moments before they had been plunging into the fight the triumphant pawnees bounded forward in chase like so many highblooded and welltrained hounds on every side were heard the cries of victory or the yell of revenge a few of the fugitives endeavoured to bear away the bodies of their fallen warriors but the hot pursuit quickly compelled them to abandon the slain in order to preserve the living among all the struggles which were made on that occasion to guard the honour of the siouxes from the stain which their peculiar opinions attached to the possession of the scalp of a fallen brave but one solitary instance of success occurred  the opposition of a particular chief to the hostile proceedings in the councils of that morning has been already seen but after having raised his voice in vain in support of peace his arm was not backward in doing its duty in the war his prowess has been mentioned and it was chiefly by his courage and example that the tetons sustained themselves in the heroic manner they did when the death of mahtoree was known this warrior who in the figurative language of his people was called the swooping eagle had been the last to abandon the hopes of victory when he found that the support of the dreaded rifle had robbed his band of the hardearned advantages he sullenly retired amid a shower of missiles to the secret spot where he had hid his horse in the mazes of the highest grass here he found a new and an entirely unexpected competitor ready to dispute with him for the possession of the beast it was bohrecheena the aged friend of mahtoree he whose voice had been given in opposition to his own wiser opinions transfixed with an arrow and evidently suffering under the pangs of approaching death  i have been on my last warpath said the grim old warrior when he found that the real owner of the animal had come to claim his property shall a pawnee carry the white hairs of a sioux into his village to be a scorn to his women and children  the other grasped his hand answering to the appeal with the stern look of inflexible resolution with this silent pledge he assisted the wounded man to mount so soon as he had led the horse to the margin of the cover he threw himself also on its back and securing his companion to his belt he issued on the open plain trusting entirely to the wellknown speed of the beast for their mutual safety the pawnees were not long in catching a view of these new objects and several turned their steeds to pursue the race continued for a mile without a murmur from the sufferer though in addition to the agony of his body he had the pain of seeing his enemies approach at every leap of their horses  stop he said raising a feeble arm to check the speed of his companion the eagle of my tribe must spread his wings wider let him carry the white hairs of an old warrior into the burntwood village  few words were necessary between men who were governed by the same feelings of glory and who were so well trained in the principles of their romantic honour the swooping eagle threw himself from the back of the horse and assisted the other to alight the old man raised his tottering frame to its knees and first casting a glance upward at the countenance of his countryman as if to bid him adieu he stretched out his neck to the blow he himself invited a few strokes of the tomahawk with a circling gash of the knife sufficed to sever the head from the less valued trunk the teton mounted again just in season to escape a flight of arrows which came from his eager and disappointed pursuers flourishing the grim and bloody visage he darted away from the spot with a shout of triumph and was seen scouring the plains as if he were actually borne along on the wings of the powerful bird from whose qualities he had received his flattering name the swooping eagle reached his village in safety he was one of the few siouxes who escaped from the massacre of that fatal day and for a long time he alone of the saved was able to lift his voice in the councils of his nation with undiminished confidence  the knife and the lance cut short the retreat of the larger portion of the vanquished even the retiring party of the women and children were scattered by the conquerors and the sun had long sunk behind the rolling outline of the western horizon before the fell business of that disastrous defeat was entirely ended     chapter xxxi              which is the merchant here and which the jew                                                    shakspeare  the day dawned the following morning on a more tranquil scene the work of blood had entirely ceased and as the sun arose its light was shed on a broad expanse of quiet and solitude the tents of ishmael were still standing where they had been last seen but not another vestige of human existence could be traced in any other part of the waste here and there little flocks of ravenous birds were sailing and screaming above those spots where some heavyfooted teton had met his death but every other sign of the recent combat had passed away the river was to be traced far through the endless meadows by its serpentine and smoking bed and the little silvery clouds of vapour which hung above the pools and springs were beginning to melt in air as they felt the quickening warmth which pouring from the glowing sky shed its bland and subtle influence on every object of the vast and unshadowed region the prairie was like the heavens after the passage of the gust soft calm and soothing  it was in the midst of such a scene that the family of the squatter assembled to make their final decision concerning the several individuals who had been thrown into their power by the fluctuating chances of the incidents related every being possessing life and liberty had been afoot since the first streak of grey had lighted the east and even the youngest of the erratic brood seemed conscious that the moment had arrived when circumstances were about to transpire that might leave a lasting impression on the wild fortunes of their semibarbarous condition  ishmael moved through his little encampment with the seriousness of one who had been unexpectedly charged with matters of a gravity exceeding any of the ordinary occurrences of his irregular existence his sons however who had so often found occasions to prove the inexorable severity of their fathers character saw in his sullen mien and cold eye rather a determination to adhere to his resolutions which usually were as obstinately enforced as they were harshly conceived than any evidences of wavering or doubt even esther was sensibly affected by the important matters that pressed so heavily on the interests of her family while she neglected none of those domestic offices which would probably have proceeded under any conceivable circumstances just as the world turns round with earthquakes rending its crust and volcanoes consuming its vitals yet her voice was pitched to a lower and more foreboding key than common and the still frequent chidings of her children were tempered by something like the milder dignity of parental authority  abiram as usual seemed the one most given to solicitude and doubt there were certain misgivings in the frequent glances that he turned on the unyielding countenance of ishmael which might have betrayed how little of their former confidence and good understanding existed between them his looks appeared to be vacillating between hope and fear at times his countenance lighted with the gleamings of a sordid joy as he bent his look on the tent which contained his recovered prisoner and then again the impression seemed unaccountably chased away by the shadows of intense apprehension when under the influence of the latter feeling his eye never failed to seek the visage of his dull and impenetrable kinsman but there he rather found reason for alarm than grounds of encouragement for the whole character of the squatters countenance expressed the fearful truth that he had redeemed his dull faculties from the influence of the kidnapper and that his thoughts were now brooding only on the achievement of his own stubborn intentions  it was in this state of things that the sons of ishmael in obedience to an order from their father conducted the several subjects of his contemplated decisions from their places of confinement into the open air no one was exempted from this arrangement middleton and inez paul and ellen obed and the trapper were all brought forth and placed in situations that were deemed suitable to receive the sentence of their arbitrary judge the younger children gathered around the spot in momentary but engrossing curiosity and even esther quitted her culinary labours and drew nigh to listen  hardheart alone of all his band was present to witness the novel and far from unimposing spectacle he stood leaning gravely on his lance while the smoking steed that grazed nigh showed that he had ridden far and hard to be a spectator on the occasion  ishmael had received his new ally with a coldness that showed his entire insensibility to that delicacy which had induced the young chief to come alone in order that the presence of his warriors might not create uneasiness or distrust he neither courted their assistance nor dreaded their enmity and he now proceeded to the business of the hour with as much composure as if the species of patriarchal power he wielded was universally recognised  there is something elevating in the possession of authority however it may be abused the mind is apt to make some efforts to prove the fitness between its qualities and the condition of its owner though it may often fail and render that ridiculous which was only hated before but the effect on ishmael bush was not so disheartening grave in exterior saturnine by temperament formidable by his physical means and dangerous from his lawless obstinacy his selfconstituted tribunal excited a degree of awe to which even the intelligent middleton could not bring himself to be entirely insensible little time however was given to arrange his thoughts for the squatter though unaccustomed to haste having previously made up his mind was not disposed to waste the moments in delay when he saw that all were in their places he cast a dull look over his prisoners and addressed himself to the captain as the principal man among the imaginary delinquents  i am called upon this day to fill the office which in the settlements you give unto judges who are set apart to decide on matters that arise between man and man i have but little knowledge of the ways of the courts though there is a rule that is known unto all and which teaches that an eye must be returned for an eye and a tooth for a tooth i am no troubler of countyhouses and least of all do i like living on a plantation that the sheriff has surveyed yet there is a reason in such a law that makes it a safe rule to journey by and therefore it ar a solemn fact that this day shall i abide by it and give unto all and each that which is his due and no more  when ishmael had delivered his mind thus far he paused and looked about him as if he would trace the effects in the countenances of his hearers when his eye met that of middleton he was answered by the latter  if the evildoer is to be punished and he that has offended none to be left to go at large you must change situations with me and become a prisoner instead of a judge  you mean to say that i have done you wrong in taking the lady from her fathers house and leading her so far against her will into these wild districts returned the unmoved squatter who manifested as little resentment as he betrayed compunction at the charge i shall not put the lie on the back of an evil deed and deny your words since things have come to this pass between us i have found time to think the matter over at my leisure and though none of your swift thinkers who can see or who pretend to see into the nature of all things by a turn of the eye yet am i a man open to reason and give me my time one who is not given to deny the truth therefore have i mainly concluded that it was a mistake to take a child from its parent and the lady shall be returned whence she has been brought as tenderly and as safely as man can do it  ay ay added esther the man is right poverty and labour bore hard upon him especially as county officers were getting troublesome and in a weak moment he did the wicked act but he has listened to my words and his mind has got round again into its honest corner an awful and a dangerous thing it is to be bringing the daughters of other people into a peaceable and wellgoverned family  and who will thank you for the same after what has been already done muttered abiram with a grin of disappointed cupidity in which malignity and terror were disgustingly united when the devil has once made out his account you may look for your receipt in full only at his hands  peace said ishmael stretching his heavy hand towards his kinsman in a manner that instantly silenced the speaker your voice is like a ravens in my ears if you had never spoken i should have been spared this shame  since then you are beginning to lose sight of your errors and to see the truth said middleton do not things by halves but by the generosity of your conduct purchase friends who may be of use in warding off any future danger from the law  young man interrupted the squatter with a dark frown you too have said enough if fear of the law had come over me you would not be here to witness the manner in which ishmael bush deals out justice  smother not your good intentions and remember if you contemplate violence to any among us that the arm of that law you affect to despise reaches far and that though its movements are sometimes slow they are not the less certain  yes there is too much truth in his words squatter said the trapper whose attentive ears rarely suffered a syllable to be utterly unheeded in his presence a busy and a troublesome arm it often proves to be here in this land of america where as they say man is left greatly to the following of his own wishes compared to other countries and happier ay and more manly and more honest too is he for the privilege why do you know my men that there are regions where the law is so busy as to say in this fashion shall you live in that fashion shall you die and in such another fashion shall you take leave of the world to be sent before the judgmentseat of the lord a wicked and a troublesome meddling is that with the business of one who has not made his creatures to be herded like oxen and driven from field to field as their stupid and selfish keepers may judge of their need and wants a miserable land must that be where they fetter the mind as well as the body and where the creatures of god being born children are kept so by the wicked inventions of men who would take upon themselves the office of the great governor of all  during the delivery of this pertinent opinion ishmael was content to be silent though the look with which he regarded the speaker manifested any other feeling than that of amity when the old man was done he turned to middleton and continued the subject which the other had interrupted  as to ourselves young captain there has been wrong on both sides if i have borne hard upon your feelings in taking away your wife with an honest intention of giving her back to you when the plans of that devil incarnate were answered so have you broken into my encampment aiding and abetting as they have called many an honester bargain in destroying my property  but what i did was to liberate  the matter is settled between us interrupted ishmael with the air of one who having made up his own opinion on the merits of the question cared very little for those of other people you and your wife are free to go and come when and how you please abner set the captain at liberty and now if you will tarry until i am ready to draw nigher to the settlements you shall both have the benefit of carriage if not never say that you did not get a friendly offer  now may the strong oppress me and my sins be visited harshly on my own head if i forget your honesty however slow it has been in showing itself cried middleton hastening to the side of the weeping inez the instant he was released and friend i pledge you the honour of a soldier that your own part of this transaction shall be forgotten whatever i may deem fit to have done when i reach a place where the arm of government can make itself felt  the dull smile with which the squatter answered to this assurance proved how little he valued the pledge that the youth in the first revulsion of his feelings was so free to make  neither fear nor favour but what i call justice has brought me to this judgment he said do you that which may seem right in your eyes and believe that the world is wide enough to hold us both without our crossing each others path again if you ar content well if you ar not content seek to ease your feelings in your own fashion i shall not ask to be let up when you once put me fairly down and now doctor have i come to your leaf in my accounts it is time to foot up the small reckoning that has been running on for some time atwixt us with you i entered into open and manly faith in what manner have you kept it  the singular felicity with which ishmael had contrived to shift the responsibility of all that had passed from his own shoulders to those of his prisoners backed as it was by circumstances that hardly admitted of a very philosophical examination of any mooted point in ethics was sufficiently embarrassing to the several individuals who were so unexpectedly required to answer for a conduct which in their simplicity they had deemed so meritorious the life of obed had been so purely theoretic that his amazement was not the least embarrassing at a state of things which might not have proved so very remarkable had he been a little more practised in the ways of the world the worthy naturalist was not the first by many who found himself at the precise moment when he was expecting praise suddenly arraigned to answer for the very conduct on which he rested all his claims to commendation though not a little scandalised at the unexpected turn of the transaction he was fain to make the best of circumstances and to bring forth such matter in justification as first presented itself to his disordered faculties  that there did exist a certain compactum or agreement between obed batt md and ishmael bush viator or erratic husbandman he said endeavouring to avoid all offence in the use of terms i am not disposed to deny i will admit that it was therein conditioned or stipulated that a certain journey should be performed conjointly or in company until so many days had been numbered but as the said time has fully expired i presume it fair to infer that the bargain may now be said to be obsolete  ishmael interrupted the impatient esther make no words with a man who can break your bones as easily as set them and let the poisoning devil go hes a cheat from box to phial give him half the prairie and take the other half yourself he an acclimator i will engage to get the brats acclimated to a feverandague bottom in a week and not a word shall be uttered harder to pronounce than the bark of a cherrytree with perhaps a drop or two of western comfort one thing ar a fact ishmael i like no fellowtravellers who can give a heavy feel to an honest womans tongue iand that without caring whether her household is in order or out of order  the air of settled gloom which had taken possession of the squatters countenance lighted for an instant with a look of dull drollery as he answered  different people might judge differently esther of the virtue of the mans art but sin it is your wish to let him depart i will not plough the prairie to make the walking rough friend you are at liberty to go into the settlements and there i would advise you to tarry as men like me who make but few contracts do not relish the custom of breaking them so easily  and now ishmael resumed his conquering wife in order to keep a quiet family and to smother all heartburnings between us show yonder redskin and his daughter pointing to the aged le balafre and the widowed tachechana the way to their village and let us say to themgod bless you and farewell in the same breath  they are the captives of the pawnee according to the rules of indian warfare and i cannot meddle with his rights  beware the devil my man hes a cheat and a tempter and none can say they ar safe with his awful delusions before their eyes take the advice of one who has the honour of your name at heart and send the tawny jezebel away  the squatter laid his broad hand on her shoulder and looking her steadily in the eye he answered in tones that were both stern and solemn  woman we have that before us which calls our thoughts to other matters than the follies you mean remember what is to come and put your silly jealousy to sleep  it is true it is true murmured his wife moving back among her daughters god forgive me that i should forget it  and now young man you who have so often come into my clearing under the pretence of lining the bee into his hole resumed ishmael after a momentary pause as if to recover the equilibrium of his mind with you there is a heavier account to settle not satisfied with rummaging my camp you have stolen a girl who is akin to my wife and who i had calculated to make one day a daughter of my own  a stronger sensation was produced by this than by any of the preceding interrogations all the young men bent their curious eyes on paul and ellen the former of whom seemed in no small mental confusion while the latter bent her face on her bosom in shame  harkee friend ishmael bush returned the beehunter who found that he was expected to answer to the charge of burglary as well as to that of abduction that i did not give the most civil treatment to your pots and pails i am not going to gainsay if you will name the price you put upon the articles it is possible the damage may be quietly settled between us and all hard feelings forgotten i was not in a churchgoing humour when we got upon your rock and it is more than probable there was quite as much kicking as preaching among your wares but a hole in the best mans coat can be mended by money as to the matter of ellen wade here it may not be got over so easily different people have different opinions on the subject of matrimony some think it is enough to say yes and no to the questions of the magistrate or of the parson if one happens to be handy in order to make a quiet house but i think that where a young womans mind is fairly bent on going in a certain direction it will be quite as prudent to let her body follow not that i mean to say ellen was not altogether forced to what she did and therefore she is just as innocent in this matter as yonder jackass who was made to carry her and greatly against his will too as i am ready to swear he would say himself if he could speak as loud as he can bray  nelly resumed the squatter who paid very little attention to what paul considered a highly creditable and ingenious vindication nelly this is a wide and a wicked world on which you have been in such a hurry to cast yourself you have fed and you have slept in my camp for a year and i did hope that you had found the free air of the borders enough to your mind to wish to remain among us  let the girl have her will muttered esther from the rear he who might have persuaded her to stay is sleeping in the cold and naked prairie and little hope is left of changing her humour besides a womans mind is a wilful thing and not easily turned from its waywardness as you know yourself my man or i should not be here the mother of your sons and daughters  the squatter seemed reluctant to abandon his views of the abashed girl so easily and before he answered to the suggestion of his wife he turned his usual dull look along the line of the curious countenances of his boys as if to see whether there was not one among them fit to fill the place of the deceased paul was not slow to observe the expression and hitting nigher than usual on the secret thoughts of the other he believed he had fallen on an expedient which might remove every difficulty  it is quite plain friend bush he said that there are two opinions in this matter yours for your sons and mine for myself i see but one amicable way of settling this dispute which is as followsdo you make a choice among your boys of any you will and let us walk off together for the matter of a few miles into the prairies the one who stays behind can never trouble any mans house or his fixen and the one who comes back may make the best of his way he can in the good wishes of the young woman  paul exclaimed the reproachful but smothered voice of ellen  never fear nelly whispered the literal beehunter whose straightgoing mind suggested no other motive of uneasiness on the part of his mistress than concern for himself i have taken the measure of them all and you may trust an eye that has seen to line many a bee into his hole  i am not about to set myself up as a ruler of inclinations observed the squatter if the heart of the child is truly in the settlements let her declare it she shall have no let or hinderance from me speak nelly and let what you say come from your wishes without fear or favour would you leave us to go with this young man into the settled countries or will you tarry and share the little we have to give but which to you we give so freely  thus called upon to decide ellen could no longer hesitate the glance of her eye was at first timid and furtive but as the colour flushed her features and her breathing became quick and excited it was apparent that the native spirit of the girl was gaining the ascendency over the bashfulness of sex  you took me a fatherless impoverished and friendless orphan she said struggling to command her voice when others who live in what may be called affluence compared to your state chose to forget me and may heaven in its goodness bless you for it the little i have done will never pay you for that one act of kindness i like not your manner of life it is different from the ways of my childhood and it is different from my wishes still had you not led this sweet and unoffending lady from her friends i should never have quitted you until you yourself had said go and the blessing of god go with you  the act was not wise but it is repented of and so far as it can be done in safety it shall be repaired now speak freely will you tarry or will you go  i have promised the lady said ellen dropping her eyes again to the earth not to leave her and after she has received so much wrong from our hands she may have a right to claim that i keep my word  take the cords from the young man said ishmael when the order was obeyed he motioned for all his sons to advance and he placed them in a row before the eyes of ellen now let there be no trifling but open your heart here ar all i have to offer besides a hearty welcome  the distressed girl turned her abashed look from the countenance of one of the young men to that of another until her eye met the troubled and working features of paul then nature got the better of forms she threw herself into the arms of the beehunter and sufficiently proclaimed her choice by sobbing aloud ishmael signed to his sons to fall back and evidently mortified though perhaps not disappointed by the result he no longer hesitated  take her he said and deal honestly and kindly by her the girl has that in her which should make her welcome in any mans house and i should be loth to hear she ever came to harm and now i have settled with you all on terms that i hope you will not find hard but on the contrary just and manly i have only another question to ask and that is of the captain do you choose to profit by my teams in going into the settlements or not  i hear that some soldiers of my party are looking for me near the villages of the pawnees said middleton and i intend to accompany this chief in order to join my men  then the sooner we part the better horses are plenty on the bottom go make your choice and leave us in peace  that is impossible while the old man who has been a friend of my family near half a century is left a prisoner what has he done that he too is not released  ask no questions that may lead to deceitful answers sullenly returned the squatter i have dealings of my own with that trapper that it may not befit an officer of the states to meddle with go while your road is open  the man may be giving you honest counsel and that which it concerns you all to hearken to observed the old captive who seemed in no uneasiness at the extraordinary condition in which he found himself the siouxes are a numberless and bloodyminded race and no one can say how long it may be afore they will be out again on the scent of revenge therefore i say to you go also and take especial heed in crossing the bottoms that you get not entangled again in the fires for the honest hunters often burn the grass at this season in order that the buffaloes may find a sweeter and a greener pasturage in the spring  i should forget not only my gratitude but my duty to the laws were i to leave this prisoner in your hands even by his own consent without knowing the nature of his crime in which we may have all been his innocent accessaries  will it satisfy you to know that he merits all he will receive  it will at least change my opinion of his character  look then at this said ishmael placing before the eyes of the captain the bullet that had been found about the person of the dead asa with this morsel of lead did he lay low as fine a boy as ever gave joy to a parents eyes  i cannot believe that he has done this deed unless in selfdefence or on some justifiable provocation that he knew of the death of your son i confess for he pointed out the brake in which the body lay but that he has wrongfully taken his life nothing but his own acknowledgment shall persuade me to believe  i have lived long commenced the trapper who found by the general pause that he was expected to vindicate himself from the heavy imputation and much evil have i seen in my day many are the prowling bears and leaping panthers that i have met fighting for the morsel which has been thrown in their way and many are the reasoning men that i have looked on striving against each other unto death in order that human madness might also have its hour for myself i hope there is no boasting in saying that though my hand has been needed in putting down wickedness and oppression it has never struck a blow of which its owner will be ashamed to hear at a reckoning that shall be far mightier than this  if my father has taken life from one of his tribe said the young pawnee whose quick eye had read the meaning of what was passing in the bullet and in the countenances of the others let him give himself up to the friends of the dead like a warrior he is too just to need thongs to lead him to judgment  boy i hope you do me justice if i had done the foul deed with which they charge me i should have manhood enough to come and offer my head to the blow of punishment as all good and honest redmen do the same then giving his anxious indian friend a look to reassure him of his innocence he turned to the rest of his attentive and interested listeners as he continued in english i have a short story to tell and he that believes it will believe the truth and he that disbelieves it will only lead himself astray and perhaps his neighbour too we were all outlying about your camp friend squatter as by this time you may begin to suspect when we found that it contained a wronged and imprisoned lady with intentions neither more honest nor dishonest than to set her free as in nature and justice she had a right to be seeing that i was more skilled in scouting than the others while they lay back in the cover i was sent upon the plain on the business of the reconnoitrings you little thought that one was so nigh who saw into all the circumventions of your hunt but there was i sometimes flat behind a bush or a tuft of grass sometimes rolling down a hill into a bottom and little did you dream that your motions were watched as the panther watches the drinking deer lord squatter when i was a man in the pride and strength of my days i have looked in at the tent door of the enemy and they sleeping ay and dreaming too of being at home and in peace i wish there was time to give you the partic  proceed with your explanation interrupted middleton  ah and a bloody and wicked sight it was there i lay in a low bed of grass as two of the hunters came nigh each other their meeting was not cordial nor such as men who meet in a desert should give each other but i thought they would have parted in peace until i saw one put his rifle to the others back and do what i call a treacherous and sinful murder it was a noble and a manly youth that boythough the powder burnt his coat he stood the shock for more than a minute before he fell then was he brought to his knees and a desperate and manful fight he made to the brake like a wounded bear seeking a cover  and why in the name of heavenly justice did you conceal this cried middleton  what think you captain that a man who has spent more than threescore years in the wilderness has not learned the virtue of discretion what red warrior runs to tell the sights he has seen until a fitting time i took the doctor to the place in order to see whether his skill might not come in use and our friend the beehunter being in company was knowing to the fact that the bushes held the body  ay it ar true said paul but not knowing what private reasons might make the old trapper wish to hush the matter up i said as little about the thing as possible which was just nothing at all  and who was the perpetrator of this deed demanded middleton  if by perpetrator you mean him who did the act yonder stands the man and a shame and a disgrace is it to our race that he is of the blood and family of the dead  he lies he lies shrieked abiram i did no murder i gave but blow for blow  the voice of ishmael was deep and even awful as he answered  it is enough let the old man go boys put the brother of your mother in his place  touch me not cried abiram ill call on god to curse you if you touch me  the wild and disordered gleam of his eye at first induced the young men to arrest their steps but when abner older and more resolute than the rest advanced full upon him with a countenance that bespoke the hostile state of his mind the affrighted criminal turned and making an abortive effort to fly fell with his face to the earth to all appearance perfectly dead amid the low exclamations of horror which succeeded ishmael made a gesture which commanded his sons to bear the body into the tent  now he said turning to those who were strangers in his camp nothing is left to be done but for each to go his own road i wish you all well and to you ellen though you may not prize the gift i say god bless you  middleton awestruck by what he believed a manifest judgment of heaven made no further resistance but prepared to depart the arrangements were brief and soon completed when they were all ready they took a short and silent leave of the squatter and his family and then the whole of the singularly constituted party were seen slowly and silently following the victorious pawnee towards his distant villages     chapter xxxii                         and i beseech you                wrest once the law to your authority                to do a great right do a little wrong                                                    shakspeare  ishmael awaited long and patiently for the motley train of hardheart to disappear when his scout reported that the last straggler of the indians who had joined their chief so soon as he was at such a distance from the encampment as to excite no jealousy by their numbers had gone behind the most distant swell of the prairie he gave forth the order to strike his tents the cattle were already in the gears and the movables were soon transferred to their usual places in the different vehicles when all these arrangements were completed the little wagon which had so long been the tenement of inez was drawn before the tent into which the insensible body of the kidnapper had been borne and preparations were evidently made for the reception of another prisoner then it was as abiram appeared pale terrified and tottering beneath a load of detected guilt that the younger members of the family were first apprised that he still belonged to the class of the living a general and superstitious impression had spread among them that his crime had been visited by a terrible retribution from heaven and they now gazed at him as at a being who belonged rather to another world than as a mortal who like themselves had still to endure the last agony before the great link of human existence could be broken the criminal himself appeared to be in a state in which the most sensitive and startling terror was singularly combined with total physical apathy the truth was that while his person had been numbed by the shock his susceptibility to apprehension kept his agitated mind in unrelieved distress when he found himself in the open air he looked about him in order to gather if possible some evidences of his future fate from the countenances of those gathered round seeing every where grave but composed features and meeting in no eye any expression that threatened immediate violence the miserable man began to revive and by the time he was seated in the wagon his artful faculties were beginning to plot the expedients of parrying the just resentment of his kinsmen or if these should fail him the means of escaping from a punishment that his forebodings told him would be terrible  throughout the whole of these preparations ishmael rarely spoke a gesture or a glance of the eye served to indicate his pleasure to his sons and with these simple methods of communication all parties appeared content when the signal was made to proceed the squatter threw his rifle into the hollow of his arm and his axe across his shoulder taking the lead as usual esther buried herself in the wagon which contained her daughters the young men took their customary places among the cattle or nigh the teams and the whole proceeded at their ordinary dull but unremitted gait  for the first time in many a day the squatter turned his back towards the setting sun the route he held was in the direction of the settled country and the manner in which he moved sufficed to tell his children who had learned to read their fathers determinations in his mien that their journey on the prairie was shortly to have an end still nothing else transpired for hours that might denote the existence of any sudden or violent revolution in the purposes or feelings of ishmael during all that time he marched alone keeping a few hundred rods in front of his teams seldom giving any sign of extraordinary excitement once or twice indeed his huge figure was seen standing on the summit of some distant swell with the head bent towards the earth as he leaned on his rifle but then these moments of intense thought were rare and of short continuance the train had long thrown its shadows towards the east before any material alteration was made in the disposition of their march watercourses were waded plains were passed and rolling ascents risen and descended without producing the smallest change long practised in the difficulties of that peculiar species of travelling in which he was engaged the squatter avoided the more impracticable obstacles of their route by a sort of instinct invariably inclining to the right or left in season as the formation of the land the presence of trees or the signs of rivers forewarned him of the necessity of such movements  at length the hour arrived when charity to man and beast required a temporary suspension of labour ishmael chose the required spot with his customary sagacity the regular formation of the country such as it has been described in the earlier pages of our book had long been interrupted by a more unequal and broken surface there were it is true in general the same wide and empty wastes the same rich and extensive bottoms and that wild and singular combination of swelling fields and of nakedness which gives that region the appearance of an ancient country incomprehensibly stripped of its people and their dwellings but these distinguishing features of the rolling prairies had long been interrupted by irregular hillocks occasional masses of rock and broad belts of forest  ishmael chose a spring that broke out of the base of a rock some forty or fifty feet in elevation as a place well suited to the wants of his herds the water moistened a small swale that lay beneath the spot which yielded in return for the fecund gift a scanty growth of grass a solitary willow had taken root in the alluvion and profiting by its exclusive possession of the soil the tree had sent up its stem far above the crest of the adjacent rock whose peaked summit had once been shadowed by its branches but its loveliness had gone with the mysterious principle of life as if in mockery of the meagre show of verdure that the spot exhibited it remained a noble and solemn monument of former fertility the larger ragged and fantastic branches still obtruded themselves abroad while the white and hoary trunk stood naked and tempestriven not a leaf nor a sign of vegetation was to be seen about it in all things it proclaimed the frailty of existence and the fulfilment of time  here ishmael after making the customary signal for the train to approach threw his vast frame upon the earth and seemed to muse on the deep responsibility of his present situation his sons were not long in arriving for the cattle no sooner scented the food and water than they quickened their pace and then succeeded the usual bustle and avocations of a halt  the impression made by the scene of that morning was not so deep or lasting on the children of ishmael and esther as to induce them to forget the wants of nature but while the sons were searching among their stores for something substantial to appease their hunger and the younger fry were wrangling about their simple dishes the parents of the unnurtured family were differently employed  when the squatter saw that all even to the reviving abiram were busy in administering to their appetites he gave his downcast partner a glance of his eye and withdrew towards a distant roll of the land which bounded the view towards the east the meeting of the pair in this naked spot was like an interview held above the grave of their murdered son ishmael signed to his wife to take a seat beside him on a fragment of rock and then followed a space during which neither seemed disposed to speak  we have journeyed together long through good and bad ishmael at length commenced much have we had to try us and some bitter cups have we been made to swallow my woman but nothing like this has ever before lain in my path  it is a heavy cross for a poor misguided and sinful woman to bear returned esther bowing her head to her knees and partly concealing her face in her dress a heavy and a burdensome weight is this to be laid upon the shoulders of a sister and a mother  ay therein lies the hardship of the case i had brought my mind to the punishment of that houseless trapper with no great strivings for the man had done me few favours and god forgive me if i suspected him wrongfully of much evil this is however bringing shame in at one door of my cabin in order to drive it out at the other but shall a son of mine be murdered and he who did it go at largethe boy would never rest  oh ishmael we pushed the matter far had little been said who would have been the wiser our consciences might then have been quiet  eester said the husband turning on her a reproachful but still a dull regard the hour has been my woman when you thought another hand had done this wickedness  i did i did the lord gave me the feeling as a punishment for my sins but his mercy was not slow in lifting the veil i looked into the book ishmael and there i found the words of comfort  have you that book at hand woman it may happen to advise in such a dreary business  esther fumbled in her pocket and was not long in producing the fragment of a bible which had been thumbed and smokedried till the print was nearly illegible it was the only article in the nature of a book that was to be found among the chattels of the squatter and it had been preserved by his wife as a melancholy relic of more prosperous and possibly of more innocent days she had long been in the habit of resorting to it under the pressure of such circumstances as were palpably beyond human redress though her spirit and resolution rarely needed support under those that admitted of reparation through any of the ordinary means of reprisal in this manner esther had made a sort of convenient ally of the word of god rarely troubling it for counsel however except when her own incompetency to avert an evil was too apparent to be disputed we shall leave casuists to determine how far she resembled any other believers in this particular and proceed directly with the matter before us  there are many awful passages in these pages ishmael she said when the volume was opened and the leaves were slowly turning under her finger and some there ar that teach the rules of punishment  her husband made a gesture for her to find one of those brief rules of conduct which have been received among all christian nations as the direct mandates of the creator and which have been found so just that even they who deny their high authority admit their wisdom ishmael listened with grave attention as his companion read all those verses which her memory suggested and which were thought applicable to the situation in which they found themselves he made her show him the words which he regarded with a sort of strange reverence a resolution once taken was usually irrevocable in one who was moved with so much difficulty he put his hand upon the book and closed the pages himself as much as to apprise his wife that he was satisfied esther who so well knew his character trembled at the action and casting a glance at his steady eye she said  and yet ishmael my blood and the blood of my children is in his veins cannot mercy be shown  woman he answered sternly when we believed that miserable old trapper had done this deed nothing was said of mercy  esther made no reply but folding her arms upon her breast she sat silent and thoughtful for many minutes then she once more turned her anxious gaze upon the countenance of her husband where she found all passion and care apparently buried in the coldest apathy satisfied now that the fate of her brother was sealed and possibly conscious how well he merited the punishment that was meditated she no longer thought of mediation no more words passed between them their eyes met for an instant and then both arose and walked in profound silence towards the encampment  the squatter found his children expecting his return in the usual listless manner with which they awaited all coming events the cattle were already herded and the horses in their gears in readiness to proceed so soon as he should indicate that such was his pleasure the children were already in their proper vehicle and in short nothing delayed the departure but the absence of the parents of the wild brood  abner said the father with the deliberation with which all his proceedings were characterised take the brother of your mother from the wagon and let him stand on the arth  abiram issued from his place of concealment trembling it is true but far from destitute of hopes as to his final success in appeasing the just resentment of his kinsman after throwing a glance around him with the vain wish of finding a single countenance in which he might detect a solitary gleam of sympathy he endeavoured to smother those apprehensions that were by this time reviving in their original violence by forcing a sort of friendly communication between himself and the squatter  the beasts are getting jaded brother he said and as we have made so good a march already is it not time to camp to my eye you may go far before a better place than this is found to pass the night in  tis well you like it your tarry here ar likely to be long my sons draw nigh and listen abiram white he added lifting his cap and speaking with a solemnity and steadiness that rendered even his dull mien imposing you have slain my firstborn and according to the laws of god and man must you die  the kidnapper started at this terrible and sudden sentence with the terror that one would exhibit who unexpectedly found himself in the grasp of a monster from whose power there was no retreat although filled with the most serious forebodings of what might be his lot his courage had not been equal to look his danger in the face and with the deceitful consolation with which timid tempers are apt to conceal their desperate condition from themselves he had rather courted a treacherous relief in his cunning than prepared himself for the worst  die he repeated in a voice that scarcely issued from his chest a man is surely safe among his kinsmen  so thought my boy returned the squatter motioning for the team that contained his wife and the girls to proceed as he very coolly examined the priming of his piece by the rifle did you destroy my son it is fit and just that you meet your end by the same weapon  abiram stared about him with a gaze that bespoke an unsettled reason he even laughed as if he would not only persuade himself but others that what he heard was some pleasantry intended to try his nerves but nowhere did his frightful merriment meet with an answering echo all around was solemn and still the visages of his nephews were excited but cold towards him and that of his former confederate frightfully determined this very steadiness of mien was a thousand times more alarming and hopeless than any violence could have proved the latter might possibly have touched his spirit and awakened resistance but the former threw him entirely on the feeble resources of himself  brother he said in a hurried unnatural whisper did i hear you  my words are plain abiram white thou hast done murder and for the same must thou die  esther sister sister will you leave me oh sister do you hear my call  i hear one speak from the grave returned the husky tones of esther as the wagon passed the spot where the criminal stood it is the voice of my firstborn calling aloud for justice god have mercy god have mercy on your soul  the team slowly pursued its route and the deserted abiram now found himself deprived of the smallest vestige of hope still he could not summon fortitude to meet his death and had not his limbs refused to aid him he would yet have attempted to fly then by a sudden revolution from hope to utter despair he fell upon his knees and commenced a prayer in which cries for mercy to god and to his kinsman were wildly and blasphemously mingled the sons of ishmael turned away in horror at the disgusting spectacle and even the stern nature of the squatter began to bend before so abject misery  may that which you ask of him be granted he said but a father can never forget a murdered child  he was answered by the most humble appeals for time a week a day an hour were each implored with an earnestness commensurate to the value they receive when a whole life is compressed into their short duration the squatter was troubled and at length he yielded in part to the petitions of the criminal his final purpose was not altered though he changed the means abner he said mount the rock and look on every side that we may be sure none are nigh  while his nephew was obeying this order gleams of reviving hope were seen shooting across the quivering features of the kidnapper the report was favourable nothing having life the retiring teams excepted was to be seen a messenger was however coming from the latter in great apparent haste ishmael awaited its arrival he received from the hands of one of his wondering and frighted girls a fragment of that book which esther had preserved with so much care the squatter beckoned the child away and placed the leaves in the hands of the criminal  eester has sent you this he said that in your last moments you may remember god  bless her bless her a good and kind sister has she been to me but time must be given that i may read time my brother time  time shall not be wanting you shall be your own executioner and this miserable office shall pass away from my hands  ishmael proceeded to put his new resolution in force the immediate apprehensions of the kidnapper were quieted by an assurance that he might yet live for days though his punishment was inevitable a reprieve to one abject and wretched as abiram temporarily produced the same effects as a pardon he was even foremost in assisting in the appalling arrangements and of all the actors in that solemn tragedy his voice alone was facetious and jocular  a thin shelf of the rock projected beneath one of the ragged arms of the willow it was many feet from the ground and admirably adapted to the purpose which in fact its appearance had suggested on this little platform the criminal was placed his arms bound at the elbows behind his back beyond the possibility of liberation with a proper cord leading from his neck to the limb of the tree the latter was so placed that when suspended the body could find no foothold the fragment of the bible was placed in his hands and he was left to seek his consolation as he might from its pages  and now abiram white said the squatter when his sons had descended from completing this arrangement i give you a last and solemn asking death is before you in two shapes with this rifle can your misery be cut short or by that cord sooner or later must you meet your end  let me yet live oh ishmael you know not how sweet life is when the last moment draws so nigh  tis done said the squatter motioning for his assistants to follow the herds and teams and now miserable man that it may prove a consolation to your end i forgive you my wrongs and leave you to your god  ishmael turned and pursued his way across the plain at his ordinary sluggish and ponderous gait though his head was bent a little towards the earth his inactive mind did not prompt him to cast a look behind once indeed he thought he heard his name called in tones that were a little smothered but they failed to make him pause  at the spot where he and esther had conferred he reached the boundary of the visible horizon from the rock here he stopped and ventured a glance in the direction of the place he had just quitted the sun was near dipping into the plains beyond and its last rays lighted the naked branches of the willow he saw the ragged outline of the whole drawn against the glowing heavens and he even traced the still upright form of the being he had left to his misery turning the roll of the swell he proceeded with the feelings of one who had been suddenly and violently separated from a recent confederate for ever  within a mile the squatter overtook his teams his sons had found a place suited to the encampment for the night and merely awaited his approach to confirm their choice few words were necessary to express his acquiescence every thing passed in a silence more general and remarkable than ever the chidings of esther were not heard among her young or if heard they were more in the tones of softened admonition than in her usual upbraiding key  no questions nor explanations passed between the husband and his wife it was only as the latter was about to withdraw among her children for the night that the former saw her taking a furtive look at the pan of his rifle ishmael bade his sons seek their rest announcing his intention to look to the safety of the camp in person when all was still he walked out upon the prairie with a sort of sensation that he found his breathing among the tents too straitened the night was well adapted to heighten the feelings which had been created by the events of the day  the wind had risen with the moon and it was occasionally sweeping over the plain in a manner that made it not difficult for the sentinel to imagine strange and unearthly sounds were mingling in the blasts yielding to the extraordinary impulses of which he was the subject he cast a glance around to see that all were slumbering in security and then he strayed towards the swell of land already mentioned here the squatter found himself at a point that commanded a view to the east and to the west light fleecy clouds were driving before the moon which was cold and watery though there were moments when its placid rays were shed from clear blue fields seeming to soften objects to its own mild loveliness  for the first time in a life of so much wild adventure ishmael felt a keen sense of solitude the naked prairies began to assume the forms of illimitable and dreary wastes and the rushing of the wind sounded like the whisperings of the dead it was not long before he thought a shriek was borne past him on a blast it did not sound like a call from earth but it swept frightfully through the upper air mingled with the hoarse accompaniment of the wind the teeth of the squatter were compressed and his huge hand grasped the rifle as if it would crush the metal then came a lull a fresher blast and a cry of horror that seemed to have been uttered at the very portals of his ears a sort of echo burst involuntarily from his own lips as men shout under unnatural excitement and throwing his rifle across his shoulder he proceeded towards the rock with the strides of a giant  it was not often that the blood of ishmael moved at the rate with which the fluid circulates in the veins of ordinary men but now he felt it ready to gush from every pore in his body the animal was aroused in his most latent energies ever as he advanced he heard those shrieks which sometimes seemed ringing among the clouds and sometimes passed so nigh as to appear to brush the earth at length there came a cry in which there could be no delusion or to which the imagination could lend no horror it appeared to fill each cranny of the air as the visible horizon is often charged to fulness by one dazzling flash of the electric fluid the name of god was distinctly audible but it was awfully and blasphemously blended with sounds that may not be repeated the squatter stopped and for a moment he covered his ears with his hands when he withdrew the latter a low and husky voice at his elbow asked in smothered tones  ishmael my man heard ye nothing  hist returned the husband laying a powerful arm on esther without manifesting the smallest surprise at the unlookedfor presence of his wife hist woman if you have the fear of heaven be still  a profound silence succeeded though the wind rose and fell as before its rushing was no longer mingled with those fearful cries the sounds were imposing and solemn but it was the solemnity and majesty of nature  let us go on said esther all is hushed  woman what has brought you here demanded her husband whose blood had returned into its former channels and whose thoughts had already lost a portion of their excitement  ishmael he murdered our firstborn but it is not meet that the son of my mother should lie upon the ground like the carrion of a dog  follow returned the squatter again grasping his rifle and striding towards the rock the distance was still considerable and their approach as they drew nigh the place of execution was moderated by awe many minutes had passed before they reached a spot where they might distinguish the outlines of the dusky objects  where have you put the body whispered esther see here are pick and spade that a brother of mine may sleep in the bosom of the earth  the moon broke from behind a mass of clouds and the eye of the woman was enabled to follow the finger of ishmael it pointed to a human form swinging in the wind beneath the ragged and shining arm of the willow esther bent her head and veiled her eyes from the sight but ishmael drew nigher and long contemplated his work in awe though not in compunction the leaves of the sacred book were scattered on the ground and even a fragment of the shelf had been displaced by the kidnapper in his agony but all was now in the stillness of death the grim and convulsed countenance of the victim was at times brought full into the light of the moon and again as the wind lulled the fatal rope drew a dark line across its bright disk the squatter raised his rifle with extreme care and fired the cord was cut and the body came lumbering to the earth a heavy and insensible mass  until now esther had not moved nor spoken but her hand was not slow to assist in the labour of the hour the grave was soon dug it was instantly made to receive its miserable tenant as the lifeless form descended esther who sustained the head looked up into the face of her husband with an expression of anguish and said  ishmael my man it is very terrible i cannot kiss the corpse of my fathers child  the squatter laid his broad hand on the bosom of the dead and said  abiram white we all have need of mercy from my soul do i forgive you may god in heaven have pity on your sins  the woman bowed her face and imprinted her lips long and fervently on the pallid forehead of her brother after this came the falling clods and all the solemn sounds of filling a grave esther lingered on her knees and ishmael stood uncovered while the woman muttered a prayer all was then finished  on the following morning the teams and herds of the squatter were seen pursuing their course towards the settlements as they approached the confines of society the train was blended among a thousand others though some of the numerous descendants of this peculiar pair were reclaimed from their lawless and semibarbarous lives the principals of the family themselves were never heard of more     chapter xxxiii                no leave take i for i will ride               as far as land will let me by your side                                                    shakspeare  the passage of the pawnee to his village was interrupted by no scene of violence his vengeance had been as complete as it was summary not even a solitary scout of the siouxes was left on the hunting grounds he was obliged to traverse and of course the journey of middletons party was as peaceful as if made in the bosom of the states the marches were timed to meet the weakness of the females in short the victors seemed to have lost every trace of ferocity with their success and appeared disposed to consult the most trifling of the wants of that engrossing people who were daily encroaching on their rights and reducing the redmen of the west from their state of proud independence to the condition of fugitives and wanderers  our limits will not permit a detail of the triumphal entry of the conquerors the exultation of the tribe was proportioned to its previous despondency mothers boasted of the honourable deaths of their sons wives proclaimed the honour and pointed to the scars of their husbands and indian girls rewarded the young braves with songs of triumph the trophies of their fallen enemies were exhibited as conquered standards are displayed in more civilised regions the deeds of former warriors were recounted by the aged men and declared to be eclipsed by the glory of this victory while hardheart himself so distinguished for his exploits from boyhood to that hour was unanimously proclaimed and reproclaimed the worthiest chief and the stoutest brave that the wahcondah had ever bestowed on his most favoured children the pawnees of the loup  notwithstanding the comparative security in which middleton found his recovered treasure he was not sorry to see his faithful and sturdy artillerists standing among the throng as he entered in the wild train and lifting their voices in a martial shout to greet his return the presence of this force small as it was removed every shadow of uneasiness from his mind it made him master of his movements gave him dignity and importance in the eyes of his new friends and would enable him to overcome the difficulties of the wide region which still lay between the village of the pawnees and the nearest fortress of his countrymen a lodge was yielded to the exclusive possession of inez and ellen and even paul when he saw an armed sentinel in the uniform of the states pacing before its entrance was content to stray among the dwellings of the redskins prying with but little reserve into their domestic economy commenting sometimes jocularly sometimes gravely and always freely on their different expedients or endeavouring to make the wondering housewives comprehend his quaint explanations of what he conceived to be the better customs of the whites  this enquiring and troublesome spirit found no imitators among the indians the delicacy and reserve of hardheart were communicated to his people when every attention that could be suggested by their simple manners and narrow wants had been fulfilled no intrusive foot presumed to approach the cabins devoted to the service of the strangers they were left to seek their repose in the manner which most comported with their habits and inclinations the songs and rejoicings of the tribe however ran far into the night during the deepest hours of which the voice of more than one warrior was heard recounting from the top of his lodge the deeds of his people and the glory of their triumphs  every thing having life notwithstanding the excesses of the night was abroad with the appearance of the sun the expression of exultation which had so lately been seen on every countenance was now changed to one better suited to the feeling of the moment it was understood by all that the palefaces who had befriended their chief were about to take their final leave of the tribe the soldiers of middleton in anticipation of his arrival had bargained with an unsuccessful trader for the use of his boat which lay in the stream ready to receive its cargo and nothing remained to complete the arrangements for the long journey  middleton did not see this moment arrive entirely without distrust the admiration with which hardheart regarded inez had not escaped his jealous eye any more than had the lawless wishes of mahtoree he knew the consummate manner in which a savage could conceal his designs and he felt that it would be a culpable weakness to be unprepared for the worst secret instructions were therefore given to his men while the preparations they made were properly masked behind the show of military parade with which it was intended to signalise their departure  the conscience of the young soldier reproached him when he saw the whole tribe accompanying his party to the margin of the stream with unarmed hands and sorrowful countenances they gathered in a circle around the strangers and their chief and became not only peaceful but highly interested observers of what was passing as it was evident that hardheart intended to speak the former stopped and manifested their readiness to listen the trapper performing the office of interpreter then the young chief addressed his people in the usual metaphorical language of an indian he commenced by alluding to the antiquity and renown of his own nation he spoke of their successes in the hunts and on the warpath of the manner in which they had always known how to defend their rights and to chastise their enemies after he had said enough to manifest his respect for the greatness of the loups and to satisfy the pride of the listeners he made a sudden transition to the race of whom the strangers were members he compared their countless numbers to the flights of migratory birds in the season of blossoms or in the fall of the year with a delicacy that none know better how to practise than an indian warrior he made no direct mention of the rapacious temper that so many of them had betrayed in their dealings with the redmen feeling that the sentiment of distrust was strongly engrafted in the tempers of his tribe he rather endeavoured to soothe any just resentment they might entertain by indirect excuses and apologies he reminded the listeners that even the pawnee loups had been obliged to chase many unworthy individuals from their villages the wahcondah sometimes veiled his countenance from a redman no doubt the great spirit of the palefaces often looked darkly on his children such as were abandoned to the worker of evil could never be brave or virtuous let the colour of the skin be what it might he bade his young men look at the hands of the bigknives they were not empty like those of hungry beggars neither were they filled with goods like those of knavish traders they were like themselves warriors and they carried arms which they knew well how to usethey were worthy to be called brothers  then he directed the attention of all to the chief of the strangers he was a son of their great white father he had not come upon the prairies to frighten the buffaloes from their pastures or to seek the game of the indians wicked men had robbed him of one of his wives no doubt she was the most obedient the meekest the loveliest of them all they had only to open their eyes to see that his words must be true now that the white chief had found his wife he was about to return to his own people in peace he would tell them that the pawnees were just and there would be a line of wampum between the two nations let all his people wish the strangers a safe return to their towns the warriors of the loups knew both how to receive their enemies and how to clear the briars from the path of their friends  the heart of middleton beat quick as the young partisan alluded to the charms of inez and for an instant he cast an impatient glance at his little line of artillerists but the chief from that moment appeared to forget he had ever seen so fair a being his feelings if he had any on the subject were veiled behind the cold mask of indian selfdenial he took each warrior by the hand not forgetting the meanest soldier but his cold and collected eye never wandered for an instant towards either of the females arrangements had been made for their comfort with a prodigality and care that had not failed to excite some surprise in his young men but in no other particular did he shock their manly pride by betraying any solicitude in behalf of the weaker sex       the americans and the indians have adopted several words which     each believe peculiar to the language of the others thus squaw     papoose or child wigwam c c though it is doubtful     whether they belonged at all to any indian dialect are much used     by both white and red men in their intercourse many words are     derived from the french in this species of prairie nomaic     partisan brave c are of the number  the leavetaking was general and imposing each male pawnee was sedulous to omit no one of the strange warriors in his attentions and of course the ceremony occupied some time the only exception and that was not general was in the case of dr battius not a few of the young men it is true were indifferent about lavishing civilities on one of so doubtful a profession but the worthy naturalist found some consolation in the more matured politeness of the old men who had inferred that though not of much use in war the medicine of the bigknives might possibly be made serviceable in peace  when all of middletons party had embarked the trapper lifted a small bundle which had lain at his feet during the previous proceedings and whistling hector to his side he was the last to take his seat the artillerists gave the usual cheers which were answered by a shout from the tribe and then the boat was shoved into the current and began to glide swiftly down its stream  a long and a musing if not a melancholy silence succeeded this departure it was first broken by the trapper whose regret was not the least visible in his dejected and sorrowful eye  they are a valiant and an honest tribe he said that will i say boldly in their favour and second only do i take them to be to that once mighty but now scattered people the delawares of the hills ahs me captain if you had seen as much good and evil as i have seen in these nations of redskins you would know of how much value was a brave and simpleminded warrior i know that some are to be found who both think and say that an indian is but little better than the beasts of these naked plains but it is needful to be honest in ones self to be a fitting judge of honesty in others no doubt no doubt they know their enemies and little do they care to show to such any great confidence or love  it is the way of man returned the captain and it is probable they are not wanting in any of his natural qualities  no no it is little that they want that natur has had to give but as little does he know of the temper of a redskin who has seen but one indian or one tribe as he knows of the colour of feathers who has only looked upon a crow now friend steersman just give the boat a sheer towards yonder low sandy point and a favour will be granted at a short asking  for what demanded middleton we are now in the swiftest of the current and by drawing to the shore we shall lose the force of the stream  your tarry will not be long returned the old man applying his own hand to the execution of that which he had requested the oarsmen had seen enough of his influence with their leader not to dispute his wishes and before time was given for further discussion on the subject the bow of the boat had touched the land  captain resumed the other untying his little wallet with great deliberation and even in a manner to show he found satisfaction in the delay i wish to offer you a small matter of trade no great bargain mayhap but still the best that one of whose hand the skill of the rifle has taken leave and who has become no better than a miserable trapper can offer before we part  part was echoed from every mouth among those who had so recently shared his dangers and profited by his care  what the devil old trapper do you mean to foot it to the settlements when here is a boat that will float the distance in half the time that the jackass the doctor has given the pawnee could trot along the same  settlements boy it is long sin i took my leave of the waste and wickedness of the settlements and the villages if i live in a clearing here it is one of the lords making and i have no hard thoughts on the matter but never again shall i be seen running wilfully into the danger of immoralities  i had not thought of parting answered middleton endeavouring to seek some relief from the uneasiness he felt by turning his eyes on the sympathising countenances of his friends on the contrary i had hoped and believed that you would have accompanied us below where i give you a sacred pledge nothing shall be wanting to make your days comfortable  yes lad yes you would do your endeavours but what are the strivings of man against the working of the devil ay if kind offers and good wishes could have done the thing i might have been a congress man or perhaps a governor years agone your grandther wished the same and there are them still lying in the otsego mountains as i hope who would gladly have given me a palace for my dwelling but what are riches without content my time must now be short at any rate and i hope its no mighty sin for one who has acted his part honestly near ninety winters and summers to wish to pass the few hours that remain in comfort if you think i have done wrong in coming thus far to quit you again captain i will own the reason of the act without shame or backwardness though i have seen so much of the wilderness it is not to be gainsayed that my feelings as well as my skin are white now it would not be a fitting spectacle that yonder pawnee loups should look upon the weakness of an old warrior if weakness he should happen to show in parting for ever from those he has reason to love though he may not set his heart so strongly on them as to wish to go into the settlements in their company  harkee old trapper said paul clearing his throat with a desperate effort as if determined to give his voice a clear exit i have just one bargain to make since you talk of trading which is neither more or less than this i offer you as my side of the business one half of my shanty nor do i much care if it be the biggest half the sweetest and the purest honey that can be made of the wild locust always enough to eat with now and then a mouthful of venison or for that matter a morsel of buffaloes hump seeing that i intend to push my acquaintance with the animal and as good and as tidy cooking as can come from the hands of one like ellen wade here who will shortly be nelly somebodyelse and altogether such general treatment as a decent man might be supposed to pay to his best friend or for that matter to his own father in return for the same you ar to give us at odd moments some of your ancient traditions perhaps a little wholesome advice on occasions in small quantities at a time and as much of your agreeable company as you please  it is wellit is well boy returned the old man fumbling at his wallet honestly offered and not unthankfully declinedbut it cannot be no it can never be  venerable venator said dr battius there are obligations which every man owes to society and to human nature it is time that you should return to your countrymen to deliver up some of those stores of experimental knowledge that you have doubtless obtained by so long a sojourn in the wilds which however they may be corrupted by preconceived opinions will prove acceptable bequests to those whom as you say you must shortly leave for ever  friend physicianer returned the trapper looking the other steadily in the face as it would be no easy matter to judge of the temper of the rattler by considering the fashions of the moose so it would be hard to speak of the usefulness of one man by thinking too much of the deeds of another you have your gifts like others i suppose and little do i wish to disturb them but as to me the lord has made me for a doer and not a talker and therefore do i consider it no harm to shut my ears to your invitation  it is enough interrupted middleton i have seen and heard so much of this extraordinary man as to know that persuasions will not change his purpose first we will hear your request my friend and then we will consider what may be best done for your advantage  it is a small matter captain returned the old man succeeding at length in opening his bundle a small and trifling matter is it to what i once used to offer in the way of bargain but then it is the best i have and therein not to be despised here are the skins of four beavers that i took it might be a month afore we met and here is another from a racoon that is of no great matter to be sure but which may serve to make weight atween us  and what do you propose to do with them  i offer them in lawful barter them knaves the siouxes the lord forgive me for ever believing it was the konzas have stolen the best of my traps and driven me altogether to makeshift inventions which might foretell a dreary winter for me should my time stretch into another season i wish you therefore to take the skins and to offer them to some of the trappers you will not fail to meet below in exchange for a few traps and to send the same into the pawnee village in my name be careful to have my mark painted on them a letter n with a hounds ear and the lock of a rifle there is no redskin who will then dispute my right for all which trouble i have little more to offer than my thanks unless my friend the beehunter here will accept of the racoon and take on himself the special charge of the whole matter  if i do may i b the mouth of paul was stopped by the hand of ellen and he was obliged to swallow the rest of the sentence which he did with a species of emotion that bore no slight resemblance to the process of strangulation  well well returned the old man meekly i hope there is no heavy offence in the offer i know that the skin of a racoon is of small price but then it was no mighty labour that i asked in return  you entirely mistake the meaning of our friend interrupted middleton who observed that the beehunter was looking in every direction but the right one and that he was utterly unable to make his own vindication he did not mean to say that he declined the charge but merely that he refused all compensation it is unnecessary however to say more of this it shall be my office to see that the debt we owe is properly discharged and that all your necessities shall be anticipated  anan said the old man looking up enquiringly into the others face as if to ask an explanation  it shall all be as you wish lay the skins with my baggage we will bargain for you as for ourselves  thankee thankee captain you grandther was of a free and generous mind so much so in truth that those just people the delawares called him the openhand i wish now i was as i used to be in order that i might send in the lady a few delicate martens for her tippets and overcoats just to show you that i know how to give courtesy for courtesy but do not expect the same for i am too old to give a promise it will all be just as the lord shall see fit i can offer you nothing else for i havent livd so long in the wilderness not to know the scrupulous ways of a gentleman  harkee old trapper cried the beehunter striking his own hand into the open palm which the other had extended with a report but little below the crack of a rifle i have just two things to sayfirstly that the captain has told you my meaning better than i can myself and secondly if you want a skin either for your private use or to send abroad i have it at your service and that is the skin of one paul hover  the old man returned the grasp he received and opened his mouth to the utmost in his extraordinary silent laugh  you couldnt have given such a squeeze boy when the teton squaws were about you with their knives ah you are in your prime and in your vigour and happiness if honesty lies in your path then the expression of his rugged features suddenly changed to a look of seriousness and thought come hither lad he said leading the beehunter by a button to the land and speaking apart in a tone of admonition and confidence much has passed atween us on the pleasures and respectableness of a life in the woods or on the borders i do not now mean to say that all you have heard is not true but different tempers call for different employments you have taken to your bosom there a good and kind child and it has become your duty to consider her as well as yourself in setting forth in life you are a little given to skirting the settlements but to my poor judgment the girl would be more like a flourishing flower in the sun of a clearing than in the winds of a prairie therefore forget any thing you may have heard from me which is nevertheless true and turn your mind on the ways of the inner country  paul could only answer with a squeeze that would have brought tears from the eyes of most men but which produced no other effect on the indurated muscles of the other than to make him laugh and nod as if he received the same as a pledge that the beehunter would remember his advice the trapper then turned away from his rough but warmhearted companion and having called hector from the boat he seemed anxious still to utter a few words more  captain he at length resumed i know when a poor man talks of credit he deals in a delicate word according to the fashions of the world and when an old man talks of life he speaks of that which he may never see nevertheless there is one thing i will say and that is not so much on my own behalf as on that of another person here is hector a good and faithful pup that has long outlived the time of a dog and like his master he looks more to comfort now than to any deeds in running but the creatur has his feelings as well as a christian he has consorted latterly with his kinsman there in such a sort as to find great pleasure in his company and i will acknowledge that it touches my feelings to part the pair so soon if you will set a value on your hound i will endeavour to send it to you in the spring more especially should them same traps come safe to hand or if you dislike parting with the animal altogether i will just ask you for his loan through the winter i think i can see my pup will not last beyond that time for i have judgment in these matters since many is the friend both hound and redskin that i have seen depart in my day though the lord hath not yet seen fit to order his angels to sound forth my name  take him take him cried middleton take all or any thing  the old man whistled the younger dog to the land and then he proceeded to the final adieus little was said on either side the trapper took each person solemnly by the hand and uttered something friendly and kind to all middleton was perfectly speechless and was driven to affect busying himself among the baggage paul whistled with all his might and even obed took his leave with an effort that bore the appearance of desperate philosophical resolution when he had made the circuit of the whole the old man with his own hands shoved the boat into the current wishing god to speed them not a word was spoken nor a stroke of the oar given until the travellers bad floated past a knoll that hid the trapper from their view he was last seen standing on the low point leaning on his rifle with hector crouched at his feet and the younger dog frisking along the sands in the playfulness of youth and vigour     chapter xxxiv                      methought i heard a voice                                                    shakspeare  the watercourses were at their height and the boat went down the swift current like a bird the passage proved prosperous and speedy in less than a third of the time that would have been necessary for the same journey by land it was accomplished by the favour of those rapid rivers issuing from one stream into another as the veins of the human body communicate with the larger channels of life they soon entered the grand artery of the western waters and landed safely at the very door of the father of inez  the joy of don augustin and the embarrassment of the worthy father ignatius may be imagined the former wept and returned thanks to heaven the latter returned thanks and did not weep the mild provincials were too happy to raise any questions on the character of so joyful a restoration and by a sort of general consent it soon came to be an admitted opinion that the bride of middleton had been kidnapped by a villain and that she was restored to her friends by human agency there were as respects this belief certainly a few sceptics but then they enjoyed their doubts in private with that species of sublimated and solitary gratification that a miser finds in gazing at his growing but useless hoards  in order to give the worthy priest something to employ his mind middleton made him the instrument of uniting paul and ellen the former consented to the ceremony because he found that all his friends laid great stress on the matter but shortly after he led his bride into the plains of kentucky under the pretence of paying certain customary visits to sundry members of the family of hover while there he took occasion to have the marriage properly solemnised by a justice of the peace of his acquaintance in whose ability to forge the nuptial chain he had much more faith than in that of all the gownsmen within the pale of rome ellen who appeared conscious that some extraordinary preventives might prove necessary to keep one of so erratic a temper as her partner within the proper matrimonial boundaries raised no objections to these double knots and all parties were content  the local importance middleton had acquired by his union with the daughter of so affluent a proprietor as don augustin united to his personal merit attracted the attention of the government he was soon employed in various situations of responsibility and confidence which both served to elevate his character in the public estimation and to afford the means of patronage the beehunter was among the first of those to whom he saw fit to extend his favour it was far from difficult to find situations suited to the abilities of paul in the state of society that existed threeandtwenty years ago in those regions the efforts of middleton and inez in behalf of her husband were warmly and sagaciously seconded by ellen and they succeeded in process of time in working a great and beneficial change in his character he soon became a landholder then a prosperous cultivator of the soil and shortly after a townofficer by that progressive change in fortune which in the republic is often seen to be so singularly accompanied by a corresponding improvement in knowledge and selfrespect he went on from step to step until his wife enjoyed the maternal delight of seeing her children placed far beyond the danger of returning to that state from which both their parents had issued paul is actually at this moment a member of the lower branch of the legislature of the state where he has long resided and he is even notorious for making speeches that have a tendency to put that deliberative body in good humour and which as they are based on great practical knowledge suited to the condition of the country possess a merit that is much wanted in many more subtle and finespun theories that are daily heard in similar assemblies to issue from the lips of certain instinctive politicians but all these happy fruits were the results of much care and of a long period of time middleton who fills with a credit better suited to the difference in their educations a seat in a far higher branch of legislative authority is the source from which we have derived most of the intelligence necessary to compose our legend in addition to what he has related of paul and of his own continued happiness he has added a short narrative of what took place in a subsequent visit to the prairies with which as we conceive it a suitable termination to what has gone before we shall judge it wise to conclude our labours  in the autumn of the year that succeeded the season in which the preceding events occurred the young man still in the military service found himself on the waters of the missouri at a point not far remote from the pawnee towns released from any immediate calls of duty and strongly urged to the measure by paul who was in his company he determined to take horse and cross the country to visit the partisan and to enquire into the fate of his friend the trapper as his train was suited to his functions and rank the journey was effected with the privations and hardships that are the accompaniments of all travelling in a wild but without any of those dangers and alarms that marked his former passage through the same regions when within a proper distance he despatched an indian runner belonging to a friendly tribe to announce the approach of himself and party continuing his route at a deliberate pace in order that the intelligence might as was customary precede his arrival to the surprise of the travellers their message was unanswered hour succeeded hour and mile after mile was passed without bringing either the signs of an honourable reception or the more simple assurances of a friendly welcome at length the cavalcade at whose head rode middleton and paul descended from the elevated plain on which they had long been journeying to a luxuriant bottom that brought them to the level of the village of the loups the sun was beginning to fall and a sheet of golden light was spread over the placid plain lending to its even surface those glorious tints and hues that the human imagination is apt to conceive forms the embellishment of still more imposing scenes the verdure of the year yet remained and herds of horses and mules were grazing peacefully in the vast natural pasture under the keeping of vigilant pawnee boys paul pointed out among them the wellknown form of asinus sleek fat and luxuriating in the fulness of content as he stood with reclining ears and closed eyelids seemingly musing on the exquisite nature of his present indolent enjoyment  the route of the party led them at no great distance from one of those watchful youths who was charged with a trust heavy as the principal wealth of his tribe he heard the trampling of the horses and cast his eye aside but instead of manifesting curiosity or alarm his look instantly returned whence it had been withdrawn to the spot where the village was known to stand  there is something remarkable in all this muttered middleton half offended at what he conceived to be not only a slight to his rank but offensive to himself personally yonder boy has heard of our approach or he would not fail to notify his tribe and yet he scarcely deigns to favour us with a glance look to your arms men it may be necessary to let these savages feel our strength  therein captain i think youre in an error returned paul if honesty is to be met on the prairies at all you will find it in our old friend hardheart neither is an indian to be judged of by the rules of a white see we are not altogether slighted for here comes a party at last to meet us though it is a little pitiful as to show and numbers  paul was right in both particulars a group of horsemen were at length seen wheeling round a little copse and advancing across the plain directly towards them the advance of this party was slow and dignified as it drew nigh the partisan of the loups was seen at its head followed by a dozen younger warriors of his tribe they were all unarmed nor did they even wear any of those ornaments or feathers which are considered testimonials of respect to the guest an indian receives as well as evidence of his own importance  the meeting was friendly though a little restrained on both sides middleton jealous of his own consideration no less than of the authority of his government suspected some undue influence on the part of the agents of the canadas and as he was determined to maintain the authority of which he was the representative he felt himself constrained to manifest a hauteur that he was far from feeling it was not so easy to penetrate the motives of the pawnees calm dignified and yet far from repulsive they set an example of courtesy blended with reserve that many a diplomatist of the most polished court might have strove in vain to imitate  in this manner the two parties continued their course to the town middleton had time during the remainder of the ride to revolve in his mind all the probable reasons which his ingenuity could suggest for this strange reception although he was accompanied by a regular interpreter the chiefs made their salutations in a manner that dispensed with his services twenty times the captain turned his glance on his former friend endeavouring to read the expression of his rigid features but every effort and all conjectures proved equally futile the eye of hardheart was fixed composed and a little anxious but as to every other emotion impenetrable he neither spoke himself nor seemed willing to invite discourse in his visiters it was therefore necessary for middleton to adopt the patient manners of his companions and to await the issue for the explanation  when they entered the town its inhabitants were seen collected in an open space where they were arranged with the customary deference to age and rank the whole formed a large circle in the centre of which were perhaps a dozen of the principal chiefs hardheart waved his hand as he approached and as the mass of bodies opened he rode through followed by his companions here they dismounted and as the beasts were led apart the strangers found themselves environed by a thousand grave composed but solicitous faces  middleton gazed about him in growing concern for no cry no song no shout welcomed him among a people from whom he had so lately parted with regret his uneasiness not to say apprehensions was shared by all his followers determination and stern resolution began to assume the place of anxiety in every eye as each man silently felt for his arms and assured himself that his several weapons were in a state for service but there was no answering symptom of hostility on the part of their hosts hardheart beckoned for middleton and paul to follow leading the way towards the cluster of forms that occupied the centre of the circle here the visiters found a solution of all the movements which had given them so much reason for apprehension  the trapper was placed on a rude seat which had been made with studied care to support his frame in an upright and easy attitude the first glance of the eye told his former friends that the old man was at length called upon to pay the last tribute of nature his eye was glazed and apparently as devoid of sight as of expression his features were a little more sunken and strongly marked than formerly but there all change so far as exterior was concerned might be said to have ceased his approaching end was not to be ascribed to any positive disease but had been a gradual and mild decay of the physical powers life it is true still lingered in his system but it was as if at times entirely ready to depart and then it would appear to reanimate the sinking form reluctant to give up the possession of a tenement that had never been corrupted by vice or undermined by disease it would have been no violent fancy to have imagined that the spirit fluttered about the placid lips of the old woodsman reluctant to depart from a shell that had so long given it an honest and an honourable shelter  his body was placed so as to let the light of the setting sun fall full upon the solemn features his head was bare the long thin locks of grey fluttering lightly in the evening breeze his rifle lay upon his knee and the other accoutrements of the chase were placed at his side within reach of his hand between his feet lay the figure of a hound with its head crouching to the earth as if it slumbered and so perfectly easy and natural was its position that a second glance was necessary to tell middleton he saw only the skin of hector stuffed by indian tenderness and ingenuity in a manner to represent the living animal his own dog was playing at a distance with the child of tachechana and mahtoree the mother herself stood at hand holding in her arms a second offspring that might boast of a parentage no less honourable than that which belonged to the son of hardheart le balafre was seated nigh the dying trapper with every mark about his person that the hour of his own departure was not far distant the rest of those immediately in the centre were aged men who had apparently drawn near in order to observe the manner in which a just and fearless warrior would depart on the greatest of his journeys  the old man was reaping the rewards of a life remarkable for temperance and activity in a tranquil and placid death his vigour in a manner endured to the very last decay when it did occur was rapid but free from pain he had hunted with the tribe in the spring and even throughout most of the summer when his limbs suddenly refused to perform their customary offices a sympathising weakness took possession of all his faculties and the pawnees believed that they were going to lose in this unexpected manner a sage and counsellor whom they had begun both to love and respect but as we have already said the immortal occupant seemed unwilling to desert its tenement the lamp of life flickered without becoming extinguished on the morning of the day on which middleton arrived there was a general reviving of the powers of the whole man his tongue was again heard in wholesome maxims and his eye from time to time recognised the persons of his friends it merely proved to be a brief and final intercourse with the world on the part of one who had already been considered as to mental communion to have taken his leave of it for ever  when he had placed his guests in front of the dying man hardheart after a pause that proceeded as much from sorrow as decorum leaned a little forward and demanded  does my father hear the words of his son  speak returned the trapper in tones that issued from his chest but which were rendered awfully distinct by the stillness that reigned in the place i am about to depart from the village of the loups and shortly shall be beyond the reach of your voice  let the wise chief have no cares for his journey continued hardheart with an earnest solicitude that led him to forget for the moment that others were waiting to address his adopted parent a hundred loups shall clear his path from briars  pawnee i die as i have lived a christian man resumed the trapper with a force of voice that had the same startling effect upon his hearers as is produced by the trumpet when its blast rises suddenly and freely on the air after its obstructed sounds have been heard struggling in the distance as i came into life so will i leave it horses and arms are not needed to stand in the presence of the great spirit of my people he knows my colour and according to my gifts will he judge my deeds  my father will tell my young men how many mingoes he has struck and what acts of valour and justice he has done that they may know how to imitate him  a boastful tongue is not heard in the heaven of a white man solemnly returned the old man what i have done he has seen his eyes are always open that which has been well done will he remember wherein i have been wrong will he not forget to chastise though he will do the same in mercy no my son a paleface may not sing his own praises and hope to have them acceptable before his god  a little disappointed the young partisan stepped modestly back making way for the recent comers to approach middleton took one of the meagre hands of the trapper and struggling to command his voice he succeeded in announcing his presence the old man listened like one whose thoughts were dwelling on a very different subject but when the other had succeeded in making him understand that he was present an expression of joyful recognition passed over his faded featuresi hope you have not so soon forgotten those whom you so materially served middleton concluded it would pain me to think my hold on your memory was so light  little that i have ever seen is forgotten returned the trapper i am at the close of many weary days but there is not one among them all that i could wish to overlook i remember you with the whole of your company ay and your grandther that went before you i am glad that you have come back upon these plains for i had need of one who speaks the english since little faith can be put in the traders of these regions will you do a favour to an old and dying man  name it said middleton it shall be done  it is a far journey to send such trifles resumed the old man who spoke at short intervals as strength and breath permitted a far and weary journey is the same but kindnesses and friendships are things not to be forgotten there is a settlement among the otsego hills  i know the place interrupted middleton observing that he spoke with increasing difficulty proceed to tell me what you would have done  take this rifle and pouch and horn and send them to the person whose name is graven on the plates of the stocka trader cut the letters with his knifefor it is long that i have intended to send him such a token of my love  it shall be so is there more that you could wish  little else have i to bestow my traps i give to my indian son for honestly and kindly has he kept his faith let him stand before me  middleton explained to the chief what the trapper had said and relinquished his own place to the other  pawnee continued the old man always changing his language to suit the person he addressed and not unfrequently according to the ideas he expressed it is a custom of my people for the father to leave his blessing with the son before he shuts his eves for ever this blessing i give to you take it for the prayers of a christian man will never make the path of a just warrior to the blessed prairies either longer or more tangled may the god of a white man look on your deeds with friendly eyes and may you never commit an act that shall cause him to darken his face i know not whether we shall ever meet again there are many traditions concerning the place of good spirits it is not for one like me old and experienced though i am to set up my opinions against a nations you believe in the blessed prairies and i have faith in the sayings of my fathers if both are true our parting will be final but if it should prove that the same meaning is hid under different words we shall yet stand together pawnee before the face of your wahcondah who will then be no other than my god there is much to be said in favour of both religions for each seems suited to its own people and no doubt it was so intended i fear i have not altogether followed the gifts of my colour inasmuch as i find it a little painful to give up for ever the use of the rifle and the comforts of the chase but then the fault has been my own seeing that it could not have been his ay hector he continued leaning forward a little and feeling for the ears of the hound our parting has come at last dog and it will be a long hunt you have been an honest and a bold and a faithful hound pawnee you cannot slay the pup on my grave for where a christian dog falls there he lies for ever but you can be kind to him after i am gone for the love you bear his master  the words of my father are in my ears returned the young partisan making a grave and respectful gesture of assent  do you hear what the chief has promised dog demanded the trapper making an effort to attract the notice of the insensible effigy of his hound receiving no answering look nor hearing any friendly whine the old man felt for the mouth and endeavoured to force his hand between the cold lips the truth then flashed upon him although he was far from perceiving the whole extent of the deception falling back in his seat he hung his head like one who felt a severe and unexpected shock profiting by this momentary forgetfulness two young indians removed the skin with the same delicacy of feeling that had induced them to attempt the pious fraud  the dog is dead muttered the trapper after a pause of many minutes a hound has his time as well as a man and well has he filled his days captain he added making an effort to wave his hand for middleton i am glad you have come for though kind and well meaning according to the gifts of their colour these indians are not the men to lay the head of a white man in his grave i have been thinking too of this dog at my feet it will not do to set forth the opinion that a christian can expect to meet his hound again still there can be little harm in placing what is left of so faithful a servant nigh the bones of his master  it shall be as you desire  im glad you think with me in this matter in order then to save labour lay the pup at my feet or for that matter put him side by side a hunter need never be ashamed to be found in company with his dog  i charge myself with your wish  the old man made a long and apparently a musing pause at times he raised his eyes wistfully as if he would again address middleton but some innate feeling appeared always to suppress his words the other who observed his hesitation enquired in a way most likely to encourage him to proceed whether there was aught else that he could wish to have done  i am without kith or kin in the wide world the trapper answered when i am gone there will be an end of my race we have never been chiefs but honest and useful in our way i hope it cannot be denied we have always proved ourselves my father lies buried near the sea and the bones of his son will whiten on the prairies  name the spot and your remains shall be placed by the side of your father interrupted middleton  not so not so captain let me sleep where i have lived beyond the din of the settlements still i see no need why the grave of an honest man should be hid like a redskin in his ambushment i paid a man in the settlements to make and put a graven stone at the head of my fathers resting place it was of the value of twelve beaverskins and cunningly and curiously was it carved then it told to all comers that the body of such a christian lay beneath and it spoke of his manner of life of his years and of his honesty when we had done with the frenchers in the old war i made a journey to the spot in order to see that all was rightly performed and glad i am to say the workman had not forgotten his faith  and such a stone you would have at your grave  i no no i have no son but hardheart and it is little that an indian knows of white fashions and usages besides i am his debtor already seeing it is so little i have done since i have lived in his tribe the rifle might bring the value of such a thingbut then i know it will give the boy pleasure to hang the piece in his hall for many is the deer and the bird that he has seen it destroy no no the gun must be sent to him whose name is graven on the lock  but there is one who would gladly prove his affection in the way you wish he who owes you not only his own deliverance from so many dangers but who inherits a heavy debt of gratitude from his ancestors the stone shall be put at the head of your grave  the old man extended his emaciated hand and gave the other a squeeze of thanks  i thought you might be willing to do it but i was backward in asking the favour he said seeing that you are not of my kin put no boastful words on the same but just the name the age and the time of the death with something from the holy book no more no more my name will then not be altogether lost on arth i need no more  middleton intimated his assent and then followed a pause that was only broken by distant and broken sentences from the dying man he appeared now to have closed his accounts with the world and to await merely for the final summons to quit it middleton and hardheart placed themselves on the opposite sides of his seat and watched with melancholy solicitude the variations of his countenance for two hours there was no very sensible alteration the expression of his faded and timeworn features was that of a calm and dignified repose from time to time he spoke uttering some brief sentence in the way of advice or asking some simple questions concerning those in whose fortunes he still took a friendly interest during the whole of that solemn and anxious period each individual of the tribe kept his place in the most selfrestrained patience when the old man spoke all bent their heads to listen and when his words were uttered they seemed to ponder on their wisdom and usefulness  as the flame drew nigher to the socket his voice was hushed and there were moments when his attendants doubted whether he still belonged to the living middleton who watched each wavering expression of his weatherbeaten visage with the interest of a keen observer of human nature softened by the tenderness of personal regard fancied he could read the workings of the old mans soul in the strong lineaments of his countenance perhaps what the enlightened soldier took for the delusion of mistaken opinion did actually occur for who has returned from that unknown world to explain by what forms and in what manner he was introduced into its awful precincts without pretending to explain what must ever be a mystery to the quick we shall simply relate facts as they occurred  the trapper had remained nearly motionless for an hour his eyes alone had occasionally opened and shut when opened his gaze seemed fastened on the clouds which hung around the western horizon reflecting the bright colours and giving form and loveliness to the glorious tints of an american sunset the hourthe calm beauty of the seasonthe occasion all conspired to fill the spectators with solemn awe suddenly while musing on the remarkable position in which he was placed middleton felt the hand which he held grasp his own with incredible power and the old man supported on either side by his friends rose upright to his feet for a moment he looked about him as if to invite all in presence to listen the lingering remnant of human frailty and then with a fine military elevation of the head and with a voice that might be heard in every part of that numerous assembly the word  here  a movement so entirely unexpected and the air of grandeur and humility which were so remarkably united in the mien of the trapper together with the clear and uncommon force of his utterance produced a short period of confusion in the faculties of all present when middleton and hardheart each of whom had involuntarily extended a hand to support the form of the old man turned to him again they found that the subject of their interest was removed for ever beyond the necessity of their care they mournfully placed the body in its seat and le balafre arose to announce the termination of the scene to the tribe the voice of the old indian seemed a sort of echo from that invisible world to which the meek spirit of the trapper had just departed  a valiant a just and a wise warrior has gone on the path which will lead him to the blessed grounds of his people he said when the voice of the wahcondah called him he was ready to answer go my children remember the just chief of the palefaces and clear your own tracks from briars  the grave was made beneath the shade of some noble oaks it has been carefully watched to the present hour by the pawnees of the loop and is often shown to the traveller and the trader as a spot where a just whiteman sleeps in due time the stone was placed at its head with the simple inscription which the trapper had himself requested the only liberty taken by middleton was to addmay no wanton hand ever disturb his remains
