 the rover boys at college     chapter i  on the train   were making time now tom  making time repeated tom rover as he gazed out of the car window at the telegraph poles flashing past i should say we were sam why we must be running sixty miles an hour  if we are not we are making pretty close to it came from a third boy of the party in the parlor car i think the engineer is trying to make up some of the time we lost at the last stop  that must be it dick said sam rover gracious how we are rocking he added as the train rushed around a sharp curve and nearly threw him from his chair  i hope we get to ashton on time remarked tom rover i want to take a look around the grounds before it gets dark  thats tom wanting to see it all before he sleeps cried sam rover with a grin you look out tom that you dont get into disgrace the first thing as you did when we went to putnam hall dont you remember that giant firecracker and how josiah crabtree locked you up in a cell for setting it off  ugh will i ever forget it groaned tom making a wry face but i got the best of old crabtree didnt i he continued his face brightening  wonder if well make as many friends at college as we did at putnam hall remarked dick rover those were jolly times and no mistake think of the feasts and the hazings and the baseball and football and the rackets with the pornell students and all that  speaking of hazing i heard that some of the hazing at the college were bound for is fierce came from sam rover  well well have to stand for what comes sam answered his big brother no crying quit here  right you are dick said tom at the same time ifgreat caesars ghost whats up now  as tom uttered the last words a shrill whistle from the locomotive pierced the air then came the sudden gripping of the air brakes on the car wheels and the express came to a stop with a shock that pitched all the passengers from their seats tom and sam went sprawling in a heap in the aisle and dick came down on top of them  hi get off of me spluttered sam who was underneath  whats the matter have we run into another train asked tom as he pushed dick to one side and arose  i dont know answered the older brother something is wrong thats certain  are you hurt sam asked tom as he helped the youngest rover to his feet  nonot much was the panting reply say we stopped in a hurry all right didnt we  with the shock had come loud cries from the other people in the car and it was found that one young lady had fainted everybody wanted to know what was the matter but nobody could answer the question the colored porter ran to the platform and opened the vestibule door tom followed the man and so did sam and dick  freight train ahead off the track announced tom we ran into the last car  let us go up front and see how bad it is returned dick maybe this will tie us up here for hours  oh i hope not cried sam i want to get to the college just as soon as possible im dying to know what its like  we can be thankful we were not hurt sam said his older brother if our engineer hadnt stopped the train as he did we might have had a fearful smashup  i know it answered sam soberly and then the boys walked forward to learn the full extent of the damage done and what prospects there were of continuing their journey  to my old readers the lads just mentioned will need no special introduction but for the benefit of those who have not read the previous volumes in this rover boys series let me state that the brothers were three in number dick being the oldest funloving tom coming next and sam the youngest they were the sons of one anderson rover a rich widower and when at home lived with their father and an aunt and an uncle on a beautiful farm called valley brook  from the farm and while their father was in africa the boys had been sent by their uncle randolph to school as related in the first book of the series called the rover boys at school at this place called putnam hall they made many friends and also a few enemies and had the time of their lives as tom often expressed it  a term at school had been followed by a short trip on the ocean and then the boys in company with their uncle went to the jungles of africa to rescue mr rover who was a captive of a savage tribe of natives after that came trips out west and to the great lakes and to the mountains and returning to school the lads went into camp with the other cadets then they took another long trip on land and sea and led a crusoelike life on an island of the pacific ocean  i think wed better settle down now said dick on returning home from being cast away but this was not to be they took a houseboat trip down the ohio and the mississippi rivers had a number of adventures on the plains and then found themselves in southern waters where they solved the mystery of a deserted steam yacht  they returned to the farm and to putnam hall and for a time matters went along quietly on account of attending to some business for his father dick had fallen somewhat behind in his studies and tom and sam did their best to catch up to him and as a consequence all three of the youths graduated from putnam hall at the same time  and now for college sam had said and all were anxious to know where their parent intended to send them next but instead of settling this question mr rover came forward with a proposition that was as novel as it was inviting this was nothing less than to visit a spot in the west indies known as treasure isle and made a hunt for a large treasure secreted there during a rebellion in one of the central american countries  a treasure hunt just the thing dick had said and his brothers agreed with him the lads were filled with excitement over the prospect and for the time being all thoughts of going to college were thrust aside  from mr rover it was learned that the treasure belonged to the estate of a mr stanhope who had died some years before mr stanhopes widow was well known to the rover boys and dick thought that dora stanhope the daughter was the finest girl in the whole world there was also another relative a mrs laningthe late mr stanhopes sisterwho was to share in the estate and she had two daughters grace and nellie two young ladies who were especial favorites with sam and tom  oh weve got to find that treasure said tom think of what it means to the stanhopes and the lanings  theyll be richand they deserve to be answered his brother sam it may be added here that the rovers were wealthy so they did not begrudge the treasure to others  a steam yacht was chartered and a party was made up consisting of the rovers several of the boys school chums mrs stanhope and dora and mrs laning and grace and nellie the steam yacht carried a fine crew and also an old tar called bahama bill who knew the exact location of the treasure  before sailing it was learned that some rivals were also after the treasure one of these was a sharper named sid merrick who had on several occasions tried to get the best of the rovers and failed with merrick was tad sobber his nephew a youth who at putnam hall had been a bitter foe to dick tom and sam sobber had sent the rovers a box containing a live poisonous snake but the snake got away and bit another pupil this lad knew all about the sending of the reptile and he exposed tad sobber and the latter growing alarmed ran away from the school  the search for the treasure proved a long one and sid merrick and tad sobber did all in their power to keep the wealth from falling into the hands of the rovers and their friends but the rovers won out in the quest and sailed away with the treasure on board the steam yacht the vessel of their enemies followed them but a hurricane came up and the other ship was lost with nearly all on board  well thats the end of sid merrick and tad sobber said dick when he heard this news if they are at the bottom of the atlantic ocean they cant bother us any more but dick was mistaken in his surmise it was true that sid merrick had been drowned but tad sobber was alive having been rescued by a schooner bound for london and he was now on his way back to the united states more bitter than ever against the rovers and with a determination to do all in his power to bring dick tom and sam to grief and gain possession of the money which he and his uncle had claimed belonged to them instead of to the stanhope estate  on arriving at philadelphia from the west indies the treasure was deposited in a strong box of a local trust company from it the expenses of the trip were paid and the sailors who had aided in the search were suitably rewarded later on the balance of the treasure was divided according to the terms of mr stanhopes will this placed a large sum of money in the hands of mrs stanhope both for herself and dora and also a goodly amount in the hands of mrs laning for herself and grace and nellie  the stanhopes had always been fairly well off but not so the lanings john laning was a farmer and this sudden change to riches bewildered him  why mother he said to his wife whatever will you and the gals do with the money  several things john she answered in the first place you are not going to work so hard and in the next place the girls are going to have a better education  well im not afraid of work answered the farmer about eddication if they want itwell its their money and they can have all the learnin they want  dora is going to a boarding school and nellie and grace want to go with her went on mrs laning  where is dora going  to a place called hope seminary her mother knows the lady who is the principal  well if its a good place i reckon the gals can go too but it will be terrible lonesome here without em  i know john but we want the girls to be somebody now they have money dont we  sure we do answered mr laning readily  so it was arranged that the three girls should go to hope seminary located several miles from the town of ashton in one of the central states in the meantime the rover boys were speculating on what college they were to attend yale was mentioned and harvard and princeton and also several institutions located in the middle west  boys wouldnt you like to go to brill college asked their father one day thats a fine institutionnot quite so large as some but just as good and he smiled in a peculiar manner  brill where is that asked dick  it is near the town of ashton about two miles from hope seminary the school dora stanhope and the laning girls are going to attend and mr rover smiled again  brill college for mine said sam promptly and in a manner that made his brothers laugh  sam wants to be near grace said tom  well dont you want to be near nellie retorted the youngest rover  of course i do and i reckon dick wont be angry at being where he can occasionally see dora went on the funloving rover with a sly wink of course its nice enough to write letters and send boxes of chocolates by mail but its a good deal better to take a stroll in the moonlight and hold hands eh dick  is that what you do asked dick but his face grew very red as he spoke  never in the wide wide world cried tom  i leave that for my sentimental brothers big and little  who is sentimental exclaimed sam maybe i dont remember you and nellie on the deck of the steam yacht that moonlight night  aw cut it out muttered tom he turned to his father who had been called from the room for a moment if you think brill college a good one dad it will suit me  and it will suit me too added sam  i mentioned brill for two reasons explained mr rover the one was because it is near hope seminary and the other is because i happen to know the president dr john wallington quite well in fact we went to school together he is a fine gentlemanas fine a fellow as captain putnamand i am sure his college must be a good one  if its as good as dear old putnam hall i shall be well content answered dick  then you are satisfied to go there dick  yes sir  so it was settled and arrangements were at once made for the three boys to go to brill fortunately it was found that their diplomas from putnam hall would admit them to the freshmen class without examination all of the boys wrote letters to the girls and received answers in return  the college was to open two weeks before the seminary so that to journey to ashton together would be out of the question  well well see the girls later anyway said dick i hope they like it at hope and we like it at brill then well have some splendid times together  right you are answered sam and tom said the same  at last came the day for the boys to leave home trunks and dresssuit cases were packed and not only their father but also their uncle randolph and their aunt martha went to the depot to see them off  now be good and take care of yourselves said mr rover on parting  learn all you can added uncle randolph remember that knowledge is better than wealth  oh im going to cram my head full of learning this trip answered tom with a grin  take care of yourselves and dont get sick was aunt marthas warning if you do get a doctor right away and then she gave each of the boys a warm motherly kiss and a hug she thought the lads the very best in all this wide world  the train came and the boys were off after a two hours ride they had to change to the main line and got into the parlor car already mentioned then they had dinner in the diner and went back to the other car to read and to look at the scenery thus several hours slipped by when of a sudden came the jar and shock that told them something out of the ordinary had happened     chapter ii  at the sanderson house   when the rover boys reached the head of the train they found an excited crowd beginning to collect the locomotive of the express had cut into the last freight car a distance of several feet smashing a number of boxes and barrels and likewise the headlight of the engine nobody had been hurt for which everybody was thankful but the engineer of the express was very angry  why didnt you send a man back with a flag or put a torpedo on the track he demanded of the freight train conductor  did send a man back was the answer but he didnt go back far enoughhadnt time this happened only a few minutes ago  you cant expect me to stop in a hundred feet growled the engineer as a matter of fact he had not stopped in many times that distance  well i did what i could grumbled the freight conductor  by making inquiries the rover boys learned that the freight train had jumped a frog at a switch and part of the cars were on one track and part on another two trucks were broken and nobody could tell how long it would take to clear the track upon which the express stood  may be an hour but more likely it will be six or eight said one of the brakemen to tom this section of the road is the worst managed of the lot  and how far is it to ashton asked dick  about twelve miles by the railroad  then walking is out of the question came from sam i shouldnt mind hoofing it if it was two or three  the railroad has to run around the hill yonder went on the train hand if you go up the tracks for a quarter of a mile youll come to a country road that will take you right into ashton and the distance from there isnt more than seven or eight miles  any houses on that road asked tom  of coursefarmhouses all along  then come on went on tom to his brothers we can hire a carriage to take us to ashton and to the college some farmer will be glad of the chance to earn the money  let us wait and see if the train moves first answered dick  she wont move just yet answered the brakeman with a sickly grin  the boys stood around for a quarter of an hour and then decided to walk up to the country road that had been mentioned their trunks were checked through but they had their dresssuit cases with them  well have to carry these said sam dolefully  let us see if we cant check them returned his big brother but this was impossible for the baggage car was locked and they could not find the man who had charge of it  oh well come on said tom the cases are not so heavy and it is a fine day for walking and off he started and his brothers followed him  it was certainly a fine day as tom said it was early september clear and cool with a faint breeze blowing from the west on the way they passed an apple orchard laden with fruit and they stopped long enough to get some  i declare this is better than sitting in that stuffy car remarked sam as he munched on an apple i am glad to stretch my legs  if we dont have to stretch them too long remarked dick  say i wonder if well pass anywhere near hope seminary cried tom it may be on this road  what of it returned his younger brother the girls are not here yetwont be for two weeks  oh we might get a view of the place anyway sam  i want to see brill first came from dick if that doesnt suit us he ended with a sigh  oh it will suit you can bet on it cried sam father wouldnt send us there if he wasnt sure it would be ok hes as much interested as we are  walking along the highway which ran down to a little milk station on the railroad the three boys soon discovered a farmhouse nestling between some trees and bushes they threw their baggage on the grass and walked up to the front door  they had to knock several times before their summons was answered then an old lady opened the door several inches and peeped out  what do you want she demanded in a cracked voice  good afternoon said dick politely can we hire somebody to drive us to ashton we were on the train but there has been a smashup and we  land sakes alive a smashup did you say cried the old lady  yes madam  was my son jimmie killed  nobody was killed or even hurt  sure of that my son jimmie went to crawford yesterday an was coming back this afternoon sure he wasnt on that train  if he was he wasnt hurt answered dick can we hire a carriage to take us to ashton  how did it happenthat accident  the express ran into the end of a freight train  land sakes alive the freight maybe it was the one we sent the cows away on was there any cows killed do you know  i dont think so  well tell me the particulars will you i dont go out much an so i dont hear nuthin but an accident aint it awful but i always said it was risky to ride on the railroad i told jimmie so a hundred times but he would go to crawford an now maybe hes a corpse you are sure you didnt see a tall thin young man with a wart on his chin that was cut up  what do you mean the wart or the young man asked tom who was bound to have his fun  why the young man o course although i allow if he was cut up the wart would be too poor boy i warned him a hundred  can we hire a carriage here or not demanded dick the talk was growing a little tiresome to him  no you cant snapped the old lady we never hire out our carriage if we did it would soon go to pieces  is there anybody who can drive us to brill college well pay for the service of course  no but you might get a carriage over to the sanderson place  where is that asked sam  up the road a piece and the old lady motioned with her head as she spoke but now if my son jimmie was in that accident  good day madam said dick and walked away and sam and tom did the same the old lady continued to call after them but they paid no attention  poor jimmie if he isnt killed in a railroad accident hell be talked to death some day was sams comment  dont you care we know that jimmies got a wart anyway observed tom and he said this so dryly his brothers had to laugh always add to your fund of knowledge when you can he added in imitation of his uncle randolph  i hope we have better success at the next farmhouse said sam i dont know that i want to walk all the way to ashton with this dresssuit case  oh were bound to find some kind of a rig at one place or another said dick all the folks cant be like that old woman  they walked along the road until they came in sight of a second farmhouse also set in among trees and bushes a neat gravel path lined with rose bushes ran from the gate to the front piazza  this looks nice observed sam some folks of the better sort must live here  the three boys walked up to the front piazza and set down their baggage on the door casing was an electric push button  no oldfashioned knocker here observed dick as he gave the button a push  well we are not wanting electric push buttons said tom an electric runabout or a good twoseat carriage will fill our bill  the boys waited for fully a minute and then as nobody came to answer their summons dick pushed the button again  i dont hear it said sam perhaps it doesnt ring  probably it rings in the back of the house answered his big brother  again the boys waited and while they did so all heard talking at a distance  somebody in the kitchen i guess said tom maybe we had better go around there some country folks dont use their front doors excepting for funerals and when the minister comes  leaving their dresssuit cases on the piazza the rover boys walked around the side of the farmhouse in the direction of the kitchen the building was a low and rambling one and they had to pass a sittingroom here they found a window wide open to let in the fresh air and sunshine  now you must go really you must they heard in a girls voice i havent done a thing this afternoon and what will papa say when he gets back  oh thats all right minnie was the answer in masculine tones you like us to be here you know you do and remember we havent seen you in a long time  yes i know mr flockley but  oh dont call me mr flockley call me dudd  yes and please dont call me mr koswell broke in another masculine voice jerry is good enough for me every time  but you must go now you really must said the girl  well go if youll say goodby in the right kind of a way eh dudd said the person called jerry koswell  yes minnie but we wont go until you do that answered the young man named dudd flockley  whawhat do you mean faltered the girl and now looking through the sittingroom window and through a doorway leading to the kitchen the rover boys saw a pretty damsel of sixteen standing by a pantry door facing two dudish young men of eighteen or twenty the young men wore checkered suits and sported heavy watch fobs and diamond rings and scarfpins  why youll give us each a nice kiss wont you said dudd flockley with a smile that was meant to be alluring  of course minnie will give us a kiss said jerry koswell next saturday im coming over to give you a carriage ride  i dont wish any carriage ride answered the girl coldly her face had gone white at the mention of kisses  well lets have the kisses anyway cried dudd flockley and stepping forward he caught the girl by one hand while jerry koswell grasped her by the other  oh please let me go cried the girl please do oh mr flockley mr koswell dontdontplease  now be nice about it growled dudd flockley  it wont hurt you a bit added jerry koswell  i want you to let me go cried the girl  i will as soon as began dudd flockley and then he gave a sudden roar of pain as he found himself caught by the ear then a hand caught him by the arm and he was whirled around and sent into a corner with a crash at the same time jerry koswell was tackled and sent down in a heap in another corner the girl thus suddenly released stared at the newcomers in astonishment and then sank down on a chair too much overcome to move or speak     chapter iii  like knights of old   the rover boys had acted on the impulse of the moment they had seen that the girl wanted the two dudish young men to leave her alone and stepping into the kitchen dick had tackled dudd flockley while tom and sam had given their attention to jerry koswell  you cowards cried dick confronting flockley why cant you leave a young lady alone when she tells you to  they ought to be kicked out of the house added tom  youyou spluttered dudd flockley he did not know what to say he gathered himself up hastily and jerry koswell followed who are you he demanded facing dick with clenched fists  never mind who i am was the reply of the oldest rover arent you ashamed of yourself  this is none of your affair came from koswell  well we made it our affair answered tom he turned to the girl i hope we did right he added hastily  whyeryes i think so faltered the girl she was still very white and trembling butbut i hope you didnt hurt them  see here minnie are you going to stand for this growled dudd flockley it aint fair were old friends and  you had no right to touch me mr flockley answered the girl i told you to let me go ii thought you were aagentleman and now the tears began to show in minnie sandersons eyes  i am a gentleman  you didnt act like one  oh come dont get prudish minnie put in jerry koswell we didnt mean any harm we  i want you to leave this house said the girl with a sudden show of spirit you had no warrant to act as you did itit waswas shameful leave at once and she stamped her small foot on the floor her anger was beginning to show itself and her face lost its whiteness and became crimson  well leave when we please muttered dudd flockley  so we will added jerry koswell  on the instant dick looked at his brothers and the three advanced on the two dudishlooking young men  you do as the young lady says said dick in a cold hard voice i dont know you but you are not wanted here and that is enough go and he pointed to the door  see here blustered flockley but he got no further for dick suddenly wheeled him around and gave him a shove that sent him through the doorway and off the back porch  now the other fellow said the oldest rover but before tom and sam could touch jerry koswell that individual ducked and ran after flockley then both young men stood at a safe distance  well fix you for this roared flockley we dont know who you are but well find out and  maybe you want a thrashing right now came from tom impulsively im in fighting trim if you want to know it and he stepped out of the house with sam at his heels dick followed at this hostile movement flockley and koswell turned and walked hurriedly out of the garden and down the country road a row of trees soon hiding them from view  they are as mad as hornets observed sam if they belong anywhere near ashton well have to look out for them  right you are answered tom but i am not particularly afraid  having watched the two young men out of sight the three rover boys returned to the farmhouse minnie sanderson had now recovered somewhat and she blushed deeply as she faced them  oh wasnt it awful she said ii dont know what you think of it they had no right to touch me i thought they were gentlemen they have called here several times but they never acted that way before  then we came in the nick of time answered dick will you allow me to introduce myself and he bowed my name is dick rover and this is my brother tom and this my brother sam you are miss sanderson i suppose  yes minnie sanderson  we are strangers here we were on the train but there was a little accident and we were in a hurry to get to ashton so we got off and walked up this road thinking we could hire somebody to drive us to brill college  oh do you go to brill and the girls eyes opened widely  we dont go yet but we are going  thenthen youll meet mr flockley and mr koswell again  what are they students there cried tom  yes this is their second year i believe i know they were there last spring for they called here  sam gave a low whistle  we are making friends first clip arent we he murmured to his brothers  the boys related a few of the particulars of the accident and their experience at the farmhouse near the railroad  oh thats old mrs craven cried minnie sanderson she would talk you out of your senses if youd let her but about a carriage i dont know if papa was here  at that moment came the sound of carriage wheels on the gravel path near the barn  there is papa now cried minnie sanderson you can talk to him i guess hell take you to the college quick enough  how did those two young fellows get here asked sam  i dont know and pleasethat isyou wont say anything to my father about that will you it would make him very angry and i dont know what hed do  well not say a word if you wish it that way answered dick  i dont think theyll bother me again after the way you treated them added the girl  she led them toward the barn and introduced her father a fat and jolly farmer of perhaps fifty mr sanderson had been off on a short drive with one horse and he readily agreed to take them to brill college for two dollars  just wait till i put in a fresh team he said then ill get you over to the college in less than an hour and a quarter  while he was hooking up he explained that he had been to a nearby village for a dry battery for the electric doorbell  we dont use the bell much but i hate to have it out of order he explained  thats why it didnt ring said sam to his brothers  the carriage was soon ready and the three dresssuit cases were piled in the rear then the boys got in and mr sanderson followed  goodby called the boys to minnie sanderson  goodby she returned sweetly and waved her hand  maybe well get down this way again some day said dick  if you do stop in returned the girl  the farmers team was a good one and they trotted out of the yard and into the road in fine shape dick was beside the driver and his brothers were in the rear the carriage left a cloud of dust behind as it bowled along over the dry country road  first year at brill inquired mr sanderson on the way  yes answered dick  fine placeno better in the world so ive heard some folks sayand they had been to some of the big colleges too  yes weve heard it was all right said tom by the way where is hope seminary  about two miles this side of brill  then well pass it eh came from sam  well not exactly its up a bit on a side road but you can see the buildingsvery nice tooalthough not so big as those up to brill ill point em out to you when we get there  do you know any of the fellows at brill questioned tom nudging sam in the ribs as he spoke  a few minnie met some of em at the baseball and football games and once in a while one of em stops at our house but we are most too far away to see much of em  presently the carriage passed through a small village which the boys were told was called rushville  i dont know why they call it that said mr sanderson with a chuckle aint no rushes growing around here and there aint no rush either its as dead as a salted mackerel and he chuckled again but theres one thing here worth knowing about he added suddenly  whats that asked dick  the jamison placeits haunted  haunted cried tom what a house  yes a big oldfashioned house set in a lot of trees it aint been occupied for years and the folks say its haunted and nobody goes near it  well have to inspect it some day said sam promptly  whatyou cried the fat farmer  sure  aint you scared  no answered the youngest rover i dont believe in ghosts  well they say its worth a mans life to go in that house especially after dark  i think id risk it  so would i added tom  well pay the haunted house a visit some day when there is no session at the college said dick it will give us something to do  hum mused the farmer well if you do it youve got backbone thats all ive got to say the folks around here wont go near that jamison place nohow  the road now became hilly with many twists and turns and the farmer had to give his entire attention to his team the carriage bounced up and down and once sam came close to being pitched out  say this is fierce he cried how much more of it  not moren a quarter of a mile answered mr sanderson it is kinder rough aint it the roadmaster ought to have it fixed some of the bumps is pretty bad  there was one more small hill to cross and then they came to a level stretch here the horses made good time and the farmer let them out in a fashion that pleased the boys very much  a fine team and no mistake said dick and this pleased mr sanderson very much for he was proud of but two thingshis daughter minnie and his horses  there is hope seminary said mr sanderson presently and pointed to a group of buildings set in among some large trees thats a good school ive been thinking of sending my daughter there only its a pretty long drive and i need her at home you see he explained minnie keeps house for mehas ever since my wife died three years ago  the boys gazed at the distant seminary buildings with interest and as they did so dick thought of dora stanhope and tom and sam remembered the lanings all thought how jolly it would be to live so close together during the college term  now weve got only two miles more said mr sanderson as he set his team on a trot again ill land you at brill inside of fifteen minutes even if the road aint none of the best  the country road ran directly into the town of ashton but there was a short cut to the college and they turned into this soon the lads caught sight of the pile of buildings in the distance they were set in a sort of park with the road running in front and a river in the rear out on the grounds and down by the stream the rover boys saw a number of students walking around and standing in groups talking  with a crack of his whip mr sanderson whirled from the road into the grounds and drove up to the steps of the main building  this is the place where new students report he said with a smile ill take your grips over to the dormitory  thank you mr sanderson said dick and here are your two dollars and he handed the money over  while dick was paying the farmer sam turned to the back of the carriage to look at the dresssuit cases he gave an exclamation  whats the matter asked tom  didnt you have a suit case tom  certainly  well its gone     chapter iv  what happened at the campus fence   gone  yes gone are you sure you put it in the carriage  positive was toms answer i put it on top of yours and dicks  then it must have jounced out somewhere on the road  whats up asked dick catching a little of the talk  toms case is gone he put it on top of ours and i suppose coming over that rough road jounced it out  one of the satchels gone eh came from mr sanderson sure you put it in  yes i am positive  too bad reckon id better go back at once and pick it up  ill go with you said tom  the matter was talked over for a minute and then tom and the farmer reëntered the carriage and drove off as they did this a man came out to meet dick and sam  new students he asked shortly  yes replied dick  please step this way  the doorman led them along a broad hall and into a large office here they signed a register and were then introduced by an under teacher to dr wallington a grayhaired man of sixty tall and thin with a scholarly aspect the president of brill shook hands cordially  i feel that i know you young gentlemen he said your father and i were old school chums i hope you like it here and that your coming will do you much good  thank you i hope so too answered dick and sam said about the same the two boys felt at once that the doctor would prove their friend so long as they conducted themselves properly but they also felt that the aged president of brill would stand for no nonsense  having been questioned by the doctor and one of the teachers the boys were placed in charge of the house master who said he would show them to their rooms in the dormitory dick had already explained the absence of tom  your father wrote that you would prefer to room together said the house master but that will be impossible since our rooms accommodate but two students each we have assigned samuel and thomas to room no 25 and richard to room no 26 next door  and who will i have with me asked dick with interest he did not much fancy having a stranger  well we were going to place a boy with you named stanley browne a very fine lad but day before yesterday we received a new application and the applicant said he desired very much to be put with the rovers so he can go with you if you wish it  who was the applicant asked dick quickly  john a powell he said he was an old school chum of yours at putnam hall and had been on a treasure hunt with you during the past summer  songbird cried dick and his face broke out in a smile oh thats good news it suits me perfectly  did you call the young man songbird queried the house master  yes thats his nickname  then he must be a singer  no he composes poetryor at least verses that he calls poetry answered the eldest rover  i wish some more of the old putnam hall crowd were coming put in sam think of having hans mueller here and the very idea made him grin  hans isnt fit for college yet sam but there may be others added dick hopefully  they soon reached the dormitory located across the campus from the main building and followed the house master upstairs and to rooms no 25 and 26 each was bright clean and cheerful with big windows looking to the southward each contained two clothes closets two beds two bookshelves a bureau a reading table two plain chairs and a rocker the walls were bare but the boys were told they could hang up what they pleased so long as they did not mar the plaster  the lavatories are at the end of the hall said the house master and the trunk room is there too have you had the trunks sent up yet  no sir answered dick  then let me have your checks and i will attend to it i see the man has already brought up your suit cases i hope your brother has no trouble in recovering the one that was lost  when is john powell coming asked dick  tomorrow so he telegraphed  the house master left dick and sam and the two boys looked over the rooms and put some of the things from their suit cases in the closets and in the bureaus then they walked down to one of the lavatories and washed and brushed up everything was so new and strange to them that they did not feel at all at home  it will take a few days to get used to it i suppose said sam with a trace of a sigh i know i felt the same way when first i went to putnam hall  let us go down and take a look around and watch for tom replied his brother say but im glad songbird is coming he added i dont care much for his doggerel but johns a good fellow just the same  none better replied sam heartily and his poetry isnt so very bad always  the two brothers went below and strolled around they found the main building formed the letter t with the top to the front in this were the offices and the classroom and also the private apartments of the president and his family and some of the faculty to the east of the main building was a long onestory structure containing a library and a laboratory and to the west the threestory dormitory the lads had just left somewhat to the rear was another dormitory and beside it a large gymnasium with a swimming pool attached a short distance away was a house for the hired help and a stable and carriage sheds down by the river was a boathouse not unlike that at putnam hall but larger  this is a fine layout and no mistake observed dick with satisfaction  did you see that fine athletic field beyond the campus returned sam that means baseball and football galore  having walked around the outside of the various buildings the rover boys made their way to the highway to watch for the coming of tom hardly had they reached the road when they saw a crowd of six students approaching among the number were dudd flockley and jerry koswell  see those two dick whispered sam wont they be mad when they see us here  well i dont care answered dick coolly if they say anything let me do the talking and thus speaking dick sat down on the top of a stone fence and his brother hopped up beside him  the six students came closer and of a sudden dudd flockley espied the rovers he stopped short and pulled his crony by the arm and jerry koswell likewise stared at dick and sam  you here demanded flockley coming closer and scowling at the youths on the fence  we are answered dick briefly  freshmen  yes  humph and flockley put as much of a sneer as possible in the exclamation  how did you get here asked koswell  got a carriage at the sanderson place answered sam with a grin  you did cried flockley say youre a fresh lot arent you he went on glaring at dick and sam wheres the third chap  none of your business answered dick sharply  dont you talk to me like that cried dudd flockley and then his face took on a look of cunning freshmen eh then you dont know what we are we are sophs and we want you to answer us decently  thats the talk cried koswell boys these are freshmen and on the fence too we cant allow this can we  no freshies allowed on that fence answered another boy of the crowd off you go and quick  as he spoke he approached sam and tried to catch him by the foot to pull him off sam drew in his foot and then sent it forth so suddenly that it took the sophomore in the stomach and sent him reeling to the grass  at them yelled flockley show them how they must behave sophs to the front  wait the command came from dick and he spoke so clearly and firmly that all the sophomores paused is this an affair between flockley and koswell and ourselves or is it simply two freshmen against six sophs  whyerhave flockley and koswell anything against you two demanded one of the boys curiously  i think so answered dick we had the pleasure of knocking them both down a few hours ago as it was a private affair we wont go into details  didnt do it because you were freshmen asked another lad  not at all we were total strangers when the thing occurred  yes but came from another sophomore  sorry i cant explain flockley and koswell can if they wish but i advise them to keep a certain partys name out of the story added dick significantly he felt bound to protect minnie sanderson as much as possible  its all stuff and nonsense roared dudd flockley they are freshies and ought to be bounced off the fence and given a lesson in the bargain  thats itcome and hammer em added jerry koswell  whats the row here demanded a tall lad who had just come up he had light curly hair blue eyes and a face that was sunshine itself  two freshies on the stone fence holden said one of the sophomores we cant allow that you know  at this frank holden the leader of the sophomore class laughed  too bad fellows but theyve got you term doesnt begin until tomorrow and they can sit where they please until twelve oclock midnight after thathe turned to dick and samwell your blood will be on your own heads if you disturb this fence or the benches around the flagstaff  my gracious franks right term isnt on until tomorrow cried another student i beg your pardon boys and he bowed lowly to the rovers  gee its a wonder you fellows wouldnt say something before i was kicked off the earth growled the sophomore who had been sent to the grass by sam  dont thank me for what i did said sam pleasantly and this caused some of the other college fellows to grin  dont say a word cried the one who had gone down onlywell if i catch you on the fence it will be whos best man thats all  arent we to do anything to these freshies demanded dudd flockley he did not at all relish the turn affairs had taken  cant do a thing until tomorrow answered frank holden decidedly  bah i believe in making a freshie toe the mark as soon as he arrives  so do i added jerry koswell  cant be doneagainst the traditions of brill answered the class leader youve got to give a freshman time to get his feet planted on the ground you know he added kindly and with a smile at dick and sam  thank you for that answered the older rover well be ready for the whole sophomore class by tomorrow  well see answered holden and passed on and the majority of the secondyear fellows followed flockley and koswell lingered behind  see here you chaps said flockley what are your names  if you want to know so bad my name is dick rover and this is my brother sam  and who was the other fellow asked koswell  my brother tom  three brothers eh and named rover growled dudd flockley all right ill remember that and ill remember how you treated us up to the sanderson place  and ill remember it too and square up added koswell  well make brill too hot to hold you snapped flockley and then he turned into the gateway leading to the campus and his crony followed     chapter v  getting acquainted   dick we have made two enemies thats sure remarked sam to his brother as they watched flockley and koswell depart  it couldnt be helped if we have sam was the reply you are not sorry for what we did at the sanderson house are you  not in the least what we should have done was to give those chaps a sound thrashing  they seem to have a number of friends here probably they will do all they can to make life at this college miserable for us  well if they do too much i reckon we can do something too  some new students had been standing at a distance watching the scene described in the last chapter now one of them approached and nodded pleasantly  freshmen he asked  yes answered both of the rovers  so am i my name is stanley browne whats yours  dick rover and this is my brother sam  oh are you dick rover ive heard about you my cousin knows you real well  who is your cousin  larry colby  larry cried dick well i guess he does know us well weve had some great times together at putnam hall and elsewhere so you are larrys cousin i am real glad to know you and dick held out his hand  larry is one of our best chums said sam also shaking hands i remember now that he has spoken of you i am glad to know somebody at this place and sam smiled broadly soon all three of the boys were on good terms and stanley browne told the rovers something about himself  i come from the south he said my folks own a large cotton plantation there larry was down there once and we had a lot of fun he told me of the sport he had had with you you must have had great times at putnam hall  we did said sam  i thought there were three of you from what larry said  so there are answered dick and told about tom and the missing dresssuit case tom ought to be getting back he added  stanley had been at brill for two days and had met both flockley and koswell he did not fancy either of the sophomores  that frank holden is all right he said but flockley and koswell are very overbearing and dictatorial i caught them ordering one of the freshmen around like a servant if they had spoken that way to me id have knocked them down and the eyes of the southern lad flashed darkly  where do you room asked dick he remembered what the house master had said about stanley and felt that the youth would make a nice roommate for anybody  im in no 27 right next to you fellows mr hicks was going to put me in with you first but afterward said a friend of yours was going to fill the place  yes said dick but you will be right next door so it will be almost the same thing who is your roommate  a fellow named max spangler i dont know much about him as he only came this noon but he seems all right here he comes now  as stanley spoke he motioned to a short stout lad who was walking across the campus the boy had a distinctly german face and one full of smiles  hello friend browne he called out pleasantly and with a german accent did you find somebody you know  ive made myself known answered stanley and then he introduced the others they bunk next door to us he added with a nod toward dick and sam  hope you dont snore said max spangler i can go anybody but what snores  no we dont snore answered sam laughing  then im your friend for life and two days afterward answered the germanamerican lad and said this so gravely the others had to laugh max put the rovers in mind of their old friend hans mueller but he spoke much better english than did hans getting his words twisted only when he was excited  dick suggested that they all walk down the road to meet tom and this was done the conversation was a lively one stanley and max telling of their former schooldays and the rovers relating a few of their own adventures thus the four got to be quite friendly by the time the carriage with tom and mr sanderson came in sight  find it sang out sam to his brother  no was toms reply  you didnt cried dick how far back did you go  way back to rushville i know it was in the carriage at that place for i saw it  too bad said sam did you have much of value in it  not a great deal most of my stuff is in my trunk but the case alone was worth six dollars and it had my comb and brush and toothbrush and all those things in it  want me any more asked mr sanderson if you dont ill get home its past milking time now  no ill not need you answered tom and hopped to the ground a minute later the farmer turned his team around and was gone in a cloud of dust  tom was introduced to stanley and max and the whole crowd walked slowly back to the college grounds then tom was taken to his room the others going upstairs with him he washed and brushed up went to the office and registered and then the bell rang for supper  the dining hall at brill was a more elaborate affair than the messroom at putnam hall but the rovers were used to dining out in fine places so they felt perfectly at home dick and sam had already met the instructor who had charge of their table mr timothy blackie and they introduced tom stanley and max were at the same table and also a longhaired youth named will jackson although his friends called him spud  i dont know why they call me spud he said to dick excepting because i like potatoes so id rather eat them than any other vegetable why when i was out in jersey one summer on a farm i ate potatoes morning noon and night and sometimes between times the farmer said i had better look out or id sprout i guess i ate about steen bushels in three weeks  phew whistled sam thats a good one  oh its a fact went on spud why one night i got up in my sleep and they found me down in the potato bin filling my coat pockets with potatoes and  filling your coat pocket queried stanley do you sleep with your coat on  why ieri guess i did that night answered will jackson in some confusion anyway im a great potato eater he added lightly later on the others found out that spud had a vivid imagination and did not hesitate to draw the long bow for the sake of telling a good story  the meal was rather a stiff and quiet one among the new students but the old scholars made the room hum with talk about what had happened at the previous term there was a good bit of conversation concerning the last season of baseball and more about the coming work on the gridiron from the talk the rovers gathered that brill belonged to something of a league composed of several colleges situated in that territory and that they had held the football championship four and three seasons before but had lost it to one of the colleges the next season and to another college the season just past  football hits me said dick to stanley id like to play firstrate  maybe youll get a chance on the eleven although i suppose they give the older students the preference was the reply  stanley had met quite a few of the other students and after supper he introduced the rovers and max and also spud thus the rovers were speedily put on friendly terms with a score or more of the freshmen and also several of the others one of the seniors a refined young man named allan charter took the crowd through the library and the laboratory and also down to the gymnasium and the boathouse  we havent any boat races for we have no other college to race against said the senior the students sometimes get up contests between themselves though dick dawson used to be our best oarsman but last june a fellow named jerry koswell beat him  koswell cried sam i thought he was too much of a dude to row in a race  at this remark the senior smiled faintly  evidently you have met mr koswell he remarked pointedly  we have answered tom  well he can row if he cant do anything else  id like to try my skill against him some day said tom who during the past year had taken quite a fancy to rowing  perhaps koswell will be glad to let you have the chance said allan charter  a little later the senior left the freshmen and the latter strolled back in the direction of the college buildings it was now growing dark and the rovers concluded to go up to their rooms and unpack their trunks which had just come in from the depot  you fellows want to keep your eyes wide open tonight cautioned stanley who came up with them  hazing asked dick  so i was told  will they start in so early asked sam  any time after midnight i hate to think of it but i reckon a fellow has got to submit  that depends answered dick ill not stand for everything ill not mind a little hazing but it mustnt be carried too far  thats the talk cried tom if they go too farwell well try to give em as good as they send thats all  right you are came from sam  they unpacked their trunks and proceeded to make themselves at home as much as possible as dick was alone in his room he went over to his brothers apartment for company locking his door as he did so  ill tell you what id do if i were you dick said tom stay here tonight my bed is big enough for two on a pinch then if there is any hazing we can keep together tomorrow if songbird comes it will be different  this suited the oldest rover and he brought over such things as he needed for the night the boys were tired out having put in a busy day and by ten oclock sam and tom were both yawning  i think ill go to bed said sam if anything happens wake me up  oh youll wake up fast enough if they come answered tom but i am going to lay down myself but i am not going to undress yet  taking off their shoes and collars ties and coats the boys said their prayers and laid down sam was soon in the land of dreams and presently tom and dick followed  two hours passed and the three lads were sleeping soundly when suddenly tom awoke with a yell a stream of cold water had struck him in the head making him imagine for the instant that he was being drowned  hi stop he spluttered and then stopped for the stream of water took him directly in the mouth then the stream was shifted and struck first dick and then sam all three of the rovers leaped from the beds as quickly as possible although confused from being awakened so rudely they realized what it meant  they were being hazed     chapter vi  a hazing and what followed   the stream of water came from a small hose that was being played through a transom window over the door of the room a lad was holding the hose and in the dim light dick recognized the face of a youth named bart larkspur a sophomore who did not bear a very good reputation larkspur was poor and dick had heard that he was used by flockley koswell and others to do all sorts of odd jobs for which the richer lads paid him well  stop that you cried the oldest rover and then rushing to the door he flung it open and gave a shove to what was beyond this was a short stepladder upon which larkspur and several others were standing and over the ladder went with a crash sending the hazers to the floor of the hallway in a heap  get the hose whispered tom who had followed his brother and while the sophomores were endeavoring to get up he caught the squirming hose and wrenched it nozzle and all from bart larkspurs hand  hi give me that yelled larkspur  all right here you are answered tom merrily and turned the stream of water directly in the sophomores face larkspur spluttered and shied and then plunged to one side into a fellow student standing near this was dudd flockley and he was carried down on his back  play away six called out tom in true fireman style and directed the stream on flockley it hit the dudish student in the chin and ran down inside his shirt collar  stop i beg of you oh my screamed flockley trying to dodge the water larkspur grab the hose knock that rascal down why dont somebody do something  give me that hose you freshie called out jerry koswell who was in the crowd dont you know better than to resist your superiors i want you to understand  keep cool old man dont get excited answered tom brazenly ah i see you are too warm will that serve to keep your temperature down and now he turned the hose on koswell hitting the fellow directly in the left ear koswell let out a wild yell and started to retreat and so did several others  dont go capture the hose called out flockley but even as he spoke he took good care to get behind another sophomore  capture it yourself growled the youth he was using as a shield  say youre making too much noise whispered another student do you want the proctor down on us and turn that water off before you ruin the building somebody has got to pay for this remember he added  as it was an unwritten law of brill that all hazers must pay for any damage done to college property while hazing anybody one of the sophomores started for the lavatory where the hose had been attached to a water faucet but while the water still ran tom aided by dick and sam directed the stream on the sophomores who were forced to retreat down the hallway  now rush em rush em yelled flockley when the water had ceased to run bind and gag em and take em down to the gym we can finish hazing em there  get into the room whispered dick hurry up and barricade the door  right you are but no more hose water for me answered tom and pulled on the rubber with all his might it parted about half way down the hallway and into the room he darted with the piece in his hands then sam and dick closed the door locked it and shoved a bed and the table against the barrier they also turned the button of the transom window so that the glass could not be swung back as before  now they cant get in unless they break in said dick grimly and i doubt if theyll dare to do that  say maybe im not wet remarked sam surveying his dripping shirt  never mind we sent as good as we got and more answered tom with a grin let us put on our coats so we dont catch cold no use of putting on dry clothing until you are sure the ball is over  tom youre a crack fireman said dick with a smile ill wager those sophs are mad enough to chew nails  whats sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander quoted the funloving rover whats the good of living if you cant return a compliment now and then  for several minutes all was silent outside then came a light knock on the door dick held his hand up for silence and the knock was repeated  dont answer them whispered the oldest rover  say i want to talk to you fellows came in low tones this is important  who are you asked dick after a pause  im larkspurbart larkspur i want to tell you something  well what is it demanded tom  your resistance to our class wont do you any good if youll come out and take your medicine like men all right but if you resist it will go that much harder with you  who sent youfrank holden asked sam  what has holden to do with it growled larkspur  we know hes the leader of your class  he is not dudd flockley is our leader  then flockley sent you eh put in dick  yes if you want to know it  well tell flockley to mind his own business answered dick sharply if frank holden wants us well come but not otherwise  are you hazing any of the other fellows asked tom  well haze them after we get through with you growled larkspur and then the rovers heard him tiptoe his way down the hall  i think this attack was gotten up by the flockleykoswell crowd was dicks comment maybe it wasnt sanctioned by the other sophs at all  the rovers waited a while longer and then with caution they pulled back the bed and the table and opened the door by the dim light in the hallway they saw that the place was deserted somebody had run a mop over the polished floor thus taking up most of the water  i guess they have given it up for tonight said dick and his words proved correct  after waiting a good hour the three rovers rearranged the room hanging up some of the bedding and rugs to dry near the window which they left wide open then they locked the door and went into dicks room which had not been disturbed as they did this another door opened and stanley poked out his head followed by max  we heard it all said the southern lad with a chuckle hope you doused em good  we did answered tom they didnt tackle you did they  no but i suppose they will later or tomorrow  i am ready for them if they come came from max i got this and he held up a long white sack  what is it asked sam  plaster of paris if they tackle me ill make em look like marble statues already and the germanamerican youth winked one eye suggestively  despite the excitement the rover boys slept soundly for the rest of the night all were rather sleepy in the morning but a good wash in cold water brightened them greatly while getting ready for breakfast they looked for flockley and koswell but those two students as well as larkspur kept out of sight  they dont like the way matters turned out last night said dick  on entering the diningroom they saw the sophomores at a nearby table flockley and koswell glared darkly while as they passed larkspur put out his foot to trip sam up but sam was on guard and instead of stumbling he stepped on the fellows ankle something that caused larkspur to utter a gasp of pain  what did you do that for he demanded savagely  sorry but you shouldnt sprawl all over with your feet answered the youngest rover coldly and passed on to his seat when he looked back larkspur watching his chance so that no teacher might see him shook his fist at sam  we have got to keep our eyes wide open for that bunch was dicks comment last nights affair will make flockley and koswell more sour than ever and larkspur is evidently their tool and willing to do anything they wish done  after chapel the rovers were assigned to their various classes and given their textbooks it was announced that no regular classes would be called until the following monday morning  that gives us plenty of time to study our first lessons said sam  yes and gives us time to get acquainted with the college layout and the rest of the students added tom do you know i think i am going to like it bangup here  just what i was thinking returned dick it isnt quite so boyish as putnam hall wassome of the seniors are young menbut that doesnt matter we are growing older ourselves  gracious im not old cried tom why i feel like a twoyearold colt and to prove his words he did several steps of a jig  only about half of the students had as yet arrived the others being expected that day friday and saturday the college coach was to bring in some of the boys about eleven oclock and the rovers wondered if songbird powell would be among them  youll like songbird said dick to stanley browne hes a great chap for manufacturing what he calls poetry but he isnt one of the dreamy kindhes as bright and chipper as you find em  the boys walked down to the gymnasium and there sam and tom took a few turns on the bars and tried the wooden horses while they did this dick talked to a number of the freshmen with whom he had become acquainted  we are to have a necktie rush monday said one boy every fellow is to wear the college colors meet on the campus an hour before supper time  ill be there said dick he knew what was meant by a necktie rush all the freshmen would don neckties showing the college colors and the sophomores and perhaps the juniors would do their best to get the neckties away from them if more than half the boys lost their ties before the supper bell rang the freshmen would be debarred from wearing the colors for that term  shortly before eleven oclock a shout was heard on the road and a number of the students made a rush in that direction the college coach swung into sight in a cloud of dust it was fairly overflowing with boys and young men all yelling and singing and waving their hats and caps at the sight those on the campus set up a cheer  this is something like cried tom enthusiastically he wanted to see things warm up as he expressed it  the coach was followed by three carriages and all deposited their loads at the main building steps and on the campus there were more cheers and many handshakes  there he is cried sam and rushing forward he caught john powell by the hand shook it and relieved the newcomer of his suit case  hello sam cried songbird and grinned from ear to ear hello dick hello tom say did i surprise you and now he shook hands with the others  you sure did replied dick i was afraid i was going to have a stranger for a roommate your coming here suits me to a t  i didnt write to you because i wanted to surprise you explained songbird ive composed some verses about it they start  never mind the verses now interrupted tom come on in and well introduce you to the fellows and then well listen to your story and well tell you some things that will surprise you  and ill tell you some things that will surprise you too returned john powell as he was led away by the three rover boys     chapter vii  the arrival of songbird   so youve made some enemies as well as some friends eh remarked songbird powell after he had been registered taken up to his room and had listened to what the rover boys had to tell no use of talking it doesnt take you fellows long to stir things up  you said you had a surprise for us songbird returned tom im dying by inches to know what it is  maybe its a new poem put in sam with a grimace at his brothers  ive got a poemseveral of them in fact answered songbird but i didnt have those in mind when i spoke who do you suppose i met yesterday morning in ithaca while i was waiting for the train  dora stanhope and the lanings answered tom promptly  no tad sobber  tad sobber exclaimed the rover boys in concert  songbird are you sure of it demanded dick  sure wasnt i talking to him  butbuti thought he was lost in that hurricane when the josephine was wrecked  no it seems he escaped to a vessel bound for england but his uncle sid merrick was lost and so were most of the others sobber just got back from englandcame in on one of the ocean liners so he told me  how did he act asked tom  where was he going added sam  did he seem to have any money came from dick  all of the rovers were intensely interested and showed it plainly  say one question at a time please cried songbird you put me in mind of a song i once wrote about a little boy    a little lad named johnny spark   was nothing but a question mark   he asked his questions night and day   when he was resting or at play   one minute he would tackle pa   and then hed turn and tackle ma   and then his uncle he would quiz    and let that line please end the biz  finished tom say songbird please dont quote poetry when we are waiting to hear all about tad sobber have some pity on us  yes tell us of sobber added sam and dick  all right if you dont appreciate my verses returned the wouldbe poet with a sigh well to start with tad sobber was well dressed and looked as if he had all the money he needed he wore a brown checkered suit so evidently he hasnt gone into mourning for his uncle he told me he had had a rough experience on the ocean during the hurricane and he blames you rovers for all his troubles  thats just like sobber was dicks comment  he wouldnt tell me where he was going or what he was going to do but he did let drop a remark or two about the fortune you discovered on treasure isle he said that he was firmly convinced that the money belonged to him and to his uncles estate and that he meant some day to make a fight for it  in the courts asked tom if he does that hell get beaten father says the treasure belongs to the stanhope estate and to nobody else  no he didnt say he was going to court about it but he said he was bound to get hold of it some day  i hope he doesnt try to get it by force said sam that would mean trouble for the stanhopes and the lanings  the money is in the banks now sam said dick he couldnt get hold of it excepting on an order from those to whom it belongs  and theyll never give him any such order added tom  do you suppose he was going to see the stanhopes and the lanings questioned the oldest rover anxiously  he didnt say i wanted to question him further but a man who was standing on a corner some distance away beckoned to him and he left me and joined the man and the two walked off  who was the man  i dont know  the boys talked the matter over for some time but songbird had nothing more to tell and at last the subject was dropped songbird was introduced to stanley max and a number of the other students and soon he felt quite at home  that evening there was a bit of hazing dick and tom escaped but sam songbird and stanley were caught in the lower hallway by a number of the sophomores and carried bodily to the gymnasium here they were tossed in blankets and then blindfolded  well take them to the river said one of the sophomores a bath will do them good  lets give em a rubbing down with mud cried jerry koswell he had some tar handy and if the mud was used he intended to mix some of the tar with it on the sly  thats the talk cried larkspur who knew about the tar he having purchased it for koswell and flockley the three had at first intended to smear the beds of the rovers with it but had gotten no chance  give them a good dose said dudd flockley he had joined in the blankettossing with vigor  sam songbird and stanley were being led to the river when max came rushing up to tom and dick who happened to be in the library looking over some works of travel  come on mit you he cried excitedly in broken english da have got sam and stanley and dot friend of yours alretty hurry up or da was killed before we git to help em  they who asked dick leaping up  sophsdown by der gym and then max cooled down a bit and related what he had seen  we must surely go to the rescue cried tom wait ill get clubs for all hands and he rushed up to his room where in a clothing closet lay the end of the hose he had taken away from the sophomores with his knife he cut the section of hose into eight clubs and with these in his hands he hurried below again  at a cry from dick and max the freshmen commenced to gather on the campus and tom quickly handed around the sections of hose other firstyear lads procured sticks boxing gloves and other things and looked around for somebody to lead them  come on cried dick and he sprang to the front with tom on one side and max on the other the germanamerican boy had a big squirtgun filled with water a gun used by the gardener for spraying the bushes  the sophomores had captured four more freshmen and marched all of the crowd down to the river front when the band under dick sixteen strong appeared the latter came on yelling like indians and flourishing their sections of hose and sticks and other things  let em go let em go was the rallying cry and then whack whack whack down came the rubber clubs and the sticks on the backs of the secondyear students  fight em off came from the sophomores  chase em away yelled dudd flockley but hardly had he spoken when max discharged the squirtgun and the water took flockley in the eye causing him to yell with fright and retreat then max turned the gun on larkspur soaking the latter pretty thoroughly  attacked from the rear the sophomores had to let go their holds on their victims and as soon as they were released sam songbird and the others ran to the right and the left and joined the force under dick  all told the freshmen now numbered twentythree while the sophomores could count up but fourteen the secondyear students were hemmed in and gradually forced nearer and nearer to the bank of the river  let up let up yelled several in alarm dont knock us overboard  its nothing but mud here i dont want my new suit spoiled cried one  i cant swim added another  ive got an idea whispered tom to the others near him shove em in the mud and water or else make em promise not to take part in the necktie rush  thats the talk replied dick he caught hold of the sophomore in front of him all shove fellows and the secondyear students were gradually forced to the very edge of the river at a point where there was a little water and a good deal of dark sticky mud of course they fought desperately to push the freshmen back but they were outnumbered as already told  now then every fellow who will promise not to take part in the necktie rush monday will be allowed to go free said dick loudly the others must take their ducking in the waterand mud  let me go roared dudd flockley im not going to have this suit ruined  i dont want to get these patent leathers wet cried jerry koswell who had on a new pair of shiny shoes  then promise cried sam and promise promise came from many others  without delay several of the sophomores promised and they were allowed to depart then the others began to show fight and three managed to escape among them being dudd flockley the others were forced into the water and mud up to their knees then they cried out in alarm and while two finally escaped the others also promised to keep out of the necktie contest  just wait snarled jerry koswell as he at last managed to pull himself out of the sticky mud just wait thats all his patentleather shoes were a sight to behold  not so much fun when you are hazed yourself is it asked sam coolly  well give it to em yet put in bart larkspur lots of time between now and the closing of the term and then he and koswell ran off to join dudd flockley the three went to their rooms and cleaned up as best they could and then took a walk down the road in the direction of rushville  it was that dick rover who led the attack said dudd flockley do you know what i think i think he is going to try to make himself leader of the freshies  just what i thought too answered larkspur and if thats the fact we ought to do all we can to pull him down  tom rover is the fellow i am going to get after came from jerry koswell he had not forgotten how tom and sam had sent him to the floor in the presence of minnie sanderson  the three students walked a distance of half a mile when they saw approaching them a trampishlooking man carrying what looked to be a new dresssuit case they looked at the fellow rather sharply and he halted as he came up to them  excuse me he mumbled but did any of you gents lose this case  why it must be rovers case cried flockley nearly every one in the college had heard about the missing baggage  i found it in the bushes alongside the road went on the tramp thought it might belong to some of the college gents  let me look at it said koswell and turned the case around yes its rovers he added seeing the initials and the address  better take it up to the college put in larkspur  wait ill take it up said jerry koswell suddenly this belongs to a poor chap he added to the tramp he wont be able to reward you but i will heres a quarter for you and he passed over the silver piece  much obliged said the tramp want me to carry it up to the buildings  no ill do that said koswell and then he winked at his cronies the tramp went on and the three watched him disappear in the distance  what did you do that for jerry asked flockley with interest he surmised that something new was afoot  oh i did it for the fun of the thing answered koswell coolly but maybe i can work it in somehow against that rover bunch anyway ill try     chapter viii  the colors contest   the next morning tom was much surprised to find his missing dresssuit case standing in front of his room door  hello how did this get here he cried as he picked up the baggage  whats that asked sam who was just getting up  look answered his brother and brought the case in somebody must have found it and left it here while i was asleep  very kind whoever he was said sam are the contents all right  instead of answering tom placed the suit case on a chair and started to unlock it  hello its unlocked he murmured i thought i had it locked  he shoved back the clasps and threw the case open the contents were much jumbled but he had expected this from the fact that the bag had been jounced out of the carriage  i guess the stuff is all here he said slowly turning over the clothing and other things somehow i thought i had more in the case though he added presently  dont you know what you had  welleri packed it in a hurry you know i wanted to go fishing and so i got through as soon as i could oh i guess its all right  tom was too lively a youth to pay much attention to his personal belongings often he hardly knew what suit of clothing he had on or what sort of a necktie the only times he really fixed up was when nellie laning was near why he did that only himself and possibly nellie knew  sunday passed quietly some of the boys attended one or another of the churches in ashton and the rovers went with them dudd flockley and his cronies took a walk up the river and reaching a warm sunny spot threw themselves down to smoke cigarettes and talk  well what did you do about the dresssuit case jerry asked flockley with a sharp look at his crony  returned it as you know was the answer and jerry winked suggestively  id have flung the bag in the river before i would give it to such a chap as tom rover growled larkspur  you trust me larky old boy answered jerry koswell i know what im doing  humph  i said i returned the case but i didnt say i returned all that was in it  what do you mean by that demanded flockley if youve got a secret out with it  koswell looked around to make certain that no outsider was near  i kept a few things out of the bagsome things that had tom rovers name or his initials on them  and you are going to went on flockley  i am going to use em some day when i get the chance  good cried flockley ill help you jerry  and so will i added larkspur if we work it right we can get tom rover in a peck of trouble  on monday morning the college term opened in earnest and once again the rovers had to get down to the grind as sam expressed it but the boys had had a long vacation and were in the best of health and they did not mind the studying  got to have a good education if you want to get along nowadays was the way dick expressed himself if you dont learn you are bound to be at the mercy of anybody who wants to take advantage of your ignorance  dick what are you going to do when you get out of college asked tom  i dont knowgo into business i imagine  oh hell marry and settle down chimed in sam he and dora will live in an ivycovered cottage like two turtle doves and  sam got no further for a pillow thrown by dick caught him full in the face and made him stagger  sam is thinking of what he and grace are going to do said dick and you and nellie will likely have a cottage across the way he added grinning at tom  really murmured tom and got as red as a beet say call it off he added do you know we have the necktie rush this afternoon  it wont amount to much answered sam too many sophs out of it  dont you believe it said dick remember the juniors come into this as well as the sophs  say ive thought of a plan cried tom greatest ever im going to patent it and he commenced to dance around in his excitement  whats loose asked songbird coming up at that moment followed by some others tom have you got a pain in your inwards  no an ideaits about the same thing responded tom gaily we want to get the best of the second and thirdyear fellows during the necktie rush and i think i know how we can do it well all sew our neckties fast  for a moment there was silence and then as the others caught the idea they commenced to laugh  thats it cried sam ill sew mine as tight as a drum  ill rivet mine on if that will do any good added dick  sure thing came from songbird and he commenced to recite    oh the sophs and the juniors will try   to steal from the freshies each tie       but they will not win       for well fight them like sin    and bust em right plumb in the eye finished tom oh say but will you all sew your neckties fast  sure  and well tell the rest to do so too added another freshman who was present  the news soon circulated and was kept from all but the firstyear students  it must be confessed that many of the students found it hard to fix their minds on their lessons that afternoon one boy max spangler brought on a great laugh when the following question was put to him  what great improvement in navigation did fulton introduce  neckties answered max abstractedly  neckties queried the instructor in astonishment  ieri dont mean neckties stammered the germanamerican student i mean steamboats  when the afternoon session was over the students hurried to their various rooms the sophomores and the juniors who were to take part in the contest talked matters over and as far as possible laid out a plan of action it was decided that the largest and heaviest of the second and thirdyear students were to tackle the smallest freshmen first while the others were to hold the rest of the firstyear men at bay  well get fifteen or twenty neckties first clip that way said one of the sophomores and it doesnt matter who we get them from a little chaps tie counts as much as that of a twohundred pounder  in the meantime the freshmen were busy following toms advice and sewing their ties fast to their collars shirts and even their undershirts then dick who had unconsciously almost become a leader called the boys into an empty recitationroom  now ive got a plan said he we want to bunch up and all the little fellows and lightweights get in the center the heavy fellows can take the outside and fight the others off understand  yes  thats a good idea  forward to the fray yelled stanley and woe be to him who tries to get my tie his blood be on his own head he added tragically  forward cried sam and let our watchword be die but no tie  now dont get excited said dick take it coolly and im certain that when the time is up well have the most of our ties still on  it was the custom to go out on the campus at a given time and when the chapel bell sounded out the hour dick led the freshmen forward they came out of a side door in a body and formed around the flagstaff almost before the sophomores and juniors knew they had appeared  the seniors took no part but three had been told off to act as referees and they stood around as if inspecting the buildings and the scenery the instructors who also knew what was coming wisely kept out of sight  come on and at em called out dudd flockley and this cry was quickly taken up by all the others who were to take part in the contest  hello they know a thing or two said frank holden who was the sophomore leader in the attack theyve got the little fellows in the middle  as tightly as possible the freshmen gathered around the flagstaff each wore a necktie of the college colors and it was fastened as tightly as strong thread could hold it  at em was the yell of the second and thirdyear lads tear em apart pull the ties from em  and then they leaped in at the big freshmen and on the instant a battle royal was started down went four boys on the campus rolling over and over others caught each other by the hands and shoulders and wrestled valiantly  dick and tom were in the front rank with sam directly behind them dick was caught by frank holden and the two wrestled with might and main frank was big and strong but dick managed to hold him so that all the sophomore leader could do was to get his finger tips on the soughtfor necktie  flockley tackled tom and much to his surprise was tripped up and sent flat on his back mad with sudden rage flockley scrambled up and let out a savage kick for toms stomach but tom was too quick for the sophomore and leaped to one side  foul cried tom  dont do that again called one of the seniors to dudd if you do youll be ruled out kicking and punching were prohibited by the rules all the boys could do was to wrestle and throw each other and either try to pull the neckties away or hold on to them  on and on the battle waged each minute growing hotter many of the students were almost winded and felt that they could not endure the struggle much longer dick tom and sam managed to keep their neckties although sams was torn loose by two sophomores who held him as in a vise until stanley came to his assistance when the time was half up eleven neckties had been capturedtwo of them almost torn to shreds  at em yelled frank holden we havent begun yet  hold em back was dicks rallying answer dont let em get near the little fellows  again the contest raged and this time with increased bitterness in the melee some few blows were exchanged but it must be admitted that one side was about as much to blame for this as the other three additional neckties were captured making fourteen in all as thirtyseven freshmen were in the contest the sophomores and juniors had to capture five more neckties to win  only three minutes more sang out one student looking at his watch at em rip em apart  three minutes more yelled dick hold em back and well win  the enemy fought with increased fury and one more necktie was takenthe collar and collar band coming with it but then of a sudden the chapel bell tolled out the hour  times up was the cry  and we win came from a score of freshmen in huge delight  look out look out cried several small youths in the center of the crowd  crack it was the flagstaff and all looked in that direction the pole old and decayed was falling it looked as if it would crush all who stood in its path     chapter ix    tom in trouble   look out the flagpole is coming down  stand from under or youll be killed  crack came from the pole and now many saw that it was breaking off close to the ground some of the students had clung to it during the contest and the strain had been too much for the stick which was much rotted just where it entered the ground  those on the outside of the crowd ran away with ease but not so those who were hemmed in two of the smallest of the freshmen billy dean and charley atwood could not move fast enough and one fell over the other and both went down  save me gasped one of the lads  dont let the pole come down on me screamed the other  the flagstaff was falling swiftly and dick and many others saw that it would fall directly across dean and atwood unless its progress was stayed  hold it up hold it up yelled dick hold it up or theyll be killed  he put up his hands to meet the pole which was coming down across the front of the campus tom did likewise and so did frank holden stanley brown and several others including an extra tall and powerful senior  it was a heavy weight and for the moment the boys under it thought they would have to let it go over came the pole and when it rested on the boys hands the top overbalanced the bottom and struck the ground sending the lower end into the air as this happened billy dean and charley atwood were hauled out of harms way then the pole was dropped to the campus with a thud  for several seconds all who stood near were too dazed to speak then a cheer arose for those who had held the flagstaff up long enough for the small youths to be rescued  say that was a close shave exclaimed sam he like a good many others was quite pale  it was indeed said a senior who had come up the fellows who held the pole up deserve a good deal of credit  dick rover suggested it said songbird good for you dick he added warmly  the falling of the flagstaff sobered the whole party of students yet the freshmen were jubilant over the fact that they had won in the colors contest  and well wear the colors this term cried tom proudly  so we will called out others in a chorus well wear em good and strong too and they did the very next day some of the lads came out with neckties twice the ordinary size and with hat bands several inches wide all of course in the brill colors  billy dean and charley atwood were much affected by what had occurred and quickly retired from the scene but later both of the small students thanked dick and the others for what had been done for them the broken flagstaff was hauled away by the laborers of the place and inside of a week a new pole much larger than the old one and set in concrete was put up  for several days after the contest over the colors matters ran along smoothly at brill the rover boys made many more friends and because of his work during the necktie rush dick was chosen as the leader of the freshmens class  on friday i am going to fix tom rover said jerry koswell to dudd flockley just wait and see what i doand keep your mouth shut  ill keep my mouth shut right enough answered dudd but whats in the wind  im going to pay off professor sharp for some of his meannessand pay off tom rover at the same time  give me a map of the proceedings im too tired to guess riddles jerry  well you know how sharp called me down today in english  sure  well ive learned that he just received a new photograph of some ladyi think his best girl he has it on the mantle in his room im going to doctor that picture and im going to lay the blame on tom rover  how will you do it  by using something i got out of rovers dresssuit case  oh i see  sharp will suspect rover at once because he and rover had a few words yesterday  good i hope he catches it wellrover i mean answered dudd flockley  saturday was more or less of a holiday at brill and the three rover boys planned to go to town incidentally they wished to learn if dora stanhope and the laning girls had as yet arrived at hope seminary they had received no letters from the girls since coming to brill and were growing anxious  tom was dressing to go to town when there came a knock on his door and one of the proctors presented himself  thomas rover you are wanted at the office immediately said the man  what for asked tom  dont ask me ask professor sharp answered the proctor and looked at tom keenly  wondering what could be the matter tom finished dressing and in a few minutes presented himself at the office president wallington and professor sharp were both waiting for him  so youve come at last have you you young rascal cried abner sharp angrily how dare you do such an outrageous thing  gently professor remonstrated the president of brill you are not yet certain  oh he did it i am sure of it spluttered professor sharp i declare i ought to have him locked up  did what demanded tom who was much mystified by what was going on  you know well enough you young reprobate stormed the instructor  see here professor sharp im neither a rascal nor a reprobate and i dont want you to call me such cried tom growing angry himself  you are and i will have you to understand  i am not and if you call me bad names again illillknock you down and tom doubled up his fists as he spoke  rover be quiet exclaimed doctor wallington so sternly that both tom and professor sharp subsided ill have no scene in this office you must behave yourself like a gentleman while you are here professor you must not call a student hard names  but this outrage sir spluttered the instructor  well soon know the truth of the matter  id like to know what you are talking about said tom i havent committed any outrage so far as i know  didnt you do this cried abner sharp and thrust under toms nose a photograph of large size the picture had once represented a fairly goodlooking female of perhaps thirty years of age but now the hair was colored a fiery red and the end of the nose was of the same hue while in one corner of the dainty mouth was represented a big cigar with the smoke curling upward under the photograph was scrawled in blue crayon aint she my darling  the representation struck tom as so comical that he was compelled to laugh outright he simply couldnt help it it was just such a joke as he might have played years before perhaps on old josiah crabtree when at putnam hall  ha so you are even willing to laugh in my face are you almost screamed abner sharp and rushing at tom he caught the youth and shook him roughly do youerknow that this lady is mymy affianced wife  let me go cried tom and shook himself loose excuse me sir i know i hadnt ought to laugh but it looks soso awfully funny and tom had to grin again  rover broke in the president of brill sternly arent you ashamed to do such a thing as this  whyerwhat do you mean sir  just what i said  oh a light began to break in on the funloving rovers mind do you think i did this  didnt you  of course he did fumed professor sharp and now he is willing to laugh over his dastardly work  i didnt do it sir said tom firmly  you are certain it was the head of the college who asked the question  yes sir i never saw that picture before  but i have the proof against you fairly shouted abner sharp it is useless for you to deny your guilt  i say i am not guilty  isnt this your box rover  as professor sharp uttered these words he brought to light a german silver case which tom had picked up in a curiosity shop in new york the case had his name engraved on it and contained pencils crayons and other things for drawing  where did you get that demanded the youth  never mind where i got it isnt it yours  yes  ha do you hear that doctor wallington cried abner sharp in triumph he admits the outfit is his  so i see said the president of brill and if anything his face grew a trifle more stern then you admit your guilt rover he questioned  what that i defaced the photograph  yes  no sir didnt i say i had never seen the picture before  this photograph was in professor sharps room on the mantel the room was locked up and the professor carried the key this box was found on the table beside some books you had some difficulty with the professor a day or two ago in the classroom  i didnt touch the picture and i havent been near professor sharps room answered tom stoutly if i was there would i be fool enough to leave that box behind with my name engraved on it and if the door was locked how would i get in  did you lend the box to anybody  no the fact is ieri thought i had left the box home ioh  well  i think maybe the box was in my dresssuit case the case i lost but it wasnt in the case when it was left at my door that morning  oh nonsense muttered professor sharp he is guilty sir and he might as well own up to it first as last  i have told the strict truth cried tom hotly i am not in the habit of telling falsehoods  have you any other proof against rover professor sharp  not now but i may be able to pick up more later  hum this is certainly a serious matter rover you will go to your room and remain there until i send for you again  cant i go down to town asked tom  not for the present i intend to get to the bottom of this affair if i possibly can if you are innocent you shall not suffer but at present it looks to me as if you were guilty you may go  but sir  not another word at present i have other matters to attend to i shall call on you later but remain in your room until i send somebody for you  an angry answer arose to toms lips but he checked it in the college doctor wellingtons word was law and he knew he would only make matters worse by attempting to argue with a heavy heart he turned gazed coldly at professor sharp and left the office     chapter x  songbird makes a discovery   its all up with me said tom to his brothers when he met them in the hall i cant go to town  why not asked sam  got to remain in my room until doctor wallington sends for me  what have you been doing tom came from dick  nothing and then tom told of what had occurred in the office his brothers listened with much interest  this is the work of some enemy said sam quickly  and the one who got hold of the dresssuit case added dick tom do you suspect any one  only in a general waykoswell flockley larkspur and that crowd  its too bad  say but that picture was a sight cried the funloving rover and gunned broadly no wonder old sharp was mad id be mad myself especially if it was a photo of my best girl  i hope the doctor doesnt keep you in the room all day said sam  you and dick might as well go to town without me returned tom with a sigh that he endeavored to suppress your staying here wont do me any good  what will you do  oh read or study it will give me a chance to catch up in my latin i was a bit rocky in that yesterday i can bone away until the president sends a special message for me  want us to get anything for you questioned dick  yes a good fat letter fromwell a fat letter thats all  postmarked cedarville and in nellie lanings handwriting came from sam slyly  i didnt know they postmarked letters in handwriting answered tom innocently  oh you know what i mean  sure sam for i know youre looking for a letter too well run along children and play said tom and a minute later sam and dick set off for ashton  tom did not feel as lighthearted as his words would seem to indicate he knew that the charge against him was a serious one and he saw no way of clearing himself the finding of the box with his name on it seemed to be proof positive against him  no use of talking the minute i get to school i seem to get into trouble he soliloquized wonder if theyll put me in a cell like old crabtree did at putnam hall if they do ill raise a kick sure as eggs are unhatched chickens  tom sat down to study but he could not fix his mind on his lessons then he heard somebody come along the hallway and turn into the next room  must be songbird or else one of the servants he thought guess ill take a look if it was songbird he could chat with his friend for a while  he went to the next room as he opened the door he saw songbird with his back toward him the sostyled poet was waving his arms in the air and declaiming    the weeping winds were whispering through the wood     the rolling rill ran round the ragged rock   the shepherd with his sunny smiling face     was far away to feed his flitting flock   deep in the dingle dank and dark    i thought i heard an old crow bark finished tom say songbird how much is that poetry by the yardor do you sell it by the ton he went on  at the sound of toms voice the wouldbe poet gave a start but he quickly recovered he scowled for a moment and then took on a look of resignation  youve spoiled one of the best thoughts i ever had he said  dont you believe it songbird answered tom ive heard you make up poetry worth ten times that dont you remember that little sonnet you once composed entitled who put ink in willies shoes it was great grand sublime  i never wrote such a sonnet cried songbird ink in shoes indeed tom you dont know real poetry when you see it  thats a fact i dont but say whats on the carpet as the iceman said to the thrush  nothing i thought id write a few verses thats all thought you were going to town with sam and dick  cant and once again tom had to tell his story he had not yet finished when songbird gave an exclamation  it fits in he cried  fits in what asked tom  what i heard a while ago  what did you hear  heard flockley koswell and larkspur talking together koswell said he had fixed you and that you were having a bad half hour with the president  where was this  in the library i was in an alcove and they didnt see me i was busy reading some poetry by longfellowfine thingwent like this  never mind chop out the poetry now songbird what more did they say  nothing they walked away and ieri got so interested in making up verses i forgot all about it until now  i wish you had heard more do you know where they went to  no but i can look around if you want me to  i wish very much that you would i cant leave or id go myself  a few more words followed and then songbird went off to hunt up the flockley crowd on the campus he met max spangler  yes i saw them said the germanamerican student in answer to a question they are down along the river just above the boathouse  thank you  ill show you if you want me to went on max  you might come along if you have nothing else to do answered songbird  the two walked toward the river and after a few minutes espied flockley and the others sitting on some rocks in the sun talking earnestly  i want to hear what they are saying said songbird i have a special reason and at maxs look of surprise he told something of what had happened  if koswell is that mean he ought to be exposed said max i dont blame him for playing a trick on old sharp but to lay the blame on tomwhy thats different  will you come along  if you want me to  i dont want to drag you into trouble max  i dink i can take care of myself answered the germanamerican student  the pair passed around to the rear of the spot where flockley and his cronies were located here was a heavy clump of brushwood so they were able to draw quite close without being seen  the talk was of a general character for a while embracing football and other college sports and songbird was disappointed but presently jerry koswell began to chuckle  i cant help but think of the way i put it over tom rover he exclaimed ill wager old sharp will make him suffer good and proper  maybe theyll suspend rover said bart larkspur but that would be carrying it pretty far wouldnt it  they wont suspend him but hell surely be punished came from dudd flockley by the way are you sure it was a photo of sharps best girl  yes but she isnt a girl shes a woman and not particularly goodlooking at that answered jerry koswell  well sharp isnt so very handsome answered larkspur his nose is as sharp as his name  i suppose rover will wonder how somebody got hold of that case of pencils and crayons remarked flockley if he  hello max cried a voice from behind the bushes and the next moment a stout youth landed on max spanglers back carrying him down with a crash in the brushwood what are you doing here anyway  at the interruption the whole flockley crowd started to their feet and turning beheld not only max and the boy who had come up so suddenly but also songbird the latter was nearest to them and koswell eyed him with sudden suspicion  what are you doing here he demanded while max and his friend were wrestling in a goodnatured way in the bushes  oh ive been listening to some interesting information answered songbird  playing the eavesdropper eh came from flockley with a sneer  if so it was for a good purpose answered the wouldbe poet warmly  say jerry you want to look out for him cried larkspur warningly he rooms with dick rover remember they are old chums  i know that said koswell he faced songbird again how long have you been here he cried angrily  that is my business koswell but i heard enough of your talk to know how you tried to put tom rover in a hole its a mean piece of business and it has got to be stopped  bah  you can bah all you please but i mean what i say to play a joke is one thing to blame it on a fellow student who is innocent is another as the poet shelley saysbut whats the use of wasting poetry on a chap like you max you heard what was said didnt you  by this time the germanamerican student was free of his tormentor a happygolucky student named henry cale he nodded to songbird  yes i heard it he said and gave koswell a meaning look  fine business to be in listening around corners sneered larkspur  say that once more and ill punch your head cried max doubling up his fists  what are you fellows going to do questioned koswell he was beginning to grow alarmed  that depends on what you fellows do returned songbird  whyerdo you think i am going to the doctor anderconfess  you have got to clear tom rover  our word is as good as yours said larkspur  then you are willing to tell a string of falsehoods eh said songbird coldly  i didnt say so  but you meant it well larkspur it wont do i know about this and so does max koswell has got to clear tom rover and that is all there is to it  will you keep quiet about me if i clear rover asked jerry koswell eagerly  that depends on what tom rover says i am going right to him now and tell him what i heard  and ill go along said max he turned to henry cale you will have to excuse me henry this is a private affair of importance  sure was the ready answer i wouldnt have butted in if i had known something was doing and henry walked off toward the college buildings  just tell tom rover to waitwell fix it up somehow cried jerry to songbird and max as the pair departed its all aera mistake imersorry i got rover into itreally i am  no doubt of it now answered songbird significantly evildoers are usually sorryafter they are caught     chapter xi  how tom escaped punishment   dick and sam were good walkers so it did not take them long to reach ashton while covering the distance they talked over toms dilemma but failed to reach any conclusion concerning it  its too bad said sam especially when the term has just opened it will give tom a black eye  i dont think hell stand for too much punishment being innocent sam hell go home first  i was thinking of that but we dont want to be here with tom gone  arriving at ashton the boys hurried to the postoffice the mail for the college was in and among it they found several letters from home and also epistles from dora stanhope and the laning girls  heres one for tomthat will cheer him up a bit said dick holding up one addressed in nellie lanings wellknown hand  the boys sat down in an outoftheway corner to read their letters dick had a communication of ten pages from dora and sam had one of equal length from grace then there was one for all the boys from their father and another from their aunt martha  the girls are coming next wednesday said dick i hope we can get down to the depot when they arrive  dont forget poor tom dick  yes isnt it too bad  nellie will cry her eyes out if he is sent away  oh weve got to fix that up somehow  having read the letters carefully the boys went to one of the stores to make some purchases and then drifted down to the depot a train was coming in but they did not expect to see anybody they knew as a welldressed young man carrying a suit case alighted both gave an exclamation  dan baxter  the individual they mentioned will need no introduction to my old readers during their days at putnam hall the rover boys had had in dan baxter and his father enemies who had done their best to ruin them the elder baxter had repented after dick had done him a great service but dan had kept up his animosity until the rovers imagined he would be their enemy for life but at last dan driven to desperation by the actions of those with whom he was associating had also repented and it was the rovers who had set him on his feet again they had loaned him money and he had gotten a position as a traveling salesman for a large wholesale house how he was faring they did not know since they had not seen or heard of him for a long time  hello you here cried dan baxter and dropped his suit case on the depot platform thought you were at the college  came down for an airing answered dick he held out his hand how goes it with you dan  fine couldnt be better baxter shook hands with both boys and they could not help but notice how cleancut and happy he appeared quite in contrast to the careless sullen dan of old  come on business inquired sam  yes  what are you selling asked dick  i am in the jewelry line now representing one of the biggest houses in the united states i was going through to cleveland but i made up my mind to stop off here and see you i heard from one of the old boys that you were here  i am sure i am glad to see you dan said dick and glad to know you are doing well  maybe youll be a member of the firm some day added sam with a smile  i dont know about that im willing to work and the traveling suits me firstrate they pay me a good salary toothirty dollars per week and all expenses  good enough cried dick  i came to see you fellows went on dan baxter in a lower voice i havent forgotten what you did for me when i was on my uppers it was splendid of you i realize it more every day i live my father is with me nowthat is when im home we are happier than we ever were before  thats good murmured sam  i want to see you all where is tom  up to the college sam did not deem it necessary to go into particulars  id like to see him too ive got something for each of you  what is that  before i tell you i want you to promise youll accept it and by the way you got that money back didnt you  yes  well will you accept what i want to give you i want to show you i appreciate your kindness  we didnt expect anything dan said dick  oh i know that dick but please say youll take what i have for you it isnt so very much but its something  all right if you want it that way answered the oldest rover seeing that his former enemy was very much in earnest  dan baxter put his hand in an inner pocket and brought forth three small packages  this is for you dick and this for you sam he said the other is for tom they are all alike  the two rovers undid the packages handed to them inside were small jewelry cases and each contained a beautiful stickpin of gold holding a ruby with three small diamonds around it  say this is fine murmured sam  dan we didnt expect this said dick  but you said youd accept pleaded baxter they are all alike as i said before i had the firm make them to order so there is nothing else like them on the market the three diamonds represent you three brothers and the rubywell when you look at that you can think of me if you want to and another thing went on baxter his face flushing a trifle the pins are settled for they didnt come out of my stock i mention this becausebecause the young traveling salesman stopped in some confusion  dan we know you are not that kind said dick hastily  well i was but im not that kind any longereverything i do is as straight as a string i paid for those stickpins out of my wages i hope you will all wear them  i certainly shall said dick i shall prize this gift very highly  and so shall i added sam  dan baxter had heard something about their search for the fortune on treasure isle and as they walked over to the hotel for lunch the rovers gave him some of the details in return he told them of some of his experiences on the road while representing a carpet house and another concern as well as the jewelry manufacturers he told them of several of the former pupils of putnam hall including fenwick better known as mumps who he said was now working in a chicago hotel  you boys can rest assured of one thing said dan baxter during the course of the conversation if i can ever do you a good turn ill do it no matter what it costs me  that is very kind to say dan answered  dick and let me say if we can do anything more for you well do it  the three youths spent several hours together and then sam and dick said they would have to get back to college secretly they were worried about tom  well please give the pin to tom said baxter and if you feel like it write me a letter some day and he told them of the cities he expected to visit during his next selling tour then the rovers and their onetime enemy separated  not at all like the old dan baxter was sams comment  he is going to make a fine business man after all returned dick well i am glad of it and glad too that he and his father are reconciled to each other  sam and dick had covered about half the distance back to brill when they saw a figure striding along the country road at a rapid gait  why say that looks like tom cried sam  it is tom returned his big brother  do you suppose he has run away  i dont know perhaps the doctor has suspended him  hello called tom as he came closer thought id find you in town yet come on back and have some fun  what does this mean tom demanded dick coming to a halt in front of his brother he saw at a glance that tom looked rather happy  what does what mean my dear richard asked the funloving rover in a sweet girlish voice  you know well enough did you run away  no walked away  without permission asked sam  my dear samuel you shock me cried tom in that same girlish voice  see here let us in on the ground floor of the sphinx cried dick impatiently  i will kind sirs answered tom this time in a deep bass voice i went to the room and remained there about an hour songbird went out on a still hunt max with him the two overheard jerry koswell and his cronies talking learned jerry did the trick came back and told me and  you told the president finished sam  not on your collar button answered tom i waited the president sent for me i went he tried to get me to confess and then the telephone rang and that did the biz  say tom are you crazy demanded dick  crazy yes im crazy with joy who wouldnt be to get free so easily  but explain it begged sam  i cant explain it as i said the president tried to make me confess and of course i had nothing to confess when the telephone rang i heard one voice and then two others one after another i think they belonged to koswell flockley and larkspur but i am not sure the voices talked to doctor wallington about ten minutes he got mad at first and then calmed down i heard him ask in professor sharps room and somebody said yes four times he asked for names but i dont think he got them then he went out of the office and was gone about a quarter of an hour when he returned he said now on your honor for the last time rover did you mar that photograph and i said no good and hard then he said he believed me and was sorry he had suspected me and he added that i could go off for the rest of the day and enjoy myself and here i am  and you didnt squeal on koswell  company asked sam  nary a squeal  do you imagine they confessed  i think they told the president over the phone that i was innocent maybe the three swore to it but i dont think they gave their names  what did they mean about sharps room  i was curious about that and i found out from one of the servants sharp found an envelope under the door it contained a fivedollar bill and on it was written in a scrawl for a new photograph  koswell  company got scared mightily mused dick well i am glad tom that you are out of it  and as a token of your escape well present you with this added sam and brought forth the package from dan baxter tom was much surprised and listened to the story about the former bully of putnam hall with interest  good for dan he cried ill write him a letter the first chance i get  and heres a letter from nellie said dick and one from father and another from aunt martha  hurrah thats the best yet exclaimed tom ive got to read em all sit down and rest and he dropped down on a grassy bank and his brothers followed suit     chapter xii  in which the girls arrive   you may be sure of one thing tom remarked dick while he and his brothers were walking back to brill some time later jerry koswell has it in for you you had better watch him closely  i intend to do so answered tom but there is another thing which both of you seem to have forgotten thats about the dresssuit case did koswell find it and if so did he take anything else besides the box of pencils and crayons  hell never admit it put in sam not unless you corner him as songbird did about the photo  hell have to tell where he got the box sam  i doubt if you get any satisfaction  and sam was right as later events proved when tom tackled koswell the latter said positively that he knew nothing of the dresssuit case he said he had found the box on a stand in the hallway near professor sharps door and had used it because it suited his purpose  but you saw it had my name on it said tom  no i didnt it was rather dark in the hall and all i saw was that it contained pencils and crayons answered jerry koswell  well i dont believe you answered tom abruptly you did it on purpose and maybe some day ill be able to prove it and he walked off leaving koswell in anything but a comfortable frame of mind  tom was curious to see how professor sharp would act after the affair during the first recitation the instructor seemed ill at ease but after that he acted as usual tom half suspected the professor still thought him guilty  well it was a pretty mean thing to do soliloquized the funloving rover if anybody did that to a picture of nellie id mash him into a jelly  all of the rovers were awaiting the arrival of the girls with interest and each was fearful that some poor recitation might keep him from going to meet them at the ashton depot on wednesday but luckily all got permission to go to town and they started without delay as soon as the afternoon session was ended  where bound asked songbird in some surprise as he saw them driving off in a carriage dick had ordered by telephone  going to meet dora and nellie and grace answered dick do youerwant to come along  oh sure ill see them all home myself answered the wouldbe poet with a wink of his eye no thank you i know enough to keep out of somebody elses honey pot give them my regards he added and strolled off murmuring softly    if them love me as i love thee   how happy thee and i will be  the boys got down to the depot ahead of time and were then told that the train was fifteen minutes late they put in the time as best they could although every minute seemed five  hello there is dudd flockley exclaimed sam presently and pointed to the dudish student who was crossing the street behind the depot  maybe he came down to meet somebody too said tom more than likely there will be quite a bunch of girls bound for the seminary  at last the train rolled in and the three rovers strained their eyes to catch the first sight of their friends  there they are shouted dick and pointed to a parlor car he ran forward and so did his brothers the porter was out with his box but it was the boys who assisted the girls to alight and dick who tipped the knight of the whiskbroom  here at last cried dick we are so glad youve come  thought the train would never get here added sam  longest wait ive had since i was able to walk supplemented tom  oh tom you big tease answered nellie merrily and caught him by both hands  yes we are late said dora a bit soberly she gave dicks hand a tight squeeze they looked at each other and on the instant he saw that she had something to tell him  how long it seems since we saw you last said grace as she took sams hand then there was handshaking all around and all the girls and boys tried to speak at once to learn how the others had been since they had separated after the treasure hunt  well have to look after our trunks said dora there they are and she pointed to where they had been dumped on a truck  ill take care of the baggage said tom just give me the checks  and weve got to find a carriage to take us to hope added grace  all arranged answered sam we are going to take you up dick is going to take dora in a buggy and tom and i are going to take you and nellie in a twoseated the baggage can go in a wagon behind  but i thought there was a seminary stage began grace  there is and if youd rather take it  oh no the carriage ride will be much nicer and grace looked at sam in a manner that made his heart beat much faster than before  do you know it seems awfully queer to be rich and to be going to a fine boarding school said nellie i declare im not used to it yet but im glad on papa and mammas account for neither of them have to work as hard as they did  papa is going to improve the farm wonderfully said grace he is going to put up a new barn and a carriage house and a new windmill for pumping water and he has bought a hundred acres from the farm in the back and added oh i dont know how many more cows and weve got a splendid team of horses and the cutest pony you ever saw and next year he is going to rebuild the wing of the house and put on a big piazza where we can have rockingchairs and a hammock  yum yum murmured sam the hammock for mine when i call  built for two i suppose remarked dick dryly  dick rover cried grace and blushed  hell want it for himself and dor began sam  here comes tom interrupted dick hastily all right about the baggage he asked loudly  all right the trunks and cases will go to the seminary inside of an hour answered tom so we might as well be off ourselves we can drive slowly you know  well you can go ahead and set the pace answered his elder brother  the buggy and the carriage were already on hand and soon the boys and girls were in the turnouts and tom drove off with dick following  as they did so they saw dudd flockley standing near eyeing them curiously they had to drive close to the dudish student who was attired in his best and he stared boldly at dora and the laning girls  what a bold young man was doras comment after they had passed  hes a student at brill answered dick not a very nice kind either dick was much put out for he did not like any young man to stare at dora  ashton was soon left behind and carriage and buggy bowled along slowly over a country road lined on either side with trees and bushes and tidy farms under the trees dick allowed his horse to drop into a walk and managed to drive with one hand while the other found doras waist and held it  dick somebody might see you she half whispered  well i cant help it dora he answered its been such a long time since we met  yes it seems like years and years doesnt it  and to think weve got to go through college beforebefore we can  yes but dick isnt it splendid that we are going to be so close to each other why well be able to meet lots of times  if the seminary authorities will let you i understand they are very strict  oh well well meet anyhow wont we  if you say so dear  why yes dearthat isoh now see what youve doneknocked my hat right down on my ear now you mustntone is enough just suppose another carriage should come upwith somebody in it from the seminary  ive got my eye open answered dick but just one moreand then you can fix your hat theyve got to make some allowance for folks that are engaged he added softly as he pressed her cheek close to his own  are we engaged dick she asked as she adjusted her hat  arent we he demanded why of course we are  well if you say so butbuti suppose some folks would think we were rather young  well im not so young as i used to beand im growing older every day  so am i i am not near as young as i was when we first meton that little steamboat on cayuga lake when you and tom and sam were going to putnam hall for the first time  no youre not quite so young dora but you are just as pretty in fact youre prettier than ever  oh you just say that  i mean it and im the happiest fellow in the world this minute cried dick and caught her again in his arms once more the hat went over on doras ear but this time she forgot to mention it truth to tell for the time being she was just as happy as he was  but presently her face grew troubled and he remembered the look she had given him at the depot  something is on your mind dora he said what is it  dick do you know that tad sobber is alive that he escaped from that dreadful hurricane in west indian waters  yes i know it but i didnt know it until a few days ago when songbird powell came to brill he said he had met sobber in ithaca  he came to see mamma  i was afraid he would what did he say  he came one evening after supper it was dark and stormy and he drove up in a buggy mamma and i and the servants were home alone although nellie had been over in the afternoon he rang the bell and asked for mamma and the girl ushered him into the parlor he asked the girl if we had company and he said if we had he wouldnt bother us  guess he was afraid of being arrested  perhaps so he told the girl he was a friend from new york i went down first and when i saw him i was almost scared to death i thought i was looking at a ghost  naturally since you thought he had been drowned its too bad he scared you so dora  he said he had come on business and without waiting began to talk about the treasure we had taken from the isle he insisted upon it that the treasure belonged to him since his uncle sid merrick was dead when my mother came in he demanded that she give him some money and sign some papers  what did your mother do  she refused of course then he got very wild and talked in a rambling fashion oh dick i am half inclined to think he is crazy and dora shuddered  what did he say after your mother refused to do as he wished  he got up and walked around the parlor waving his hands and crying that we were robbing him that the treasure was his and that the rovers were nothing but thieves then mamma ordered him out of the house and sent the girl to get the man who runs the farm for us but before the man came sobber went away driving his horse as fast as he could  have you heard from him since  yes the next day we got an unsigned letter in it sobber said that by hook or by crook he intended to get possession of the treasure and for the rovers to beware     chapter xiii  the rowing race   having told so much dora went into all the particulars of tad sobbers visit to the stanhope homestead she told of how sobber had argued and she said he had affirmed that the rovers had falsified matters so that the stanhopes and the lanings might benefit thereby  what he says is absolutely untrue said dick father went over those papers with care and so did the lawyers and the treasure belongs to you and the lanings and to nobody else  dont you think sid merrick fooled sobber asked the girl  perhaps but i guess tad was willing to be fooled they set their hearts on that money and now tad cant give it up in one way i am sorry for him and if a small amount of cash would satisfy him and set him on his feet id hand it over we put dan baxter on his feet that way  oh but baxter isnt sobber dick sobber is wild and wicked i was so afraid he would attack mamma and me i hardly knew what to do and his eyes rolled so when he talked  did he go to the lanings  no  probably he was afraid of your uncle mr laning wont stand for any nonsense i suppose your mother is afraid hell come back  yes and to protect herself she has hired one of the farm men to sleep in the house the man was once in the army and he knows how to use a gun  then that will make sobber keep his distance he is a coward at heart i found that out when we went to putnam hall together  but you must beware of him dick he may show himself here next  it wont do him any good all ive got here is a little spending money no i dont think hell show himself here more than likely hell try to hire some shyster lawyer to fight for the treasure in the courts but i dont think hell be able to upset your claim  they had now reached hope seminary and the conversation came to an end the boys helped the girls to alight and said goodby then they drove back to ashton where the buggy was left at the livery stable and all piled into the carriage for the college on the way dick told his brothers about tad sobber  dora is right he is a bad egg said sam i wouldnt trust him under any consideration  he is too much of a coward to attack anybody openly was toms comment but as dick says he may hire some shyster lawyer to take the matter into the courts it would be too bad if the fortune was tied up in endless litigation  hes got to get money to fight with first said dick  oh some lawyers will take a case like that on a venture  thats true  several days passed quietly and the rover boys applied themselves diligently to their studies for they wished to make fine records at brill  we are here to get a good education was the way dick expressed himself and we want to make the most of our time  as if i wasnt boning away to beat the band murmured tom reproachfully  id like to take the full course in about two years came from sam  college studies are mighty hard broke in songbird who was working over his chemistry i dont get any chance to write poetry any more  for which let us all be truly thankful murmured sam to tom  ten minutes more announced dick looking at his watch then what do you say to a row on the river  suits me cried tom  all right then now clear out andsilence  a quarter of an hour later the rover boys and songbird walked down to the river there were plenty of boats to be had and dick and tom were soon out songbird and sam received an invitation to go for a ride in a gasolene launch owned by stanley  suits me cried the wouldbe poet i can row any time but i cant always ride in a motor boat  same here said sam  a number of craft were on the river including one containing jerry koswell and bart larkspur koswell scowled as he saw tom and dick rowing near by  well give em a shaking up he said to his crony and turned their rowboat so that it bumped fairly and squarely into the craft manned by tom and dick the shock was so great that dick who had gotten up to fix his seat was nearly hurled overboard  see here what do you mean by running into us demanded the oldest rover on recovering his balance  sorry but it couldnt be helped answered koswell why didnt you get out of the way  we didnt have to retorted sam and if you try that trick again somebody will get his head punched  talk is cheap sneered larkspur  say i heard you fellows have been boasting of how you can row went on koswell after a pause  we havent been boasting but we can row answered tom  want to race  when  now  i dont know as i care to race with a chap like you koswell answered dick pointedly  youre afraid  no i am not afraid  let us race them whispered tom to his brother i am not afraid of them  oh neither am i tom  well race you to rock island and back said koswell after consulting larkspur  all right answered dick  want to bet on the result questioned koswell he was usually willing to bet on anything  we dont bet answered tom  and we wouldnt with you if we did added dick i dont think you are in our class koswell and you never will be at the same time since you are so anxious to row against us well race youand beat you  this answer enraged jerry koswell and he dared the rovers to wager ten dollars on the race they would not but others took up the bet and then several other wagers were made  rock island was a small stony spot half a mile up the stream so the race would be about a mile in length frank holden was chosen as referee and umpire and all of the contestants prepared for the struggle  your boat is lighter than that of the rovers said holden to koswell and larkspur you really ought to give them some lead  no this is an even start growled koswell  very well but it doesnt seem quite fair  it was soon noised around that the race was to take place and the river bank speedily became lined with students anxious to see how the contest would terminate  now tom take it easy at the start but finish up strong cautioned dick  i feel like pulling a strong stroke from the first answered tom let us do it and leave them completely in the shade  no we must first try to find out what they can do  say youve got to beat em came from sam as the launch came close if they win youll never hear the end of it  theyre not going to win answered dick quietly but firmly  all ready asked frank holden as the boats drew up side by side near the boathouse float  we are sang out tom  ready answered jerry koswell  go shouted frank  four pairs of oars dropped into the water simultaneously and away shot the two craft side by side there was no disguising the fact that koswell and larkspur were good oarsmen and what was equally important they had done much practicing together on the other hand while dick and tom could row well they had pulled together but twice since coming to brill  youve got your work cut out for you shouted songbird but never mind go in and win  for the first quarter of a mile the two rowboats kept close together occasionally one would forge ahead a few inches but the other would speedily overtake it then however the rover boys settled down to a strong steady stroke and forged a full length ahead  see see the rovers are winning shouted max in delight  thats the way to do it cried stanley keep it up youre doing nobly  show em the way home added songbird  pull jerry pull bart screamed dudd flockley to his cronies dont let them beat you  before long the island was reached and the rovers rounded it a length and a half ahead this made jerry koswell frantic and he called on larkspur to increase the stroke  all right im with you was the short answer  the increase in the stroke speedily told and inch by inch the second boat began to overhaul the first then tom made a miss sending a shower of water into the air at this the craft containing koswell and larkspur shot ahead  hurrah thats the way to do it yelled flockley in delight even money on the green boat  take you answered spud jackson promptly how much  a fiver  all right  steady tom cautioned dick now then ready  yes  then bend to it one two three four  again the rover boys went at the rowing with a will increasing their stroke until it was six to the minute more than that of koswell and larkspur the latter were frantic and tried to do likewise but found it impossible inch by inch the rovers craft went ahead now it was half a length then a length then two lengths  say there is rowing for you was the comment of a senior just look at them bend to it  yes and look at the quick recovery added another fourthyear student  from two lengths the rovers went three lengths ahead then koswell missed a stroke and tumbled up against larkspur  hi what are you doing spluttered larkspur in disgust  coucouldnt helhelp it panted jerry he was all but winded for the pulling had been too much for him  the rovers win the rovers win was the shout that went up and in the midst of the hubbub dick and tom crossed the line winning by at least six lengths koswell and larkspur were so disgusted that they did not even finish but stopped rowing and turned away from the float  the rovers win announced frank holden a fine race too he added let me congratulate you and he waved his hand pleasantly to dick and tom  i got a pain in my side and that made me miss the stroke said jerry koswell lamely some day ill race them again and win too  you should have won this time growled dudd flockley when he was alone with his cronies i dropped twenty dollars on that race  i never thought they could row like that was larkspurs comment i dont think i want to row against them again  dick and tom were warmly congratulated by all their friends it had been a wellearned victory and they were correspondingly happy koswell was sourer than ever against them and vowed he would square up somehow and larkspur agreed to help him dudd flockley was glum for his spending money for the month was running low and it was going to be hard to pay the wagers he had lost     chapter xiv  william philander tubes   on the following saturday the rover boys went down to ashton in the afternoon they had arranged for the hire of a large touring car with a competent chauffeur and were to take dora and the laning girls out for a ride to another town called toddville here they were to have supper at the hotel returning to ashton in the evening  lest it be thought strange that the girls could get permission from the seminary authorities to absent themselves let me state that matters had been explained by mrs stanhope and mrs laning to the principal of hope so dora and her cousins were free to go out with the rovers whenever they could go out at all  well have the best time ever cried tom enthusiastically i hope you ordered a fine supper over the telephone dick  i did was the reply just the things i know the girls like  and a bouquet of flowers added sam he knew that grace loved flowers  yes i didnt forget them sam  the boys arrived in ashton a little ahead of time and while waiting for the chauffeur of the car to appear they walked down to the depot to see if there would be any new arrivals on the saturday special  when the train pulled into the depot a tall welldressed youth with an elaborate dresssuit case and a bag of golf sticks descended from the parlor car and gazed around him wonderingly  are youahsure this isahashton he inquired of the porter  yes sah was the brisk answer  not aahvery large place is it now drawled the passenger  look whos here burst out tom as he hurried forward  why its tubbswilliam philander tubbs ejaculated sam  and sure enough it was tubbs the most dudish pupil putnam hall had ever known and one with whom the cadets had had no end of fun  my dear old buttertub how are you called out tom loudly and caught the new arrival by the shoulder how are you and how is the wife and the eight children  whyahis it really tom rover gasped tubbs he stared at tom and then at dick and sam what are youahdoing here may i inquire but please he added hurriedly dont call me buttertub and dont say i have a wife and children when i havent and tubbs looked around to see if anybody had overheard toms remark  we go to school here said dick as he shook hands brill college  well i never gasped the tall dude brill did you say  thats it put in sam  i am going there myself  you roared tom hail columbia happy land thats the best yet tubblets well have dead loads of fun did you bring your pet poodle and your fancywork and those beautiful red and yellow socks you used to wear  i hope you didnt forget that green and pink necktie you used to have came from sam and the blue handkerchief with the purple variegated border  iahi never had those things stormed tubbs oh say do you really go to brill he questioned with almost a groan in his voice  sure as youre born answered dick well be glad to have you there william philander youll be a credit to the institution we have a few fellows who dress well but youll top them all i know it  do youahreally think i canahi will be as well dressed as theahas anybody asked the dude eagerly he was a fair scholar but his mind was constantly on the subject of what to wear and how to wear it  oh youll lead the bunch and all the girls at hope will fall dead in love with you answered tom  hope what do you mean  thats the seminary for girls fine lot of girls there waiting to see you philliam willander  william philander please so there is a girls school here eh thatsahvery nice yes i like the girlsi always did but tom please dont call meahbuttertub i think its horrid dont you know  all right washtub anything you say stands still answered tom cheerfully i wouldnt hurt your feelings for a million warts  there is the carriage for brill said sam pointing it out  are you going with me asked the dude  no we are not going back until this evening explained dick well see you later  only one other student going with you added tom mischievously hes kind of queer but i guess he wont hurt you he had seen an innocent quiet youth named smith getting into the college turnout  queer asked tubbs  yes gets fits or something like that he wont hurt you if you keep your hand to your nose  myahmy hand to my nose  yes went on tom innocently you see he has an idea that folks are smelling things so if you keep your hand to your nose he will know you are not smelling anything so hell keep quiet  i dontahknow as i like that stammered william philander  carriage for the college called the driver approaching and before he could say anything the rovers had tubbs in the turnout  mr smith mr tubbs said dick introducing the students smith bowed and so did tubbs then the hand of the dude went up to his nose and stayed there  goodby see you later cried tom  be careful warned sam and tapped his nose  ii think idahrather walk groaned tubbs  its too far answered dick then the carriage rolled away as it passed out of sight they saw william philander with his hand still tight on his olfactory organ  wonder what smith will think remarked dick after the three brothers had had a good laugh over the sight  hell certainly think tubblets queer answered sam  tubby will be a barrel of fun said tom im mighty glad hes come it will aid to brighten up our existence considerably  the rover boys were soon on their way to where they were to meet the girls at a point on the road some distance from hope seminary soon the whole crowd was in the big touring car and away they skimmed over a road which if it was not particularly good was likewise by no means bad  and where are we going asked dora for that had been kept a secret  to a town about twenty miles from here said dick we are to have supper there at the hotel  how nice came in a chorus from the girls  i just love automobiling said nellie i wish i had a car  ill get you one said tom and added in a whisper just wait till we are settled down well have the finest auto rides that  tom rover cried nellie and then blushed and giggled oh look at the beautiful autumn leaves she added to change the subject but a second later she gave tom an arch look that meant a good deal they seemed to understand each other fully as well as did dick and dora  the ride to toddville was one long to be remembered they talked and sang and the boys told of the meeting with tubbs and the joke played and this set the girls almost in hysterics for they were acquainted with the dude and knew his peculiarities  when they arrived at the hotel the spread was almost ready for them and by the time they had washed and brushed up all felt rather hungry there was a fine bouquet on the table and in addition a tiny one at each plate  oh how nice cried grace  let me pin this on you said dora to dick and fastened the small bouquet in his buttonhole the other girls performed a like service for tom and sam  the meal was served in a private diningroom so all felt free to act as if they were at home they talked and cracked jokes to their hearts content and the boys told their best stories they also grew serious at times talking of home and their folks  mamma hasnt heard another word from tad sobber said dora to dick  and i hope he never appears again answered the oldest rover  the meal was about half finished when one of the waiters came to dick and said the chauffeur would like to speak to him  very well answered the oldest rover and excusing himself to the others he went out into the hallway  ive just got a telephone message from raytown said the chauffeur my brother has been hurt at a fire there and they want me i dont know what to do i might send for another man to run the car but youll have to wait until he comes would you be willing to do that  i might run the car myself answered dick he could see that the chauffeur was much worried over the news he had received  could you do that sir if you could it would help me out a whole lot my brother has a wife and two little children and shell be scared to death if bill is injured  then go right along only see to it that the car is in good working order answered dick and then he followed the chauffeur to the shed where the automobile was stored and had the peculiar working of that make of car explained to him as my old readers know dick had driven a car before and understood very well how to do it  as there was no particular need for hurrying and as it promised to be a fine moonlight night the rover boys and their company did not leave the hotel until nearly eight oclock then dick lit the lamps of the machine and ran it around to the piazza and the others bundled in  are you sure you can run this car dick asked dora a bit timidly  oh yes dora it is of a make that i have run before only the other was a fiveseat instead of a seven but this one runs the same way  dick is a born chauffeur said sam wait till you see him let the car out to sixty miles an hour  mercy i dont want to run as fast as that cried grace  wed all be killed if anything should happen added nellie  dont you worry dick will crawl along at three miles per drawled tom the moonlight is too fine to run fast besides dora is going to sit in front with him  ill make the run in about an hour and a half said dick and that is fast enough we dont want to get back too early  might go around the block suggested sam  around the block would mean about fifteen miles extra said dora who knew all about country blocks  i dont know the roads so ill keep to the one we came on answered dick all ready then off we go he added and started on low speed which he soon changed to second and then high this is something like he cried as he settled back with his hands on the wheel  keep your eyes on the road and not on dora cautioned tom  say another word and ill drag you from nellie and make you run the car retorted dick and then tom shut up promptly  mile after mile was covered and dick proved that he could run the big automobile fully as well as the regular driver the moon was shining brightly so that it was very pleasant the party sang songs and enjoyed themselves immensely  they were still two miles from ashton when they came to a turn in the road here there were a number of trees and it was much darker than it had been dick slowed up a trifle and peered ahead  suddenly the front lamps of the machine shone down on something in the roadway that sent back a strange sparkle of light dick bent forward and uttered an exclamation of dismay he turned off the power and jammed on both brakes  whats the matter cried sam and tom in a breath and the girls gave a scream of fear  bang came a report from under the car  one of the tires had burst     chapter xv  an automobiling adventure   what did you run over asked sam  look for yourself returned his big brother this is an outrage i wish i could catch the party responsible for it he added bitterly  dick had stopped the touring car in the midst of a quantity of broken glass bottles the glass covered the road from side to side and had evidently been put there on purpose  say do you think that chauffeur had anything to do with this demanded tom  hardly answered dick if his story about the fire was not true hed know hed be found out  maybe it was done by some country fellow who is running an auto repair shop suggested sam ive heard of such things being donewhen business was dull  well well have to fix the tire that is all there is to it said the oldest rover might as well get out while we are doing it he added to the girls  lucky you stopped when you did said tom as he walked around the machine if you hadnt we might have had all four tires busted  what a contemptible trick to play said dora as she alighted  can you mend the tire asked nellie as she too got out followed by her sister  oh yes we can mend itor rather put on another said dick but well examine all the tires first he added taking off a lamp for that purpose  it was found that each tire had some glass in it and the bits were picked out with care while this was going on dick suddenly swung the lamp around so that its rays struck through the trees and bushes lining the roadway  look look he cried there is somebody watching us  the fellow who is guilty added sam  catch him came from tom and he made a quick rush forward  say weve got to get out of here came in a low voice from among the trees run for all you are worth  i told you to get back said another voice come on this way  a crashing through the brushwood back of the trees followed dick held up the lamp and threw the rays in the direction of the sounds he and his brothers caught a glimpse of two boys or men hurrying away  stop or ill shoot cried tom although he had no weapon at his command but this cry only made the fleeing ones move the faster  sam you stay with the girls said dick quickly tom and i can go after those rascals  all right but take care they may be dangerous answered the youngest rover  tom had picked up a good sized stone now he hurled it ahead into the bushes a cry of alarm followed but whether he hit anybody or not he could not till  holding the lamp so that it would light up the scene ahead dick and tom ran through the grove of trees and then into the thicket of brushwood beyond they could hear two persons working their way along and knew they must be the fellows they were after once they caught sight of the rascals but the evildoers lost no time in seeking cover by running for another patch of undergrowth  say this is fierce cried tom as he stepped into a hole and tumbled headlong  well its just as bad for those fellows answered dick grimly  yes but i reckon they are not dressed up as we are tom had on his tuxedo and a white tie and dick was similarly attired but over the dress suit each wore a linen coat buttoned close up to the neck  the two youths kept on until much to their surprise they came out on a back road that was almost as good as the highway they had left here was a rail fence and as they halted at this tom pointed down the road a distance  somebody on wheels he cried turn the light on em  dick did as requested and to their astonishment they beheld two young fellows on bicycles they had their heads bent low over the handlebars and were streaking along at top speed soon a bend of the road hid them from view  those are the chaps who put that glass in the roadway said tom  i believe you answered his brother they came up here on their wheels and walked through the woods to do it the question is who are they  they are enemies of ours was the prompt answer  yes but how did they know we were coming this way and in the auto  they might have overheard us talking to songbird or stanley  can they be flockley and koswell  more likely koswell and larkspur flockley hasnt the backbone to do a thing like this hes too much of a dude  dick and tom took a look around the vicinity by the light of the lamp they saw where the others had leaped the fence and mounted their bicycles  they are the guilty ones i am sure of that said dick i wish we had seen their faces  the youths went back to the auto and told of their adventure sam and the girls listened with interest to what they had to say  those boys must be very wicked said nellie if we had been running fast we might have had a serious accident  shall you accuse them of it asked dora  i dont know ill think it over answered dick  the cutup tire has got to be paid for said tom whoever is guilty ought to be made to foot the bill  while dick and sam jacked up the axle of the automobile and put on a new tireinner tube and shoe combinedsam set to work and cleaned up the roadway throwing all the glass into the bushes then the new tire was pumped up and tested  now we are all right again said dick  i am glad we had to mend but one said tom he felt pretty dirty from the job but he was not going to tell the girls  all entered the touring car again and dick turned on the power he ran slowly at first to test the new tire  all ok he announced presently and then they went spinning along as before but the edge had been taken off the ride and they did not seem as freehearted and full of fun as they had been before the mishap  it was after ten oclock when the seminary was reached and the girls found one of the under teachers waiting for them  young ladies you were told to be in at ten said the teacher severely it is now half after  we had an accident answered dora and told what it was  you must not stay away later than the time originally allowed said the teacher severely remember that after this please and then she dismissed the girls  when the boys got to the garage where the automobile belonged they told the man in charge about the chauffeur and of what had happened on the road the garage manager could hardly believe the story about the broken glass  youll have to pay for that tire he said coldly you cant expect to make me stand the loss  i suppose not answered dick you can have the old tire repaired and send the bill to me and now i want somebody to take us up to brill just as quickly as it can be done it is getting late  ill get a man right away said the manager in a relieved tone and two minutes later the three rover boys were being whirled toward the college  do you think those fellows are back yet questioned sam as they sped along the road  thats what i want to find out returned dick that is provided they came from here  they left the car at the entrance to the grounds and the chauffeur at once turned around and started back for ashton  well take a look around the gymnasium first said dick that is where they keep the bicycles and such things  they hurried in the direction of the gymnasium and finding the door unlocked entered the building was dark and deserted for it was now after eleven oclock  hello there called a voice from a distance and a watchman appeared lantern in hand whats wanted  we want to look at the bicycles pinkey answered dick  the bicycles aint goin for no ride this time o night are you asked the watchman  no we want to see if any of them have been used  think somebody has been usin your machine on the sly  to this question the rovers did not reply for the reason that they had no bicycles at brill the watchman led the way to the bicycle room here were about twenty bicycles and half a dozen motor cycles all belonging to various students  aint half as many as there used to be remarked pinkey when the craze was on we had about a hundred an fifty its all automobiling now  the boys looked over the various wheels and felt of the working parts and the lamps presently sam found a hot lamp and dick located another  who do these machines belong to asked dick  theres the list said the watchman pointing to a written sheet tacked on the wall they are no 15 and no 9  the boys looked at the sheet and read the names of walter d flood and andrew w crossley two juniors whom they knew by sight only  they wouldnt play this trick on us whispered dick to his brothers they must have loaned their bicycles to others  right you are answered tom well have to question them  do you know where they room  no but we can find out from the register  they entered their dormitory and found out that flood and crossley were in the next building occupying room 14 together  thats luck said sam we wont have to wake up anybody else  it was against the rules to be prowling around the dormitories so late at night so the rovers had to be cautious in their movements they mounted the stairs to the second floor and had to hide in a corner while a proctor marched past and out of hearing then aided by the dim light that was burning they located no 14  dick knocked lightly on the door and receiving no answer knocked again still there was silence  must be pretty heavy sleepers murmured tom try the doorknob  dick did so and found the door locked then he knocked again this time louder than before  youll knock a long time to wake them up said a voice behind them and turning they saw frank holden grinning at them  hello said dick softly why whats wrong  nobody in that room thats all answered the sophomore  dont flood and crossley sleep here asked sam  yes when they are at college but they got permission to go home yesterday and they went and they wont be back until monday  at this dick whistled softly to himself  its all up so far as finding out who used the wheels is concerned he said to his brothers whoever took them did so most likely without permission  i guess you are right returned tom  anything i can do for you asked frank holden pleasantly  nothing thank you replied dick and then he and his brothers withdrew and made their way to their own rooms as silently as possible on the way they stopped at the doors of the rooms occupied by koswell and larkspur and listened the students within were snoring  no use said tom softly well have to catch them some other wayif they are guilty and his brothers agreed with him     chapter xvi  something about a cane   but if koswell and larkspur were guilty they kept very quiet about it and the rover boys were unable to prove anything against them the bill for the cutup tire came to dick and he paid it  the college talk was now largely about football and one day a notice was posted that all candidates for admission on the big eleven should register at the gymnasium  i think ill put my name down said tom  and ill do the same returned dick but i doubt if well get much of a show since they know nothing of our playing qualities here  there were about thirty candidates including thirteen who had played on the big team before but two of these candidates were behind in then studies and had to be dropped by order of the faculty  that leaves a full eleven anyway of old players said sam not much hope for you he added to his brothers  theyll do considerable shifting every college team does said dick and he was right after a good deal of scrub work and a general sizing up of the different candidates four of the old players were dropped while another went to the substitutes bench  it was now a question between nine of the new candidates and after another tryout dick was put in as a guard he having shown an exceptional fitness for filling that position tom got on the substitutes bench which was something if not much then practice began in earnest for the college was to play a game against roxley another college on a saturday ten days later  i hope you win dick said sam and its a pity you didnt get on the gridiron tom he continued  oh ill get on sooner or later answered tom with a grin football is no baby play and somebody is bound to get hurt  youre not wishing that are you asked songbird  no indeed but i know how it goes havent i been hurt myself more than once  the football game was to take place at brill on the athletic field and the college students were privileged to invite a certain number of their friends the rovers promptly invited dora nellie and grace and it was arranged that sam should see to it that the girls got there  sam will have as good a time as anybody said tom hell have the three girls all to himself  well you cant have everything in this world replied the youngest rover with a grin i guess football honors will be enough for you this time  if we win put in dick i understand roxley has a splendid eleven this season they won out at stanwell yesterday 24 to 10  i hear they are heavier than we are said tom at least ten pounds to the man that is going to count for something  at that moment william philander tubbs came up he was attired as usual in the height of fashion and sported a light goldheaded cane  for gracious sake look at tubby exclaimed sam talk about a fashion plate  hello billy boy called out tom going to make a social call on your washerwoman  no hes going to town to buy a pint of peanuts said sam  i thought he might be going to a funeraldressed so soberly added dick and this caused a general laugh for tubbs was attired in a light gray suit patent leathers with spats and a creamcolored necktie with gloves to match  how do you do said william philander politely as if he had not seen the others in the classrooms an hour before pleasant day  looks a bit stormy to me answered dick as he saw several sophomores eyeing tubbs angrily it was against the rule of brill for a freshman to carry a cane  stormy did you say repeated the dude in dismay why iahthought it very fine dont you know perhaps i had better take anahumbrella instead of this cane  it would be much safer returned dick significantly  but iahdont see any clouds went on william philander gazing up into the sky  they are coming cried tom  stand from under called out sam  and then the clouds did come although not the kind the dude anticipated six sophomores came up behind tubbs and while two caught him by the arms a third wrenched the goldheaded cane from his grasp  hi hi stop that i say cried william philander in alarm let me alone give me back my cane  you dont get this cane back freshie answered one of the secondyear students  you must give it to me why miss margaret devoe marlow gave me that cane last summer when we were at newport i want  no more cane for you freshie was the cry and then to tubbs untold horror one of the sophomores placed the cane across his knee as if to break it in two  dont you break that cane dont you dare to do it cried the dude and then he commenced to struggle violently for the cane was very dear to him being a birthday gift from one of his warmest lady friends in the scuffle which followed william philander had his collar and necktie torn from him and his coat was split up the back  say this is going too far cried dick and then he raised his voice freshmen to the rescue  this is none of your affair growled the sophomore who had led the attack on tubbs  dont break that cane cried tom if you do somebody will get a bloody nose  well do as we please cried several secondyear students  then tom and sam rushed for the cane and got hold of it two sophomores held fast on the other side and a regular tugofwar ensued in the meantime other sophomores were making life miserable for tubbs they took his hat and used it for a football and threw the dude on his back and piled on top of him until he thought his ribs were going to be stove in  whats the row the call came from stanley and he and max appeared followed by songbird and several others  attack on tubblets called tom to the rescue everybody save the cane  and then a crowd of at least twelve students surrounded the cane hauling and twisting it this way and that it was a determined but goodnatured crowd the sophomores felt they must break the offending stick into bits while the freshmen considered it the part of honor to save the same bit of wood from destruction  at last sam saw his chance and with a quick movement he leaped directly on the shoulders of one of the secondyear students as the fellow went down he caught hold of two of his chums to save himself this loosened the hold on the cane and in a twinkling sam aided by stanley had it in his possession he leaped down and started on a run for the dormitory  after him get the cane  dont let him get away with it  nail him somebody  so the cries rang out several sophomores tried to head the youngest rover off but he was too quick for them he dodged to the right and the left and hurled one boy flat then he ran around a corner of a building mounted the steps to a side door and disappeared from view  hurrah for sam rover  say that was as good as a run on the football field  thats the time the sophs got left  hi wheres my cane howled william philander gazing around in perplexity as soon as the secondyear students let go of him  sam has it answered tom and it wasnt broken either he added with pride  butahwhy did heahrun away with it queried tubbs innocently  to stop the slaughter of the innocents answered dick hell give it back to you later but dont try to carry it again went on dick in a low voice  just look at me moaned william philander as he gazed at the wreck of his outfit look at this tieand it cost me a dollar and seventyfive cents  be thankful you werent killed answered a sophomore dont you know better than to carry a cane  iahfancy ill carry a cane if i wish answered tubbs with great dignity  not around brill answered several  andahwhy not  because youre a freshie thats why you can wear the colorsbecause of the necktie rushbut you cant carry a cane  ohahso thats it cried william philander a light breaking in on him but why didnt you come up politely and tell me so instead of rushing at me like aahlike mad bulls it was very rude dont you know  next time well send you a scented note by special liveried messenger said one of the secondyear students in disgust  well have it on engraved paper too added another  thank you that will beahbetter replied william philander calmly but look at my suit he continued and gave a groan i cantahmake any afternoon calls today and i was going to a pink tea  wow a pink tea boys yelled one of the boys wouldnt that rattle your back teeth  never mind tubby the cook will give you a cup of coffee instead said tom  i should think youd feel blue instead of pink added spud jackson  sew up the coat with a shoestring and let it go at that suggested max  if you want to paste that collar fast again ive got a bottle of glue said songbird  nowahdont you poke fun at me stormed william philander havent i suffered enough already  why were not poking fun were weeping said tom and pretended to wipe his eyes with his handkerchief  i am so sorry i could eat real doughnuts said dick  maybe you want to send a substitute to that pink tea came from stanley you might call on professor sharp  or pinkey the watchman said max hell do it for a quarter maybe  iahdont want any substitute growled william philander iahthink you areahvery rude all of you i am going back to my room that is what i am going to do  at this tom began to sing softly    dont be angry william darling   wipe the raindrops from your eyes   all your sorrows will be passing   when youre eating christmas pies  you stop thatyou mean thing burst out the dude and then turning he almost ran for the dormitory the laughter of the students ringing out loudly after him     chapter xvii  a misunderstanding   heres a letter from fatherquite an important one too said dick as he joined his brothers in one of the rooms several days later  what about questioned sam while tom looked up from a book with interest  its about tad sobber and that fortune from treasure isle answered dick  what has that rascal showed up again exclaimed tom  he has and according to what father says he is going to make all the trouble possible for the stanhopes and the lanings  thats too bad said sam  ill read the letter went on dick and proceeded to do so in part the communication ran as follows  you wrote that you knew about sobbers call upon mrs stanhope well after the girls left for hope seminary sobber and a lawyer named martin snodd called upon mr laning and then upon me sobber was very bitter and he wanted to know all about what had been done with the treasure he claims that he and his uncle who is dead were robbed of the boxes evidently sobber and the lawyer had talked the matter over carefully for the latter intimated that sobber might settle the case if the stanhopes and the lanings would give him seventyfive per cent of the fortune mr laning did not wish to go to law and told sobber he might be willing to settle for a small amount say two or three thousand dollars but sobber wouldnt listen to this and went off declaring he would have it all  since that time martin snodd has been busy and he has obtained a temporary injunction against the stanhopes and the lanings so that they cannot touch a dollar of the money which as you know is now in several banks the matter will now have to await the result of the case which will probably be tried in court some months from now  i have learned that sobber has little or no money and that martin snodd has taken the case on speculation sobber to allow him half of whatever he gets out of it snodds reputation is anything but good so i am afraid he will have a lot of evidence manufactured to order i have recommended a firm of firstclass lawyers to mrs stanhope and the lanings and they will of course fight the matter to the bitter end  this is too bad cried sam after dick had finished so the fortune is tied up so they cant spend a cent of whats left  they cant touch a cent until the courts decide who the fortune really belongs to answered dick and if sobber should win the stanhopes and the lanings will have to pay back that which they have already used  oh how can sobber win cried tom father said the stanhope and laning claims were perfectly legal  true tom but you can never tell how a case is going to turn out in court if this martin snodd is a shyster he may have all sorts of evidence cooked up against our friends sobber would most likely swear to anything and so would some of the sailors saved from the josephine and then there are some of sid merricks other relatives who would try to benefit by the case theyd probably testify in favor of sobber for they wouldnt expect anything from mrs stanhope or the lanings  but the records of mr stanhopes business deals ought to be clear said sam  they are not as clear as one would wish so father told me answered dick he gave a long sigh too bad and just when we thought the stanhopes and the lanings could sit down and enjoy all that fortune  i wonder if the girls know of this yet mused tom  most likely they have had word from home answered dick  it will make them feel pretty sore said sam  yes it would make anybody feel sore answered the oldest rover well have to drive over and see the first chance we get  when they met the girls the boys learned that they knew all about the affair all were worried and showed it  this will upset mamma very much said dora i am afraid it will put her in bed  its too bad but it cant be helped said dick  dick do you think we ought to buy sobber off  no he doesnt deserve a cent of that money  papa says the case will not come up for a long time the courts are so crowded with cases remarked nellie he is about as worried as anybody for he has already spent several thousand dollars and if we lose he wont know how to pay it back  well lend him the cash said tom promptly and for this nellie gave him a grateful look  the boys did their best to cheer up the girls but their efforts were not entirely successful all felt that the coming legal contest would be a bitter one and that tad sobber and the shyster lawyer who was aiding him would do all in their power to get possession of the fortune found on treasure isle  the girls were coming to the football game with sam and all said they trusted brill would win the contest  we are all going to carry brill flags said grace and i am going to rootisnt that what you call itas hard as i can  then well be sure to win cried dick  yet the oldest rover was by no means confident the brill eleven had heard that their opponents were in the pink of condition they had played three games already and won all of them brill had played against the scrub only which was hardly a test of what it could do  the day for the contest dawned clear and bright and early in the afternoon the visitors from roxley hope and other institutions of learning as well as from ashton and other towns commenced to pour in they came on foot in carriages and automobiles and on bicycles and soon the grandstand and the bleachers were filled to overflowing flags and college colors were in evidence everywhere and so were horns and rattles  while dick was waiting to catch sight of the carriage containing sam and the girls from hope he saw another turnout approaching in it were mr sanderson and his daughter minnie  why how do you do mr rover cried the girl pleasantly  very well answered dick politely raising his cap and how are you  oh fine i made papa drive me over to see the game its going to be something grand so ive heard went on minnie and then she added thought you and your brothers were coming to see us  weerwe havent had much time stammered dick he did not care to add that when he went to see a young lady it was always dora stanhope and that tom and sam called only on nellie and grace laning  ive been expecting you said the girl with a pretty pout  have dudd flockley and jerry koswell been there since  yes both of them came once and flockley came after that but i refused to see them mr flockley wished to bring me to see this game but i sent word that i was going with papa  he ought to know enough to stay away by this time said dick he could think of no other remark to make  can i get a seat anywhere asked minnie looking anxiously over in the direction of the grandstand  i think so wait ill look  hold on put in mr sanderson just you take minnie along mr rover ill go and take care of the hoss i can stand anywhere and look on  minnie prepared to spring to the ground and there was nothing to do but for dick to assist her he wondered if sam was coming with dora and the others but did not see them then he led the way through the crowd to where some seats were reserved  i think youll be able to see nicely from here he said  oh i know i shall she smiled broadly at him you are very kind i dont know what i should have done if i had been alonethere is such a jam oh i do hope you win and minnie beamed on dick in a manner that made him blush for he saw that several were watching them  i must go now it is getting late said dick after a little more talk he turned to see sam dora and the laning girls only a few seats away dora was looking fully at minnie sanderson with wide open eyes and a flush mounting to her cheeks  oh so youve arrived cried dick cheerily but his voice had a catch in it somehow he felt guilty he could not tell why  yes here we are answered nellie  and what a crowd added grace dora said not a word she had stopped looking at minnie and her eyes were directed to nothing at all on the football field  well dora are you going to wish me success asked dick bound to say something  oh i guess all your lady friends will wish you that was the answer in a voice that did not seem like doras at all  why whats the matter he asked in a low voice meant only for her ears  nothing  but there is dora  you had better go down to the field now i see the other players are getting ready  but if you are angry at me  oh i am not angry so please leave me alone and now dora turned still further away while something like tears began to spring into her eyes  dick drew back for her tone of voice nettled him he felt he had done nothing wrong he did not see that look in her eyes or he would have understood how much she was hurt he turned nodded pleasantly to nellie and grace and hurried from the grandstand  where have you been asked tom when he appeared in the dressingroom  up on the stand talking to the girls was dicks short answer  anything wrong you look out of sorts  no nothing is wrong answered the oldest rover but he felt that there was something my much wrong yet he could not tell tom  i didnt do anything out of the way im sure i didnt dick murmured to himself as he prepared to go out on the gridiron any gentleman would have found a seat for miss sanderson i suppose dora saw me talking to her and now she imagines all sorts of things it isnt fair well i dont care and dick whistled to himself just to keep up his courage he did care a great deal  at last he was ready and he followed tom out on the field the roxley team had just come out and their friends were giving them a royal welcome  roxley roxley they shouted they are the boys to win  its brill this time was the answering rally and then horns and rattles added to the din while banners were waved gaily in the bracing autumn air  dick looked toward the grandstand trying to single out dora instead his eyes met those of minnie sanderson and she waved both her banner and her handkerchief he answered the salute and then turned to look where dora and the lanings were sitting nellie and grace as well as sam cheered him but dora took no notice but she waved her flag at tom  this last action made dicks heart sink figuratively speaking to his shoes how could a fellow hope to play and win with his girl cutting him like that but then of a sudden he shut his teeth hard  ill win even if she doesnt care he told himself ill not do it for her or myselfill do it for the honor of brill     chapter xviii  the great football game   it is not my intention to give all the particulars of that game of football between brill and roxley for the reason that i have many other things to tell about yet i feel that i must tell something of that great second half which nobody who saw it will ever forget  in the first half roxley had the kickoff and they played such a fierce whirlwind game that before the leather had been on the gridiron eight minutes they scored a touchdown then they made another touchdown and just before the whistle blew for the end of the first half one of their players kicked a goal from the field  and brill scored nothing  more than this the playing was so rough that two of the brill eleven and one from roxley had to retire from the field  of course the visitors went wild with joy and shouted themselves hoarse they waved their colors swung their rattles and tooted their horns for fully five minutes while the silence among the brill contingent was so thick it could be cut with a knife as sam afterward expressed it  its all over murmured stanley with a glum look on his face their eleven this year are too heavy for us  we cant meet them in mass play thats certain was dicks comment if we are going to gain anything at all it must be by open work  tom rover can take feltons place came the order from the head of the team and tom at once threw off the blanket he had been using and got into practice with another new man and some others  dick felt sore physically and mentally he had been roughly used by two of the roxley players and had made a fumble at a critical moment and all during that heartrending first half dora had not noticed him at all  the coach did some plain talking to the players while in the dressingroom and told them of where he thought roxley might be weakat the left end  dont mass unless you absolutely have to were his words of caution they have the weight but i dont think they have the wind keep them on the jump i think that is your only chance  when the whistle blew for the second half the brill eleven came out on the gridiron with a do or die look on their faces  now pile it into em cried the coach dont give em time to think about it  whether it was this caution or the very desperateness of the case it would be hard to say but true it is that brill went at their opponents hammer and tongs from the very start they avoided all wedge work and confined themselves as much as possible to open playing more than this they used a little trick dick had once played when on the eleven at putnam hall the ball was passed from right to left then to center and then to left again and then carried around the end for a gain of twentyfive yards then it was picked up again turned back and to the left once more and forced around the end for twenty yards more  thats the way to do it yelled several of the brill supporters  over with it while youve got the chance  the ball was forced back by sheer weight of roxley but only for five yards then the brill quarterback got it sent it over to toms and in a twinkling tom nursed it to where he wanted it and kicked a goal from the field  hurrah hurrah hurrah  thats the way to do it  now then for another  by the great julius caesar cried sam isnt that fine  oh it was grand exclaimed nellie and she waved her banner directly at tom and he waved his hand in return just then nellie felt as if she could go and hug him  it certainly was fine said grace but its only one goal and they have such a big score she pouted  never mind we wont be whitewashed anyway  its a pity they didnt have tom in the first half said dora although her heart was strangely sore she nevertheless felt proud of what tom had accomplished  again the two elevens went at it and now roxley tried again to force the center by a rush but to their surprise brill shifted to the leftthat one weak spotand got the ball on a fumble by the roxley halfback there was more quick action by four of the brill players and when the scrimmage came to an end the leather was found just three yards from the roxley goal line  and then came that awful struggle where muscle met muscle in a strain that was truly terrific roxley was heavier but its wind was going fast brill held at first then went aheadan incha foota yard  hold em hold em was the roxley cry but it was not to be the yard became two and then the leather went over with a rush  a touchdown a touchdown for brill  now make it a goal was the cry and a goal it became the brill quarterback doing the kicking  from that moment on the battle waged with a fury seldom seen on any gridiron brill from almost certain defeat commenced to scent a victory and went into the play regardless of physical consequences tom had his thumb wrenched and dick had his ankle skinned but neither gave heed to the hurts indeed they never noticed them until the game was at an end  and then came dicks hour of triumph how he got the ball from the burly roxley right guard nobody could exactly tell afterward but get the ball he did and rounded two rival players before they knew what was up then down the field he sped with his enemies yelling like demons behind him and his friends on the benches encouraging him to go on he saw nothing and heard nothing until on the grandstand he perceived a slender girlish form arise wave a banner and fairly scream  dick dick run run run  its dora he thought dora sees me she wants me to win  it was the last bit of inspiration he needed and as a roxley fullback came thundering up to him he threw the fellow headlong then straight as an arrow from a bow he rushed for the goal line crossed it and sank limply down in front of the grandstand  hurrah for dick rover  say wasnt that a dandy run  those brothers can certainly play  its brills game now roxley is going to pieces  amid a great din the leather was taken down into the field and the goal was kicked  want to get out of the game dick was asked as he came down breathing heavily  no not unless im put out was the gritty answer  youll not be put out that was the finest run ever made on this field  what had been said about roxley going to pieces was in part true several shifts were made in the players but this did not aid the eleven with twelve minutes more to play brill kept up its winning streak and secured another touchdown and goal and then a safety when the whistle finally blew the ball was well in roxleys territory  brill wins  say wasnt that a great game all roxley the first half and all brill the second  talk about a team pulling itself together i never saw anything like what brill did in the second half  nor i  those two rover boys are winders  so the talk ran on of course roxley was keenly disappointed but it tried not to show it and sang songs and cheered its opponents and brill cheered the enemy as is the custom  tom and dick were surrounded by a host of friends and had to shake hands over and over again and had to have their hurts washed and bound up both wanted to get to where sam and the girls had been left but this was impossible for quite a while and then much to their surprise they found their brother and the others had gone and minnie sanderson had departed also  wonder where they went to questioned tom i told sam wed be along as soon as possible  to this dick did not answer he was thinking deeply was dora still angry in spite of how she had cheered him  there they are cried tom a few minutes later as he and dick walked toward the river he had seen nellie and grace on a bench in the sun surrounded by a number of other visitors he hurried up to them his brother following more slowly where are dora and sam he questioned looking around  dora asked to go back to the seminary answered nellie and looked sharply at dick  to the seminary repeated tom in wonder why hows that  she said she had aheadache  is that so thats too bad why didnt she wait for dick to take her over  ii dont know tom nellie lowered her voice so dick might not hear something is wrong between them i dont know what it is  wrong why how can that be i didnt hear of anything tom now spoke in a whisper  well i am sure something is wrong they acted queer when dick came to the grandstand before the game commenced doras heart was not in the game at all she was ready to go before it was over  by the way tom who was that other girl asked grace pointedly  what other girl  the girl dick was talking to here on the grandstand  oh that was the farmers daughter we helped when we first came to ashton her name is minnie sanderson we told you about her  she seems to think a good deal of dick was nellies comment  why you dont mean tom looked around expecting to see dick close by hello where did he go he cried  dick is walking back to the college said grace  hi dick called out tom to his brother where are you going  up to my room answered dick  yes but see here  cant see now ill see you later answered dick he waved his cap and bowed goodby nellie goodby grace and then he turned on his heel and continued on his way to the dormitory building  well if this doesnt beat the chinese murmured tom  he must be very angry over something murmured nellie  i think he might have come and shook hands when he said goodby said grace with a pout  i think so myself answered tom say do you think its that girl he went on in his usual blunt fashion  it must be answered nellie who was equally frank on all occasions i dont know what else it could be  but dick hasnt done anything i am sure of it why i dont think he has seen her since we stopped at her home that time  well he seemed very attentive to her here in the stand said grace and if youll remember he didnt meet us when we arrived i am sure dora looked for him  tom gave a long sigh and shrugged his shoulders  this takes the edge off the victory he murmured i thought the six of us would have a jolly time for the rest of the day  it certainly is too bad answered nellie but i dont think dora is to blame  oh of course a girl will stick up for another girl retorted tom bound to say something in his brothers defense  tom rover cried nellie and then she showed that she was displeased  it was quite a while before sam came back from seeing dora to the seminary he too thought dora was more to blame than dick and this did not altogether please grace as a consequence there was a coldness all around and the rest of the afternoon dragged most woefully dick did not return and at last sam and tom saw the laning girls back to their school  a pretty mess of fish muttered sam on returning to brill  yes and where is it going to end asked tom dolefully it was the first time there had been such cold feelings all around     chapter xix  more complications   the football eleven celebrated the victory that evening by bonfires and by something of a feast of course tom and dick were present as were also sam and a host of others but it must be confessed that the rovers did not enjoy themselves  see here dick said tom after the festivities were over what is this trouble between you and dora  dont ask me ask her returned dick shortly she knows more about it than i do  she wont say a word came from sam she said she didnt feel well thats all and i know that wasnt true altogether  was it that minnie sanderson went on tom  if it was it wasnt my fault answered dick  but what did you do insisted tom he was bound to get at the bottom of the affair  thereupon dick was compelled to relate all that had happened which in truth was not much  and is that all asked sam  yes  i dont see why she should be put out over that said tom slowly but then girls are queer the more you know them the less you understand them  grace and nellie take doras part said sam with a deep sigh it has put us all somewhat on the outs  i am sorry to hear that answered dick and his tone of voice showed that he was sincere but i dont know what i can do he added helplessly i dont want to be on the outs with anybody but if dora is bound to turn the cold shoulder to me he did not finish  following the game with roxley brill played two other games with a college from delton and another from speer the game with the latter college resulted in a tie but delton was beaten by brill by a score of 16 to 10 tom and dick played in both games and won considerable credit for their work  during these days the boys did not see the girls nor did they hear from them thanksgiving was passed at brill only a few of the students going home among the number to leave were dudd flockley and jerry koswell and they did not return until a week later  the dude and his crony as well as larkspur were still down upon the rovers but for the present they kept quiet the reason being that they were behind in their lessons and had to work hard to make up but all were watching their chances to do the rover boys some injury on the quiet  dick tom and sam got along well in their studies the only trouble they had in the classroom was with professor sharp who made them toe the mark upon every occasion but they took good care to obey the rules so the irascible teacher got no chance to lecture or punish them  the boys got a number of letters from home and these brought news that the law case tad sobber had instituted against the stanhopes and the lanings was being pushed vigorously mr rover wrote that he felt certain the shyster lawyer sobber had on the case was going to present a great mass of evidence no doubt manufactured for the occasion  its a shame cried tom after hearing this such a lawyer ought to be in prison  the thing of it is to prove he is doing something wrong answered dick it is one thing to know the truth and quite another to prove it in court  if the case should be lost the lanings will be poorer than ever said sam  that is true sam i wish we could do something but i am afraid we cant  fate seemed bound to make matters worse for the rover boys on a clear cold saturday afternoon in december the three brothers and songbird went out to look for nuts in the woods near ashton they had heard that the seminary girls occasionally visited the woods for that purpose and each was secretly hoping to run across dora and the lanings  it did not take the boys long to reach the woods and they soon found a spot where hickory nuts were plentiful they had brought some bags along and were soon hard at work gathering the nuts  while thus occupied they heard a number of girls coming along at first they fancied the newcomers might be from the seminary but soon saw that they were natives of the place they were five in number and among them was minnie sanderson  why how do you do said minnie coming up with a smile on her face how strange to meet out here and then she shook hands with each of the rovers and speedily introduced her friends and the rovers introduced songbird  minnie was neatly attired in a brown dress with a brown hat to match and while she did not look anyway stunning she made an attractive appearance her friends too were pretty and well dressed and all were very jolly  its a nice bunch all right murmured tom to sam i like their openhearted way of talking  so do i answered the youngest rover  the girls joined the boys in gathering nuts and so spent an enjoyable hour roaming through the woods often the rovers and songbird would knock down the nuts with sticks and stones and leave the girls to gather what they wanted  we like to have a large quantity of nuts on hand for the winter said minnie to dick then when there is a deep snow on the ground we can sit before the blazing fire and crack nuts and eat them you must come over some time this winter and help she added  perhaps i will murmured dick he had to admit to himself that minnie was very cordial and that she was by no means bad looking he did not wonder why flockley and koswell were so anxious to call upon her  roaming through the woods caused songbird to become poetic and while they rested in the sunshine and picked some of the nuts that tom and sam had cracked he recited some verses composed on the spur of the moment    hark to the silence all around   the welltrained ear doth hear no sound   the birds are silent in their nest   all tired nature is at rest   the brook in silence finds its way   from shadows deep to perfect day   the wind is dead there is no breeze    to make a fellow cough and sneeze  murmured tom and gave a loud kerchew that set all the girls to laughing  that isnt right declared songbird half angrily there is no sneeze in this poem  oh excuse me i only thought id help you out answered tom soberly and then the wouldbe poet continued    the wind is dead there is no breeze   to stir the bushes or the trees   full well i know as here i stand   that solitude commands the land  good fine immense great cried sam enthusiastically hurrah for solitude  why mr powell you are a real poet said one of the girls gravely and this pleased songbird greatly  youll have to write in my autograph album said another and the wouldbe poet readily consented later he inscribed a poem in the book three pages long  at last it came time to leave the woods and the boys walked with the girls toward the road as they did this they heard the sound of wheels  must be a carriage coming said dick and stepped into the roadway to see followed by the others in the party a few seconds later a turnout rumbled into sight it was the hope seminary carryall and it contained half a dozen girls including dora nellie and grace  hello look there cried tom and raised his cap and the other boys did the same dora and her cousins looked at the crowd and their faces flushed they bowed rather stiffly and then the carryall bowled on its way  why those are your friends cried minnie turning to the rovers dont you want to speak to them  its too late now answered dick he had a curious sinking sensation in his heart that he could not explain he looked at his brothers and saw that they too were out of sorts  the passing of the carryall put a damper on matters and the girls felt it they talked with the rovers and songbird a few minutes longer and then turned in one direction while the brill students turned in another  fine lot of girls was songbirds comment very nice indeed and they know how to appreciate poetry too he added with satisfaction  oh yes they are all right answered dick carelessly somehow he was now sorry he had gone to the woods after nuts  i am going to call on all of them some time went on songbird that minnie sanderson told me she plays the piano and sings i am going to get her to sing a new song i am writing it goes like this  excuse me songbird not now said dick i want to do an extra lesson and he hurried off while sam and tom did the same  two hours later dick ran into william philander tubbs who had been down to town in company with stanley  had a lovely time dont you know drawled william philander while stanley posted some letters and addressed some picture postals i did up the shops and what do you think i found a beautiful new maroon necktie and it was only a dollarsame kind they would charge one seventyfive for in the big cities and i saw a new style of collar and some patentleather pumps that have bows with loose ends and  some other time billy interrupted dick im in a hurry now  oh im sorry but dick one other thing i met miss stanhope and her cousins  you did and now dick was willing to listen where  at one of the stores they were doing some buying in company with those chaps you dont like  the chaps i dont like you dont mean  dick paused in wonder  i mean that flockley chap and his chums koswell and larkspur  were miss stanhope and the misses laning with those fellows demanded the elder rover  they seemed to be they were buying fruit and candy and i think flockley treated to hot chocolate the girls seemed glad enough to see me but iahdidnt want toahbreak in you know so i came away  where did they go after having the chocolate and candy  i dont know i didnt see them after that and there the talk came to an end for several other students appeared dick walked off in a thoughtful mood  deeper and deeper he told himself with something like a groan then he hunted up sam and tom  going with flockley and that crowd cried tom not much i wont have it and he commenced to pace the floor  what are you going to do about it asked sam  call on the girls and talk it overand you and dick are going with me  ill not go declared dick  neither will i added sam  yes you shalland tonight said tom firmly     chapter xx  days of waiting   eight oclock that evening saw the three rovers on their way to hope seminary tom was the leader and it had taken a good half hours arguing on his part to get dick and sam to accompany him  youll make a fool of yourself and make fools of us too was the way sam expressed himself  most likely they wont want to see us was dicks opinion  if they dont want to see us really and truly i want to know it answered tom bluntly i dont believe in this dodging around the bush there is no sense in it it had angered him to think nellie had been seen in the company of flockley and his cronies and he was for having it out without delay  well youll have to lead the way said dick im not going to make a call and have dora send down word that she cant see me  she wont do that said tom i know her too well  well you call on nellie first  im not afraid retorted tom he was so worked up he was willing to do almost anything  the nearer the three students got to the seminary the slower they walked even tom began to realize that he had undertaken what might prove a very delicate mission  i think it would have been better to have sent a letter suggested sam lets go back and write it before we go to bed  and put down something in black and white that youd be sorry for afterward grumbled dick  at the entrance to the seminary grounds they halted again but then tom caught each brother by the arm and marched them up to the front door and rang the bell  a maid answered their summons and led them to a receptionroom a minute later one of the teachers appeared  why i thought you young gentlemen knew the young ladies had gone away said the teacher after they had mentioned the object of their visit they said they were going to send you a note  gone away echoed dick  yes the three left for home on the late afternoon train mrs stanhope and mrs laning said it was a matter of business then you didnt get their note  we did not answered tom  that is too bad i am sure they spoke of sending it wait i will ask parks our messenger about it  the teacher left the room and the rover boys looked speculatively at each other  they must have been getting ready to leave when tubbs saw them said dick  and we never knew they were going added sam bitterly  the matter of business must refer to that sobber case said tom i dont know what else could take them home  maybe they have lost the case and must give the treasure up said sam in that case mr laning would have to take the girls away from such an expensive place as this  in a few minutes the lady teacher came back  parks says he took three notes addressed to richard thomas and samuel rover he says he went over to brill this morning with them and gave them to a man named filbury  filbury eh said dick naming an old man who worked around the dormitories well we didnt get them and i am very sorry  so am i mr rover said the teacher  do you know how long the young ladies will be gone  they could not tell they said they would send letters after they arrived home  this was all the seminary teacher could tell and a minute later the rovers said good night and left all hurried from the grounds in deep thought  we must find filbury and see what he did with those letters said tom and his brothers agreed with him  when they reached brill they located the man they were after fixing a light in one of the halls  where are those letters you got for us this morning filbury asked dick sternly  letters asked the old man who was rather absent minded i dont remember no letters mr rover  i mean the three letters which parks of hope seminary gave you for me and my brothers  oh them i remember now let me see yes i got them and one for mr flockley too i gave him all the letters he said hed hand em to you and apparently satisfied filbury resumed his work on the light  when was this demanded sam  about eleven oclock i hope its all right i would have delivered the letters myself only i had a lot of work to do  it is not all right and we are going to look into the matter at once said dick and hurried off with tom and sam at his heels they went straight to the room occupied by flockley and koswell and knocked on the door there was a stir within a few whispered words and then the door was opened  what do you want asked jerry koswell flockley was sitting by the table reading  flockley what did you do with those letters you got from filbury for us demanded dick striding into the room  letters asked the dude carelessly oh i put them on the table in tom and sams room  when  this morning  they werent there after dinner said sam  nor after supper either added tom  look here do you accuse me of stealing your letters demanded flockley rising as if in anger  no but we want to know where they are answered tom  i told you what i did with them i wouldnt have touched the letters only filbury asked me to do the favor if they are not on the table maybe the wind swept them to the floor did you look  no  then you had better  you might have spoken about them flockley said dick coldly any other student would have done so  or you could have handed us the letters at lunch added sam  i am not your hired man cried dudd flockley next time ill not touch the letters at all and then he dropped back into his chair and pretended to read again  if we dont find the letters youll hear from us again said dick and then he and his brothers retired  they entered the room occupied by sam and tom and lit up the notes were not on the table  here they are cried sam and picked them up from the floor under the edge of toms bed they looked rather mussed up and all of the rovers wondered if flockley had opened and read them  i dont think hed be any too good to do it muttered tom as he opened the note addressed to himself  it was from nellie and rather cool in tone it said all were called home on account of the case at court but did not give any particulars at the bottom was mentioned the time of departure from hope and also from ashton the notes from dora and grace contained about the same information and grace added that she wanted sam to write to her  if we had had these letters this afternoon we might have gone to hope instead of nutting said tom bitterly  they must have expected to see us either there or at the depot said sam otherwise they wouldnt have been so particular about mentioning the time of departure from both places  yes i guess they expected to see us or hear from us said dick and breathed a deep sigh  well they did see uswhen we were with miss sanderson and her friends  what must they have thoughtif they imagined we had received the letters groaned tom  they thought we cut em dead replied sam isnt this the worst ever and all on flockleys account id like to punch his nose  id like to be sure of one thing said dick a hard tone stealing into his voice did flockley just happen to be in ashton when the girls got there or did he open and read these letters and then go on purpose with koswell and larkspur  say thats something to think about cried tom if he opened the letters id like to make him confess  well one thing is certain said dick after the matter had been talked over for a while we missed a splendid chance to talk matters over with the girls it is too bad and his face showed his concern  and you didnt even want to go to hope with me commented tom with a humor he could not repress  wish we had gone yesterday answered sam bluntly he could read between the lines of the note he had received and knew that grace wanted to see him just as much as he wanted to see her  sam said he was going to write a letter that night and finally tom and dick agreed to do the same  but i shant write much said dick i am not going to put my foot in it nevertheless he wrote a letter of four pages and then added a postscript of two pages more and the communications sam and tom penned were equally long  well not trust em to the college mail said tom we can take em to the postoffice when we go to church tomorrow and this was done  after the letters were posted the brothers waited anxiously for replies and in the meantime buckled down once more to their studies it was now well along in december and one morning they awoke to find the ground covered with snow  snowballing today said tom with a touch of cheerfulness and he was right that day after class hours the students snowballed each other with a will the freshmen and the sophomores had a regular pitched battle which lasted the best part of an hour all of the rovers took part in the contest and it served to make them more cheerful than they had been for some time  whats the good of moping said tom we are bound to hear from the girls sooner or later yet as day after day went by and no letters came he felt as downcast as did his brothers  the boys were to go home for the christmas holidays and under ordinary circumstances they would have felt gay over the prospect but now it was different  going to send dora a christmas present asked tom of dick a few days before the close of the term  i dont know are you going to send anything to nellie  yes if you send something to dora  sam says he is going to send grace a writing outfit and a book of postage stamps went on dick  thats what they all need growled tom its a shame they might at least have acknowledged our letters  the boys did not know what to do supposing they sent presents to the girls and got them back they held a meeting in dicks room and asked songbirds advice  send them the nicest things you can buy said the wouldbe poet i am going to send a young lady a gifta beautiful autograph album with a new poem of mine sixteen verses in length its on the clasp of a friendly hand i got the inspiration once when ierbut never mind that its a dandy poem  who is the album to go to asked tom indifferently  whyerminnie sanderson answered songbird innocently you see we have gotten to be very good friends lately     chapter xxi  home for the holidays   the next day the rover boys went down to ashton to see what they could find in the stores dick said he wanted to get something nice for his aunt martha tom wanted something for his father and sam said he thought uncle randolph was deserving of a gift that was worth while  yet when they got into the largest store of which the town boasted all seemed to gravitate naturally to where the pretty things for the ladies were displayed  theres a dandy fan murmured tom nellie likes fans very much  so does grace returned sam say what are you going to do  what are you going to do sam  im going to get one of those fans and send it along with a box of bonbons and chocolates answered the youngest rover boldly and im going to send mrs laning a pair of kid gloves he added  then ill send a fan too answered tom and ill send mrs laning a workbox i know shed like one  in the meantime dick was looking at some fancy belt buckles and hatpins he knew dora liked such things  ill just take songbirds advice and get the best i can and send them he told himself and he picked out the best buckle he could find and likewise a handsome hatpin and had them put into a fancy box along with a fancy christmas card on which he wrote his name then he purchased a fivepound box of candy at the confectioners shop and tom and sam did the same  this was the start and now that the ice was broken and the first plunge taken the boys walked around from one store to another picking up various articles not alone for the folks at home but also for their various friends and they added a number of other things for the girls too  its no worse to send four things than two was the way tom expressed himself  right you are answered dick now that they had decided to send the things they all felt better for it  on the day school closed there was another fall of snow and the boys were afraid they would be snowbound but the train came in although rather late and all piled on board  at oak run their railroad station they found jack ness the rovers hired man awaiting them with the big sleigh into this they tumbled stowing their dresssuit cases in the rear and then with a crack of the whip they were off over swift river and through dexters corners on their way to valley brook farm  and how are the folks jack asked sam as they drove along the sleighbells jingling merrily in the frosty air  fine master sam fine was the hired mans answer  and how have you been  me oh ive been takin it easysince master tom quit plaguing me  why i never plague anybody murmured tom with a look of injured innocence on his round face he reached out and caught some snow from a nearby bush say jack what is that on the horses hind foot he went on  where i dont see nuthin answered the hired man and leaned over the dashboard of the turnout to get a better view as his head went forward tom quickly let the snow in his hand fall down the mans neck inside his collar  hi hi wow spluttered jack ness straightening up and twisting his shoulders say what did you put that snow down my back for  just to keep you from sweating too much jack answered tom with a grin  at your old tricks again groaned the hired man now i reckon the house will be turned upside down till you go back to college  when the boys got in sight of the big farm house they set up a ringing shout that quickly brought their father and their uncle and aunt to the door and behind these appeared the ebony face of aleck pop the colored man who was now a fixture of the rover household  hello everybody cried tom making a flying leap from the sleigh the instant it drew up to the piazza isnt this jolly though and he rushed to his aunt martha and gave her a hug and kiss and then shook hands with his father and his uncle randolph dick and sam were close behind him and went through a similar performance  my my dont squeeze the breath out of me cried mrs rover as she beamed with delight you boys are regular bears  glad you got through said their father it looks like a heavy storm  it does my heart good to see you again said uncle randolph i trust you have profited by your stay at brill he was well educated himself and thought knowledge the greatest thing in the world  oh we did profit uncle randolph answered tom with mischief chewing in his eyes dick and i helped to win the greatest football game you ever heard about  tom rover remonstrated his aunt while aleck pop doubled up with mirth and disappeared behind a convenient door  we brought home good reports said sam dick stands second in the class and tom stands fifth thats not so bad in a class of twentytwo  and sam stands third put in tom  that is splendid said anderson rover i am proud of you  and so am i proud added randolph rover  youll all be great men some time said their aunt martha but come into the sittingroom and take off your things supper will be ready in a little while but if you want a doughnut beforehand  hurrah for aunt marthas doughnuts cried sam i was thinking of them while riding in the train  well you shall have all you wish during the holidays answered his aunt fondly  they were soon settled down and relating the particulars of some of the things that had happened at brill none of the boys cared to tell of the coldness that had sprung up between themselves and the girls they simply said they knew the girls had gone home  that was an outrage said mr rover with considerable warmth  an outrage repeated dick doubtfully what do you mean  perhaps you didnt hear the report that was circulated at hope seminary concerning them  we heard no report excepting that they had been called home  somebody circulated a story that they were going to school on money that did not belong to themthat their folks had confiscated a fortune belonging to others grace wrote to her mother that the story was being whispered about everywhere and it was making them all miserable and thats the main reason for their going home  what a contemptible thing to do cried tom who do you suppose is guiltytad sobber  i can think of nobody else he is so angry he would do anything to injure them and us  and what of the case asked sam will it come up in court soon  some time next spring  and what do the lawyers think of our side winning questioned dick eagerly  they say it depends largely upon the evidence the other side submits it is possible that the case may drag on for years  what a shame murmured dick  it continued to snow all that night and the next day and christmas found the family all but snowbound at valley brook  merry christmas was the cry early in the morning and the boys tumbled out of bed and dressed in a hurry then they went below to find a stack of presents awaiting them they quickly distributed the gifts they had brought and then looked at their own they had almost everything their hearts could desire  yet each youth felt a pang of disappointment for among all the gifts there were none for them from the stanhopes or the lanings  we are out of it said dick laconically to his brothers  so it appears answered tom soberly for once all the fun was knocked out of him  well i am glad i didnt forget them anyway said sam bravely but he wondered how it was grace could treat him so shabbily  the boys passed the day as best they could in reading and playing games and in snowballing each other and jack ness and aleck pop  my my but dis am lik old times at putnam hall said the colored man grinning from ear to ear when tom hit him on the head with a snowball hab yo fun while yo am young massa tom  thats my motto aleck answered tom have another and he landed a snowball on the colored mans shoulder  i move we go down to the postoffice for mail said dick toward evening we dont know what we may be missing  second the motion cried tom the postoffice it is if we can get through  cant no hoss git through these drifts came from jack ness  well hitch up our biggest team and take our time said dick we have got to get down to the postoffice somehow he was hoping desperately that he would find a letter from dora there  when the old folks heard of it they shook their heads doubtfully but the boys pleaded so strongly that at last they were allowed to go they got out a strong cutter and the best pair of horses on the farm and bundled up well  if you cant make it drive in at one of the neighbors said mr rover on parting  we will answered dick     chapter xxii  word at last   it was a long hard drive to dexters corners and by the time the boys arrived there they were chilled through and through and the team was pretty well winded they went directly to the postmasters house for the office was in a room of the building  ill see if there are any letters said the postmaster and went off he returned with a picture postal for mrs randolph rover and two advertising circulars for her husband there were also a newspaper and a magazine for the boys father  and is that all asked dick his heart sinking  thats all  not worth coming for muttered tom as they turned away  the mail didnt come in this morning shouted the postmaster after them youll have to wait for more stuff until the train arrives at oak run  let us go over to the run and see if we can learn anything about the trains said sam a spark of hope springing up in his breast  they drove over the river and as they did so they heard the whistle of a locomotive  something is coming cried dick  perhaps its only the night freight returned tom  when they reached the depot the train was standing there it was the morning accommodation nine hours late they saw some mail bags thrown off and also several express boxes and packages  curiosity prompted dick to inspect the express goods he uttered a cry of joy  a box for us he exclaimed and from cedarville  where cried tom and sam and ran forward to look the box over it was two feet long and a foot high and equally deep and was addressed to r t and s rover  from the girls ill bet a snowball cried tom joyfully hurry up and sign for it and well see what it contains  the agent was at hand for he was the ticket agent and station master as well and they soon signed for the box then they took it to a secluded corner of the station and with a borrowed hammer and chisel pried off the cover  the sight that met their gaze filled them with pleasure there were several packages for each of the boys from the girls and from mrs stanhope and mrs laning there were some beautiful neckties some books and some diaries for the new year and a box of fudge made by the girls dora had written on the flyleaf of one of the books wishing dick a merry christmas and a happy new year and similar sentiments from nellie and grace appeared in the books for tom and sam  say i reckon this was worth coming for remarked sam  rather answered dick  wouldnt have missed it for a million dollars added tom  maybe the mail bag has some letters for us went on sam he was disappointed that no note had accompanied the gifts  well take the bags to the office and see said dick and this was done a little later after the box had been closed and put in the cutter and carefully covered with a robe in the bags were found letters from their old friends hans mueller and fred garrison and a postal from dave kearney but that was all  well we mustnt expect too much said dick remember we didnt send any letters  but we will now thanking them for all these nice things said sam quickly  it was nearly midnight before the boys got home again and their folks were much alarmed about them they were almost exhausted but very happy and they showed their new presents with great pride  they are dear girls said mrs rover it was splendid of them to remember you this way and splendid of mrs stanhope and mrs laning too  the next morning was spent in writing letters it was rather hard at first to say just what they wanted to but after they had started the letters grew and grew until each was ten pages or more they told about meeting minnie sanderson and the other girls by accident and about not getting the notes until that night and dick added the following to his letter to dora  and now let me tell you something in secret songbird powell has developed a very very strong liking for miss sanderson the girl tom and sam and i aided when first we came to brill he talks about her a good deal and took her to a concert at ashton one evening he said he was going to give her an autograph album for christmas and write in it an original poem sixteen verses long on the clasp of a friendly hand that is pushing matters some isnt it we all wish him luck  there that ought to make her understand how i feel about miss sanderson said dick to himself and then he ended the letter by stating he hoped they would meet again soon so that they could have a good long talk  on the day after the letters were mailed the storm cleared away and the sun came out brightly the boys went for a long sleigh ride and visited some friends living in that vicinity then they helped to clear off a pond and on new years day went skating  and now back to the grind said tom with a little sigh  never mind remember summer will soon be here answered sam and then we can go on a dandy trip somewhere  the next day found them back at brill this was saturday and the school sessions were resumed on monday they went at their studies with a will resolved to get marks that would be worth while at the june examinations they were asked to join the college basketball team but declined and took regular gymnasium exercise instead much to their surprise dudd flockley was put on the team  i dont think that dude will make good said tom and he was right flockley made some bad errors during the first game played and was lectured so severely that he left the team in disgust and songbird powell was put in his place then the team won three games straight which pleased all the students of brill greatly minnie sanderson was at two of the games and she applauded songbird heartily the two were certainly warm friends dick spoke to minnie but did not keep himself long in her company  at last after waiting much longer than they had expected the boys received letters from dora and the lanings the girls had been on a visit to some relatives in philadelphia and had just received the letters mailed from oak run  the three rovers read those letters with deep interest they told about what the girls had been doing and related the particulars of the trouble at hope seminary it was all tad sobbers work they said and added that sobber had written that he would not only get the treasure but also disgrace them all he possibly could  the rascal muttered dick when he read this he ought to be put in prison  doras letter to dick was an especially tender epistle and he read it several times in secret he was glad that the misunderstanding between them was being cleared away he wished she might be near so that he could go and see her  id take a run to cedarville if it wasnt so far he told his brothers  id go along answered tom and sam said the same  perhaps we can run up there during the spring vacation went on dick  there was little more snow that winter but the weather remained bitterly cold until well into february the boys had considerable fun snowballing and skating on the river racing on skates was a favorite amusement and sam and tom won in a number of contests  one day tom was skating by himself he was doing some fancy figures and he did not notice the approach of jerry koswell who was skating with a young lady from ashton tom came around in a circle and jerry who was looking at the young lady instead of where he was going bumped into tom both of the students went down tom on top  hi what do you mean by this burst out koswell in a rage  what do you mean retorted tom getting up  you knocked me down on purpose howled jerry  it was as much your fault as mine  it wasnt my fault at all ive a good mind to punch your face and having gotten to his feet koswell doubled up his fists threateningly  at this the young lady let out a scream  oh please dont fight she cried and then she skated to a distance and disappeared in a crowd  you keep your distance koswell said tom coldly if you dont  he got no further for just then koswell let out with his right fist the blow landed on toms shoulder and sent him spinning away a distance of several feet     chapter xxiii  the springtime of life   a fight a fight came from the crowd and soon tom and koswell were surrounded by a number of students and some outsiders  the blow from the bully angered tom greatly and skating forward he made a pass at koswell but the latter ducked and then came back at tom with a blow that sent the funloving rover into several students standing by  say rover look out or jerry koswell will eat you up said one of the seniors  koswell is a good scrapper came from another  i gave him one lesson and i can give him another answered tom there take that  he turned swiftly and rushed at koswell one blow after another was delivered with telling accuracy and koswell went flat on his back on the ice when he got up his nose was bleeding  ill fix you he roared come on to shore and take off your skates  im willing answered tom recklessly he knew fighting was against the rules of the college but he was not going to cry quits  the pair moved toward the shore the crowd still surrounding them they soon had their skates off  now jerry do him up brown came from larkspur who was present  give him the thrashing of his life added flockley who had come up  he has got to spell able first and he doesnt know the alphabet well enough to do it answered tom  whats up cried a voice from the rear of the crowd and dick appeared followed by sam  koswell attacked me and wants to fight and i am going to accommodate him said tom  dont you butt in growled koswell  i wont answered dick but i want to see fair play he knew it would be useless to attempt to get tom to give up the fight  without preliminaries the two faced each other and koswell made a savage rush at tom aiming a blow for his face tom ducked and landed on his opponents chest then koswell hit tom on the arm and tom came back at him with one on the chin then they clinched went down and rolled over and over  stop you rascal cried tom suddenly cant you fight fair  whats up asked dick leaping forward  he bit me in the wrist  ii didnt do anything of the kind howled jerry koswell  break away both of you ordered dick well see into this  tom let go but koswell continued to hold fast seeing this dick forced the two apart and both scrambled up  see here this isnt your fight said larkspur to dick  it will be yours if you dont shut up answered dick so sharply that larkspur shrunk back in alarm  i didnt bite him grumbled koswell  he didright here answered tom positively look  he pulled up his sleeve and showed his wrist there in the flesh were the indentations of a set of teeth  you coward said sam you ought to be drummed out of brill  thats worse than using a sandbag added dick  ii didnt do it muttered koswell he looked around as if he wanted to slink out of sight  you did cried tom and take that for it and before the brute of a youth could ward off the blow he received toms fist in his right eye then he got one in the other eye and another in the nose that made the blood spurt freely he tried to defend himself but tom was fighting mad and his blows came so rapidly that koswell was knocked around like a tenpin and sent bumping first into flockley then into larkspur and then into some bushes where he lay panting for breath  now have you had enough demanded tom while the crowd marveled at his quickness and staying powers  ii stammered koswell  if youve had enough say so went on tim if not ill give you some more  iim sick murmured koswell i was sick this morning when i got up illill finish this with you some other day  all right koswell answered tom coolly but when you go at it again do it fairly or youll get the worst of it remember that  hurrah for tom rover was the cry from stanley and the cheer was taken up on all sides jerry koswell sneaked away as soon as he could and flockley and larkspur followed him  hell have it in for you tom said sam as he and his brothers got away from the crowd most likely he is mad enough to do anything  oh he was mad before declared tom i am not afraid of him  everybody thought there might be another fight in the near future but day after day went by and koswell made no move nor did he even notice tom he kept with flockley and larkspur and the three were often noticed consulting together  at last winter was over and the warm breath of spring filled the air much to the pleasure of the boys they got news that dora nellie and grace were going to return to hope regardless of the reports that had been circulated about them  good thats what i call pluck cried dick  they learned when the girls would arrive at ashton and got permission to go to town to meet them it must be confessed that all of them were a trifle nervous in spite of the warm letters that had been sent  when the train came in they rushed for the parlor car and then what a handshaking and greeting followed all around everybody was talking at once and after the first minute or two there was nothing but smiles and laughter  i am so sorry thatyou know whispered dick to dora  so am i she answered what geese we are arent we  well we wont have any more misunderstandings will we he went on squeezing her hand  never she declared and gave him an arch look and you say songbird isis  going with miss sanderson yes and they are as thick as two peas but dora i never waservery friendly with her ii  but youyou talked to her at that football game dick and you didnt meet me when sam  i know but i had to find her a seat after she about asked me to i wanted to be with you i did really dear  who said you could call me dear and now her eyes were as bright as stars  i said so and im going towhen we are alone the future mrs dick rover deserves it he went on boldly but in a very low voice  oh dick youre awful cried dora and blushed but somehow she appeared mightily pleased  the boys drove the girls to the seminary and by the time the boardingschool was reached all were on the best of terms once more  mamma wanted us to come back explained dora she says even if we do lose that fortune she wants me to have a better education and she will pay the bill for nellie and grace too  it will make the lanings quite poor i am afraid if the fortune is lost replied dick gravely  i know it dick but well have to take what comes  have you heard from sobber or his lawyer lately  nothing since he threatened to disgrace us  you must watch out for him if he attempts to bother you while you are here let us know at once  we will  i hope the case in court is decided soon and in your favor  say stop cried tom as they were turning into the gate at the seminary  whats up asked sam while dick halted the team he was driving  here comes a buggy along the side road just look who is in it  all turned to look in the direction of the turnout which was approaching as it came closer the rover boys recognized it as one belonging to mr sanderson on the front seat sat songbird driving with minnie sanderson beside him on the rear seat was william philander tubbs in company with one of minnies friendsa girl the rovers had met while nutting  theres a happy crowd cried tom after they had passed and bowed and smiled  no happier than we are said dick as he looked meaningly at dora  you are right dick she answered very earnestly     chapter xxiv  at the haunted house   boys ive got a proposition to make said dick one friday afternoon as he and his brothers with songbird and stanley were strolling along the river bank  all right well accept it for twentyfive cents on the dollar returned tom gaily  what is it dick asked songbird  do you remember the haunted house at rushville the place mr sanderson called the jamison home asked dick of his brothers  sure returned sam and tom promptly  well i propose we visit that house tomorrow and investigate the ghostsif there are any  just the thing cried sam  ive heard of that place said stanley i am willing to go if the rest are  if i go as far as rushville i might as well go on to the sanderson home said songbird who could not get minnie out of his mind  well well leave you offafter we have interviewed the ghosts answered dick with a laugh  do you believe in ghosts asked stanley with a faint smile  no do you  hardly although i have heard some queer stories my aunt used to think she had seen ghosts  she was mistaken said tom there are no real ghosts  say tom how could a ghost be real and still be a ghost asked songbird and this question brought forth a general laugh  the boys sat down on a bench in the warm sunshine to discuss the proposed visit to the deserted jamison place and it was arranged that they should drive to the spot in a twoseated carriage then while the rovers and stanley investigated to their hearts content songbird was to drive on to the sanderson home for a brief visit  but mind you are not to stay too long said dick an hour is the limit  ill make it an hour by the watch answered the wouldbe poet say i just thought of something he went on and murmured softly    tomorrow ere the hour is late   we shall go forth to investigate       the jamison ghost       shall be our host   we trust well meet a kindly fate  thats as cheerful as a funeral dirge cried tom  we dont want to meet any kind of a fate added sam we want to have some fun  while the boys were discussing the proposed trip to rushville they did not notice that larkspur was close at hand taking in much that was said presently larkspur sauntered off and hunted up jerry koswell  the rovers are going off tomorrow he said where do you suppose they are going  i am not good at guessing riddles answered koswell rather sourly he hated to hear the rover name mentioned since it made him think of his defeat at toms hands  they are going to the old jamison place at rushville  well what of it  i was thinking answered larkspur meaningly you said you would like to square up with the rovers and with tom especially  so i would show me how it can be done and ill go at it in jig time and now koswell was all attention  i happen to know that tom rover and professor sharp are on the outs again said larkspur the professor wouldnt like anything better than to catch him doing something against the rules  well what do you propose anyway demanded jerry koswell  come up to the room and ill tell you answered larkspur and then the two hurried off and joined by dudd flockley hatched out a scheme to get the rovers into dire trouble with the college authorities they had a number of preparations to make and paid a hurried visit to ashton and several other places flockley hiring a runabout for that purpose  saturday proved clear and warm and the rovers and their friends started directly after lunch for rushville in a twoseated carriage hired from a liveryman of ashton as they did not wish to excite any curiosity they told tubbs and max that they were going out merely for a long ride  going to call on miss stanhope and the misses laning i suppose said william philander  no they have some lessons to make up today answered dick and this was true otherwise the rovers might not have been so willing to spend their time at the haunted house  no sooner had the rovers and their two friends driven away from brill than an automobile dashed up on the side road and flockley koswell and larkspur climbed in the automobile kept to the side road until the rovers turnout was passed then took to the main highway passing the upper end of ashton  here is where you can leave us said koswell to the chauffeur ill see to it that the machine comes back safely  you are sure about being able to run it asked the man  of course i ran a big sixcylinder at home  very well then this is a fine car and there would be trouble with the boss if anything happened to it  nothing is going to happen so dont worry answered koswell coolly then the chauffeur left and the automobile dashed on its way in the direction of rushville  as the rovers and their chums were out purely for pleasure they took their time in driving to rushville going there by way of hope seminary they thought they might catch sight of dora and the lanings but were disappointed  too bad that they have got to grind away on such a fine day as this said dick  well such is life returned sam one good thing schooldays wont last forever  just wait till the summer vacation comes cried tom im going to have the best time anybody ever heard about  what doing questioned stanley  oh i dont know yet  they took their time climbing the long hill leading to the haunted house and it was just three oclock when they came in sight of the dilapidated structure almost hidden in the tangle of trees and underbrush  now songbird youve got to be back here by four or half after at the latest said dick as he and his brothers and stanley got out no spooning with minnie till six  huh i dont spoon grumbled the wouldbe poet i ameronly going to show her some new verses i wrote they are entitled  keep them for minnie cried sam and remember what dick said we are not going to hang around here after dark  scared already asked songbird  no but enough of this place is enough thats all  ill be back dont worry said songbird and away he drove at a swift gait leaving the rovers and stanley in the roadway in front of the house said to be haunted  it was certainly a lonely spot no other house being in sight for rushville lay under the brow of a hill the boys stood still and listened not a sound broke the stillness that surrounded the deserted house  it sure is a ghostlike place remarked stanley i shouldnt care to come here at midnight  oh that wouldnt make any difference if you had a light answered dick the thought of a ghost had never bothered him very much  boldly the four boys entered what had once been a fine garden the pathway was now overrun with weeds and bushes and they had to pick their way with care then they ascended the piazza the flooring of which was much decayed  look out that you dont fall through somewhere and break a leg cautioned tom this is worse than it looks from the outside  wait till we get inside said sam glad we brought a lantern for a light had been taken along at the last minute  they pushed open the front door and entered the broad hall as they did so they heard a noise at the rear of the place  what was that asked stanley nervously  sounded like a door closing answered dick  hello called out tom is any one here  to this call there was no answer nor was the noise they had heard repeated  come on said dick bravely i am going to walk right through the house room by room from top to bottom  and well all go along said tom and sam  well i am with you came from stanley but he plainly showed that he did not relish what was before him     chapter xxv  in the hands of the enemy   the first room the boys entered was the parlor it was totally dark the blinds of the windows being tightly closed it was full of cobwebs which brushed their cheeks as they passed along  certainly this was a fine mansion in its day said dick as he threw the rays of the lantern around but it is utterly worthless now he added as he gazed at the fallen ceilings and rotted woodwork  i fancy the ghosts are nothing but rats and bats said tom come on he continued its damp enough to give one the rheumatism  from the parlor they passed to a sittingroom here there was a huge open fireplace filled with ashes and cobwebs as they entered the room they heard a rushing noise in the chimney  whats that cried stanley anxiously  birds answered dick i suppose they have made their home in the chimney since it is not used for fires  in a corner of the sittingroom was an old table and on it several musty books the boys looked the books over but found little to interest them as relics the volumes were of no value  come on to the diningroom said tom maybe well find something good to eat  ugh i dont want anything here answered stanley with a shudder  wouldnt you like a piece of ghost pie or some specter doughnuts went on tom who was bound to have his fun  nothing thank you tom  the diningroom of the house was in a wing and to get to it they had to pass through a pair of folding doors which were all but closed as they did so all heard a peculiar rustling sound but from whence it came they could not tell  what was that asked sam  i dont know answered his oldest brother  say this room looks as if it had been used lately cried tom as the rays of the lantern illuminated the apartment why its quite homelike  maybe some tramps have had their headquarters here said dick it would be just like them to single out a spot like this  yes provided they werent afraid of ghosts came from stanley  tramps arent usually afraid of anything but work answered tom dryly but this is queer isnt it he added as he picked up an empty cigar box somebody must smoke good cigarsthese were imported  here is an empty liquor flask said stanley  and here are some empty wine bottles added sam  and here are some decks of playingcards put in dick yes some persons have certainly used this as a hangout  what is this in the fireplace asked tom as he pointed to something smoking there  it certainly has a vile smell exclaimed stanley making a wry face  that shows somebody has been here recently was dicks comment we had better be on guard if they are tramps  i cant stand that smell said tom i am going to get out  the stuff in the fireplace whatever it was now burned up more brightly it gave off a peculiar vapor that made the boys dizzy  tom turned to a door that led to the kitchen of the house the door was shut and he tried in vain to open it the others were behind him and they too tried to open the barrier  must be locked from the other side said tom come on out the way we came in gracious isnt that awful stuff that is burning he added for the vapor now filled the room completely  in sudden alarm the four boys turned back toward the folding doors through which they had entered the diningroom to their consternation the doors were tightly shut  who shut these asked dick as he tried to open one of the doors  i didnt said sam  neither did i added tom  nobody touched the doors ejaculated stanley it must be some of the ghosts work  nonsense answered dick sharply somebody shut the doorsand locked em he added after trying both hi you he called open these doors and be quick about it  thou fool to come here exclaimed a hollow voice from the other side of the doors  its the ghost i said it was said stanley  its somebody fooling us answered tom open the door or well smash it down he added in a loud voice  instead of a reply there came a weird groan and then the rattle of some heavy chains stanley turned pale and began to tremble but the rovers were not much impressed  we dont believe in ghosts so you might as well let us out cried dick that stuff you set on fire is smothering us  at this there was a murmur from the next room but what was said the prisoners did not know  come on let us get out of a window cried tom his head was commencing to swim and he could hardly see  thathats it murmured sam say imimgoing he did not finish but sank to the floor in a heap  sam has been overcome cried dick in horror  oh if only we hadnt come here groaned stanley ithe windowiamsmothering he took another step forward and then fell dick tried to pick him up but went down also with his brain in a whirl and strange lights flashing before his closed eyes  tom was the last to be overcome he reached a window only to find it tightly locked he smashed the glass but could not open the blinds then he went down but before he closed his eyes he saw the door to the kitchen open and several masked faces appeared he tried to say something but the words would not come and then all became a terrible dark blank around him  for about half a minute after tom went down nothing was done then the door to the kitchen was thrown wide open and four figures appeared all wore sheets and masks  you are sure it wont kill any of them parwick asked a voice that sounded like jerry koswells and which was far from steady  yes im sure answered the voice of a stranger but we dont want to leave them in this room too long take em below  if we get found out said another and one could readily recognize flockleys voice  we wont get found out put in a fourth person it was larkspur come ahead and dont waste time here  with great haste the masked ones picked up the three rovers and stanley and dragged them into the kitchen of the old house then one after another the unconscious ones were taken down into a dark and musty cellar and placed on some straw  now to fix up the evidence cried koswell we must be quick or it may be too late  for all of a quarter of an hour the three rover boys and stanley browne lay where they had been placed on the moldy straw they breathed with difficulty for the strange vapor still exercised its influence on their lungs  at last sam stirred and opened his eyes  whawhats the matter with me he murmured and then sat up  he could see next to nothing for the cellar was dark his head ached keenly and he could not collect his senses he also felt somewhat sick at the stomach  dick tom he called where are you  there was no reply but presently he heard somebody stir  dontdont kill me murmured stanley take the ghosts away  stanley called sam whewhere are we  whowho is thathat stammered stanley sitting up  it is isam  whewhere are we sam  ii dont know  my head is gogoing around likelike a top  so is mine tom dick  is that you sam came faintly from the elder rover as he opened his eyes  yes where is tom  here i guess beside me dick shook his brother tom tom wake up he cried but tom continued to lay quiet with his eyes tightly closed  sam was feeling in his pocket for a matchbox and presently he brought the article forth and made a light he was still so dizzy he could scarcely see about him stanley had fallen back again gasping for breath  by the dim light afforded by the match the two brothers looked at tom he was gasping in a strange unnatural fashion  i believe he is choking to death said dick hoarsely air he must have air he arose unsteadily to his feet bring him here  and he made for a closed cellar window with all the strength he could command     chapter xxvi  the evidence against them   fortunately a loose brick lay handy and with this dick smashed out the panes of glass in the cellar window another window was opposite and this he likewise demolished at once a current of pure air swept through the place  hold him up to the window said dick as he staggered around and he and sam raised tom up as best they could  if we could only get outside mumbled sam his head was aching worse than ever  ill see what i can do answered his oldest brother and stumbled up the narrow stairs to his joy the door above leading to the kitchen of the house was unfastened  not without great labor did the two brothers carry tom to the floor above then they went after stanley who was conscious but too weak to walk as they stumbled around they sent several empty liquor bottles spinning across the floor and one was smashed into pieces  i wish i knew how to revive him said dick as he and sam placed tom near the open doorway wonder if there is any water handy  oh my poor head came from stanley i feel as if i had been drinking for a month  wonder what it was murmured sam ii cant make it out at all  nor i added dick but come we must do what we can for tom and he commenced to loosen his unconscious brothers tie and collar  suddenly a form darkened the outer doorway of the kitchen and to the surprise of the boys professor abner sharp showed himself he was accompanied by professor blackie  ha so we have caught you have we cried professor sharp in tones of evident satisfaction nice doings these for students of brill arent you ashamed of yourselves and he glared maliciously at the rovers and stanley browne  oh professor can youerhelp us murmured stanley weerare in a lot of trouble  so i see answered abner sharp chillily nice doings i declare dont you think so he added to the other professor  it is too bad murmured professor blackie i thought them all rather nice lads  dicks head was still dizzy so he could not catch the import of the professors words he continued to work over tom who just then opened his eyes  gigive me aa drink murmured poor tom his throat seemed to be on fire  not another drop shouted professor sharp not one this is disgraceful look at what they have been drinking already and he pointed to the bottles scattered around  say whats the matter with you asked sam sleepily and angrily he was doing his best to pull his wits together and thus overcome the effects of the strange vapor  there is nothing the matter with me roared professor sharp the matter is with you rover you have been drinking too much  me drinking stammered sam no sir  rover you may as well admit it came from professor blackie it is a sad state of affairs  but i havent been drinking  we know better look at the evidence roared abner sharp pointing to the bottles why your very clothing smells of rum he added smelling of dicks shoulder  sam has told you the truth we havent been drinking said dick  rover it would be better if you did not add falsehoods to your other shortcomings said professor blackie he was usually a very mild man and had little to say outside of the classroom  you are mistaken murmured dick it was all he could say for he was still too bewildered to make a clear note of what was going on  this one seems to be the worst of all said abner sharp turning to tom he must have drunk more than the others  he will have to sleep it off answered professor blackie too bad too bad why will young men do such things and he shook his head sorrowfully  i believe what the note said this has been a regular hangout for the rovers and their chums said professor sharp severely it is high time it was broken up  yes yes answered the other instructor how shall weerget them back to brill  ill see about that they must have some sort of a carriage here or maybe somebody was going to call for them  shall i take a look around  if you will  professor blackie looked around the house and grounds and then went through the tangle of a garden to the roadway he espied songbird coming along driving the team rapidly and singing to himself songbird had passed an alltooshort hour with minnie sanderson  stop powell cried the professor  i was going to sir answered the wouldbe poet cheerily how is this professor blackie did you come to hunt for the ghost too  ghost i came for no ghostssince there are no ghosts was the quiet answer were you to stop here  yes sir to pick up the three rovers and stanley browne they must be somewhere about they came to explore the old house and to settle this ghost story  i think they came more for spirits than for ghosts answered professor blackie dryly then you know all about it eh  why yes  then you knew they came here to drink and to carouse generally went on the instructor and his voice grew stern  drink carouse what are you talking about gasped songbird the rovers dont drink at all and stanley browne drinks very little  of course you wish to shield them but it will do little good powell professor sharp received word of what was going on and he asked me to accompany him here we have seen a sad sight what doctor wallington will say when he hears of it i cannot tell i am afraid however that he will deal severely with the offenders  professor blackie what you say is a riddle to me answered songbird i dont understand you at all  then come with me and perhaps you will understand was the instructors reply and he led the way to the rear of the deserted house  all of the students and professor sharp were now outside on or near the back porch tom had recovered his senses and sam had obtained for him a drink of water from an old well much to the astonishment of the students the professor had caught sight of a liquor flask in toms pocket and had snatched it away  here is evidence you cannot deny cried abner sharp in triumph all but empty too he added after shaking the flask and smelling of it  how did thatthat get in mmy pocket mumbled poor tom he was still hazy in his mind  you probably know better than anybody else retorted professor sharp and you can tell too where the liquor went to he continued with a sneer  youre aacontemptible old sneak cried tom wrathfully and if i didnt feel soso dizzy id knock you down  tom cried dick warningly he was growing a little clearer in his mind and could see that a terrible mistake had been made  youll not knock anybody down you young villain roared abner sharp in a rage ill teach you to come here and drink and carouse and bring disgrace upon the fair name of brill college ill have you dismissed and sent home in disgrace  youre making a mistake began dick  no there is no mistake of course you wish to hide the truth and smooth matters over but it wont go with me nor with professor blackie either stormed professor sharp we know what we see and what we smell you young fellows are a disgrace to brill and the sooner everybody knows it the better now then march to the roadway every one of you and no more back talk  but sir began stanley in dismay  not another word cried abner sharp if you have anything more to tell you may tell it to doctor wallington    chapter xxvii  in disgrace   still dizzy from the effects of the strange vapor the students were driven rapidly over the country roads in the direction of brill college the fresh air served to make them feel a little better but all were far from clear headed when ushered into the presence of doctor wallington  we have brought them back with us sir said professor sharp stiffly  the president of the college gazed keenly at the rovers and stanley they looked at him in return but blinked and swayed as they did so  i will listen to the story said doctor wallington turning to the two instructors and his voice had a hard tone to it that did not augur well for the students  thereupon professor sharp told how he had received an anonymous note stating that the rovers and some others were going off to the old jamison house to drink and gamble and that it was thought they were going to take some innocent outsider with them to fleece him of his money on receiving the note abner sharp had called professor blackie into consultation with him and had gone off after leaving word for the doctor about what they proposed to do  we found themthe three rovers and stanley brownein a beastly state continued professor sharp truly beastly statewith empty liquor bottles and flasks strewn around and thomas rover had a flask in his pocket which i took from him the instructor placed the flask on the presidents desk there were also cigar butts scattered around and some packs of playingcards  where was powell  he had dropped the others off at the old house and gone on to visit some folks named sanderson he came back later  had he been drinking too  i do not think so answered professor blackie  during this talk dick and his brothers and stanley stared somewhat vacantly at the president and the professors the students wanted to speak several times but doctor wallington waved them to be silent  i will hear what you have to say after professor sharp and professor blackie have finished said the head of the college  he asked the instructors a great number of questions and then turned to dick as the oldest of the boys  now then what have you to say about your disgraceful conduct he demanded severely or perhaps it would be as well to postpone further conversation until you are in a fit condition to tell a straight story the doctor was sarcastic as well as severe  ii am not well sir said dick in a low voice none of us are but it was not liquor that did it it was the vapor  vapor queried doctor wallington in perplexity  yes sir  what do you suppose he means and now the master of the college turned to abner sharp  when we found them in such a sad state they tried to excuse themselves by stating that a strange vapor had made them sick was the instructors reply but we could not trace any such vapor i feel sure it is merely an excuse  you ought to have your head punched growled tom he was still sick and the sickness made him reckless  rover how dare you exclaimed doctor wallington severely  i dont care he is down on us me especially and he wants to put us in disgrace hes a miserable sneak thats what he is  you are evidently in no condition to tell your story and your companions are little better off went on the head of the college he turned to the two professors you may take them up to rooms 77 and 78 mr blackie i will confer with you further mr sharp  there was no help for it and with their heads still in a whirl the rovers and stanley were taken to two rooms not used by any of the other students the rooms were in an angle of the building away from all others they had a small hallway of their own with a door shutting it off from the main hall  professor blackie marched the boys into the rooms and saw to it that they had a pitcher of fresh drinking water  you will have to remain here until doctor wallington sends for you said the instructor and walked out of the room the boys heard him pass through the little hall and close and lock the door to the main hall  prisoners what do you think of that cried sam  it is carrying matters with a high hand answered dick he placed a hand on his forehead how my head aches  same here answered stanley i am going to rest he added and threw himself on one of the beds  the others were glad to rest also and soon all were occupying the beds the connecting rooms contained they left the windows wide open so that they might get all the fresh air possible strange to say each was soon in a profound slumber  while they were sleeping they did not know that professor sharp came in to see if they wanted any supper seeing them sleeping so soundly he notified doctor wallington  do not disturb them said the president of brill sleep will do them more good than anything i doubt if they care to eat and he heaved a sigh as he thought of the problem before him he liked the rovers and stanley browne but according to what he had seen and been told some of the strictest rules of brill had been violated and it would be impossible for him to pass the affair by or mete out ordinary punishment  i am afraid i shall have to dismiss them he told himself too bad  in some manner the story leaked out and by sunday noon all the students at brill knew that the rovers and stanley were in disgrace and in danger of dismissal a few sided with the boys but the majority shook their heads  they had no business to go off on such a lark said one of the seniors its a disgrace to the whole college if they are sent home it will serve them right  koswell and larkspur were in high glee over the success of their plot and when alone winked at each other and poked each other in the ribs  theyll get whats coming to em this trip said bart larkspur with a chuckle theyll be lucky if they are not sent home  and well rub it in too added koswell you know how those rovers are dead stuck on those girls at hope  sure  well ill fix it so those girls hear all about this affair  good cried larkspur that will be the bitterest dose of all  say put in dudd flockley nervously you dont suppose there is any danger of our being found out  not the slightest answered koswell i saw to it that all our tracks were covered  but that fellow parwick are you certain he can be trusted  yes but we have got to pay him for his trouble i promised him twenty dollars ill give him half and you can give him the other half answered koswell he knew larkspur had no spending money  oh im willing to pay him his price said the dudish student but i want to be dead certain that he will keep his mouth shut  ill make him do that returned jerry koswell    chapter xxviii  dark days   the rovers and stanley browne were kept in the rooms until monday morning during that time their meals were sent to them and professor sharp came to see them twice  doctor wallington will dispose of your case on monday said the instructor  i think we should have had a doctor said dick all of us were sick and needed medical attention  nonsense cried abner sharp you have sobered up and that was all that was needed  this assertion led to a war of words and tom came close to whacking the unreasonable teacher over the head with the water pitcher as a consequence abner sharp ran out of the room in fear and reported to the head of the institution that he had been assaulted  on monday morning the four boys were told to go down and report at the presidents office previous to this they had held a council of war as sam expressed it and made dick their spokesman  now then as you appear to be sober i will listen to your story said doctor wallington he was the only other person present and remember he added sharply i want nothing but the truth you cannot hope for any leniency on my part unless you tell me everything  that is what we propose to do sir answered dick looking the doctor full in the eyes my brothers and stanley have asked me to do the talking for all of us shall i tell my story now  yes  thereupon dick told his tale from beginning to end very much as i have set it down here he of course could tell nothing of the actions of koswell and his crowd for he had been unconscious most of the time  certainly a remarkable story mused doctor wallington when the oldest rover had finished and you mean to say you did not drink any of the liquor  not a drop sir and neither did the others  and this vapor what was it and how do you account for it the doctors tones were very sceptical  i cant account for it excepting by thinking it was part of a plot against us  hum the doctor turned to stanley have you anything to add to rovers story  nothing sir excepting that it is absolutely true doctor wellington  after this the boys were questioned for the best part of an hour but without shaking their testimony in the least then songbird was called in and he told what he knew  if your story is true it is a most extraordinary occurrence said the head of brill at last but i must confess that i can scarcely credit such a tale however i will for the time being give you the benefit of the doubt and in the meantime make some investigations on my own account if i find you have not told the truth i shall dismiss you from the college do you understand that  to this the students bowed  one thing more all of you may return to your classes but thomas rover he has an extra charge against him that of assaulting professor sharp thomas rover you will remain here the rest of you can go  with strange feelings in their hearts dick sam and stanley accompanied by songbird left the office they had been heard but had not been believed  we may be dismissed from here after all said sam bitterly  what a shame cried songbird oh if you could only find out who did it and expose them  the boys went back to their classes with heavy hearts they saw a number of the other students looking at them questioningly  jerry koswell saw them return and was much astonished had his plot to put them in disgrace miscarried after all larkspur too was perplexed flockley was a bit relieved and half hoped the whole matter would blow over and nothing more be heard of it  the day went by and the other lads did not see tom but they saw him in the evening just before supper  well how did you make out asked dick eagerly  got a vacation was toms laconic answer  dismissed asked the others in concert  no suspended until doctor wallington can investigate the whole matter more thoroughly he wanted me to apologize to sharp and i said flatly that i wouldnt do it because i hadnt anything to apologize for he got mad at first and threatened me with instant dismissal then i warmed up and said i was innocent of all wrongdoing and perhaps id be able to prove it some day and if so and i was dismissed id sue the college for loss of reputation that brought matters to a head and i guess the doctor saw i was in deadly earnest he told me i could consider myself suspended for two weeks or until he could get to the bottom of the affair so ive got a holiday  im glad you didnt apologize to sharp said sam  what are you going to do with yourselfgo home asked dick  no i am going to move to ashton and then try to get to the bottom of this matter  the doctor will send a letter home  so will i and you must do the same i think father will believe us  tom left that night and established himself at the leading hotel in ashton  news travels swiftly and koswell and his cohorts took care that the girls at hope should hear the story about the rovers and stanley and their supposed disgraceful doings dora nellie and grace could scarcely believe their ears when they heard it  this is awful murmured dora and the tears came to her eyes  i dont believe one word of it cried nellie with spirit  but tom has been suspended said grace and think of poor sam and dick and her heart sank like lead within her bosom  i am going to send dick a note right away said dora i cannot bear this suspense  but you dont think dick is guilty do you asked nellie  no butbut the disgrace it is terrible and now dora burst out crying in earnest  the note from dora reached dick the following day in the afternoon mail it was short but to the point reading as follows  dear dick we have just heard something awful about you and tom and sam tell us what it means of course we dont believe you have done anything wrong  yours  dora  this note disturbed dick and sam greatly for they could understand how the evil report concerning them had been circulated at hope seminary and how the girls had suffered in consequence  i am glad they think we are innocent said sam  they couldnt do anything else knowing us as they do returned his brother and then he sent a note back stating that the reports were all falsehoods and asking them to meet tom and themselves on the following saturday at ashton  perhaps tom will have something to report by that time said dick  the time to saturday dragged miserably the boys could not set their minds on their lessons and as a consequence got some poor marks for this professor blackie gave them a lecture  you ought to show your appreciation of what doctor wellington has done in your case said the instructor  we cant settle down to lessons with this cloud hanging over us answered dick frankly it has got to be cleared away or he did not finish  or what rover  or im afraid well have to leave even if we are not dismissed was the slow answer and dick breathed a deep sigh     chapter xxix  what the girls discovered   the rover boys sent letters to their father and on saturday morning came replies from mr rover he said he was both surprised and shocked at what had occurred and added that if they needed his aid he would come on at once he showed that he believed them innocent for which they were thankful  here is more news said dick the case of tad sobber against the stanhopes and the lanings comes up in court next tuesday that is they are going to argue the question of the injunction on that day  that will make mrs stanhope and mrs laning very anxious  yes and the girls too sam  well we are anxious too oh i do hope our side wins cried sam wistfully it would set me wild to see tad sobber get all that money  dick and sam were to meet tom in ashton at three oclock and all hoped that the girls would come later stanley could not go for he had a latin composition to write  when the rovers reached the hotel in ashton they found tom impatiently awaiting them by the look on his face they knew he had something to tell  come up to my room he said and led the way to the apartment located on the second floor front  you can sit by the window dick and keep a lookout for the girls said sam  yes theyll be here in about an hour said tom they telephoned this morning  well what have you discoveredanything demanded dick impatiently  i think i am on the right track answered tom let me tell you what ive done in the first place i visited the haunted house yesterday morning and went through it from cellar to garret  alone queried sam  yes alone but i carried a pistol and i had it ready for use too  i dont blame you murmured dick and i guess you looked to see if the doors were open too  i did and smashed out several windows in the bargain the first place i investigated was that fireplace and in it i found this and tom held up a bit of white paper on it was printed    m b schlemp   uggist   ain st  that is from a druggist said dick  exactly i figure out the name is william b schlemp that he is a druggist and that he is doing business at some number on main street came from tom but i figure out more than that  what  the paper was crumpled up and had in it a few grains of a gray powder i set the powder on fire and got that strange vapor that almost strangled us  you did cried sam then that stuff came from that druggist beyond a doubt  so i figure it but there is no druggist named schlemp here went on tom and the druggist here doesnt know of such a fellow  i know what we can do cried dick dont you remember dan baxter said he had worked for a wholesale drug house we can telegraph and ask him if he knows of this schlemp  then let us do it at once said tom i have his routethe one he said he was to follow  a few minutes later the following message was being flashed over the wires to dan baxter then supposed to be located at detroit  send full name and address of blank b schlemp druggist at once highly important  thomas rover  ashton hotel  that was about all i found at the haunted house that was important said tom after the message had gone but ive found out something here that may lead to something else of value  what is that questioned sam  there is a fellow hanging around here named henry parwick he is rather dissipated and does not seem to work for a living one night this parwick had been drinking pretty freely and he got into a quarrel with one of his companions they taunted each other about money and parwick said he had some good friends up to brill who would give him all the cash he wanted the other fellow wanted to know that was and parwick winked one eye and answered oh theres a reason buddy a good reason they wouldnt dare to refuse me since that time i have seen parwick talking to jerry koswell and bart larkspur  do you think this parwick helped koswell and the others in a plot against us asked dick  it may be so anyway i think parwick has some kind of a hold on koswell for i saw jerry give him some money  this is certainly interesting mused dick do you suppose we could corner this parwick and get him to talk  we might but i have another plan  what is that  to watch parwick and follow him when i think he is going to meet koswell and the others i may be able to overhear their talk  good  after that dick and sam told tom of what had occurred at the college since their brother had left sam was just relating the particulars of a stormy interview with professor sharp when dick uttered a cry  look here comes dora and she is running  one after another the brothers ran down to the ground floor of the hotel and hurried outside  oh i am so glad i found you all together cried dora panting for breath come quick  where to queried dick  down the road about half a mile we just saw that jerry koswell and bart larkspur and they are having a quarrel with a man who acts as if he was half intoxicated  it must be henry parwick ejaculated tom  yes his name is parwick said dora we heard koswell mention it  where are they asked sam as the whole party hurried down the main street and out of ashton dora leading the way  they are at a cottage where an old woman named brice lives we were going to stop for a drink of water when we heard voices and saw the young men then nellie and grace heard them mention you and they asked me to come here and get you just as quickly as possible they said they would remain and if possible hear what it was all about  i think we are on the right track cried dick joyfully maybe matters will come to a head quicker than we imagined  dick you stay with dora cried tom come on sam and off the two brothers sped at top speed leaving dick and dora to follow as rapidly as the strength of the girl would permit  curiosity lent strength to the legs of the two rovers and they covered the distance to the brice cottage in an incredibly short space of time as they came into view they beheld grace watching for them she held up her hand for caution she was standing in among some bushes by the roadside  be careful or those wicked boys will see you she cried in a low voice they are back of the cottage near the barn  where is nellie asked tom  she is watching them  have you learned anything asked sam  yes indeed we have learned that koswell larkspur and flockley were guilty of this plot against you and that a man named parwick aided them by getting a strange powder for them the powder that made you dizzy and sick were graces words and they filled the rovers with much satisfaction     chapter xxx  a beginning and an ending   it was allan charters coming that clinched matters said tom doctor wallington might not have believed us but he had to believe charter  he had to believe the girls too added dick he knew they would not tell him such falsehoods but i am glad charter came along he hated to get mixed up in it i know but he acted the man about it didnt he  wonder what the doctor will do with koswell  company questioned sam  fire em most likely and they deserve to be fired growled stanley oh when i think of the trick that was played i feel like wiping up the floor with every one of those scoundrels  it was certainly a bit of dirty work was dicks comment  the boys were seated in sam and toms room talking it over it was sunday afternoon and outside the sun shone brightly and a light breeze stirred the trees  it had proved a strenuous saturday afternoon and evening dick and dora had come up meeting allan charter the leading senior of brill on the way they had persuaded charter to accompany them to the brice cottage and there all had witnessed a bitter quarrel between henry parwick and koswell larkspur and flockley parwick was semiintoxicated and in a maudlin way had exposed all that had been done at the haunted house he had spoken about getting the powder for them and mentioned how koswell had fixed a fuse and lit it and he told of getting the liquor bottles and flasks and other things he had warmed up during his recital and had demanded fifty dollars on the spot when refused he had threatened to go to the brill authorities and blow everything then koswell had threatened if this was done that he would have parwick arrested for robbing his former employer william schlemp then had come blows and in the midst of this charter had stepped forward and confronted the evildoers  we have seen and heard all he had said sternly i am a witness and so are these young ladies you koswell flockley and larkspur ought to be ashamed of yourselves i never dreamed any students of brill could be so bad i shall report to doctor wallington without delay  charter had been as good as his word and had been closeted with the head of the college for an hour the girls went back with tom dick and sam and also had an interview with the president then doctor wallington sent for flockley koswell and larkspur only flockley answered the summons and it was learned that koswell and larkspur were afraid to come back fearing arrest parwick had also disappeared then had come a telegram from dan baxter giving the address of the druggist schlemp word was sent to this man and later he wrote that parwick had once worked for him but had been discharged for drunkenness and because he was not honest  the interview between doctor wallington and flockley was a most affecting one the dudish student broke down utterly and confessed all he said koswell had hatched out the plot aided by larkspur and that he himself had been a more or less unwilling participant he told much about parwick and how that dissolute fellow had spoken of having the strange powder which was a japanese concoction and which if used often would render a person insane he begged the good doctor to forgive him and said he would be willing to do anything in order to remain at brill  my father will never forgive me if i am dismissed he said in a broken voice  but supposing i had dismissed the rovers and stanley browne asked the doctor severely  yes yes i know sir wailed flockley but oh sir dont send me away ill do anything if youll let me stay  i will think it over answered the head of brill shortly and thus flockley was dismissed from the office  it was certainly a wicked piece of work said songbird to the others in the room i really think somebody ought to be arrested  tom was about to speak when a footstep sounded in the hall and a knock on the door followed sam opened the portal to behold flockley standing there hat in hand the dudish student was as white as the wall his clothing looked dishevelled and his shoes were unblacked a great contrast to the flockley of old  what do you want asked sam abruptly  i wanti want commenced flockley brokenly then he stepped into the room and confronted dick oh rover he cried wont youwont you please please get doctor wallington to let me stay at brill please dont let him send me home ill do anythingapologize get down on my knees if you likebut please help me to stay here  flockley caught dick by the arm and continued to plead and then he entreated sam tom and stanley also it was a truly affecting scene they all commenced to speak he had been so mean wicked so unlike a decent college fellow how could they forgive him  and then came a pause and during that pause a distant church bell sounded out full and clear across the hills surrounding brill dick listened and so did his brothers and stanley and the anger in their faces died down  well im willing you should stay said dick and ill speak to the doctor about it if you wish  and so will i added sam and tom and stanley nodded  but you ought to cut such fellows as koswell and larkspur said tom  i will i will said flockley earnestly  the rovers and stanley browne were as good as their word on the following day they had another interview with the head of the college and spoke of flockley  well if you desire it he can remain said doctor wallington as for koswell and larkspur i doubt if they wish to return since they have not yet shown themselves you can prosecute them if you wish  no we dont want to do that said dick we have talked it over and we think for the honor of brill the least said the better  that conclusion does you much credit and i feel greatly relieved said the head of the college he turned to tom you are of course reinstated thomas and i shall see to it that the marks placed against your name are wiped out i sincerely trust that you and professor sharp will allow bygones to be bygones and will make a new beginning  im willing answered tom and a little later he entered one of the classrooms and he and professor sharp shook hands after school professor blackie came up and shook hands all around  i am glad to know you are exonerated said that professor this has taught me a lesson to take nothing for granted he added  when the truth became known many of the students flocked around the rovers and stanley and songbird and congratulated them on the outcome of the affair flockley did not show himself for a long time excepting at meals and during class hours  he feels his position keenly said dick well i hope he turns over a new leaf  a telegram for richard rover said one of the teachers to the boys a few days later  wonder whats up now mused dick as he tore open the yellow envelope he read the slip inside hurrah this is the best news yet he cried  what is it asked tom and sam  the injunction against the stanhopes and the lanings is dissolved by the court they can keep the fortune tad sobber has had his case thrown out of court  say thats great ejaculated tom and in the fullness of his spirits he turned a handspring  i reckon thats the end of mr tad sobber said sam but the youngest rover was mistaken though beaten in court sobber did not give up all idea of gaining possession of the fortune and what he did next will be related in another volume to be called the rover boys down east or the struggle for the stanhope fortune in that book we shall also meet jerry koswell and bart larkspur once more and learn how they tried again to injure our friends  but for the time being all went well and the rover boys were exceedingly happy as soon as possible they met the girls and all spent a happy half day in taking another ride in an automobile from flockley they gradually learned how koswell and larkspur had done many mean things including putting the glass in the roadway and using the pencil box out of toms dresssuit case  vacation will soon be at hand cried sam one day and then  well have the best time ever known finished tom  ah vacation time put in songbird i have composed some verses about that season they run like this  not today songbird interrupted dick ive got to bone away at my geometry  then hurry up dick said sam i want you to come and play ball  ball it isin half an hour answered dick and then he added softly to himself then i guess ill write a good long letter to dora  the end
