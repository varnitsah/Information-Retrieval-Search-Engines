his big mouth   everybody knows that grandfather frog has a big mouth of course it wouldnt be possible to look him straight in the face and not know that he has a big mouth in fact about all you see when you look grandfather frog full in the face are his great big mouth and two great big goggly eyes he seems then to be all mouth and eyes  anyway that is what peter rabbit says peter never will forget the first time he saw grandfather frog peter was very young then he had run away from home to see the great world and in the course of his wanderings he came to the smiling pool never before had he seen so much water the most water he had ever seen before was a little puddle in the lone little path so when peter who was only half grown then hopped out on the bank of the smiling pool and saw it dimpling and smiling in the sunshine he thought it the most wonderful thing he ever had seen the truth is that in those days peter was in the habit of thinking everything he saw for the first time the most wonderful thing yet and as he was continually seeing new things and as his eyes always nearly popped out of his head whenever he saw something new it is a wonder that he didnt become popeyed  peter stared and stared at the smiling pool and little by little he began to see other things first he noticed the bulrushes growing with their feet in the water they looked to him like giant grass and he began to be a little fearful lest this should prove to be a sort of magic placea place of giants then he noticed the lilypads and he stared very hard at these they looked like growing things and yet they seemed to be floating right on top of the water it wasnt until a merry little breeze came along and turned the edge of one up so that peter saw the long stem running down in the water out of sight that he was able to understand how those lilypads could be growing there he was still staring at those lilypads when a great deep voice said  chugarum chugarum dont you know it isnt polite to stare at people  that voice was so unexpected and so deep that peter was startled he jumped started to run then stopped he wanted to run but curiosity wouldnt let him he simply couldnt run away until he had found out where that voice came from and to whom it belonged it seemed to peter that it had come from right out of the smiling pool but look as he would he couldnt see any one there  if you please said peter timidly im not staring at anybody all the time he was staring down into the smiling pool with eyes fairly popping out of his head  chugarum have a care young fellow have a care how you talk to your elders do you mean to be impudent enough to tell me to my face that i am not anybody the voice was deeper and gruffer than ever and it made peter more uncomfortable than ever  oh no sir no indeed exclaimed peter i dont mean anything of the kind iiwell if you please sir i dont see you at all so how can i be staring at you im sure from the sound of your voice that you must be somebody very important please excuse me for seeming to stare i was just looking for you that is all  a little movement in the water close to a big green lilypad caught peters eyes and then out on the big green lilypad climbed grandfather frog if peter had stared before he doubly stared now eyes and mouth wide open grandfather frog was looking his very best in his handsome green coat and whiteandyellow waistcoat but peter had hardly noticed these at all  why youre all mouth he exclaimed and then looked very much ashamed of his impoliteness  grandfather frogs great goggly eyes twinkled he knew that peter was very young and innocent and just starting out in the great world he knew that peter didnt intend to be impolite  not quite said he goodnaturedly not quite all mouth though i must admit that it is of good size the fact is i wouldnt have it a bit smaller if i could if it were any smaller i should miss many a good meal and if i were forced to do that i am afraid i should be very illtempered indeed the truth is i am very proud of my big mouth i dont know of any one who has a bigger one for their size  he opened his mouth wide and it seemed to peter that grandfather frogs whole head simply split in halves he hadnt supposed anybody in all the great world possessed such a mouth  where did you get it gasped peter and then felt that he had asked a very foolish question  grandfather frog chuckled i got it from my father and he got his from his father and so on way back to the days when the world was young and the frogs ruled the world said he would you like to hear about it  id love to cried peter so he settled himself comfortably on the bank of the smiling pool for the first of many many stories he was to hear from grandfather frog  chugarum began grandfather frog you know he always begins a story that way chugarum once upon a time the great world was mostly water and most of the people lived in the water it was in those days that my greatgreateversogreatgrandfather lived those were happy days for the frogs yes indeed those were happy days for the frogs of course they had enemies but those enemies were all in the water they didnt have to be watching out for danger from the air and from the land as i do now there was plenty to eat and little to do and the frog tribe increased very fast in fact the frogs increased so fast that after a while there wasnt plenty to eat that is there wasnt plenty of the kind of food they had been used to which was mostly water plants and water bugs and such things  of course there were many fish and these also increased very fast and the big fish ate the frogs whenever they could catch them just as they do to this day the big fish also ate the little fish and it wasnt long before the frogs and the little fish took to living where the water was not deep enough for the big fish to swim and this made it all the harder to get enough to eat the mouths of the frogs in those days were not big in fact they were quite small you see living on the kind of food they did they had no need of big mouths  one day as a greatgreateversogreatgrandfather frog sat with just his head out of water wondering what it would seem like to have his stomach really filled a school of little fish came swimming about him and it popped into his head that if little fish were good for big fish to eat they might be good for a frog to eat so he caught the first one that came within reach and he found it was good to eat he liked it so well that after that he caught fish whenever he could of course he swallowed them whole he had to because he had no chewing or biting teeth  now the frogs always have been famous for their appetites and greatgrandfather frog found that it took a great many of these teeny weeny fish to make a comfortable meal he was thinking of this one day when a larger fish came within reach and almost without realizing what he was doing greatgrandfather snapped at and caught him he caught the fish by the tail and at once began to swallow it which of course was no way to swallow a fish but greatgrandfather frog had much to learn in those day and so he tried to swallow that fish tail first instead of head first he got the tail down and the smallest part of the body and then that fish stuck yes sir that fish stuck the fact was greatgrandfather frogs mouth wasnt wide enough it was bad enough not to be able to swallow all of that fish but what was worse was the discovery that he couldnt get up again what he had swallowed that fish was stuck it would go neither down nor up  poor greatgrandfather frog was in a terrible fix big tears rolled down his cheeks he choked and choked and choked until it looked very much as if he might choke to death just in time in the very nick of time who should come along but old mother nature she saw right away what the trouble was and she pulled out the fish then she asked how that fish had happened to be in such a place as greatgrandfather frogs mouth when he could get his breath he told her all about ithow food had been getting scarce and how he had discovered that fish were good to eat and how he had make a mistake in catching a fish too big for his mouth old mother nature looked thoughtful she saw the great numbers of young fish suddenly she reached over and put a finger in greatgrandfather frogs mouth and stretched it sideways then she did the same thing to the other corner greatgrandfather frogs mouth was three times as big as it had been before  now said she i dont believe youll have any more trouble and im going to do the same thing for all the other frogs  she did that very day and from then on the frogs no longer had any trouble in getting plenty to eat so that is where i got my big mouth and i tell you right now i wouldnt trade it for anything anybody else has got concluded grandfather frog as he snapped up a foolish green fly who came too near  i think it is splendid perfectly splendid cried peter i wish i had one just like it and then he wondered why grandfather frog laughed so hard     ii  where miser the trade rat first set up shop   it was quite by accident that peter rabbit first heard of miser the trade rat you know how it is with peter he is forever using those big ears of his to learn interesting things that is what ears are for but there is a right way and a wrong way to use them and i am afraid that peter isnt always overparticular in this respect i suspect in fact i know that peter sometimes listens when he has no business to listen and knows he has no business to listen again he sometimes overhears things quite by accident when he cannot very well help hearing it was in this way that he first heard of miser the trade rat  peter had crept into a hollow log in the green forest to rest and to feel absolutely safe while he was doing it he had been there only a little while when he heard light footsteps outside and a moment later a voice which made him shiver a little in spite of himself and the knowledge that he was perfectly safe the footsteps and the voice were old man coyotes  very carefully peter peeped out old man coyote had sat down close by the log in which peter was hiding on a dead tree close at hand sat ol mistah buzzard who had come up from way down south for the summer and it was to him that old man coyote was talking  i was over by farmer browns barn last night said old man coyote and i caught a glimpse of robber the brown eat what a disgrace he is to the whole rat tribe for that matter he is a disgrace to all who live on the green meadows and in the green forest he isnt much like his cousin miser the trade rat  mah goodness do yo know miser exclaimed ol mistah buzzard  do i know miser i should say i do replied old man coyote ive tried to catch him enough times to know him he kept a junk shop very near where i used to live way out west do you know him mr buzzard  ah certnly does chuckled ol mistah buzzard ah certnly does ah never did see such a busy fellow as he is ah done see his junk shop many times and always it done be growin bigger ah wonders brer coyote if yo ever heard the story of his greatgreateversogreatgrandaddy the first of the family and how and where he started the business thats been kept in the family ever since  no said old man coyote i never did and ive wondered about it a great deal  peter rabbit almost forgot that he was hiding he was so eager to hear that story that he was right on the point of speaking up and begging ol mistah buzzard to tell it when he remembered old man coyote just in the nick of time he clapped a hand over his mouth it seemed to peter a long long time before old man coyote said  id like to hear that story mr buzzard if it isnt too much to ask of you  not at all brer coyote not at all ahll be morn pleased to tell it to yo ah certnly will said ol mistah buzzard and peter settled himself comfortably to listen  yo see it was this way began ol mistah buzzard ah got it from mah grandaddy and he got it from his grandaddy and his grandaddy got it from  i know interrupted old man coyote it was handed down from your greatestgreatgrandfather who lived in the days when the world was young and what you are going to tell me about happened isnt that it  yes suh replied ol mistah buzzard yes suh thats it ol mother nature treat em all alike in those days shes a right smart busy person and she aint got no time fo to answer foolish questions no suh she aint so quick as she get a new kind of critter made she turn him loose and tell him if he want to live he got to be right smart and find out for hisself how to do it ah reckons yo know all about that brer coyote  old man coyote nodded and ol mistah buzzard scratched his bald head gently as if trying to stir up his memory peter rabbit almost squealed aloud in his impatience while he waited for ol mistah buzzard to go on  when ol mother nature made brer trade rat in the beginning and turned him loose in the great world he was just plain mistah rat and nothing more same as his no count cousin robber the brown rat continued ol mistah buzzard he had to win a name for hisself same as evybody else he had mighty sharp wits had this mistah rat and directly he found he had to shift for hisself he began to study and study and study what he gwine to do to live well and be happy he watched his neighbors to see what they did and it didnt take him long to find out that if he would be respected he must have a home those without homes were mostly no count folks same as they are today  so brer rat made a nest close to the trunk of a tree on the edge of the green forest a soft warm nest and in collectin the stuff to make it of he learned the joy of bein busy personly yo understand ah thinks he was all wrong ah never am so happy as when ah can take a sunbath with nothin to do but brer rat was never so happy as when he was busy and when he got that lil nest finished time began to hang heavy on his hands yes suh it certnly did just because he didnt have anything else to do he began to add a little more to his house one day he stepped on a thorn ouch cried brer rat and then right away forgot the pain in a new idea he would cover his house with thorns leavin just a little secret entrance for hisself then he would be safe wholly safe from his big neighbors some of whom had begun to look at him with such a hungry look in their eyes that they made him right smart uncomfortable so he spent his time did brer rat in huntin for the longest and sharpest thorns and in cuttin the branches on which they grew these he carried to his house and piled them around it and on it until it had become a great pile with sharp thorns stickin out in every direction and the hungriest of the big people of the forest passed it at a respectful distance  when brer rat had all the thorns he needed and more he began to collect other things and added these to his pile yo see he had found that it was great fun to collect things to find the queerest things he could and bring them home and look at them and wonder about them so little by little his house became a sort of junk shop the very first one in all the great world bright stones and shells bones anything that caught his bright eyes and pleased them he brought home when he was tired of huntin fo food or more strange things he would sit and gloat over his treasures and play with them and then the first thing he knew he had a name yes suh he had a name he was called miser  of course brer miser hadnt lived vey long befo he found out that one law of the great world was that things belonged to whoever could get them and keep them he saw that some thought themselves vey smart when they stole from their neighbors brer miser didnt like this at all he was vey yey honest was brer miser perhaps he wasnt really much tempted not fo a long time anyway  but at last came a time when he was tempted quite by accident he found one of mr squirrels storehouses in it were some nuts different from any he ever had seen befo brer squirrel wont mind if ah taste just one said he and did it it tasted good it tasted vey good indeed brer miser began to wish he had some nuts like those when he got home he couldnt think of anything but how good those nuts tasted he knew that all he had to do was to watch until brer squirrel was away and then go hep hisself he knew that was just what any of his neighbors would do in his place but brer miser couldnt make it seem just right any way he looked at it he was too honest was brer miser to do anything like that  he was sitting staring at his treasures but thinking about those nuts when an idea popped into his head an idea that made him smile until ah reckons he most split his cheeks ah knows what ahll do said he ahll just hep mahself to some of those nuts and ahll leave something of mine in place of them thats what ahll do  and thats what he did do he picked out a bright shell of which he was very fond and he left it in brer squirrels storehouse to pay fo the nuts that he took after that he always helped himself to anything he wanted but he always left something to pay fo it it wasnt long befo his neighbors found out what he was doing and then they called him miser the trade rat whenever anybody found something he didnt want hisself he took it to the little junk shop of miser the trade rat and traded it fo something else or left it where miser would find it knowing that miser would leave something in its place  and its been just so with misers family ever since there is one rat who is a credit to his family instead of a disgrace concluded ol mistah buzzard     iii  where yapyap the prairie dog used his wits   peter rabbit had just had a great fright he is used to having great frights but this time it was a different kind of a fright it was not for himself that he had been afraid but for one of his old friends and neighbors now that it was over peter drew a little breath of sheer relief  you see it was this way peter had started over for a call on johnny chuck when he reached johnny chucks house he found no one at home at first he thought he would go look for johnny for he knew that johnny must be somewhere near as he never goes far from his own doorstep then he changed his mind and decided to wait for johnny to return so he stretched himself out in some tall grass beside johnny chucks house intending to jump out and give johnny a scare when he came home hardly had he settled himself when he heard johnny coming and he knew by the sounds that johnny was running from some danger  very very carefully peter raised his head to see then he ducked it again and held his breath johnny chuck was running as peter never had seen him run before and with very good reason just a few jumps behind johnnys twinkling little black heels was old man coyote it looked to peter as if old man coyote certainly would catch johnny chuck this time he was so frightened for johnny that he quite forgot that he himself might be in danger head first through his doorway plunged johnny and old man coyotes teeth snapped together on nothing  old man coyote backed away a few steps and sat down with his head on one side as he studied johnny chucks house in the ground it was plain to be seen that he was trying to make up his mind whether it would be worth while to try to dig johnny out presently johnny came halfway up his long hall where he could look out then he began to scold old man coyote old man coyote grinned  i give up johnny chuck said he you did well when you made your home between the roots of this old tree if it wasnt for those roots i certainly would dig you out as it is you are safe you remind me very much of your cousin yapyap the prairie dog who lives out where i came from theres a fellow who certainly knows how to make a house in the ground he doesnt have to depend on the roots of trees to keep from being dug out well i guess it is a waste of time to hang around here youll make just as good a dinner some other time as you would now so ill wait until then old man coyote grinned wickedly and trotted off  now at the mention of yapyap the prairie dog the long ears of peter rabbit had pricked up at once it was the first time he had heard of yapyap and when at last johnny chuck ventured out peter was as full of questions as a peapod is of peas but johnny chuck knew nothing about his cousin yapyap and wasnt even interested in him so finally peter left him and went back home to the dear old briarpatch but he couldnt get yapyap out of his mind and he resolved that the first chance he got he would ask old man coyote about him the chance came that very night old man coyote came along by the dear old briarpatch and stopped to peer in and grin at peter peter grinned back for he knew that under those friendly brambles he was quite safe  i heard what you said to johnny chuck about his cousin yapyap said peter  old man coyote looked as surprised as he felt where were you he demanded gruffly  lying flat in the grass close by johnny chucks house replied peter and grinned more broadly than ever  and to think i didnt know it sighed old man coyote when i failed to catch johnny chuck i thought i had missed only one dinner but it seems i missed two next time i shall look around a little more sharply do you know the sight of johnny chuck always makes me homesick he reminds me so much of his cousin yapyap and the days when i was young  i didnt know that johnny chuck had a cousin until you mentioned it said peter does he look like johnny wont you tell me about him mr coyote  seeing that i havent anything in particular to do i dont know but i will replied old man coyote who happened to be feeling very goodnatured many and many a time i have chased yapyap into his house seems as if i can hear the rascal scolding me and calling me names right this minute he used to get me so provoked that it was all i could do to keep from trying to dig him out  why didnt you asked peter  because it would have meant a waste of time sore feet and nothing to show for my trouble retorted old man coyote yapyap never has forgotten what his greatgreateversogreatgrandfather learned when he first took to living on the open prairie  what did he learn tell me about it mr coyote begged peter  he learned to use his wits replied old man coyote with a provoking grin he learned to use his wits thats all  please tell me about it mr coyote please begged peter  once upon a time began old man coyote so my grandfather told me and he got it from his grandfather who got it from his grandfather who  i know interrupted peter it happened in the days when the world was young  old man coyote looked at peter very hard as if he had half a mind not to tell the story but peter looked so innocent and so eager that he began again once upon a time lived the greatgreateversogreatgrandfather of yapyap the very first of all the prairie dogs and his name was yapyap too he was own cousin to old mr woodchuck who of course wasnt old then and the two cousins looked much alike save that yapyap was a little smaller than mr woodchuck and perhaps a little smarter looking  from the very beginning yapyap was a keen lover of the great open spaces trees were all very well for those who liked them but he preferred to have nothing above him but the blue blue sky it seemed to him that he never could find a big enough open space so he never stayed very long in any one place but kept pushing on and on looking for a spot in the great world that would just suit him at last he came to the edge of the green forest and before him as far as he could see stretched the green meadows at least it was like the green meadows only a million thousand times as big as the green meadows we are on now peter and was really the great prairie  yapyap looked and looked then he drew a long breath of pure joy and started out across the green grass on and on he went until when he sat up and looked this way or that way or the other way he could see nothing but grass and flowers and over him was naught but the blue blue sky he had found the great open space of which he had dreamed and he was happy so he ate and slept and played with the merry little breezes and grew fat  then one day came skimmer the swallow and brought him news of the hard times which had come to the rest of the great world and how as a result the big and the strong were hunting the small and the weak in order that they themselves might live when skimmer had gone yapyap grew uneasy what if some of the big and strong people he had known should come out there in quest of food and should find him there was no place in which to hide there was no cave or hollow log  yapyap looked at the strong claws old mother nature had given him and an idea came to him he would dig a hole in the ground so he dug a hole on a long slant very much like the hole of johnny chuck but when it was finished a little doubt crept into his head and grew and grew what was to prevent some one who was very hungry from digging him out so he moved on a little way and started another hole and this time he made it almost straight down every day he made that hole deeper until it was many feet deep then he made a turn in it and dug a long tunnel at the end of which he hollowed out a comfortable bedroom and lined it with grass when it was finished he was quite satisfied  i dont believe said he that any one will have the patience to dig to the bottom of this  so at night he slept in his bed at the end of his long hall far below the surface but all day he spent above ground for he dearly loved the sunshine all went well until there came a time of heavy rains then yapyap discovered that the water ran down his hole and if he didnt do something he was likely to be drowned out right away he set his sharp wits to work he noticed that when the water on the surface reached the little piles of sand he had made it ran around them so he made a great mound of sand around his hole with the entrance in the middle and pressed it firm on the inside so that the rain would not wash it down in then although the water stood all around it no longer ran down in his house in fair weather that mound was a splendid place on which to sit and watch for danger so once more yapyap was happy and carefree all because he had used his wits  and from that day to this the prairie dogs have made their houses in just that way and no one that i know cares to try to dig one out concluded old man coyote     iv  where yellowwing got his liking for the ground   peter rabbit was hopping along on the edge of the green meadows looking for a new patch of sweet clover it was very beautiful that morning and peter was in the best of spirits it was good just to be alive every once in a while peter would jump up and kick his long heels together just from pure happiness he was so happy that he didnt pay particular attention to where he was going or what was about him the result was that peter got a fright right from under his very nose something sprang out of the grass so suddenly and so wholly unexpectedly that peter very nearly tumbled over backward he made two long jumps off to one side and then turned to see what had startled him so but all he saw was an old feathered acquaintance headed towards the old orchard he seemed to bound along through the air much as peter bounds along over the ground when he is in a hurry it was yellowwing the flicker  peter grinned and looked a little foolish he felt a little foolish you know it always makes you feel foolish to be frightened when there is nothing to be afraid of peter watched yellowwing until he disappeared among the trees of the old orchard from which presently his voice sounded clear and loud and in it there was a mocking note as if yellowwing were laughing at him peter suspected that he was but peter was feeling too happy to mind being laughed at in fact he chuckled himself it was something of a joke to be frightened by one who was so wholly harmless peter recalled how many times he had frightened other people and thought it the best of jokes  peter went on until he found a new patch of sweet clover then he forgot all about yellowwing he was too busy filling that big stomach of his to think of anything else when he couldnt find room for another leaf of clover he went home to the dear old briarpatch and there in his favorite spot he settled himself to rest and think or dream as the case might be presently his thoughts returned to yellowwing and he chuckled again at the memory of his fright that morning and then for the first time it struck peter as queer that yellowwing should have been out there on the green meadows on the ground he often had seen yellowwing on the ground but until that moment there never had seemed anything queer about that now however it suddenly came to peter that yellowwing belonged in trees not on the ground  peter scratched his long left ear with his long left hind foot which was a sign that he was thinking of something that puzzled him he belongs to the woodpecker family thought peter and never have i seen any of his relatives on the ground they get all their food in the trees now why is yellowwing so different from his relatives  the more peter thought about it the queerer it seemed that a woodpecker should spend so much time on the ground or visit the ground at all for that matter but just wondering about it didnt get him anywhere and at last peter decided that the only way to find out would be to ask questions so peter made up his mind to watch for yellowwing and ask him all about it the first chance he got  the chance came the very next day in the very same place where peter had been so startled this time he was on the watch and saw yellowwing very busy about something peter stole up within speaking distance  good morning yellowwing said he i wonder if you will tell me something  it was yellowwings turn to be startled for he had not seen peter approaching he half lifted his wings to fly but when he saw who it was he changed his mind  it all depends on what it is you want me to tell you he replied rather shortly  it is just this replied peter why do you spend so much time on the ground  thats easily answered laughed fellowwing i do it because it is the easiest way to get enough to eat  peter looked as surprised as he felt i thought that all your family got their living in the trees he exclaimed  all do but me replied yellowwing a wee bit testily but i dont have to do what they do just because they do it no siree im independent do you like ants peter  what exclaimed peter  i asked if you like ants repeated yellowwing  ive never tried them peter replied but ive heard old mr toad say they are very nice  they are said yellowwing they are more than nicethey are delicious it is because of them that i spend so much time on the ground ants changed the habits of the flicker branch of the woodpecker family i wouldnt be surprised if we became regular ground birds one of these days  peter looked puzzled he kept turning it over in his mind as he watched yellowwing plunge his long stout bill into an ant hill and then gobble up the ants as they came rushing out to see what the trouble was  i dont see how ants could change the habits of anybody he ventured after a while  yellowwings eyes twinkled why dont you learn to eat them he demanded if you would they might change your habits the beginning of the change in the habits of my folks began a long time ago  way back in the beginning of things when the world was young asked peter  no not quite so far back as that replied yellowwing greatgreateversogreatgrandfather who was the first flicker was of course a member of the woodpecker family and he got his living in regular woodpecker fashion it never entered his head to look for food anywhere but in the trees and i dont suppose that it ever entered his head to set foot on the ground it was the same with his children and his childrens children for a long time  but though they lived as true woodpeckers should the flickers always were a bit sharperwitted and more independent than most of their relatives for one thing they had discovered that ants were fine eating and that great numbers of them were to be found running up and down the trunks of certain trees so the flickers used to look for these trees and feast on the ants it saved a lot of labor a stomachful of ants could be picked from the trunk of a tree in the time it would take to dig out one worm in the wood to say nothing of the saving of hard work  one day a few years ago my greatgreatgreatgrandfather so the story goes had stuffed himself with ants from the trunk of a tree and had settled himself for a rest from where he sat he could see a procession of ants going up and down the tree and he got to wondering where they all came from and where they all went to so he watched and presently discovered that that double line of ants led out along the ground from the foot of the tree this made him still more curious and he followed it flying along just over it he had gone but a short distance when he came to a little mound of sand and there the line of ants ended grandfather flicker flew up in a tree from which he could look right down on that mound and it didnt take him long to discover that those ants were going in and out of little holes in that mound  as i live that must be their home exclaimed he that place is alive with them what a place to fill ones stomach i never was on the ground in my life but the next time im hungry im going to see what the ground is like i wont have to stay on it long to get my dinner here  grandfather flicker was as good as his word when he was ready for another meal he flew down to that ant hill he found that when he plunged his bill into it the ants fairly poured out to see what was happening and all he had to do was to thrust out his long sticky tongue and lick them up never in all his life before had he filled his stomach so easily after that instead of wasting time hunting for worms and insects in the trees where he could find only one at a time grandfather flicker kept his eyes open for ant hills on the ground he taught his children to do the same thing that was the beginning of the change of habits with the flickers ever since we have spent more and more time on the ground so that now we feel quite at home there we still get some of our food in the trees by way of variety and we make our homes there but a good big part of our food we get just as i am doing now  with this yellowwing once more plunged his bill into the ant hill and licked up a dozen ants who had come rushing out to see what was going on and so once more the curiosity of peter rabbit was satisfied and he had learned something     v  where little chief learned to make hay   no one in all the great world thinks more of the present and less of the future than does careless happygolucky peter rabbit everybody who knows peter at all knows that peter doesnt waste any time worrying over what may happen in a day that may never be so peter isnt thrifty as are happy jack squirrel and chatterer the red squirrel and whitefoot the wood mouse and paddy the beaver and striped chipmunk  ive got enough to eat today and enough is enough so what is the use of working when i dont have to says peter i dont believe in working today so that i wont have to work tomorrow because when tomorrow comes there may be no need of working and then i would feel that i had wasted all this good time today no peter isnt the least bit thrifty  it is the same way with peters big cousin jumper the hare the truth is the whole family is happygolucky happy jack squirrel says that every blessed one of them is shiftless it does look that way it is a pity that peter and jumper never have learned a lesson from little chief hare who is commonly supposed to be a relative of theirs although as a matter of fact he is neither a hare nor a rabbit but is a pika which is another family altogether he is also called a coney and sometimes the calling hare but if you want sureenough proof that he is neither a rabbit nor a hare just watch him if you are lucky enough to have a chance cut and dry and store away a great pile of hay for winter use no true member of peters family ever would think of doing such a thing as that more is the pity  peter never has seen little chief because little chief lives high up on a mountain of the far west among the rocks where peter would never go even if he could but he has heard all about him old man coyote told him all about him and he got the story from his grandfather who got it from his grandfather who had one time visited the great mountain where little chiefs eversogreatgrandfather lived in the very place where little chief lives now old man coyote had chased peter into the dear old briarpatch one cold winter day and as he peered through the brambles at peter he noticed that peter was very thin very thin indeed old man coyote grinned  im just as well pleased not to have caught you this time peter said he you wouldnt make much of a dinner just now when i dine i want something more than skin and bones it must be that you are having as hard work as i am to get a living these days  i am replied peter with all this snow and ice on the ground there is nothing to eat but bark and such tender twigs as i can reach and they are not very filling but theyll keep me alive until better times come and then perhaps ill get fat enough to suit you it was peters turn to grin  old man coyote grinned back goodnaturedly i should think peter said he that when there is so much sweet grass and clover in the summer you would make some of it into hay and store it away for winter as little chief hare does theres the thrifty little haymaker for you  who is little chief and where did he learn to make hay demanded peter his ears standing straight up with curiosity  old man coyote likes to tell a story once in a while and having nothing else to do just then he sat down just outside the dear old briarpatch and told peter all about little chief and his haymaking  of course said he little chiefs father taught him how to make hay and his fathers father taught him and so on way back to the days when the world was young and old mother nature made the first pika or coney whichever you please to call him and set him free on a great mountain to prove whether he was worthy to live or was so helpless that there was no place for him in the great world now mr pika who was promptly called little chief no one remembers now just why was exactly like little chief of today he was just about a fourth as big as you peter in fact he looked a lot like one of your babies excepting his legs and his ears his legs were short and rather weak and his ears were short and rounded he was very gentle and timid he had neither the kind of teeth and claws for fighting nor long legs for running away and it did seem as if little chiefs chances of a long life and a happy one were very slim indeed especially as it happened that he was set free to shift for himself just at the beginning of the hard times when the big and strong had begun to hunt the small and weak  for a while little chief had a hard time of it and so many narrow escapes that his heart was in his mouth most of the time in trying to keep out of the way of his enemies he kept climbing higher and higher up the mountain for the higher he got the fewer enemies he found at last he came to a big rockslide above where the trees grew and where there was nothing but broken stone and big rocks the sun lay there very warm and little chief crept out among the stones to take a sunbath as he squatted there it would have taken keen eyes indeed to tell him from a stone himself though he didnt know this  after he had had a good rest and jolly mr sun had moved so that little chief was no longer in the warm rays little chief decided to look about a little it didnt take him long to discover that there were wonderful little winding galleries and hidingplaces down among the stones these led to little cracks and caves deep down in the mountain side little chief was tickled almost to death  this is the place for me he cried no one ever will think to look for me up here and if they should they couldnt find me for no one not even king bear could pull away these stones fast enough to catch me all day long i can enjoy the sun and at night i can sleep in perfect safety in one of these little caves  so little chief made his home in the rockslide high up on the mountain and was happy for it was just as he thought it would beno one thought of looking in that bare place for him for food he ate the pea vines and grasses and other green things that grew just at the edge of the rockslide and was perfectly happy one day he decided he would take some of his dinner into his little cave and eat it there so he cut a little bundle of pea vine and other green things he left his little bundle on a flat rock in the sun while he went to look for something else and then forgot all about it it didnt enter his head again until a few days later he happened along by that flat rock and discovered that little bundle the pea vines and grasses were quite dry just like the hay farmer browns boy helps his father store away in the barn every summer  i guess i dont want to eat that said little chief but it will make me a very nice bed so he carried it home and made a bed of it there wasnt quite enough so the next day he cut some more and carried it home at once but this being green soon soured and smelled so badly that he was forced to take it out and throw it away that set him to thinking why was the first he had brought in so dry and sweet and pleasant why didnt it spoil as the other had done he cut some more and spread it out on the big flat rock and once again he forgot when he remembered and went to look at it two or three days later he found it just like the first dry and sweet and very pleasant to smell this he took home to add to his bed then he took home some more that was green and this spoiled just as the other had done  little chief was puzzling over this as he squatted on a rock taking a sunbath the sun was very warm and comforting after a while the rock on which he sat grew almost hot little chief had brought along a couple of pieces of pea vine on which to lunch but not being hungry he left them beside him on the rock by and by he happened to glance at them they had wilted and already they were beginning to dry an idea popped into his funny little head  its the sun that does it he cried  up he jumped and scampered away to cut some more and spread it out on the rocks then he discovered that the pea vine which he spread in the sun dried as he wanted it to while any that happened to be left in the shadow of a rock didnt dry so well he had learned how to make hay he was the first haymaker in the great world he soon had more than enough for a bed but he kept on making hay and storing it away just for fun then came cold weather and all the green things died there was no food for little chief he hunted and hunted but there was nothing then because he was so hungry he began to nibble at his hay it tasted good very good indeed it tasted almost as good as the fresh green things little chiefs heart gave a great leap he had food in plenty he had nothing to worry about for his hay would last him until the green things came again as come they would he felt sure  and so it proved and that is how little chief the pika learned to make hay while the sun shone in the days of plenty he taught his children and they taught their children and little chief of today does it just as his greatgreateversogreatgranddaddy did i dont see why you dont do the same thing peter you would make me a great deal finer dinner if you did  perhaps that is the reason i dont replied peter with a grin  illustration little chiefs father taught him how to make hay page 67     vi  where glutton the wolverine got his name   glutton the wolverine is a dweller in the depths of the great forests of the far north and it is doubtful if peter rabbit would ever have known that there is such a person but for his acquaintance with honker the goose who spends his summers in the far north but each spring and fall stops over for a day or two in a little pond in the green forest a pond peter often visits this acquaintance with honker and peters everlasting curiosity have resulted in many strange stories at least they have seemed strange to peter because they have been about furred and feathered people whom peter has never seen and one of the strangest of these is the story of how glutton the wolverine got his name  of course you know what a glutton is it is one who is very very very greedy and eats and eats as if eating were the only thing in life worth while it is one who is all the time thinking of his stomach no one likes to be called a glutton so when honker the goose happened to mention glutton it caused peter to prick up his ears at once  whos a glutton he demanded  i didnt say any one was a glutton replied honker i was speaking of glutton the wolverine who lives in the great forests of the far north and whom everybody hates  is glutton his name asked peter wrinkling his brows in perplexity for it seemed a very queer name for any one  certainly replied honker certainly that is his name and a very good name for him it is but then of course it is because he is a glutton that he is named glutton rather i should say that is the reason the first wolverine was named glutton the name has been handed down ever since and it fits mr wolverine of today quite as well as ever it did his greatgreateversogreatgrandfather  tell me about it peter begged please tell me about it  tell you about what asked honker pretending not to understand  about how the first wolverine got the name of glutton replied peter promptly there must have been a very good reason and if there was a very good reason there must be a story please honker tell me all about it  honker swam a little way out from shore and with head held high and very still he looked and listened and listened and looked until he was quite certain that no danger lurked near then he swam back to where peter was sitting on the bank  peter said he i never in all my born days have seen such a fellow for questions as you are if i lived about here i think i should swim away every time i saw you coming but as i only stop here for a day or two twice a year i guess i can stand it besides you really ought to know something about some of the people who live in the great forest it is shameful peter that you should be so ignorant and so if you will promise not to ask for another story while i am here i will tell you about glutton the wolverine  of course peter promised he wanted that story so much that he would have promised anything so honker told the story and here it is just as peter heard it  once upon a time long long long ago the first wolverine was sent out to find a place for himself in the great world just as every one else had been sent out old mother nature had told him that he was related to mr weasel and mr mink and mr fisher and mr skunk but no one would have guessed it just to look at him in fact some of his new neighbors were inclined to think that he was related to old king bear certainly he looked more like king bear than he did like little mr weasel but for his bushy tail he would have looked still more like a member of the bear family he was clumsylooking he was rather slow moving but he was strong very strong for his size and he had a mean disposition yes sir mr wolverine had a mean disposition he had such a mean disposition that he would snarl at his own reflection in a pool of water  now you know as well as i do that no one with a mean disposition has any friends it was so with mr wolverine when his neighbors found out what a mean disposition he had they let him severely alone they would go out of their way to avoid meeting him this made his disposition all the meaner he didnt really care because his neighbors would have nothing to do with him no he didnt really care for the simple reason that he didnt want anything to do with them but just the same it made him angry to have them show that they didnt want to have anything to do with him every time he would see one of them turn aside to avoid meeting him he would snarl under his breath and his eyes would glow with anger he would resolve to get even  being slow in his movements because of his stout build he early realized that he must make nimble wits make up for the lack of nimble legs he also learned very early in life that patience is a virtue few possess and that patience and nimble wits will accomplish almost anything so living alone in the great forest he practised patience until no one in all the great world could be more patient than he no one knew this because you see everybody kept away from him and all the time he was practising patience he was studying and studying the other people of the great forest both large and small learning all their habits how they lived where they lived what they ate and all about them  one never knows when such knowledge may be useful he would say to himself the more i know about other people and the less they know about me the better  so mr wolverine kept out of sight as much as possible and none knew how he lived or where he lived or anything about him save that he had a mean disposition patiently he watched the other people especially those of nimble wits who lived largely by their cunning and clevernessmr fox mr coyote mr lynx and his own cousins mr mink and mr weasel from each one he learned something and at last he was more cunning and more clever than any of them or even than all of them for that matter  living alone as he did and having a mean disposition he grew more and more sullen and savage until those who at first had avoided him simply because of his mean disposition now kept out of his way through fear for his claws were long and his strength was great and his teeth were sharp it didnt take him long to discover that there were few who did not fear him and he cunningly contrived to increase this fear for he had a feeling that the time might come when it would be of use to him  the time did come as you know there came a time when food was scarce and everybody or almost everybody had hard work to get enough to keep alive mr wolverine didnt the fact is mr wolverine lived very well indeed he simply reaped the reward of his patience in learning all about the ways of his neighbors of his nimble wits and of the fear which he inspired instead of hunting for food himself he depended on his neighbors to hunt for him they didnt know they were hunting for him but somehow whenever one of them had secured a good meal mr wolverine was almost sure to happen along a growl from him was enough and that meal was left in his possession  knowing how scarce food was and the uncertainty of when he would get the next meal mr wolverine always made it a point on these occasions to stuff himself until it was a wonder his skin didnt burst if there was more than he could eat he would take a nap right there and because of fear of him the rightful owner of the food would not dare take what was left when he awoke mr wolverine would finish what remained  those who secured more food than they could eat and tried to store away the rest found that no matter how cunningly they chose a hidingplace for it and covered their tracks mr wolverine was sure to find it in fact he made a business of robbing storehouses and the habit of greediness became so strong that he would stuff himself at one storehouse and immediately start for another when it did happen that he couldnt eat all he found and yet didnt want to stay until he could finish it he would tear to bits all that remained and scatter it all about you know i told you he had a mean disposition  even when good times returned and there was no possible excuse for such greed mr wolverine continued to stuff himself until it seemed that instead of eating in order to live as the rest of us do he lived in order to eat of course it wasnt long before some one called him a glutton and presently he was named glutton and no one called him anything else glutton by name and a glutton in habit he remained as long as he lived both name and habits he handed down to his children and they to their children so it is that today there is no more cunning thief no greedier rascal and no one with a meaner disposition in all the great woods of the far north than glutton the wolverine  queer how a habit will stick isnt it said peter thoughtfully  particularly a bad habit added honker     vii  where old mrs gator made the first incubator   peter rabbit and mrs quack the mallard duck are great friends they have been great friends ever since peter tried to help mrs quack when she and mr quack had spent a whole summer on a little pond hidden deep in the green forest because mr quack had a broken wing and so he and mrs quack simply couldnt keep on to their home in the far north for which they had started during that long summer peter had become very well acquainted with them in fact he visited them very often for as you know peter is simply brimming over with curiosity and there were wonderful things which mr and mrs quack could tell him for they are great travelers  now once as mrs quack was telling peter about the faraway southland where she and mr quack and many other birds spend each winter she mentioned old ally the gator people who live where he does call him just gator but you and i would call him alligator  at the mention of old ally all peters curiosity was awakened for mrs quack had said that foolish young ducks sometimes mistook him for an old log floating in the water and didnt find out the difference until his great mouth flew open and he swallowed them whole at that peters eyes threatened to pop right out of his head and every time he visited that little pond he pestered mrs quack with questions about old ally the gator and mrs gator it seemed as if he couldnt think of anything else and when mrs quack just happened to mention that little gators are hatched from eggs just as her own children are it was almost too much for peter to believe  what he squealed hopping up and down in excitement do you mean to tell me that anything as big as old ally big enough to swallow you whole can come from an egg i dont believe it besides only birds lay eggs    quack quack quack quack quack quack quack    peter you must take that back  cried mrs quack  why must i take it back demanded peter  because as usual youve let your tongue run loose and that is a bad habit peter it certainly is a bad habit how about the snake family  oh said peter looking very foolish i forgot all about the snakes they do lay eggs  and how about spotty the turtle didnt he come from an egg persisted mrs quack  peter looked more foolish than before if that were possible yes he replied slowly and reluctantly  then dont be so quick to doubt a thing just because youve never seen it retorted mrs quack ive seen mrs gator build her nest more than once and ive seen her eggs and ive seen the baby gators and what is more im not in the habit of telling things that i dont know are so  i beg your pardon mrs quack peter was very humble i do indeed please forgive me isis mrs gators nest at all like yours  peter seemed so truly sorry for having doubted her that mrs quack recovered her good nature at once no said she it isnt if i hadnt seen her make it i wouldnt have known it was a nest you see one spring i got hurt so that i couldnt take my usual long journey to the far north and had to spend the summer way down in the southland where i always lived in the winter and that is how i happened to learn about mrs gators nest and eggs and a lot of other things mrs gator is lazy but she is smart shes smart enough to make mr sun do her work what do you think of that  right away peter was all excitement you see that sounded as if there might be a story behind it i never have heard of such a thing he cried how did she learn to do such a smart thing as that of course i dont for a minute believe that she herself discovered a way to get mr sun to work for her probably it was her eversogreatgrandmother who first did it isnt that so mrs quack  mrs quack nodded youve guessed it peter said she it all happened way way back in the days when the world was young  tell me about it please please tell me about it mrs quack and the first chance i get ill do something for you begged peter  mrs quack carefully went over all her feathers to see that every one was in place for she is very particular about how she looks when she was quite satisfied she turned to peter fidgeting on the bank  way back in the days when the world was young said she old mother nature made the first alligators before she made the first birds or the first animals so old ally and mrs gator who live way down south now belong to a very old family and are proud of it in the beginning of things there was very little dry land as you may have heard so old mr and mrs gator who of course were not old then were made to live in the water with the fish old mother nature was experimenting then she was planning to make a great deal more land and she wanted living creatures on it so she gave the gators legs and feet instead of fins and lungs to breathe air instead of gills for breathing in the water as fish do then having many other things to attend to she told them they would have to take care of themselves and went about her business  it didnt take mr and mrs gator long to discover that their legs were not of much use in the water for they used their powerful tails for swimming then one day mrs gator crawled out on land and right away discovered what those legs were for she could go on dry land while fishes could not it didnt take her long to find out that nothing was quite so fine as a sunbath as she lay stretched out on the bank so she and mr gator spent most of their time on sunny days taking sunbaths  one day old mother nature came along and whispered a wonderful secret to mrs gator i am going to give you some eggs whispered old mother nature some eggs of your very own and if you watch over them and keep them warm out of each one a baby gator will some day creep but if you let those eggs get cold there will be no babies dont forget that you must keep them warm  old mother nature was as good as her word she gave mrs gator twenty beautiful white eggs and mrs gator was perfectly happy those eggs were the most precious things in all the great world it seemed as if she never would grow tired of looking at them and admiring them and of dreaming of the day when her babies should come out of them it was very pleasant to lie there in the sun and dream of the babies to come from those wonderful eggs suddenly right into the midst of those pleasant dreams broke the memory of what old mother nature had said about keeping those eggs warm all in a twinkling happiness was turned to worry  what can i do what can i do mrs gator kept saying over and over however can i keep them warm when mr sun goes to bed at night oh dear oh dear my beautiful eggs never never will turn to darling babies what can i do  all this time mr gator was a great deal more interested in making himself comfortable than he was in those eggs he had picked out a place where all day long mr sun poured down his warmest rays and he had dug a place to sprawl out in comfortably the sand he had thrown in a pile at one side when mrs gator went to consult mr gator about those precious eggs and her worries when the cool of evening had come she happened to put one foot in that loose pile of sand and she found that while the sand on the outside was already cool that down inside the pile was still warm a clever idea came to her like a flash  first she sent mr gator into the water to get his supper then she scooped a hole in that pile of warm sand and in it she put her precious eggs and carefully covered them up with sand when this was done she stretched out close by to keep watch and see that nothing disturbed those treasures that was a very anxious night for mrs gator the sand on which she lay grew very cool when at last day came and mr sun once more began to shine she opened that pile of sand and great was her joy to find that inside it was still warm when mr gator came crawling out of the water to spend the day in that comfortable bed he had dug she chased him away and was so cross that he went off grumbling and dug another bed mrs gator waited until mr sun had made the sand very warm indeed and then she made a great mound of it and in the middle of it were her precious eggs night and day she kept guard and all the time she worried lest those eggs should not be warm enough then one day twenty baby gators dug their way out of that mound of sand yes sir they did  all this happened long long ago when the world was young and ever since then gators have lived only way down south where it is very warm and where mr sun will hatch their eggs for them and today it is done just as ive told you for ive seen with my own eyes mrs gator build her nest cover her eggs and then lie around while mr sun did the work for her what do you think of that  i think that if you hadnt told me that you had seen it with your own eyes mrs quack i should think it a fairy story replied peter     viii  where mr quack got his webbed feet   twice every year in the early spring and in the late fall peter rabbit watches the smiling pool with a great deal of eagerness can you guess why it is because two very good friends of peters are in the habit of stopping there for a few days for rest and refreshment before continuing the long journey which they are obliged to make they are mr and mrs quack the mallard ducks peter is very fond of them and when the time for their arrival draws near peter watches for them with a great deal of anxiety you see they have told him something of the terrible dangers which they always encounter on these long journeys and so peter is always afraid that something terrible may have happened to them and it is a great relief when he finds them swimming about in the smiling pool  one reason peter is so fond of mr and mrs quack is because they always have a story for him sometimes it is a story of adventure a tale of terrible danger and narrow escapes sometimes it is about their home in the far northland and again it is about the wonderful southland where they spend the winter but the story that peter likes best is the one about where and how the quack family got their funny webbed feet mr quack doesnt think those feet funny at all but peter does he never grows tired of watching mr and mrs quack use them because you know they are used so differently from other feet and always he goes back to the dear old briarpatch with renewed admiration for the wisdom of old mother nature  peter noticed those feet the first time he met mr and mrs quack he couldnt help but notice them it happened that mr and mrs quack were out on the bank of the smiling pool as peter came hurrying over in his usual way lippertylippertylip they heard him coming and not knowing at first who it was they at once started for the water peter never will forget the funny way in which they waddled he never had seen anybody quite so awkward but when they reached the water he forgot to laugh he simply stared openmouthed in astonishment you see there they were as graceful as they had been awkward on land afterward when peter had become acquainted with them and they were the best of friends he ventured to speak of their queer feet  do you know said he you have the most interesting feet of anybody i know of they are so broad that the first time i saw them i couldnt believe my own eyes i didnt suppose anybody had such broad feet i suppose there is some special reason why they are so broad and why your legs are so short do you know how mother nature happened to give you feet so different from the feet of other birds mr quack  mr quack chuckled i tell you what it is peter said he if youll tell me why it is you have such long hind legs and such a funny short tail ill tell you why it is that mrs quack and i have such broad feet though i must confess that i dont see anything odd about them  peter agreed at once he told mr and mrs quack all about what happened to his grandfather a thousand times removed the very first rabbit way back when the world was young and how ever since then all rabbits have had long hind legs and short tails when he had finished mr quack thoughtfully scratched his handsome green head looked at his reflection in the smiling pool to make sure that he was looking his very best looked behind to see that the feathers in the tip of his tail had the proper curl and then gazed off over the green meadows with a faraway look in his eyes as if he were looking way back to the time he was to tell about at last just as peter rabbit was beginning to lose patience mr quack began  it must be peter said he that my greatgreateversogreatgrandfather lived just about the same time as your greatgreateversogreatgrandfather way back in the days when the world was young perhaps they knew each other perhaps they were acquainted just as you and i are now anyway according to what has been handed down in the family grandfather quack was very much such a looking fellow as i am now except in the matter of his bill and feet his bill was not broad like mine but more like the bills of other birds and his feet were like the feet of mr grouse and bob white they were made for scratching and there was nothing between the toes you see old mother nature was experimenting she made everybody a little different from everybody else and then started them forth in the great world to shift for themselves and to find out what they really needed that they hadnt got  old mr quack my greatgreateversogreatgrandfather soon discovered one thing and that was that his legs were too short for him to get around very fast when he walked everybody laughed at him when he tried to run they laughed harder than ever he didnt mind this so very much though he did a little nobody likes to be laughed at especially when it is because of something they cannot help but what he did mind was the fact that his neighbors could run about so much faster than he that they got all the best of the food and quite often he went hungry  one day he happened to be sitting on the bank of the smiling pool thinking the matter over and wondering what he had best do when mr fox stole up behind him and startled him so that he lost his balance and tumbled down the bank into the water this frightened him more than ever and he flapped about and squawked and squawked and flapped until mr fox nearly split his sides laughing at him and when he was quite out of breath mr quack discovered that he was making all this fuss for nothing he didnt sink but floated on the water and what was more the water didnt get under his feathers at all when he tried to walk of course he couldnt and he had a funny feeling because his feet didnt touch anything and felt so very useless but he kept moving them back and forth and pretty soon he discovered that he moved ahead of course he moved very slowly because his feet were not made for use in the water but he moved and that was enough he knew then that he could get back to land then he tried his wings and he found that he could rise into the air from the water quite as easily as from the land right then and there all fear of the water left him in fact he liked it  little by little grandfather quack began to understand that he had made a great discovery he had discovered the safest place in all the great world for him out on the water he was safe from mr fox and mr wolf and all the other fourfooted hunters so he took to spending most of his time on the water or near it when he wanted a nap he would hide among the rushes that grew in the water if only i didnt have to leave the water for food sighed grandfather quack if only i could find food here i would never leave the water  at the time he was squatting at the very edge of the smiling pool presently he noticed a funny water bug crawling on the bottom where the water was only an inch or two deep i wonder if that fellow is good to eat thought he and almost without thinking he plunged his head under water and caught the bug it was good grandfather quack at once started to look for more and while doing this he discovered that there were a great many seeds from the rushes scattered about in the mud at the bottom of the smiling pool and that these also were good to eat then quite by accident he got hold of a tender root in the mud and found that this was especially good  this was enough for grandfather quack he had found that he could get plenty to eat without leaving the smiling pool moreover he didnt have to share it with anybody because there was no one else who thought of looking for food there he knew when he was well off so grandfather quack grew fat and was happy the only things that bothered him were the slowness with which he had to pick up seeds one at a time and the slowness with which he could paddle about for you couldnt really call it swimming but in spite of these things he was happy and made the best of his lot  one day he tugged and tugged at a root with his head under water when at last he had to bring his head up for a breath whom should he discover but old mother nature watching him from the opposite bank come over here mr quack and tell me all about it she commanded  grandfather quack started across the smiling pool but because his feet were not made for swimming it took him a long time to get there old mother nature smiled as she watched him you look better on the water than you do on land said she in fact i believe that is just where you belong now tell me how you happened to take to the water  grandfather quack told her the whole story and how old mother nature did laugh when he described how frightened he was when he fell in that time suddenly she reached out and caught him by the bill i dont think much of that bill for poking about in the mud said she how will this do she let go and grandfather quack found he had a broad bill just suited for getting food out of the mud then old mother nature bade him hold forth first one foot and then the other between the toes she stretched a tough skin clear to the toe nails now let me see you swim said she  grandfather quack tried he kicked one foot and then the other and to his great joy he shot along swiftly when he drew his feet back for another kick his toes closed together and so his feet came through the water easily but when he kicked back they were wide spread and the skin between them pushed against the water and drove him ahead it was wonderful it was splendid he hurried over to old mother nature and with tears of joy in his eyes he thanked her and from that day to this members of my family have had the same broad bills and webbed feet and have lived on the water concluded mr quack  illustration peter noticed those feet the first time he met mr and mrs quack page 111     ix  where thunderfoot the bison got his hump   thunderfoot the bison often called buffalo is not a handsome fellow as you very well know if you have seen him or a picture of him his head is carried low very near the ground and on his shoulders is a great hump no you wouldnt call him handsome you would hardly call him goodlooking even in fact you would i suspect call him homely certainly there is nothing about him to suggest pride yet according to the story digger the badger once told peter rabbit pride and nothing less was the cause of that big hump which makes thunderfoot appear so clumsy and homely  peter rabbit as you know is very fond of stories in this respect he is very like some other folks i know anyway he never misses a chance for a story if he can help it he had discovered that digger the badger and old man coyote both of whom had come to the green meadows from the far west were full of stories about their neighbors of the distant prairies folk whom peter never had seen sometimes when he had nothing else to do old man coyote would come over to the dear old briarpatch and tell stories to peter who sat safe behind the brambles perhaps old man coyote hoped that peter would become so interested that he would forget and come out of the dear old briarpatch but peter never did  but most of the stories of the people of the far west peter got from digger the badger because you see he wasnt afraid to go beg for them he knew that digger couldnt catch him if he wanted to and so when grandfather frog hadnt a story for him peter would go tease digger for one it was thus that he heard about thunderfoot the bison and where he got that great hump of his  i dont suppose said peter that there are any very big people out there on those prairies where you used to live any more than there are here on the green meadows all the very big people seem to prefer to live in the green forest  it is that way now i must admit said digger the badger but it wasnt so in the old days in the good old days when there were no terrible guns and thunderfoot and his followers shook the ground with their feet digger shook his head sadly  instantly peter pricked up his ears who was thunderfoot he demanded  digger looked at peter with such a look of pity for peters ignorance that peter felt almost ashamed he doesnt live here and never did so far as i have heard so how should i know anything about him he added a wee bit defiantly  if thats the case replied digger it is time you learned about the lord of the prairies  but i want to know about thunderfoot first cried peter you can tell me about the lord of the prairies another time  were you born stupid or have you grown so asked digger impatiently then without waiting for an answer he added thunderfoot was the lord of the prairies he ruled over the wide prairies just as old king bear ruled in the green forest he ruled by might he ruled because no one dared deny him the right to rule he ruled because of his great size and his great strength and all who lived on the wide prairies looked up to him and admired him and bowed before him and paid him the utmost respect when he and his followers ran the earth shook and the noise was like thunder and everybody hastened to get out of the way and to warn his neighbors crying here comes my lord of the prairies make way make way and truly thunderfoot and his followers were a magnificent sight so my greatgrandfather told me and he had it from his greatgrandfather who was told so by his greatgrandfather who saw it all with his own eyes but that was in the days before thunderfoots head was brought low and he was given the great hump which none of his descendants have ever been able to get rid of  tell me about that hump and where my lord of the prairies thunderfoot the bison got it begged peter with shining eyes that there was a story he hadnt the least doubt  digger the badger flattened himself out on the ground and into his eyes crept a dreamy faraway look as if he were seeing things a great great way off way back in the days when the world was young so my greatgrandfather said he began thunderfoot the first bison was given the wide prairies for a kingdom by old mother nature and strode forth to take possession big was he the biggest of all living creatures thereabouts strong was he with a strength none cared to test and he was handsome he held his head proudly all who lived on the wide prairies admired him with a great admiration and hastened to pay homage to him  for a long time he ruled wisely all the other people brought their disputes to him to be settled and so wisely did he decide them that the fame of his wisdom spread even beyond the wide prairies and was talked about in the green forest the humblest of his subjects could come to him freely and be sure of a hearing and that justice would be done big as he was and mighty as he was he took the greatest care never to forget the rights of others  but there came a time when flattery turned his head as the saying is mr coyote and mr fox were the chief flatterers and in all the great world there were no smoother tongues than theirs they never lost an opportunity to tell him how handsome he was and how mighty he was and how they admired him and looked up to him and how unequaled was his wisdom you see being themselves dishonest and mischiefmakers they frequently were in trouble with their neighbors and would have to appear before thunderfoot for judgment even when it went against them they praised the wisdom of it admitting that they were in the wrong and begging forgiveness all of which was very flattering to thunderfoot  little by little without knowing it he yielded to the flattery of mr coyote and mr fox he liked to hear the pleasant things they said little by little it became easier to find them in the right than in the wrong when they were accused of wronging their neighbors of course they flattered him still more they hinted to him that it was beneath the dignity of one so big and strong and handsome to take notice of the very small and humble people like mr meadow mouse and mr toad and mr meadow lark and others of his subjects  gradually the little people of the wide prairies began to notice a change in thunderfoot he became proud and vain he openly boasted of his strength and fine appearance when he met them he passed them haughtily not seeing them at all or at least appearing not to no longer did he regard the rights of others no longer did he watch out not to crush the nest of mrs meadow lark or to step on the babies of danny meadow mouse it came about that when the thunder of his feet was heard those with homes on the ground shivered with fright and hoped that my lord of the prairies would not come their way  one day as he raced over the wide prairies for no reason but that he felt like running mr meadow lark flew to meet him mr meadow lark was in great distress turn aside my lord he begged turn aside my lord of the prairies for before you lies my nest with four precious eggs and i fear you will step on them  thunderfoot the bison lord of the wide prairies tossed his head if you will build your nest where it can be trodden on you cant expect me to look out for it said he if anything so unfortunate happens to it it is your own fault and you mustnt blame me and he neither looked down to see where he was putting his feet nor turned aside so much as an inch on he galloped and presently with a cry of fright out from beneath his feet flew mrs meadow lark and at the very next step he trod on the little nest in the grass and crushed the four eggs  mr coyote who was racing beside him on one side and saw what had happened grinned mr fox who was racing beside him on the other side and saw what had happened grinned seeing them grin thunderfoot himself grinned thus grinning heartlessly they continued to run until they came to a place where mother nature walked among the flowers of the wide prairies mr coyote and mr fox whose heads were not held so high saw her in time to put their tails between their legs and slink away thunderfoot holding his head high failed to see her until he was so close to her that it was with difficulty he stopped before running her down  my lord of the prairies seems in fine spirits said mother nature softly is all well with my lord  thunderfoot tossed his head proudly all is well said he  i am sorry that others cannot say as much replied mother nature and all the softness was gone from her voice and it was sharp i seem to hear the sobs of a brokenhearted little meadow lark she continued little though she be and humble she is as much to me as is my lord of the prairies who has made her suffer  stooping swiftly mother nature picked up her staff and with it struck thunderfoot on the neck so that his head was brought low and in fear of another blow he humped his shoulders up thus shall you be still big still strong but humpshouldered and carrying your head low in shame no longer lord of the prairies until such time as you restore to mrs meadow lark the eggs you destroyed said she and turned her back on him  it was so from that day on thunderfoot ceased to rule over the wide prairies he was humpshouldered and he carried his head low looking and looking for the eggs he never could find to restore to mrs meadow lark and though his children and his childrens children became many there never was one without the hump or who ceased to carry his head low in shame concluded digger the badger     x  where limberheels got his long tail   have you ever seen limberheels the jumping mouse when he was in a hurry if you have very likely the first time you felt very much as peter rabbit did when he saw limberheels for the first time he was hopping along across the green meadows with nothing much on his mind when from right under his wobbly nose something shot into the air over the tops of the grasses for eight or ten feet and then down and out of sight peter rubbed his eyes  did i see it or didnt i and if i did what was it gasped peter  a squeaky little laugh answered him you saw it all right peter but it isnt polite to call any one it he would be quite provoked if he had heard you that was my cousin limberheels replied a voice quite as squeaky as the laugh had been  peter turned to see the bright eyes of danny meadow mouse twinkling at him from the entrance to a tiny little path that joined the bigger path in which peter was sitting  hello danny he exclaimed do you mean to tell me that was a relative of yours since when have any of your relatives taken to flying  danny chuckled he wasnt flying he retorted he just jumped that was all danny chuckled again for he knows that peter considers himself quite a jumper and is inclined to be a bit jealous of any one else who pretends to jump save his cousin jumper the hare  jumped snorted peter jumped do you expect me to believe that any mouse can jump like that i didnt get a good look at that fellow but whoever he is i tell you he flew nobody can jump like that  danny chuckled again wait a minute peter said he he disappeared and peter waited he waited one minute two minutes three minutes and then suddenly danny poked his head out from the grass beside the path here he is peter said he coming wholly out into the path let me introduce my cousin limberheels  as he spoke the grass beside him rustled and out crept some one beside whom danny meadow mouse looked big clumsy and homely one glance was enough to tell peter that the stranger was a sureenough member of the mouse family but such a member as he never had seen before he was trim and slender he wore a reddishbrown coat with a white waistcoat but the things that made peter stare very impolitely were his tail and his legs his tail was nearly twice as long as his body slim and tapering and his hind legs were very long while his fore legs were short it took only one glance to convince peter that here was a born jumper any one built like that must jump  you two must become acquainted and be friends continued danny meadow mouse peter is one of my best friends limberheels he wouldnt hurt a flea im sure that from now on he will be one of your best friends  ill be happy to said peter promptly danny has been telling me what a wonderful jumper you are would you mind showing me how you jump i guess you jumped right in front of me a few minutes ago but i was so surprised that i didnt really see you  i guess i did replied limberheels rather timidly you see i didnt hear you coming until you were almost on top of me and then i didnt know who it was so i got away as quickly as i could ill be ever so glad to have you for a friend and next time i wont run away  show him how you can jump interrupted danny meadow mouse he wouldnt believe me when i told him that you didnt fly  limberheels grinned rather sheepishly of course i didnt fly said he no animal can fly but flitter the bat i just jumped like this  with a tremendous spring from his long hind legs limberheels leaped while peter rabbit stared his mouth wide open with astonishment he hadnt dreamed that any one could jump so far in proportion to his size as this slim trim little cousin of dannys later after limberheels had jumped for peters benefit until he was tired and had gone to hunt for a lunch of grass seeds peter wanted to know all about limberheels  never in my life have i seen such jumping he declared and never have i seen such a tail i thought whitefoot the wood mouse had a fine tail but it doesnt compare with that of limberheels  it is a fine tail replied danny whose own tail as you know is very short  it is a fine tail he repeated rather wistfully would you like to hear where he got it  i know retorted peter with a grin he got it from his father who got it from his father and so on way back to the days when the world was young then seeing a look of disappointment on dannys face and eager for a story as usual he added but i would like to know how such a tail as that came in the family  danny brightened up at once its funny how things come about in this world he began the greatgreateversogreatgrandfather of limberheels the first one you know was quite an ordinary mouse when old mother nature made him and started him out to make his way in the great world he was little one of the smallest of the family and his tail was short no longer than mine his hind legs were like those of all his relatives he ran about just as his relatives did he was so small and kept out of sight so much that he didnt even have a name there was nothing about him to suggest a name  for a long time he was contented and happy then one day he happened to see mr hare jump it seemed to him the most wonderful thing in the world that any one should be able to jump like that so he began to spend most of his spare time where he could watch mr hare one day old mother nature happened along unseen by him as he was watching mr hare jump and she overheard him say very very wistfully how i wish i could jump like that i wish i had long hind legs like mr hare  old mother natures kindly eyes twinkled thats easily arranged said she if you think long hind legs will be of more use to you than the ones you have you shall have them  the next morning when little mr mouse awoke he discovered that in the night something had happened to his hind legs they were very long and strong regular jumping legs like those of mr hare of course he was in such a great hurry to try them that he couldnt wait for his breakfast he began by making little short hops and in no time at all he was getting about splendidly at last he got up his courage to try a long jump up in the air he shot and then something happened yes sir something happened he couldnt kept his balance he turned two or three somersaults and landed on his back  i guess said he to himself ive got to learn to make long jumps so he kept trying and trying but always with the same resulthe never knew when where or how he was going to land as long as he made short jumps he had no trouble but every time he tried a long jump he lost his balance and try as he would he couldnt discover why so at last he gave up trying and contented himself with short jumps finally old mother nature came that way again  how do you like your long hind legs she asked  very much thank you replied little mr mouse politely  let me see you jump said old mother nature  little mr mouse made half a dozen little jumps they were not much more than hops you dont call that jumping do you laughed old mother nature with such long strong legs as ive given you you ought to be one of the best jumpers anywhere about now let me see you make a long jump  little mr mouse tried his best to think of some excuse but he couldnt so he made a long jump and the usual thing happenedhe turned two or three somersaults and landed on his back old mother nature looked astonished then she laughed until she had to hold her sides do it again she commanded  with the most shamefaced air that you can imagine little mr mouse jumped again old mother nature watched him closely come here to me said she as he scrambled to his feet after his tumble its all my fault said she kindly as he obeyed her it was very stupid of me what you need is a long tail to balance you on a long jump that short tail is all right for short jumps but it wont do for long jumps it wont do at all i should have thought of that when i made your legs long  she reached down and took hold of the tip of that little short tail and drew it out until it was long almost twice as long as the body of little mr mouse now jump she commanded and jump with all your might  a little fearfully but with the beginning of a little hope mr mouse jumped with all his might away he sailed straight and true and landed lightly on his feet so far from where he had left the ground that he could hardly believe his own eyes as he looked back mother nature was smiling  there you are mr limberheels i guess that that will make you quite the most wonderful jumper of all my children said she  and so it was that little mr mouse all at one time became possessed of a long tail a name and the ability to out jump all his neighbors concluded danny meadow mouse do you know he added wistfully sometimes i envy my cousin limberheels  i envy him myself declared peter     xi  where old mr gobbler got the strutting habit   peter rabbit never will forget the first time he saw big tom gobbler it was very early one spring morning when peter was not yet old enough to have made the acquaintance of all the people who live in the green forest and when it seemed as if the chief thing in life with him was to satisfy his curiosity about the ways of the great world several times when he had been hopping along lippertylippertylip through the green forest just after sunup he had heard a strange sound quite unlike any other of all the many sounds his long ears had learned to know he knew that it was the voice of some one who lived in the green forest but though he had looked and looked he had been unable to discover the owner of that voice  on this particular morning peter happened to be sitting under some ferns on the edge of a little open space among the trees when again he heard that strange voice it seemed to come from somewhere back in the woods in the very direction from which he had just come gobbleobbleobble said the voice and again a moment later gobbleobbleobble  peter was just preparing to go back to see if he could find the owner of that voice when the noise of great wings caused him to look up just in time to see a bigger bird than he ever had even dreamed of coming swiftly over the treetops with his eyes popping out and his mouth wide open with astonishment peter saw the great bird set its wings and sail down into the little opening on the edge of which peter was sitting the instant this great bird was on the ground he stood as still as if he were made of stone his long neck stretched up only the shine of a pair of the sharpest eyes peter ever had seen showed that he was alive  peter held his breath and it was so still that you could have heard a leaf drop had you been there when at last the stranger moved it was his head only he turned it suddenly to the right and a moment later to the left it was plain that he was listening for suspicious sounds all the time his bright eyes searched the edge of the opening until peter although he was well hidden felt that he must be seen at last satisfied that all was safe the stranger drew in his neck and began to walk about pecking at the ground here and there and swallowing what he picked up though what it was peter couldnt tell  a sound seemed to catch the strangers quick ears for he stopped and stared very hard at a little clump of brush peter stared at it too at first he saw nothing but presently he saw a head poked out and this also was a stranger peter glanced at the big stranger in the opening and for a minute he wondered if it could be that something was wrong with his eyes never had he seen such a change in anybody this stranger didnt look like the same bird at all he was swelled up until peter was afraid he would burst his tail was spread out like a great fan his head was laid back on his humped shoulders his wings were dropped until the stiffly spread feathers brushed the ground his head and neck were as red as blood and there were no feathers on either all the feathers of his body were ruffed out so that the sun shone on them and made them shimmer and shine in colors that seemed to constantly change  back and forth in front of the brush from which the other stranger was peeping very shyly this great bird strutted he would stand still so that the sun would fall full on his shining coat and show it off to the best advantage and at the same time he would draw in a great deal of air and then puff it out all at once then he would walk a few steps turn drag his wings on the ground to make them rustle wheel and run a few steps never had peter seen such vanity such conceit such imposing puffedup pride he watched until he grew tired and then he stole away and hurried over to the smiling pool to tell grandfather frog all about it and ask who these strangers were  chugarum exclaimed grandfather frog opening his big mouth very wide to laugh at peter and his excitement that was big tom gobbler and he was doing all that for the benefit of mrs gobbler who was hiding in that brush it was her head you saw big tom is the most conceited fellow in the green forest he dearly loves to strut he is just like his father and his grandfather and his greatgrandfather the gobblers never have gotten over strutting since old mr gobbler the first of the family got the habit  tell me about it please grandfather frog tell me about it begged peter how did old mr gobbler get the habit  grandfather frog chuckled he got it from admiring his own reflection in a pool of water said he you see in those days way back when the world was young people had more time to form habits than they do now with plenty to eat and little to do they had more time to think about themselves than they do now old mr gobbler soon discovered that he was the biggest of all the birds in that part of the great world where he lived and this discovery was i suspect the beginning of his vanity then one day as he was walking along he came to a little pool of water it was very clear and there wasnt a ripple on the surface there for the first time mr gobbler saw his reflection the more he looked the better he liked his own appearance he spread his tail just to see how it would look in the water then he puffed himself out and strutted  there is nobody to compare with me thought he and strutted more than ever  after that he used to steal away every day to admire himself in that little pool of water he tried new ways of strutting and of puffing himself out after a while he was no longer content to admire himself he wanted others to admire him so the first chance he got he began to strut and show off all his grand airs before mrs gobbler at first she paid no attention to him at least that is the way she appeared she would turn her back on him and walk off into the bushes this made old mr gobbler very angry until he discovered that she would tiptoe back and watch him admiringly when she thought he didnt know it that made him strut all the more  at first all the neighbors used to gather around and admire him and tell him how handsome he was until his head was quite turned as the saying is and he spent most of his time strutting and showing off then he took to bragging and boasting that there was no bird to compare with him thus he became quite unbearable and all his neighbors would turn their backs on him when they saw him coming only mrs gobbler continued to watch in secret and to admire him  now in those days mr gobbler didnt have a red head and neck one day old mother nature happened along when mr gobbler was strutting and boasting how big and brave he was he didnt see her and she watched him quietly for a few minutes then she slipped away and hunted up mr wolf  i want you to steal over where mr gobbler is strutting said she and suddenly spring out at him as if you intended to catch him  mr wolf grinned and trotted off to do her bidding he found mr gobbler swelled up until he looked as if he must burst and bragging to mrs gobbler  im the biggest of all the birds bragged mr gobbler im afraid of no one while you have me with you my dear you have nothing in all the great world to fear  just then out sprang mr wolf with all his long sharp teeth showing mr gobbler gave a yelp of fright he lost his swelledup appearance as suddenly as a bubble flattens out when it is pricked with a frantic beating of his wings he took to the air being in such a fright he didnt see where he was going and struck his head against a sharp twig which tore the skin for there were no feathers to protect it and made it bleed the blood ran all over his head and down his neck though he really was hardly hurt at all from the top of a tall tree he looked down there stood old mother nature looking up at him  mr gobbler said she you have acquired a bad habit a very bad habit hereafter whenever you become vain and strut your head and neck shall become as red as they now are as a reminder to you and all who see you of how silly it is to be vain and boastful  and so it was and so it is with big tom gobbler to this day there is nothing in the world more foolish than vanity concluded grandfather frog  illustration dont call me striped chipmunk and dont call me gopher said he page 172     xii  where seekseek got his pretty coat   peter rabbit never will forget the first time he saw seekseek the ground squirrel often wrongly called gopher or gopher squirrel but whose real name is spermophile which means seed eater peter wont forget that meeting because of the funny mistake he made and the foolish feeling he had as a result of it you see peter didnt know that there was such a person as seekseek he was hopping along across the green meadows in his usual happygolucky way when right in front of him he saw what at first he took to be a stake a small stake driven in the ground but as he drew nearer it suddenly moved it wasnt a stake at all but a very lively small person in a striped coat who had been sitting up very straight and motionless  hello striped chipmunk what are you doing way out here so far from the old stone wall exclaimed peter  the small person in the striped coat whirled and faced peter with snapping eyes dont call me striped chipmunk and dont call me gopher said he very fiercely for so small a person i am neither one i am seekseek the ground squirrel and ill thank you to call me by my own name i am getting everlastingly tired of being called the names of other people  peter looked very foolish i beg your pardon said he i do indeed im sorry perhaps you dont know it but you look very much like striped chipmunk who is one of my best friends you look so much like him that i thought you must be him i wonder if you are related to him  certainly im related to him or he is related to me whichever way you please to put it snapped seekseek we are cousins but he is a rock squirrel and i am a ground squirrel which is altogether different you dont find me where there are rocks and stones in the way if i know it besides if you used your eyes you would see that we are not dressed alike either just because we both happen to wear stripes is no reason why we should be mistaken for each other  peter looked at seekseek more closely than he had and at once he made a discovery why he exclaimed your coat has more stripes than striped chipmunks has hasnt it  i should hope so retorted seekseek  and it has little rows of spots too cried peter if i had noticed those spots at first i wouldnt have made such a foolish mistake i do believe that your coat is prettier than striped chipmunks and i had thought his as pretty as a coat can be  seekseek looked rather pleased though he tried not to huh he sniffed of course its prettier it took you a long time to find it out i wouldnt trade coats with striped chipmunk or anybody else of my acquaintance  neither would i if i were in your place declared peter i wish old mother nature had given me a coat like that he said this so wistfully that seekseek who had started to laugh turned his head so that peter might not know it im afraid it wouldnt look so well on one as big as you he replied anyway you wouldnt be able to hide from your enemies as you can now  thats so said peter thoughtfully i would be easily seen in a coat like that for a fact i hadnt thought of that i guess old mother nature knows best ii wonder how she ever happened to think of a coat like yours  seekseek chuckled he had quite forgotten that he had felt offended because peter had mistaken him for his cousin striped chipmunk he enjoyed peters admiration of his coat he is naturally rather talkative and like most folks he enjoyed talking about himself  this coat said he has been in the family a very great while of course i dont mean this particular coat that i am wearing he hastened to add as he saw peter beginning to grin i mean this style of coat has been in the family a very long time my father was dressed just as i am so was his father and  i know interrupted peter you were going to say that so were all your grandfathers way back to the days when the world was young and old mother nature made the very first one of your family its funny to me that all the interesting things happened such a long time ago now wasnt that what you were going to say  seekseek admitted that it was and looked a little disappointed that peter had guessed it but a second later he felt better when peter asked him very politely but very earnestly for the story of how the first ground squirrel got such a pretty coat there is a story i know there is a story declared peter wont you tell it to me please seekseek  now peter didnt want to hear it any more than seekseek wanted to tell it so while peter squatted down comfortably seekseek sat up very straight and began the story  first of all you must know that seekseek is an old family name which has been handed down just as the pattern of my coat has been the very first of all my greatgreatgrandfathers was called seekseek when old mother nature made seekseek she must have had two families in mind at one time the marmot family and the squirrel family for she made him a little like each so that in his looks he sort of fitted in between the two mother nature told him that he was a member of the squirrel family and set him free to find a place for himself in the great world  now it didnt take grandfather seekseek long to find out that though he might be a member of the squirrel family old mother nature had failed to furnish him with the right kind of claws for climbing trees as most of his cousins did true he could climb a little but it was not easy and he felt anything but comfortable off the ground but if those claws were of little use for climbing they were splendid tools for digging just as are the claws of the marmot family so old mother nature must have been thinking of the marmots when she fashioned those claws  at first seekseek wandered about trying to find a place for himself in the great world being a squirrel he tried to live as did his cousins mr red squirrel and mr gray squirrel but on account of those claws he didnt make much of a success of it then one day he met mr chipmunk they stopped and stared at each other in surprise because you know their coats were so much alike at that time seekseek was wearing plain stripes just as striped chipmunk does to this day  what do you mean by stealing my coat demanded mr chipmunk angrily  i was just about to ask you the same question retorted seekseek  mr chipmunk had a sharp reply right on the tip of his tongue but he checked it just in time whats the use of quarreling over something neither of us had anything to do with said he it must be that we are cousins where do you live  seekseek explained that he didnt live anywhere in particular but was trying to find his place in the great world he told how he had tried to live like the other squirrels and failed i know i know all about it interrupted mr chipmunk ive been all through it the place for us is on the ground or at least close to it come see how i live  so seekseek went with mr chipmunk and saw how he lived among the rocks and stones for a time he tried living there too but he didnt like the rocks and stones much better than he did the trees besides all the neighbors were forever mistaking him for mr chipmunk because they looked so much alike and he didnt like this one day he wandered out on the green meadows it was very lovely out there among the grasses and flowers he wandered farther and farther and the farther he wandered the better he liked it by and by he came to the home of yapyap the prairie dog who is one of the marmot family as you know  a home like that would suit me thought grandfather seekseek wistfully as he journeyed on i wonder if i could dig one i believe ill try  so when he found a place to suit him he began to dig there were no stones to hurt his feet and dull his nails and he actually enjoyed digging so he dug and dug until he had a wonderful underground home all about were plenty of seeds and tender grasses to eat and he was happy he had found his place in the great world then one day along came old mother nature hello mr chipmunk she exclaimed as she caught sight of his striped coat what are you doing way out here  then she discovered her mistake dear me said she this will never do at all if i cant tell my own children apart how can i expect others to your coat is altogether too much like that of mr chipmunk i must change it i certainly must change it  she leaned over and lightly tapped seekseek right down the length of the broadest brown stripe of his coat wherever her finger touched a little spot of yellow was left then she did the same thing to each of the other brown stripes when she had finished grandfather seekseek had a coat exactly like the one i am now wearing and his cup of happiness was filled to the brim from that day on he never was mistaken for mr chipmunk or any one else thats the story of my coat and now i must get busy collecting seeds for my storehouse concluded seekseek come and see me again peter rabbit  i will replied peter as he started for the dear old briarpatch to tell mrs peter all about seekseek and his pretty coat     xiii  where old mr osprey learned to fish   peter rabbit had seen a very strange thing it was strange to peter anyway it gave him something to think about and this i am sure you will agree was a most excellent thing for it kept him out of mischief for a while he had been over to the smiling pool for a call on jerry muskrat and had just started back for the dear old briarpatch when he chanced to look over in the direction of the big river coming straight towards him but high in the air was a big bird a bird with broad wings peter didnt have to look twice to know that it was a member of the hawk family at first he thought it was redtail then he caught a flash of white and he thought it was whitetail the marsh hawk in spite of the fact that it didnt fly like him peter didnt stop to think of that it was enough for him that a member of the hawk family was headed that way and he didnt care a twitch of his funny little tail which member it was he felt that the stomach of one was quite as undesirable a place for peter rabbit as the stomach of another and he had no intention of filling any if he could help it  he remembered that there was an old house of johnny chucks under the big hickorytree on the bank of the smiling pool and he wasted no time in getting there lippertylippertylip as fast as he could go he would stay there until the way was clear to get home to the dear old briarpatch as soon as he was safe in the old house of johnny chuck he turned and poked his head out of the doorway he wanted to see if any one would be caught he hoped not but if any one was caught he wanted to see you know peter never misses anything if he can help it on came mr hawk and when he was right over the smiling pool he turned and made a short circle high in the air then peter saw that he had a white waistcoat and was a stranger  i wonder who he is thought peter staring very hard hes bigger than either redtail or whitetail i hope he isnt going to make his home here because we have trouble enough as it is  suddenly mr hawk paused high up in the air then closed his wings and shot straight down like an arrow plunge peter couldnt believe his own eyes mr hawk actually had disappeared in the smiling pool a second later there was a great splashing and out of the water rose mr hawk flapping his great wings heavily scattering spray in all directions up up he went and then peter saw that in his great claws was a fish peter watched him fly away with the fish and when he felt that it was quite safe to do so he came out over on the end of an old log among the bulrushes sat jerry muskrat just where peter had left him it was very plain that jerry hadnt been the least bit frightened by mr hawk peter couldnt understand it his eyes fairly popped out of his head with excitement and curiosity  who was that he asked eagerly  that why that was plunger the osprey though some people call him fish hawk replied jerry i thought everybody knew him why did you run away peter he wouldnt hurt you  huh i wouldnt trust any hawk snapped peter  which goes to show how little you know retorted jerry muskrat plunger never bothers anybody but the fish but he surely is a terror to them old mother nature knew what she was doing when she made fishermen out of that family didnt she  she certainly did though ive never heard how she came to do it how did it happen jerry peter was doing some fishing himself he was fishing for a story  jerry muskrat grinned think youll sleep any better if i tell you he inquired  peter grinned back and nodded so jerry muskrat told him this story  way back in the days when the world was young and the greatgreateversogreatgrandfathers of all the little people of the green meadows and the green forest of today were being started out in life by old mother nature they had everything to learn the great world was a new place and they were new in it no one knew exactly his place or what was expected of him and old mother nature was too busy to be bothered with questions she expected each one to work out for himself a way in which to make himself useful or at least to take care of himself without bothering her if he couldnt do that she didnt want him around at all and the sooner something happened to him the better so the great world began to be peopled with birds and animals  it didnt take them long to learn that it wouldnt be possible for all to live if they all ate the same kind of food so some learned to eat one thing and some another and all went happily until there came a time when all food was scarce and more stomachs were empty than full youve heard about that hard time and sad time  peter nodded and jerry took a drink of water and then went on with his tale  of course that was really a very dreadful time for it was then that the strong began to hunt the weak and fear was born into the world and yet i guess it wasnt wholly bad nothing is so far as i can find out anyway because of that hard time everybody became a little smarter than before you know an empty stomach sharpens wit and fear puts a fine edge on it now mr osprey who was one of the biggest of the cousins of old king eagle couldnt get over a feeling of meanness whenever he hunted those smaller than himself one day he caught little mr sparrow when little mr sparrow was so busy that he forgot to watch out  im powerful sorry mr sparrow apologized mr osprey but theres an emptiness just about your size in my stomach and it wont give me any peace of mind until its filled i hate to make a neighbor uncomfortable and ill be just as quick and accommodating about this little matter as i can if youll just shut your eyes you wont see anything unpleasant and i wont be a minute in getting that peace of mind ive been without so long i just must have it or i wouldnt bother you at all i hope you wont hold it against me mr sparrow  mr osprey was so nice and polite about it that little mr sparrow perked up a little and started his wits working he tried to be just as nice and polite as mr osprey i know just how you feel mr osprey said he in a trembling voice and during these hard times ive had that same ailment of the mind because of lonesomeness of the stomach which is troubling you so long as that emptiness is filled i dont suppose it matters to you if i shouldnt happen to fill it  not at all replied mr osprey  mr osprey said little mr sparrow very earnestly if i were in your place i never would go hungry no sir i never would go hungry and i certainly never never would trouble any of my neighbors who wear feathers i certainly would feel most happy if old mother nature had given me what she has given you indeed i would  mr osprey looked down at little mr sparrow and blinked at him in a puzzled way what has old mother nature given me that you would be happy to have he asked  fishhooks replied little mr sparrow pointing to mr ospreys great claws the finest fishhooks in the world you dont hear billy mink or little joe otter or mr heron complaining about hard times why because they dont know what hard times are there are plenty of fish to be caught and when they are hungry they go fishing fish are very filling and satisfying ive heard say when i flew across the smiling pool a little while ago i saw a fat fish taking a sunbath right close to the top of the water seemed like he was just waiting for some one with hooks to come along and snatch him right out of the water  whered you say that fish was asked mr osprey  if youll let me go ill show you replied little mr sparrow  so mr osprey let little mr sparrow go but he followed him right close mr sparrow led the way straight to the smiling pool sure enough there was the big fish taking a sunbath mr osprey hardly wet his feet putting those big hooks into that fish he flew away with it and presently he was rid of that emptiness in his stomach and had back his peace of mind after that whenever he was hungry he went fishing instead of hunting the birds and the animals by practice he learned how to use those big fishhooks of his and became one of the smartest of all fishermen he and little mr sparrow became great friends in fact such friends that when mr osprey built a great nest little mr sparrow built his right in the side of it and there he was perfectly safe from others who might be hunting him and its been just that way ever since if you wore scales instead of fur and lived in the water instead of on the land peter rabbit you would have reason to fear plunger the osprey but as it is you are safer when he is about than when he isnt there comes old redtail the hawk youd better get out of sight peter  peter did     xiv  where old mr bobcat left his honor   of all those who are forever trying to catch peter rabbit he fears none more than yowler the bobcat and from that fear has grown hate you will find it true all through life that hate often springs from great fear peter isnt much given to hate but he does hate yowler the bobcat it is partly because of his fear of yowler but it is still more because he feels that yowler is not fair in his hunting he has no honor there are many others whom peter fearsreddy fox old man coyote hooty the owland with very good reason but peter considers that these hunt him fairly he knows when and where to be on the watch for them  but with yowler it is altogether different yowler hides beside one of peters favorite little paths and there he waits patiently for unsuspecting peter to come along he waits and watches much as black pussy who is a cousin of yowler waits and watches at a mousehole peter feels that it doesnt give him a chance and everybody is entitled to at least a chance to live  i hate him hate him hate him exclaimed peter fiercely as he crawled under the very middle of a great pile of brush after the narrowest of narrow escapes he had been hopping along one of his favorite little paths without a thought of danger presently he came to a little branch path there he hesitated he had intended to keep on along the main path but suddenly he had a feeling that it would be better to take the branch path he knew no reason why he shouldnt keep on as he had planned it was just a feeling that it would be better to take the other path a feeling without any real reason so he hesitated and finally turned down the little branch path as he did so he caught a glimpse of a brown form moving stealthily from behind a log farther up the main little path it was moving swiftly in the direction of the little branch path that glimpse was enough for peter that stealthy form could be but one personyowler the bobcat he turned and darted back the way he had come and then off to one side to the great pile of brush under which he had crawled  who is it you hate asked a voice  for just a second peter was startled then he recognized the voice of mrs grouse one of his very best friends yowler the bobcat said he as fiercely as before  i dont love him myself replied mrs grouse i suspected that he was somewhere about and that is why i am here did you see him  yes said peter i saw him he was hiding beside my favorite little path and it is a wonder i didnt hop straight into his jaws that fellow doesnt hunt fairly he doesnt give us a chance he hasnt any honor  honor exclaimed mrs grouse honor of course he hasnt any honor there hasnt been any honor in yowlers family since old mr bobcat the first of all the bobcats left his honor in turkey wood way back in the days when the world was young and failed to get it again honor of course yowler hasnt any what could you expect  at once peter was all ears ive never heard about that said he tell me about it mrs grouse weve got to stay right where we are for a long time to make sure that yowler has given us up and gone away so you will have plenty of time to tell me the story where was turkey wood and how did old mr bobcat happen to leave his honor there  he didnt happen to he did it deliberately replied mrs grouse you see it was like this in the beginning of things when old mother nature made the first little people and the first big people of the green forest and the green meadows she was too busy to watch over them all the time so for a while she put them on their honor not to harm one another or interfere with one another in any way for she wanted them to live in peace and happiness and raise families to people the great world  now it chanced that mr and mrs gobbler the first of the turkey family chose a certain little grove of trees in which to make their home and it became known as turkey wood there in course of time mrs turkey made her nest on the ground well hidden among some bushes and in it laid twelve big eggs it was the day on which she laid the twelfth big egg that old mr bobcat who of course wasnt old then took it into his head to prowl about in turkey wood already mr bobcat had begun to form a sneaky habit of stealth he was very fond of watching his neighbors to find out what they were about and it was this fondness of minding the business of other people instead of his own that was making him sneaky and stealthy for of course he didnt want any one to know what he was doing  it happened that as he stole into turkey wood mrs gobbler left her nest to get a bite to eat mr bobcat saw her but she didnt see him he crouched flat until she was out of sight  she seemed mighty careful about how she slipped out of those bushes thought mr bobcat she acted as if she didnt want to be seen i wonder why i wonder if she has a secret hidden in those bushes i suppose the way to find out is to look  first making sure that no one saw him mr bobcat crept in his sneaky way into the bushes and it didnt take him long to find that nest with the twelve big eggs he didnt know what they were for they were the first eggs he had ever seen he stared at them and wondered if they were good to eat he glanced this way and that way to be sure that no one was watching him  dont touch them warned something inside of him these belong to mrs gobbler and old mother nature has put you on your honor not to interfere with others or their affairs  it wont do any harm just to touch them and see what they are like said another little tempting voice inside of him  remember your honor warned the first little voice  bother my honor im not going to do any harm muttered mr bobcat and picked up one of the eggs in his mouth he tried it with his teeth to see if it was hard and of course he put his teeth right through the shell he started to put it back in a hurry but just then he noticed a good taste in his mouth the inside of that egg was good to eat very good indeed  one wont be missed thought mr bobcat and then fearing that mrs gobbler would return he bounded away taking the egg with him  when mrs gobbler returned she did miss that egg she looked all about for it but there was nothing to show what had become of it with a troubled mind she began to sit on her eggs she was so worried that she didnt leave them until she simply had to get something to eat  meanwhile mr bobcat had eaten that egg and it had tasted so good that he could think of nothing but how he could get another so at the first opportunity he sneaked back to turkey wood and without making a sound crept in among the bushes until he could see mrs gobbler sitting on her eggs there he lay and watched and watched until mrs gobbler left to get something to eat no sooner was she out of sight than mr bobcat stole to the nest  remember your honor warned the little voice inside  bother honor id rather have an egg muttered mr bobcat and pulled one out of the nest he bit a hole in one end and sucked out the contents it was so good he took another this led to a third and finally mr bobcat had sucked every one of those eggs then silently he sneaked awayaway from turkey wood to a distant part of the green forest behind him in turkey wood he left a nestful of empty shells and his honor  nobody knows who did it and nobody ever will find out thought mr bobcat but all the time he knew that he had left his honor behind and this made him more sneaky than ever he never would meet any one face to face you know that is something that one who has lost his honor never can do it wasnt long before all his neighbors knew that he was without honor and so would have nothing to do with him they shunned him he grew to be more and more of a sneak and all the time he believed that no one knew what he had done or where he had left his honor  but old mother nature knew of course mrs gobbler told her what had happened to her eggs old mother nature told her to make a new nest and hide it more carefully than before which mrs gobbler did and hatched out ten fine young gobblers meanwhile old mother nature went about her business but all the time she was watching to see who would fail to look her straight in the face the first time she met mr bobcat he tried to slip past unseen when old mother nature stepped in front of him he couldnt look her in the face try as he would  ahha said she you are the one who left his honor in turkey wood from this time forth you shall be an outcast friendless and alone hated by every one  and so it was and has been ever since and so it is with yowler today you said truly peter that he hasnt any honor isnt it dreadful  and peter agreed that it is     xv  where dippy the loon got the name of being crazy   as you all know peter rabbit is out and about at a time when most folks are snugly tucked in bed the fact is peter is very fond of roaming around at night he says he feels safer then in spite of the fact that some of his smartest enemies are also out and about among them hooty the owl and reddy fox and old man coyote the two latter also hunt by day when the fancy takes them or they have been so unsuccessful at night that their stomachs wont give them any peace and peter is sure that though they can see very well at night they can see still better in the light of day anyway that is one of the reasons he gives for his own liking for roaming after jolly round red mr sun has gone to bed behind the purple hills  now it happened one moonlight night that peter had ventured way over almost to the big river he had heard hooty the owls fierce hunting call far off in the green forest he had heard reddy fox barking up in the old pasture so peter felt quite safe he felt so safe that he had almost forgotten that there could be such a thing as fear and then from the direction of the big river there came such a sound as peter never had heard before it was a sound that made his heart seem to quite stop beating for an instant it was a sound that sent cold chills racing and chasing all over him it was a sound that made him wish with all his might that he was that instant right in the heart of the dear old briarpatch instead of way over there near the bank of the big river  he didnt waste much time getting back to the dear old briarpatch once he was sure his heart hadnt really stopped beating the way he went across the green meadows lippertylippertylip lippertylippertylip was positive proof that in spite of his fright his heart was quite all right he didnt run a little way stop run a little farther and stop again as is his usual way he kept lippertylippertylipping without a single stop until he reached the edge of the dear old briarpatch and once more felt really safe two or three times he had felt that he must stop to get his breath but each time that sound that dreadful sound had seemed to be following right at his heels and he had suddenly discovered that he didnt need to stop after all  but having reached the dear old briarpatch peter stopped and panted for breath while he anxiously watched for the appearance of some unknown enemy following him it was then that he realized that that sound came from the big river and that whoever made it had not left the big river at all it made peter feel a wee bit foolish as he thought how he had been sure that there was danger right at his very heels all the way home when all the time there hadnt been any danger at all  peter sat there and listened and despite the fact that he now felt absolutely safe the cold chills ran over him every time he heard it it was a voice peter was sure of that it was a voice but such a voice as peter never in his life had heard before it was quite as bad if not worse than the voice of old man coyote in a way it reminded him of old man coyotes voice but while old man coyotes voice sounded like many voices in one it was not so fearsome as this voice for this voice sounded like a human voice yet wasnt something inside peter told him that it wasnt a human voice in spite of its sounding so  the next morning peter ran over to the smiling pool to ask grandfather frog if he had any idea who could have such a voice as that when he tried to tell grandfather frog what that voice was like he couldnt he just couldnt describe it  it was the lonesomest and craziest sound ive ever heard declared peter and that is all i can tell you it was crazier than the voice of old man coyote  that is all you need tell me chuckled grandfather frog that was the voice of dippy the loon and let me tell you something peter you are not the first one to think his voice has a crazy sound oh my no no indeed why a lot of people think dippy is crazy and when any one does queer things they say of him that he is crazy as a loon  but is he crazy asked peter  chugarum exclaimed grandfather frog chugarum not half so crazy as you are peter coming over here to the smiling pool in broad daylight he likes to be thought crazy just as his greatgreateversogreatgrandfather did before him thats all everybody thought his greatgreateversogreatgrandfather was crazy and it paid mr loon to have them think so so he did his best to make them keep thinking so  tell me about it do please tell me about it grandfather frog begged peter please please please  now how could grandfather frog resist that he couldnt he didnt even try to he just cleared his throat once or twice and began  once on a time long long ago lived the very first of all the loons the everandeverandeversogreatgrandfather of dippy whose voice frightened you so last night  how did you know it frightened me exclaimed peter for he had taken care not to tell grandfather frog anything about that  grandfather frog chuckled and went right on with his story right from the beginning mr loon was a mighty independent fellow it didnt take him long to find out that old mother nature had too much to do to waste any time on those who didnt try to take care of themselves and that those would live longest who were smartest and most independent he had sharp eyes had old mr loon just as dippy has today and he used them to good account he saw at once that with so many birds and animals living on the land it was likely to get crowded after a while and that when such became the case it was going to be mighty hard work for some to get a living so mr loon went to mother nature and told her that if she had no objections he would like a pair of swimming feet and would live on the water  now old mother nature had just fitted out mr duck with a pair of webbed feet that he might swim so she was quite prepared to fit mr loon out in like manner  i suppose said she that you want a bill like mr ducks  mr loon shook his head thank you said he but i would prefer a sharp bill to a broad one  how is that exclaimed mother nature mr duck has been delighted with his bill ever since i gave it to him  and with good reason replied mr loon did i propose to live as mr duck lives i should want a bill just like his but i find that fish are more to my liking also i have noticed that there are fewer who eat fish  so mother nature gave him the kind of bill he wanted and mr loon went about his business he managed to get fish enough to keep from going hungry but he found that the only way he could do it was to sit perfectly still until a fish swam within reach and then strike swiftly in fact his fishing was much like that of mr heron save that the latter stood instead of sitting success was chiefly the result of luck and patience  now this sort of thing was not at all to the liking of mr loon he gloried in his strength and he wanted to hunt for his fish and catch them in fair chase instead of waiting for them to unsuspectingly swim within reach he practised and practised swimming and diving but he soon made up his mind that he never would be able to move through the water fast enough to catch a fish unless there was some change he watched the fish swim and he saw that the power which drove them through the water came from their tails mr loon grew very thoughtful  the next time mother nature came around to see how everybody was getting on to hear complaints and to grant such requests as seemed wise mr loon was on hand if you please said he when his turn came i would like my legs moved back to the lower end of my body  mother nature was surprised she looked it but youll hardly be able to walk at all with your legs there she exclaimed  mr loon said that he knew that and that he didnt want to walk he would far rather spend all his time on the water so mother nature granted his request mr loon thanked her and started for the water he couldnt keep his balance he simply flopped along while all his neighbors who had heard his queer request jeered at him and called him crazy he just didnt pay any attention but flopped along until he reached the water then he swam away swiftly when he was quite by himself with none to see he dived and as he had hoped he found that he could drive himself through the water at great speed he practised a while and then he went fishing when he caught his first fish in a fair chase he was so delighted that he shrieked and shouted and laughed in the wildest fashion far into the night and those who had heard his strange request and thought him crazy were sure of it as they listened to his wild laughter  so little by little it was spread about among all the other people that mr loon was crazy and he was left much to himself which was just what he desired he was quick to note that the sound of his voice sent shivers over some of his neighbors and so he would shriek and laugh just to drive them away it pleased him to have them think him crazy and he kept it up  so it is with dippy today and last night you ran from the voice of a crazy loon who isnt crazy at all but likes to make people think he is concluded grandfather frog     xvi  where bighorn got his curved horns   it was digger the badger who told peter rabbit the story of the great ram who was the first of all the wild sheep who live on the tops of the mountains bounding the great plains of the far west on which digger was born it happened that farmer browns flock of sheep were grazing in the old pasture in plain sight of digger as he sat on his doorstep watching his shadow grow longer at the head of the flock was a ram whose horns curved around in almost a circle and whom peter rabbit often had admired  peter happened along as digger sat there on his doorstep watching his shadow grow longer so he sat down at a safe and respectful distance and helped digger watch his shadow grow longer peter delights in doing things like this because it isnt hard work at all it is only when there is real work concerned that peter loses interest a lot of people are just like peter in this respect  peter gazed over at the old pasture and he too saw farmer browns sheep and the big ram with the curving horns at his head for a long time peter had greatly admired those horns though he never had told any one so he had admired those horns because they were different from any other horns peter ever had seen they looked perfectly useless for fighting because they curved so that the points never could be made to hurt any one but just the same peter admired them now as he watched he spoke aloud without thinking what he was doing  i wish i had a pair of horns like those said he wistfully  digger the badger stopped watching his shadow and turned to stare at peter then he laughed until finally he choked peter looked at him in surprise  whats the matter with you mr badger asked he what is there to laugh at  only you peter only you replied digger faintly for he had laughed so hard that he had almost lost his voice i am afraid you would find a pair of horns like those rather heavy peter rather heavy  peter grinned of course i didnt really mean that said he of course not i was just thinking how nice it would be to have such fine horns if one were big enough to have horns i dont believe there are any other such horns in all the great world  and that shows how little you know about the great world peter retorted digger the badger  did you ever see such horns before demanded peter  no i never did confessed digger but ive heard my grandfather tell of sheep that live on the tops of the great mountains as free as lightfoot the deer or any other of the green forest people and with horns so large that they the sheep are called bighorns from what i have heard my grandfather say those horns over there of mr rams are nothing to brag about no sir they are nothing to brag about one of those wild free cousins of mr ram over there would laugh at those horns but they are funny horns and theyve been like that always since the days of the first great ram the greatgreateversogreatgrandfather of all the sheep so my grandfather told me it was way back in those longago days that they became curved and quite useless for fighting and all because of old bighorn going about with a chip on his shoulder  peter pricked up his ears that was a funny thing for bighorn to be doing said he what under the sun did he have a chip on his shoulder for and what harm was there in that even if he did  once more digger began to laugh peter said he you certainly are the funniest fellow i know of course old bighorn didnt really have a chip on his shoulder that is just a saying peter just a saying when any one goes about looking for trouble and ready to quarrel at the least pretext he is said to be carrying a chip on his shoulder and daring anybody to knock it off  oh said peter  and so continued digger bighorn didnt have anything to do with a really truly chip but just went about always trying to get somebody to fight with him it wasnt that bighorn was ugly he wasnt you see old mother nature had given him great strength yes sir for his size bighorn was very strong and in that strength be took great pride and mother nature had given him a pair of very large and strong horns with which to defend himself if there should be need those horns were almost straight and with bighorns great strength behind them they were truly dangerous weapons he didnt think of that no sir he didnt think of that he was just brimming full of life and he dearly loved to try his strength against the strength of others it got so that the instant he saw anybody down would go his head and at them he would go full tilt  it was great funfor him sometimes he got the worst of it as when old king bear stepped aside at the very last instant and hit him such a clip with his great paw that bighorn was sent rolling over and over and lost his breath for a few minutes but usually it was the other who got the worst of it for those great sharppointed horns of bighorns tore and hurt indeed even when he tried to be gentle with those smaller than himself he was forever hurting some one  finally some of his neighbors wished to go to old mother nature and complain about bighorn but others were against this plan because they knew that old mother nature was quite loaded down with cares and worries as it was so instead they called a meeting to which everybody except bighorn was invited if bighorn could have heard all that was said about him his ears surely would have burned every one was of the opinion that something must be done but just what no one could suggest at last just when it seemed that the meeting would break up without anything being done old man coyote stepped forward now old man coyote already was known as a very clever fellow more clever even than mr fox though it would never have done to say so where it would get back to the ears of mr fox  friends and neighbors said old man coyote it seems to me a very simple matter to teach neighbor bighorn a lesson that he will not soon forget being rather bashful i havent liked to suggest it before because i thought surely some one else would do it i suggest that some one be selected to fight bighorn and when that one can fight no longer some one else be selected to fight him and so on until he gets tired and some one can whip him then i think he will have had enough of fighting  up spoke mr fox and he winked at his neighbor on the right and he winked at his neighbor on the left that is a very good idea of neighbor coyotes said he a very good idea indeed and i suggest that mr coyote be selected for the honor of being the first one to fight bighorn mr fox grinned in a sly way and everybody else grinned for everybody knew that old man coyote never was known to fight when there was a chance to run away so with one accord everybody agreed with mr fox and old man coyote was selected as the first one to face bighorn to everybodys surprise old man coyote made no objections instead he expressed himself as highly honored and said that he hoped to do so well that there would be no need for others to fight bighorn so it was arranged that bighorn should be invited to fight old man coyote the very next day  you may be sure that everybody was on hand the next day to see that fight no one expected old man coyote to appear but he did yes sir he did he was right on hand at the appointed time bighorn hadnt been told whom he was to fight and when he found that it was old man coyote he was disappointed you see there was no anger in bighorns fighting he fought just for the love of using his great strength and big horns fighting was fun to him and he wanted some one who would stand up to him as soon as it was explained to him that when he had disposed of old man coyote there would be some one else for him to fight mr deer had offered to be the next he felt better mr deer had horns and was somewhere near his size  old man coyote slipped around until he had his back to a great rock im ready any time said he  bighorn who had been stamping with impatience lowered his head so that his horns pointed straight at old man coyote he grinned as he did it for he saw that with that great rock behind him old man coyote would have no chance to run away as he always had done in the past everybody else saw the same thing and wondered what could have happened to make old man coyote so stupid as to do such a thing as that he who always had been accounted so clever but they had hardly time to think of this for with a snort bighorn bounded forward all the others held their breath as they saw those great horns driving straight at old man coyote who was crouched with his back to the great rock then everybody closed their eyes for a second for nobody wanted to see old man coyote killed and everybody knew that that was what was going to happen  then there was a crash and everybodys eyes flew open there lay bighorn on the ground looking mighty puzzled as if he wasnt quite sure what had happened and there sat old man coyote grinning at him they were still staring at old man coyote as if they couldnt believe their own eyes when some one cried look at the horns of bighorn  instead of being long and straight those great horns were curved over and round into almost a circle and there was no longer danger from their sharp points what had happened why at just the right instant old man coyote had leaped over bighorn and bighorn had butted into that great rock with all his might he had hit so hard biff bang that he had bent his horns just as crafty clever old man coyote had hoped he would  when old mother nature heard of the affair and saw those bent horns she chuckled at the cleverness of old man coyote and decided to leave those horns just as they were for the safety of bighorns neighbors and so they remained as long as bighorn lived and just so have been the horns in his family from that day to this concluded digger and once more began to watch his shadow grow longer
