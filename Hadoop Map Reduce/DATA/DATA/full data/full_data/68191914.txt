this volume have for the most part already appeared in an american edition combes new york 1886  the essays on old french titlepages and lady booklovers take the place of book binding and bookmen at rome elzevirs and some japanese bogie books are reprinted with permission of messrs cassell from the magazine of art curiosities of parish registers from the guardian literary forgeries from the contemporary review lady booklovers from the fortnightly review a bookmans purgatory and two of the pieces of verse from longmans magazinewith the courteous permission of the various editors  all the chapters have been revised and i have to thank mr h tedder for his kind care in reading the proof sheets and mr charles elton mp for a similar service to the essay on parish registers    elzevirs    the countryman  you know how much for some time past the editions of the elzevirs have been in demand  the fancy for them has even penetrated into the country  i am acquainted with a man there who denies himself necessaries for the sake of collecting into a library where other books are scarce enough as many little elzevirs as he can lay his hands upon  he is dying of hunger and his consolation is to be able to say i have all the poets whom the elzevirs printed  i have ten examples of each of them all with red letters and all of the right date  this no doubt is a craze for good as the books are if he kept them to read them one example of each would be enough  the parisian  if he had wanted to read them i would not have advised him to buy elzevirs  the editions of minor authors which these booksellers published even editions of the right date as you say are not too correct  nothing is good in the books but the type and the paper  your friend would have done better to use the editions of gryphius or estienne  this fragment of a literary dialogue i translate from entretiens sur les contes de fees a book which contains more of old talk about books and booksellers than about fairies and folklore  the entretiens were published in 1699 about sixteen years after the elzevirs ceased to be publishers  the fragment is valuable  first because it shows us how early the taste for collecting elzevirs was fully developed and secondly because it contains very sound criticism of the mania  already in the seventeenth century lovers of the tiny elzevirian books waxed pathetic over dates already they knew that a caesar of 1635 was the right caesar already they were fond of the redlettered passages as in the first edition of the virgil of 1636  as early as 1699 too the parisian critic knew that the editions were not very correct and that the paper type ornaments and format were their main attractions  to these we must now add the rarity of really good elzevirs  though elzevirs have been more fashionable than at present they are still regarded by novelists as the great prize of the book collector  you read in novels about priceless little elzevirs about books as rare as an old elzevir  i have met in the works of a lady novelist but not elsewhere with an elzevir theocritus  the late mr hepworth dixon introduced into one of his romances a romantic elzevir greek testament worth its weight in gold  casual remarks of this kind encourage a popular delusion that all elzevirs are pearls of considerable price  when a man is first smitten with the pleasant fever of bookcollecting it is for elzevirs that he searches  at first he thinks himself in amazing luck  in booksellers row and in castle street he picks up for a shilling or two elzevirs real or supposed  to the beginner any book with a sphere on the titlepage is an elzevir  for the beginners instruction two copies of spheres are printed here  the second is a sphere an illcut illdrawn sphere which is not elzevirian at all  the mark was used in the seventeenth century by many other booksellers and printers  the first on the other hand is a true elzevirian sphere from a play of molieres printed in 1675  observe the comparatively neat drawing of the first sphere and be not led away after spurious imitations  beware too of the vulgar error of fancying that little duodecimos with the mark of the fox and the bees nest and the motto quaerendo come from the press of the elzevirs  the mark is that of abraham wolfgang which name is not a pseudonym for elzevir there are three sorts of elzevir pseudonyms  first they occasionally reprinted the full titlepage publishers name and all of the book they pirated  secondly when they printed books of a dangerous sort jansenist pamphlets and so forth they used pseudonyms like nic schouter on the lettres provinciales of pascal  thirdly there are real pseudonyms employed by the elzevirs  john and daniel printing at leyden 16521655 used the false name jean sambix  the elzevirs of amsterdam often placed the name jacques le jeune on their titlepages  the collector who remembers these things must also see that his purchases have the right ornaments at the heads of chapters the right tailpieces at the ends  two of the most frequently recurring ornaments are the socalled tete de buffle and the sirene  more or less clumsy copies of these and the other elzevirian ornaments are common enough in books of the period even among those printed out of the low countries for example in books published in paris  a brief sketch of the history of the elzevirs may here be useful the founder of the family a flemish bookbinder louis left louvain and settled in leyden in 1580  he bought a house opposite the university and opened a bookshop  another shop on college ground was opened in 1587  louis was a good bookseller a very ordinary publisher  it was not till shortly before his death in 1617 that his grandson isaac bought a set of types and other material  louis left six sons  two of these matthew and bonaventure kept on the business dating ex officina elzeviriana in 1625 bonaventure and abraham son of matthew became partners the good dates of elzevirian books begin from 1626  the two elzevirs chose excellent types and after nine years endeavours turned out the beautiful caesar of 1635  their classical series in petit format was opened with horace and ovid in 1629  in 1641 they began their elegant piracies of french plays and poetry with le cid  it was worth while being pirated by the elzevirs who turned you out like a gentleman with fleurons and red letters and a pretty frontispiece  the modern pirate dresses you in rags prints you murderously and binds you if he binds you at all in some hideous example of cloth extra all gilt like archaic gingerbread  bonaventure and abraham both died in 1652 they did not depart before publishing 1628 in grand format a desirable work on fencing thibaults academie de lespee  this tibbald also killed by the book  john and daniel elzevir came next they brought out the imitation thomae a kempis canonici regularis ord  s augustini de imitatione christi libri iv i wish by taking thought i could add eight millimetres to the stature of my copy  in 1655 daniel joined a cousin louis in amsterdam and john stayed in leyden  john died in 1661 his widow struggled on but her son abraham 1681 let all fall into ruins  abraham died 1712 the elzevirs of amsterdam lasted till 1680 when daniel died and the business was wound up  the type by christopher van dyck was sold in 1681 by daniels widow  sic transit gloria  after he has learned all these matters the amateur has still a great deal to acquire  he may now know a real elzevir from a book which is not an elzevir at all  but there are enormous differences of value rarity and excellence among the productions of the elzevirian press  the bookstalls teem with small cropped dingy dirty battered elzevirian editions of the classics not of the good date  on these it is not worth while to expend a couple of shillings especially as elzevirian type is too small to be read with comfort by most modern eyes  no let the collector save his money avoid littering his shelves with what he will soon find to be rubbish and let him wait the chance of acquiring a really beautiful and rare elzevir  meantime and before we come to describe elzevirs of the first flight let it be remembered that the taller the copy the less harmed and nipped by the binders shears the better  men scarcely know how beautiful fire is says shelley and we may say that most men hardly know how beautiful an elzevir was in its uncut and original form  the elzevirs we have may be dear but they are certainly dumpy twelves  their fair proportions have been docked by the binder  at the beckford sale there was a pearl of a book a marot not an elzevir indeed but a book published by wetstein a follower of the elzevirs  this exquisite pair of volumes bound in blue morocco was absolutely unimpaired and was a sight to bring happy tears into the eyes of the amateur of elzevirs  there was a gracious svelte elegance about these tomes an appealing and exquisite delicacy of proportion that linger like sweet music in the memory  i have a copy of the wetstein marot myself not a bad copy though murderously bound in that ecclesiastical sort of brown calf antique which goes well with hymn books and reminds one of cakes of chocolate  but my copy is only some 128 millimetres in height whereas the uncut beckford copy it had belonged to the great pixerecourt was at least 130 millimetres high  beside the uncut example mine looks like cinderellas plain sister beside the beauty of the family  now the moral is that only tall elzevirs are beautiful only tall elzevirs preserve their ancient proportions only tall elzevirs are worth collecting  dr lemuel gulliver remarks that the king of lilliput was taller than any of his court by almost the breadth of a nail and that his altitude filled the minds of all with awe  well the philistine may think a few millimetres more or less in the height of an elzevir are of little importance  when he comes to sell he will discover the difference  an uncut or almost uncut copy of a good elzevir may be worth fifty or sixty pounds or more an ordinary copy may bring fewer pence  the binders usually pare down the top and bottom more than the sides  i have a rabelais of the good date with the red title 1663 and some of the pages have never been opened at the sides  but the height is only some 122 millimetres a mere dwarf  anything over 130 millimetres is very rare  therefore the collector of elzevirs should have one of those useful ivoryhandled knives on which the french measures are marked and thus he will at once be able to satisfy himself as to the exact height of any example which he encounters  let us now assume that the amateur quite understands what a proper elzevir should be  tall clean well bound if possible and of the good date  but we have still to learn what the good dates are and this is matter for the study and practice of a wellspent life  we may gossip about a few of the more famous elzevirs those without which no collection is complete  of all elzevirs the most famous and the most expensive is an old cookery book le pastissier francois  wherein is taught the way to make all sorts of pastry useful to all sorts of persons  also the manner of preparing all manner of eggs for fastdays and other days in more than sixty fashions  amsterdam louys and daniel elsevier 1665  the mark is not the old sage but the minerva with her owl  now this book has no intrinsic value any more than a tauchnitz reprint of any modern volume on cooking  the pastissier is cherished because it is so very rare  the tract passed into the hands of cooks and the hands of cooks are detrimental to literature  just as nursery books fairy tales and the like are destroyed from generation to generation so it happens with books used in the kitchen  the pastissier to be sure has a good frontispiece a scene in a low country kitchen among the dead game and the dainties  the buxom cook is making a game pie a pheasant pie decorated with the birds head and tailfeathers is already made 1  not for these charms but for its rarity is the pastissier coveted  in an early edition of the manuel 1821 brunet says with a feigned brutality for he dearly loved an elzevir till now i have disdained to admit this book into my work but i have yielded to the prayers of amateurs  besides how could i keep out a volume which was sold for one hundred and one francs in 1819  one hundred and one francs  if i could only get a pastissier for one hundred and one francs  but our grandfathers lived in the bookmans paradise  il nest pas jusquaux anglais adds brunetthe very english themselveshave a taste for the pastissier  the duke of marlboroughs copy was actually sold for 1 pound 4s  it would have been money in the ducal pockets of the house of marlborough to have kept this volume till the general sale of all their portable property at which our generation is privileged to assist  no wonder the pastissier was thought rare  berard only knew two copies pietiers writing on the elzevirs in 1843 could cite only five pastissiers and in his annales he had found out but five more willems on the other hand enumerates some thirty not including motteleys  motteley was an uncultivated untaught enthusiast  he knew no latin but he had a flair for uncut elzevirs  incomptis capillis he would cry it was all his lore as he gloated over his treasures  they were all burnt by the commune in the louvre library  a few examples may be given of the prices brought by le pastissier in later days  sensiers copy was but 128 millimetres in height and had the old ordinary vellum bindingin fact it closely resembled a copy which messrs ellis and white had for sale in bond street in 1883  the english booksellers asked i think about 1500 francs for their copy  sensiers was sold for 128 francs in april 1828 for 201 francs in 1837  then the book was gloriously bound by trautzbauzonnet and was sold with potiers books in 1870 when it fetched 2910 francs  at the benzon sale 1875 it fetched 3255 francs and falling dreadfully in price was sold again in 1877 for 2200 francs  m dutuit at rouen has a taller copy bound by bauzonnet  last time it was sold 1851 it brought 251 francs  the duc de chartres has now the copy of pieters the historian of the elzevirs valued at 3000 francs  about thirty years ago no fewer than three copies were sold at brighton of all places  m quentin bauchart had a copy only 127 millimetres in height which he swopped to m paillet  m chartener of metz had a copy now bound by bauzonnet which was sold for four francs in 1780  we call this the age of cheap books but before the revolution books were cheaper  it is fair to say however that this example of the pastissier was then bound up with another book vlacqs edition of le cuisinier francois and so went cheaper than it would otherwise have done  m de fontaine de resbecq declares that a friend of his bought six original pieces of molieres bound up with an old french translation of garths dispensary  the one faint hope left to the poor book collector is that he may find a valuable tract lurking in the leaves of some bound collection of trash  i have an original copy of molieres les fascheux bound up with a treatise on precious stones but the bookseller from whom i bought it knew it was there  that made all the difference  but to return to our pastissier here is m de fontaine de resbecqs account of how he wooed and won his own copy of this illustrious elzevir  i began my walk today says this haunter of ancient stalls by the pont marie and the quai de la greve the pillars of hercules of the bookhunting world  after having viewed and reviewed these remote books i was going away when my attention was caught by a small naked volume without a stitch of binding  i seized it and what was my delight when i recognised one of the rarest of that famed elzevir collection whose height is measured as minutely as the carats of the diamond  there was no indication of price on the box where this jewel was lying the book though unbound was perfectly clean within  how much said i to the bookseller  you can have it for six sous he answered is it too much  no said i and trembling a little i handed him the thirty centimes he asked for the pastissier francois  you may believe my friend that after such a piece of luck at the start one goes home fondly embracing the beloved object of ones search that is exactly what i did  can this tale be true  is such luck given by the jealous fates mortalibus aegris  m de resbecqs find was made apparently in 1856 when trout were plenty in the streams and rare books not so very rare  to my own knowledge an english collector has bought an original play of molieres in the original vellum for eighteenpence  but no one has such luck any longer  not at least in london  a more expensive pastissier than that which brought six sous was priced in bachelindeflorennes catalogue at 240 pounds  a curious thing occurred when two uncut pastissiers turned up simultaneously in paris  one of them morgand and fatout sold for 400 pounds  clever people argued that one of the twin uncut pastissiers must be an imitation a facsimile by means of photogravure or some other process  but it was triumphantly established that both were genuine they had minute points of difference in the ornaments  m willems the learned historian of the elzevirs is indignant at the successes of a book which as brunet declares is badly printed there must be at least forty known pastissiers in the world  yes but there are at least 4000 people who would greatly rejoice to possess a pastissier and some of these desirous ones are very wealthy  while this state of the market endures the pastissier will fetch higher prices than the other varieties  another extremely rare elzevir is lillustre theatre de mons corneille leyden 1644  this contains le cid les horaces le cinna la mort de pompee le polyeucte  the name lillustre theatre appearing at that date has an interest of its own  in 164344 moliere and madeleine bejart had just started the company which they called lillustre theatre  only six or seven copies of the book are actually known though three or four are believed to exist in england probably all covered with dust in the library of some lord  he has a very good library i once heard some one say to a noble earl whose own library was famous  and what can a fellow do with a very good library answered the descendant of the crusaders who probably being a youth lighthearted and content was ignorant of his own great possessions  an expensive copy of lillustre theatre bound by trautzbauzonnet was sold for 300 pounds  among elzevirs desirable yet not hopelessly rare is the virgil of 1636  heinsius was the editor of this beautiful volume prettily printed but incorrect  probably it is hard to correct with absolute accuracy works in the clear but minute type which the elzevirs affected  they have won fame by the elegance of their books but their intention was to sell good books cheap like michel levy  the small type was required to get plenty of copy into little bulk  nicholas heinsius the son of the editor of the virgil when he came to correct his fathers edition found that it contained so many coquilles or misprints as to be nearly the most incorrect copy in the world  heyne says let the virgil be one of the rare elzevirs if you please but within it has scarcely a trace of any good quality  yet the first edition of this beautiful little book with its two passages of red letters is so desirable that till he could possess it charles nodier would not profane his shelves by any virgil at all  equally fine is the caesar of 1635 which with the virgil of 1636 and the imitation without date m willems thinks the most successful works of the elzevirs one of the most enviable jewels in the casket of the bibliophile  it may be recognised by the page 238 which is erroneously printed 248  a good average height is from 125 to 128 millimetres  the highest known is 130 millimetres this book like the imitation has one of the pretty and ingenious frontispieces which the elzevirs prefixed to their books  so farewell and good speed in your sport ye hunters of elzevirs and may you find perhaps the rarest elzevir of all laimable mere de jesus    ballade of the real and ideal double refrain    o visions of salmon tremendous of trout of unusual weight of waters that wander as ken does ye come through the ivory gate but

the people that hold us in scorn but the sorrow the scathe and the hate through the portals of horn  envoy  fair dreams of things golden and great ye come through the ivory gate but the facts that are bleak and forlorn through the portals of horn    curiosities of parish registers    there are three classes of persons who are deeply concerned with parish registersnamely villains antiquaries and the sedulous readers parish clerks and others of the second or agony column of the times  villains are probably the most numerous of these three classes  the villain of fiction dearly loves a parish register  he cuts out pages inserts others intercalates remarks in a different coloured ink and generally manipulates the register as a greek manages his hand at ecarte or as a hebrew dealer in moabite bricabrac treats a synagogue roll  we well remember one villain who had locked himself into the vestry he was disguised as an archaeologist and who was enjoying his wicked pleasure with the register when the vestry somehow caught fire the rusty key would not turn in the door and the villain was roasted alive in spite of the disinterested efforts to save him made by all the virtuous characters in the story  let the fate of this bold bad man be a warning to wicked earls baronets and all others who attempt to destroy the record of the marriage of a heros parents  fate will be too strong for them in the long run though they bribe the parish clerk or carry off in white wax an impression of the keys of the vestry and of the iron chest in which a register should repose  there is another and more prosaic danger in the way of villains if the new bill entitled the parish registers preservation act ever becomes law  the bill provides that every register earlier than 1837 shall be committed to the care of the master of the rolls and removed to the record office  now the common villain of fiction would feel sadly out of place in the register office where a more watchful eye than that of a comic parish clerk would be kept on his proceedings  villains and local antiquaries will therefore use all their parliamentary influence to oppose and delay this bill which is certainly hard on the parish archaeologist  the men who grub in their local registers and slowly compile parish or county history deserve to be encouraged rather than depressed  mr chester waters therefore has suggested that copies of registers should be made and the comparatively legible copy left in the parish while the crabbed original is conveyed to the record office in london  thus the local antiquary would really have his work made more easy for him though it may be doubted whether he would quite enjoy that condescension while the villain of romance would be foiled for it is useless as a novel of mr christie murrays proves to alter the register in the keeping of the parish when the original document is safe in the record office  but previous examples of enforced transcription as in 1603 do not encourage us to suppose that the copies would be very scrupulously made  thus after the reformation the prayers for the dead in the old registers were omitted by the copyist who seemed to think as the contractor for sandwich men said to the poor fellows who carried the letter h i dont want you and the public dont want you and youre no use to nobody  again when laurence fletcher was buried in st saviours southwark in 1608 the old register described him as a player the kings servant  but the clerk keeping a notebook simply called laurence fletcher a man and in 1625 he also styled mr john fletcher a man  now the old register calls mr john fletcher a poet  to copy all the parish registers in england would be a very serious task and would probably be but slovenly performed  if they were reproduced again by any process of photography the old difficult court hand would remain as hard as ever  but this is a minor objection for the local antiquary revels in the old court hand  from the little volume by mr chester waters already referred to parish registers in england printed for the author by f j roberts little britain ec we proceed to appropriate such matters of curiosity as may interest minds neither parochial nor doggedly antiquarian  parish registers among the civilised peoples of antiquity do not greatly concern us  it seems certain that many polynesian races have managed to record in verse or by some rude marks the genealogies of their chiefs through many hundreds of years  these oral registers are accepted as fairly truthful by some students yet we must remember that pindar supposed himself to possess knowledge of at least twentyfive generations before his own time and that only brought him up to the birth of jason  nobody believes in jason and medea and possibly the genealogical records of maoris and fijians are as little trustworthy as those of pindaric greece  however to consider thus is to consider too curiously  we only know for certain that genealogy very soon becomes important and therefore that records are early kept in a growing civilisation  after nehemiahs return from the captivity in babylon the priests at jerusalem whose register was not found were as polluted put from the priesthood  rome had her parish registers which were kept in the temple of saturn  but modern parish registers were discovered like america in 1497 when cardinal ximenes found it desirable to put on record the names of the godfathers and godmothers of baptised children  when these relations of gossip or gods kin as the word literally means were not certainly known married persons could easily obtain divorces by pretending previous spiritual relationship  but it was only during the reign of mary called the bloody that this rule of registering godfathers and godmothers prevailed in england  henry viii introduced the custom of parish registers when in a protestant humour  by the way how curiously has madame de flamareil la femme de quarante ans in charles de bernards novel anticipated the verdict of mr froude on henry viii  on accuse henri viii dit madame de flamareil moi je le comprends et je labsous cetait un coeur genereux lorsquil ne les aimait plus il les tuait  the public of england mistrusted in the matter of parish registers the generous heart of henry viii  it is the fixed conviction of the public that all novelties in administration mean new taxes  thus the croatian peasantry were once on the point of revolting because they imagined that they were to be taxed in proportion to the length of their moustaches  the english believed and the insurgents of the famous pilgrimage of grace declared that baptism was to be refused to all children who did not pay a trybette tribute to the king  but henry or rather his minister cromwell stuck to his plan and september 29 1538 issued an injunction that a weekly register of weddings christenings and burials should be kept by the curate of every parish  the cost of the book twopence in the case of st margarets westminster was defrayed by the parishioners  the oldest extant register books are those thus acquired in 1597 or 1603  these volumes were of parchment and entries were copied into them out of the old books on paper  the copyists as we have seen were indolent and omitted characteristic points in the more ancient records  in the civil war parish registers fell into some confusion and when the clergy did make entries they commonly expressed their political feelings in a mixture of latin and english  latin by the way went out as protestantism came in but the curate of rotherby in leicestershire writes bellum bellum bellum interruption persecution  at st bridgets in chester is the quaint entry 1643  here the register is defective till 1653  the tymes were such  at hilton in dorset william snoke minister entered his opinion that persons whose baptism and marriage were not registered will be made uncapable of any earthly inheritance if they live this i note for the satisfaction of any that do though we may doubt whether these parishioners found the information thus conveyed highly satisfactory  the register of maids moreton bucks tells how the readingdesk a spread eagle gilt was doomed to perish as an abominable idoll and how the cross on the steeple nearly but not quite knocked out the brains of the puritan who removed it  the puritans had their way with the registers as well as with the eagle the vowl as the old country people call it and laymen took the place of parsons as registrars in 1653  the books from 1653 to 1660 while this regime lasted were kept exceptionally well new brooms sweeping clean the books of the period contain fewer of the old puritan christian names than we might have expected  we find repente kytchens so styled before the poor little thing had anything but original sin to repent of  faint not kennard is also registered and freegift mabbe  a novelty was introduced into registers in 1678  the law required for purposes of protecting trade that all the dead should be buried in woollen windingsheets  the price of the wool was the obolus paid to the charon of the revenue  after march 25 1667 no person was to be buried in any shirt shift or sheet other that should be made of woole only  thus when the children in a little oxfordshire village lately beheld a ghost dressed in a long narrow gown of woollen with bandages round the head and chin it is clear that the ghost was much more than a hundred years old for the act had fallen into disuse long before it was repealed in 1814  but this has little to do with parish registers  the addition made to the duties of the keeper of the register in 1678 was thishe had to take and record the affidavit of a kinsman of the dead to the effect that the corpse was actually buried in woollen fabric  the upper classes however preferred to bury in linen and to pay the fine of 5l  when mistress oldfield the famous actress was interred in 1730 her body was arrayed in a very fine brussels lace headdress a holland shift with a tucker and double ruffles of the same lace and a pair of new kid gloves  in 1694 an empty exchequer was replenished by a tax on marriages births and burials the very extortion which had been feared by the insurgents in the pilgrimage of grace  the tax collectors had access without payment of fee to the registers  the registration of births was discontinued when the taxation acts expired  an attempt to introduce the registration of births was made in 1753 but unsuccessfully  the public had the old superstitious dread of anything like a census  moreover the custom was denounced as french and therefore abominable  in the same way it was thought telling to call the cloture the french gag during some recent discussions of parliamentary rules  in 1783 the parish register was again made the instrument of taxation and threepence was charged on every entry  thus the clergyman was placed in the invidious light of a tax collector and as the poor were often unable or unwilling to pay the tax the clergy had a direct inducement to retain their goodwill by keeping the registers defective  it is easy to imagine the indignation in scotland when bang went saxpence every time a poor man had twins  of course the scotch rose up against this unparalleled extortion  at last in 1812 roses act was passed  it is styled an act for the better regulating and preserving registers of births but the registration of births is altogether omitted from its provisions  by a stroke of the wildest wit the penalty of transportation for fourteen years for making a false entry is to be divided equally between the informer and the poor of the parish  a more casual act has rarely been drafted  without entering into the modern history of parish registers we may borrow a few of the ancient curiosities to be found therein the blunders and the waggeries of forgotten priests and curates and parish clerks  in quite recent times 1832 it was thought worth while to record that charity morrell at her wedding had signed her name in the register with her right foot and that the ring had been placed on the fourth toe of her left foot for poor charity was born without arms  sometimes the time of a birth was recorded with much minuteness that the astrologers might draw a more accurate horoscope  unlucky children with no acknowledged fathers were entered in a variety of odd ways  in lambeth 1685 george speedwell is put down as a merry begot anne twine is filia uniuscujusque  at croydon a certain william is terraefilius 1582 an autochthonous infant  among the queer names of foundlings are nameless godsend subpoena and moyses and aaron two children found not in the bulrushes but in the street  the rule was to give the foundling for surname the name of the parish and from the temple church came no fewer than one hundred and four foundlings named temple between 1728 and 1755  these temples are the plebeian gens of the patrician house which claims descent from godiva  the use of surnames as christian names is later than the reformation and is the result of a reaction against the exclusive use of saints names from the calendar  another example of the same reaction is the use of old testament names and ananias and sapphira were favourite names with the presbyterians it is only fair to add that these names are no longer popular with presbyterians at any rate in the kirk of scotland  the old puritan argument was that you would hardly select the name of too notorious a scriptural sinner as bearing testimony to the triumph of grace over original sin  but in america a clergyman has been known to decline to christen a child pontius pilate and no wonder  entries of burials in ancient times often contained some biographical information about the deceased  but nothing could possibly be vaguer than this  1615 february 28 st martins ludgate was buried an anatomy from the college of physicians man woman or child sinner or saint we know not only that an anatomy found christian burial in st martins ludgate  how much more full and characteristic is this from st petersintheeast oxford 1568  there was buried alyce the wiff of a naughty fellow whose name is matthew manne  there is immortality for matthew manne and there is in shorthand the tragedy of alyce his wiff  the reader of this record knows more of matthew than in two hundred years any one is likely to know of us who moralise over matthew  at kyloe in northumberland the intellectual defects of henry watson have like the naughtiness of manne secured him a measure of fame 1696  henry was so great a fooll that he never could put on his own close nor never went a quarter of a mile off the house as voltaires memnon resolved never to do and as pascal partly recommends  what had mary woodfield done to deserve the alias which the croydon register gives her of queen of hell 1788  distinguished people were buried in effigy in all the different churches with which they were connected and each sham burial service was entered in the parish registers a snare and stumblingblock to the historian this curious custom is very ancient  thus we read in the odyssey that when menelaus heard in egypt of the death of agamemnon he reared for him a cenotaph and piled an empty barrow that the fame of the dead man might never be quenched  probably this old usage gave rise to the claims of several greek cities to possess the tomb of this or that ancient hero  a heroic tomb as of cassandra for example several towns had to show but which was the true grave which were the cenotaphs  queen elizabeth was buried in all the london churches and poor cassandra had her barrow in argos mycenae and amyclae  a drynkyng for the soul of the dead a greek text or funeral feast was as common in england before the reformation as in ancient greece  james cooke of sporle in norfolk 1528 left six shillings and eightpence to pay for this drynkyng for his soul and the funeral feast which long survived in the distribution of wine wafers and rosemary still endures as a slight collation of wine and cake in scotland  what a funeral could be as late as 1731 mr chester waters proves by the bill for the burial of andrew card senior bencher of grays inn  the deceased was brave in a superfine pinked shroud cheap at 1l 5s 6d and there were eight large plate candlesticks on stands round the dais and ninetysix buckram escutcheons  the pallbearers wore alamode hatbands covered with frizances and so did the divines who were present at the melancholy but gorgeous function  a hundred men in mourning carried a hundred white wax branch lights and the gloves of the porters in grays inn were ashcoloured with black points yet the wine cost no more than 1l 19s 6d a deal of sack by no means intolerable  leaving the funerals we find that the parish register sometimes records ancient and obsolete modes of death  thus martyrs are scarce now but the register of all saints derby 1556 mentions a poor blinde woman called joan waste of this parish a martyr burned in windmill pit  she was condemned by ralph baynes bishop of coventry and lichfield  in 1558 at richmond in yorkshire we find richard snell brnt bur 9 sept  at croydon in 1585 roger shepherd probably never expected to be eaten by a lioness roger was not like wyllyam barker a common drunkard and blasphemer and we cannot regard the croydon lioness like the nemean lion as a miraculous monster sent against the county of surrey for the sins of the people  the lioness was brought into the town to be seen of such as would give money to see her  he roger was sore wounded in sundry places and was buried the 26th aug  in 1590 the register of st oswalds durham informs us that duke hyll hogge and holiday were hanged and burned for there horrible offences  the arm of one of these horrible offenders was preserved at st omer as the relic of a martyr a most precious treasure in 1686  but no one knew whether the arm belonged originally to holiday hyll duke or hogge  the coals when these unfortunate men were burned cost sixpence the other items in the account of the abominable execution are perhaps too repulsive to be quoted  according to some critics of the british government we do not treat the egyptians well  but our conduct towards the fellahs has certainly improved since this entry was made in the register of st nicholas durham 1592 august 8th  simson arington featherston fenwick and lancaster were hanged for being egyptians  they were in fact gypsies or had been consorting with gypsies and they suffered under 5 eliz c 20  in 1783 this statute was abolished and was even considered a law of excessive severity  for even a hundred years ago the puling cant of sickly humanitarianism was making itself heard to the injury of our sturdy old english legislation  to be killed by a poet is now an unusual fate but the st leonards shoreditch register 1598 mentions how gabriel spencer being slayne was buried  gabriel was slayne by rare ben jonson in hoxton fields  the burning of witches is naturally not an uncommon item in parish registers and is set forth in a bold businesslike manner  on august 21 1650 fifteen women and one man were executed for the imaginary crime of witchcraft  a grave for a witch sixpence is an item in the municipal accounts  and the grave was a cheap haven for the poor woman who had been committed to the tender mercies of a scotch witchtrier  cetewayos medicinemen who smelt out witches were only some two centuries in the rear of our civilisation  three hundred years ago bishop jewell preaching before elizabeth was quite of the mind of cetewayo and saul as to the wickedness of suffering a witch to live  as late as 1691 the register of holy island northumberland mentions william cleugh bewitched to death and the superstition is almost as powerful as ever among the rural people  between july 13 and july 24 1699 the widow comon in essex was thrice swum for a witch  she was not drowned but survived her immersion for only five months  a singular homicide is recorded at newington butts 1689  john arris and derwick farlin in one grave being both dutch soldiers one killed the other drinking brandy  but who slew the slayer  the register is silent but often eating a shoulder of mutton or a peck of hasty pudding at a time caused the death of james parsons at teddington in middlesex 1743  parsons had resisted the effects of shoulders of mutton and hasty pudding till the age of thirtysix  and so the registers run on  sometimes they tell of the death of a glutton sometimes of a grace wyfe grosse femme  now the bell tolls for the decease of a duke now of a dogwhipper lutenists and saltpetrementhe skeleton of the old german allegory whispers to each and twitches him by the sleeve  ellis thompson insipiens leaves chesterlestreet where he had gabbled and scrabbled on the doors and

office for newcastle had her regular town fools before she acquired her singularly advanced modern representatives  the aquavity man dies in cripplegate and the dumbman who was a fortuneteller stepney 1628 and the kings falkner and mr gregory isham who combined the professions not frequently united of attorney and husbandman in barwell leicestershire 1655  the lame chimney sweeper and the king of the gypsies and alexander willis qui calographiam docuit the linguist and the tom o bedlam the comfitmaker and the panyerman and the tackmaker and the suicide they all found death or if they sought him the churchyard where they were hurled into a grave was interdicted and purified after a fortnight with frankincense and sweet perfumes and herbs  sometimes people died wholesale of pestilence and the longborough register mentions a fresh way of death the swat called new acquaintance alias stoupe knave and know thy master  another malady was the posting swet that posted from towne to towne through england  the plague of 1591 was imported in bales of cloth from the levant just as british commerce still patriotically tries to introduce cholera in cargoes of egyptian rags  the register of malpas in cheshire aug 24 1625 has this strange story of the plague  richard dawson being sicke of the plague and perceiving he must die at yt time arose out of his bed and made his grave and caused his nefew john dawson to cast strawe into the grave which was not farre from the house and went and layd him down in the sayd grave and caused clothes to be layd uppon and so depted out of this world this he did because he was a strong man and heavier than his said nefew and another wench were able to bury  and john dawson died and rose smyth the wench already spoken of died the last of the household  old customs survive in the parish registers  scolding wives were ducked and in kingstononthames 1572 the register tells how the sextons wife was sett on a new cukkingstoole and brought to temes brydge and there had three duckings over head and eres because she was a common scold and fighter  the cuckingstool a very elaborate engine of the law cost 1l 3s 4d  men were ducked for beating their wives and if that custom were revived the profession of cuckingstool maker would become busy and lucrative penances of a graver sort are on record in the registers  margaret sherioux in croydon 1597 was ordered to stand three market days in the town and three sundays in the church in a white sheet  the sin imputed to her was a dreadful one  she stood one saturday and one sunday and died the next  innocent or guilty this world was no longer a fit abidingplace for margaret sherioux  occasionally the keeper of the register entered any event which seemed out of the common  thus the register of st nicholas durham 1568 has this contribution to natural history  a certaine italian brought into the cittie of durham a very greate strange and monstrous serpent in length sixteen feet in quantitie and dimentions greater than a greate horse which was taken and killed by special policie in ethiopia within the turkas dominions but before it was killed it had devoured as is credibly thought more than 1000 persons and destroyed a great country  this must have been a descendant of the monster that would have eaten andromeda and was slain by perseus in the country of the blameless ethiopians  collections of money are recorded occasionally as in 1680 when no less than one pound eight shillings was contributed for redemption of christians taken by ye turkish pyrates out of turkish slavery  two hundred years ago the turk was pretty unspeakable still  of all blundering dogberries the most confused kept in 1670 the parish register at melton mowbray  here he writes is a bill of burton lazareths people which was buried and which was and maried above 10 years old for because the clarke was dead and therefore they was not set down according as they was but they all set down sure enough one among another here in this place  they all set down sure enough nor does it matter much now to know whom they married and how long they lived in melton mowbray  the following

weary nations ills who from his study window sees the circle of the sussex hills    some japanese bogiebooks    there is or used to be a poem for infant minds of a rather pharisaical character which was popular in the nursery when i was a youngster  it ran something like this   i thank my stars that i was born a little british child   perhaps these were not the very words but that was decidedly the sentiment  look at the japanese infants from the pencil of the famous hokusai  though they are not british were there ever two jollier happier small creatures  did leech or mr du maurier or andrea della robbia ever present a more delightful view of innocent wellpleased childhood  well these japanese children if they are in the least inclined to be timid or nervous must have an awful time of it at night in the dark and when they make that eerie northwest passage bedwards through the darkling house of which mr stevenson sings the perils and the emotions  all of us who did not suffer under parents brought up on the views of mr herbert spencer have endured in childhood a good deal from ghosts  but it is nothing to what japanese children bear for our ghosts are to the spectres of japan as moonlight is to sunlight or as water unto whisky  personally i may say that few people have been plagued by the terror that walketh in darkness more than myself  at the early age of ten i had the tales of the ingenious mr edgar poe and of charlotte bronte put into my hands by a cousin who had served as a bashi bazouk and knew not the meaning of fear  but i did and perhaps even nelson would have found out what fear was or the boy in the norse tale would have learned to shiver if he had been left alone to peruse jane eyre and the black cat and the fall of the house of usher as i was  every night i expected to wake up in my coffin having been prematurely buried or to hear sighs in the area followed by light unsteady footsteps on the stairs and then to see a lady all in a white shroud stained with blood and clay stagger into my room the victim of too rapid interment  as to the notion that my respected kinsman had a mad wife concealed on the premises and that a lunatic aunt black in the face with suppressed mania would burst into my chamber it was comparatively a harmless fancy and not particularly disturbing  between these and the yellow dwarf who though only the invention of the countess daulnoy might frighten a nervous infant into hysterics i personally had as bad a time of it in the night watches as any happy british child has survived  but our ogres are nothing to the bogies which make not only night but day terrible to the studious infants of japan and china  chinese ghosts are probably much the same as japanese ghosts  the japanese have borrowed most things including apparitions and awesome sprites and grisly fiends from the chinese and then have improved on the original model  now we have a very full complete and horrorstriking account of chinese harnts as the country people in tennessee call them from mr herbert giles who has translated scores of chinese ghost stories in his strange tales from a chinese studio de la rue 1880  mr giless volumes prove that china is the place for messrs gurney and myers the secretaries of the psychical society  ghosts do not live a holeandcorner life in china but boldly come out and take their part in the pleasures and business of life  it has always been a question with me whether ghosts in a haunted house appear when there is no audience  what does the spectre in the tapestried chamber do when the house is not full and no guest is put in the room to bury strangers in the haunted room  does the ghost sulk and complain that there is no house and refuse to rehearse his little performance in a conscientious and disinterestedly artistic spirit when deprived of the artists true pleasure the awakening of sympathetic emotion in the mind of the spectator  we give too little thought and sympathy to ghosts who in our old castles and country houses often find no one to appear to from years end to yearsend  only now and then is a guest placed in the haunted room  then i like to fancy the glee of the lady in green or the radiant boy or the headless man or the old gentleman in snuffcoloured clothes as he or she recognises the presence of a spectator and prepares to give his or her best effects in the familiar style  now in china and japan certainly a ghost does not wait till people enter the haunted room  a ghost like a person of fashion goes everywhere  moreover he has this artistic excellence that very often you dont know him from an embodied person  he counterfeits mortality so cleverly that he the ghost has been known to personate a candidate for honours and pass an examination for him a pleasing example of this kind illustrating the limitations of ghosts is told in mr giless book  a gentleman of huai shang named choutieni had arrived at the age of fifty but his family consisted of but one son a fine boy strangely averse from study as if there were anything strange in that  one day the son disappeared mysteriously as people do from west ham  in a year he came back said he had been detained in a taoist monastery and to all mens amazement took to his books  next year he obtained is ba degree a first class  all the neighbourhood was overjoyed for huai shang was like pembroke college oxford where according to the poet first class men are few and far between  it was who should have the honour of giving his daughter as bride to this intellectual marvel  a very nice girl was selected but most unexpectedly the ba would not marry  this nearly broke his fathers heart  the old gentleman knew according to chinese belief that if he had no grandchild there would be no one in the next generation to feed his own ghost and pay it all the little needful attentions  picture then the father naming and insisting on the day till kochang ba got up and ran away  his mother tried to detain him when his clothes came off in her hand and the bachelor vanished  next day appeared the real flesh and blood son who had been kidnapped and enslaved  the genuine kochang was overjoyed to hear of his approaching nuptials  the rites were duly celebrated and in less than a year the old gentleman welcomed his muchlongedfor grand child  but oddly enough kochang though very jolly and universally beloved was as stupid as ever and read nothing but the sporting intelligence in the newspapers it was now universally admitted that the learned kochang had been an impostor a clever ghost  it follows that ghosts can take a very good degree but ladies need not be afraid of marrying ghosts owing to the inveterate shyness of these learned spectres  the chinese ghost is by no means always a malevolent person as indeed has already been made clear from the affecting narrative of the ghost who passed an examination  even the spectre which answers in china to the statue in don juan the statue which accepts invitations to dinner is anything but a malevolent guest  so much may be gathered from the story of chu and lu  chu was an undergraduate of great courage and bodily vigour but dull of wit he was a married man and his children as in the old oxford legend often rushed into their mothers presence shouting mamma mammal papas been plucked again  once it chanced that chu was at a wine party and the negus a favourite beverage of the celestials had done its work  his young friends betted chu a birdsnest dinner that he would not go to the nearest temple enter the room devoted to coloured sculptures representing the torments of purgatory and carry off the image of the chinese judge of the dead their osiris or rhadamanthus  off went old chu and soon returned with the august effigy which wore a green face a red beard and a hideous expression in his arms  the other men were frightened and begged chu to restore his worship to his place on the infernal bench before carrying back the worthy magistrate chu poured a libation on the ground and said whenever your excellency feels so disposed i shall be glad to take a cup of wine with you in a friendly way that very night as chu was taking a stirrup cup before going to bed the ghost of the awful judge came to the door and entered  chu promptly put the kettle on mixed the negus and made a night of it with the festive fiend  their friendship was never interrupted from that moment  the judge even gave chu a new heart literally whereby he was enabled to pass examinations for the heart in china is the seat of all the intellectual faculties  for mrs chu a plain woman with a fine figure the ghost provided a new head of a handsome girl recently slain by a robber  even after chus death the genial spectre did not neglect him but obtained for him an appointment as registrar in the next world with a certain rank attached  the next world among the chinese seems to be a paradise of bureaucracy patent places jobs mandarins buttons and tails and in short the heaven of officialism  all civilised readers are acquainted with mr stocktons humorous story of the transferred ghost  in mr stocktons view a man does not always get his own ghostship there is a vigorous competition among spirits for good ghostships and a great deal of intrigue and party feeling  it may be long before a disembodied spectre gets any ghostship at all and then if he has little influence he may be glad to take a chance of haunting the board of trade or the post office instead of walking in the foreign office  one spirit may win a post as white lady in the imperial palace while another is put off with a position in an old college library or perhaps has to follow the fortunes of some seedy medium through boardinghouses and third rate hotels  now this is precisely the chinese view of the fates and fortunes of ghosts  quisque suos patimur manes  in china to be brief and to quote a ghost who ought to know what he was speaking about supernaturals are to be found everywhere this is the fact that makes life so puzzling and terrible to a child of a believing and trustful character  these oriental bogies do not appear in the dark alone or only in haunted houses or at cross roads or in gloomy woods  they are everywhere  every man has his own ghost every place has its peculiar haunting fiend every natural phenomenon has its informing spirit every quality as hunger greed envy malice has an embodied visible shape prowling about seeking what it may devour  where our science for example sees or rather smells sewer gas the japanese behold a slimy meagre insatiate wraith crawling to devour the lives of men where we see a storm of snow their livelier fancy beholds a comic snowghost a queer grinning old man under a vast umbrella  the illustrations in this paper are only a few specimens chosen out of many volumes of japanese bogies  we have not ventured to copy the very most awful spectres nor dared to be as horrid as we can these native drawings too are generally coloured regardless of expense and the colouring is often horribly lurid and satisfactory this embellishment fortunately perhaps we cannot reproduce meanwhile if any child looks into this essay let him or her not be alarmed by the pictures he beholds  japanese ghosts do not live in this country there are none of them even at the japanese legation  just as bears lions and rattlesnakes are not to be seriously dreaded in our woods and commons so the japanese ghost cannot breathe any more than a slave can in the air of england or america  we do not yet even keep any ghostly zoological garden in which the bogies of japanese australians red indians and other distant peoples may be accommodated  such an establishment is perhaps to be desired in the interests of psychical research but that form of research has not yet been endowed by a cultivated and progressive government  the first to attract our attention represents as i understand the common ghost or simulacrum vulgare of psychical science  to this complexion must we all come according to the best japanese opinion each of us contains within him somewhat of a shadowy being like the spectre described by dr johnson  something like the egyptian ka for which the curious may consult the works of miss amelia b edwards and other learned orientalists  the most recent french student of these matters the author of lhomme posthume is of opinion that we do not all possess this double with its power of surviving our bodily death  he thinks too that our ghost when it does survive has but rarely the energy and enterprise to make itself visible to or audible by shadowcasting men  in some extreme cases the ghost according to our french authority that of a disciple of m comte feeds fearsomely on the bodies of the living  in no event does he believe that a ghost lasts much longer than a hundred years  after that it mizzles into spectre and is resolved into its elements whatever they may be  a somewhat similar and to my own mind probably sound theory of ghosts prevails among savage tribes and among such peoples as the ancient greeks the modern hindoos and other ancestor worshippers when feeding as they all do or used to do the ghosts of the ancestral dead they gave special attention to the claims of the dead of the last three generations leaving ghosts older than the century to look after their own supplies of meat and drink  the negligence testifies to a notion that very old ghosts are of little account for good or evil  on the other hand as regards the longevity of spectres we must not shut our eyes to the example of the bogie in ancient armour which appears in glamis castle or to the jesuit of queen elizabeths date that haunts the library and a very nice place to haunt  i ask no better as a ghost in the pavilion at lords might cause a scandal of an english nobleman with these instantiae contradictoriae as bacon calls them present to our minds we must not in the present condition of psychical research dogmatise too hastily about the span of life allotted to the simulacrum vulgare  very probably his chances of a prolonged existence are in inverse ratio to the square of the distance of time which severs him from our modern days  no one has ever even pretended to see the ghost of an ancient roman buried in these islands still less of a pict or scot or a palaeolithic man welcome as such an apparition would be to many of us  thus the evidence does certainly look as if there were a kind of statute of limitations among ghosts which from many points of view is not an arrangement at which we should repine  the japanese artist expresses his own sense of the casual and fluctuating nature of ghosts by drawing his spectre in shaky lines as if the model had given the artist the horrors  this simulacrum rises out of the earth like an exhalation and groups itself into shape above the spade with which all that is corporeal of its late owner has been interred  please remark the uncomforted and dismal expression of the simulacrum  we must remember that the ghost or ka is not the soul which has other destinies in the future world good or evil but is only a shadowy resemblance condemned as in the egyptian creed to dwell in the tomb and hover near it the chinese and japanese have their own definite theory of the next world and we must by no means confuse the eternal fortunes of the permanent conscious and responsible self already inhabiting other worlds than ours with the eccentric vagaries of the semimaterial tombhaunting larva which so often develops a noisy and bear fighting disposition quite unlike the character of its proprietor in life  the next bogie so limp and washedout as he seems with his white drooping dripping arms and hands reminds us of that horrid french species of apparition la lavandiere de la nuit who washes dead mens linen in the moonlit pools and rivers  whether this simulacrum be meant for the spirit of the well for everything has its spirit in japan or whether it be the ghost of some mortal drowned in the well i cannot say with absolute certainty but the opinion of the learned tends to the former conclusion  naturally a japanese child when sent in the dusk to draw water will do so with fear and trembling for this limp floppy apparition might scare the boldest  another bogie a terrible creation of fancy i take to be a vampire about which the curious can read in dom calmet who will tell them how whole villages in hungary have been depopulated by vampires or he may study in fauriels chansons de la grece moderne the vampires of modern hellas  another plan and perhaps even more satisfactory to a timid or superstitious mind is to read in a lonely house at midnight a story named carmilla printed in mr sheridan le fanus in a glass darkly  that work will give you the peculiar sentiment of vampirism will produce a gelid perspiration and reduce the patient to a condition in which he will be afraid to look round the room if while in this mood some one tells him mr augustus hares story of crooglin grange his education in the practice and theory of vampires will be complete and he will be a very proper and well qualified inmate of earlswood asylum  the most awful japanese vampire caught redhanded in the act a hideous bestial incarnation of ghoulishness we have carefully refrained from reproducing  scarcely more agreeable is the bogie or witch blowing from her mouth a malevolent exhalation an embodiment of malignant and maleficent sorcery  the vapour which flies and curls from the mouth constitutes a sending in the technical language of icelandic wizards and is capable in iceland at all events of assuming the form of some detestable supernatural animal to destroy the life of a hated rival  in the case of our last example it is very hard indeed to make head or tail of the spectre represented  chinks and crannies are his domain through these he drops upon you  he is a merry but not an attractive or genial ghost  where there are such visions about it may be admitted that children apt to believe in all such fancies have a youth of variegated and intense misery recurring with special vigour at bedtime  but we look again at our first picture and hope and trust that japanese boys and girls are as happy as these jolly little creatures appear    ghosts in

amusing history of impostures there is no more diverting chapter than that which deals with literary frauds  none contains a more grotesque revelation of the smallness and the complexity of human nature and nonenot even the records of the tichborne trial nor of general electionsdisplays more pleasantly the depths of mortal credulity  the literary forger is usually a clever man and it is necessary for him to be at least on a level with the literary knowledge and critical science of his time  but how low that level commonly appears to be  think of the success of ireland a boy of eighteen think of chatterton think of surtees of mainsforth who took in the great sir walter himself the father of all them that are skilled in ballad lore  how simple were the artifices of these ingenious impostors their resources how scanty how handtomouth and improvised was their whole procedure  times have altered a little  jo smiths revelation and famed golden bible only carried captive the polygamous populus qui vult decipi reasoners a little lower than even the believers in angloisrael the moabite ireland who once gave mr shapira the famous ms of deuteronomy but did not delude m clermontganneau was doubtless a smart man he was however a little too indolent a little too easily satisfied  he might have procured better and less recognisable materials than his old synagogue rolls in short he took rather too little trouble and came to the wrong market  a literary forgery ought first perhaps to appeal to the credulous and only slowly should it come with the prestige of having already won many believers before the learned world  the inscriber of the phoenician inscriptions in brazil of all places was a clever man his account of the voyage of hiram to south america probably gained some credence in brazil while in england it only carried captive mr day author of the prehistoric use of iron and steel  but the brazilians from lack of energy have dropped the subject and the phoenician inscriptions of brazil are less successful after all than the moabite stone about which one begins to entertain disagreeable doubts  the motives of the literary forger are curiously mixed but they may perhaps be analysed roughly into piety greed push and love of fun  many literary forgeries have been pious frauds perpetrated in the interests of a church a priesthood or a dogma then we have frauds of greed as if for example a forger should offer his wares for a million of money to the british museum or when he tries to palm off his samaritan gospel on the bad samaritan of the bodleian  next we come to playful frauds or frauds in their origin playful like perhaps the shakespearian forgeries of ireland the supercheries of prosper merimee the sham antique ballads very spirited poems in their way of surtees and many other examples  occasionally it has happened that forgeries begun for the mere sake of exerting the imitative faculty and of raising a laugh against the learned have been persevered with in earnest  the humorous deceits are of course the most pardonable though it is difficult to forgive the young archaeologist who took in his own father with false greek inscriptions  but this story may be a mere fable amongst archaeologists who are constantly accusing each other of all manner of crimes  then there are forgeries by pushing men who hope to get a reading for poems which if put forth as new would be neglected  there remain forgeries of which the motives are so complex as to remain for ever obscure  we may generally ascribe them to love of notoriety in the forger such notoriety as macpherson won by his dubious pinchbeck ossian  more difficult still to understand are the forgeries which real scholars have committed or connived at for the purpose of supporting some opinion which they held with earnestness  there is a vein of madness and selfdeceit in the character of the man who half persuades himself that his own false facts are true  the payne collier case is thus one of the most difficult in the world to explain for it is equally hard to suppose that mr payne collier was taken in by the notes on the folio he gave the world and to hold that he was himself guilty of forgery to support his own opinions  the further we go back in the history of literary forgeries the more as is natural do we find them to be of a pious or priestly character  when the clergy alone can write only the clergy can forge  in such ages people are interested chiefly in prophecies and warnings or if they are careful about literature it is only when literature contains some kind of titledeeds  thus solon is said to have forged a line in the homeric catalogue of the ships for the purpose of proving that salamis belonged to athens  but the great antique forger the ionian father of the rest is doubtless onomacritus  there exists to be sure an egyptian inscription professing to be of the fourth but probably of the twentysixth dynasty  the germans hold the latter view the french from patriotic motives maintain the opposite opinion  but this forgery is scarcely literary  i never can think of onomacritus without a certain respect  he began the forging business so very early and was apart from this failing such an imposing and magnificently respectable character the scene of the error and the detection of onomacritus presents itself always to me in a kind of pictorial vision  it is night the clear windless night of athens not of the athens whose ruins remain but of the ancient city that sank in ashes during the invasion of xerxes  the time is the time of pisistratus the successful tyrant the scene is the ancient temple the stately house of athene the fane where the sacred serpent was fed on cakes and the primeval olivetree grew beside the well of posidon  the darkness of the temples inmost shrine is lit by the ray of one earthen lamp  you dimly discern the majestic form of a venerable man stooping above a coffer of cedar and ivory carved with the exploits of the goddess and with boustrophedon inscriptions  in his hair this archaic athenian wears the badge of the golden grasshopper  he is onomacritus the famous poet and the trusted guardian of the ancient oracles of musaeus and bacis  what is he doing  why he takes from the fragrant cedar coffer certain thin stained sheets of lead whereon are scratched the words of doom the prophecies of the greek thomas the rhymer  from his bosom he draws another thin sheet of lead also stained and corroded  on this he scratches in imitation of the old cadmeian letters a prophecy that the isles near lemnos shall disappear under the sea  so busy is he in this task that he does not hear the rustle of a chiton behind and suddenly a mans hand is on his shoulder  onomacritus turns in horror  has the goddess punished him for tampering with the oracles  no it is lasus the son of hermiones a rival poet who has caught the keeper of the oracles in the very act of a pious forgery  herodotus vii 6  pisistratus expelled the learned onomacritus from athens but his conduct proved in the long run highly profitable to the reputations of musaeus and bacis  whenever one of their oracles was not fulfilled people said oh that is merely one of the interpolations of onomacritus and the matter was passed over this onomacritus is said to have been among the original editors of homer under pisistratus 13  he lived long never repented and many years later deceived xerxes into attempting his disastrous expedition  this he did by keeping back the oracles unfavourable to the barbarians and putting forward any that seemed favourable the children of pisistratus believed in him as spiritualists go on giving credit to exposed and exploded mediums  having once practised deceit it is to be feared that onomacritus acquired a liking for the art of literary forgery which as will be seen in the case of ireland grows on a man like dramdrinking onomacritus is generally charged with the authorship of the poems which the ancients usually attributed to orpheus the companion of jason  perhaps the most interesting of the poems of orpheus to us would have been his inferno or greek text in which the poet gave his own account of his descent to hades in search of eurydice but only a dubious reference to one adventure in the journey is quoted by plutarch  whatever the exact truth about the orphic poems may be the reader may pursue the hard and fruitless quest in lobecks aglaophamus 14 it seems certain that the period between pisistratus and pericles like the alexandrian time was a great age for literary forgeries  but of all these frauds the greatest according to the most advanced theory on the subject is the forgery of the iliad and odyssey  the opinions of the scholars who hold that the iliad and odyssey which we know and which plato knew are not the epics known to herodotus but later compositions are not very clear nor consistent  but it seems to be vaguely held that about the time of pericles there arose a kind of greek macpherson  this ingenious impostor worked on old epic materials but added many new ideas of his own about the gods converting the iliad the poem which we now possess into a kind of mocking romance a greek don quixote  he also forged a number of pseudoarchaic words tenses and expressions and added the numerous references to iron a metal practically unknown it is asserted to greece before the sixth century  if we are to believe with professor paley that the chief incidents of the iliad and odyssey were unknown to sophocles aeschylus and the contemporary vase painters we must also suppose that the greek macpherson invented most of the situations in the odyssey and iliad  according to this theory the cooker of the extant epics was far the greatest and most successful of all literary impostors for he deceived the whole world from plato downwards till he was exposed by mr paley there are times when one is inclined to believe that plato must have been the forger himself as bacon according to the other hypothesis was the author of shakespeares plays  thus plato the wise and largebrowed verulam would be the first of those who forge  next to this prodigious imposture no doubt the false letters of phalaris are the most important of classical forgeries and these illustrate like most literary forgeries the extreme worthlessness of literary taste as a criterion of the authenticity of writings  for what man ever was more a man of taste than sir william temple the most accomplished writer of the age whom mr boyle never thought of without calling to mind those happy lines of lucretius    quem tu dea tempore in omni omnibus ornatum voluisti excellere rebus   well the ornate and excellent temple held that the epistles of phalaris have more race more spirit more force of wit and genius than any others he had ever seen either ancient or modern  so much for what bentley calls temples nicety of tast  the greatest of english scholars readily proved that phalaris used in the spirit of prophecy an idiom which did not exist to write about matters in his time not invented but many centuries younger than he  so let the nicety of temples tast and its absolute failure be a warning to us when we read if read we must german critics who deny homers claim to this or that passage and platos right to half his accepted dialogues on grounds of literary taste  and farewell as herodotus would have said to the letters of phalaris of socrates of plato to the lives of pythagoras and of homer and to all the other uncounted literary forgeries of the classical world from the sibylline prophecies to the battle of the frogs and mice  early christian frauds were naturally pious  we have the apocryphal gospels and the works of dionysius the areopagite which were not exposed till erasmuss time  perhaps the most important of pious forgeries if forgery be exactly the right word in this case was that of the false decretals  of a sudden says milman speaking of the pontificate of nicholas i ob 867 ad of a sudden was promulgated unannounced without preparation not absolutely unquestioned but apparently overawing at once all doubt a new code which to the former authentic documents added fiftynine letters and decrees of the twenty oldest popes from clement to melchiades and the donation of constantine and in the third part among the decrees of the popes and of the councils from sylvester to gregory ii thirtynine false decrees and the acts of several unauthentic councils  the whole is composed milman adds with an air of profound piety and reverence  the false decretals naturally assert the supremacy of the bishop of rome they are full and minute on church property they were sure to be that in fact they remind one of another forgery pious and aryan the institutes of vishnu  let him not levy any tax upon brahmans says the brahman forger of the institutes which came from the mouths of vishnu as he sat clad in a yellow robe imperturbable decorated with all kinds of gems while lakshmi was stroking his feet with her soft palms  the institutes took excellent care of brahmans and cows as the decretals did of the pope and the clergy and the earliest popes had about as much hand in the decretals as vishnu had in his institutes  hommenay in pantagruel did well to have the praise of the decretals sung by filles belles blondelettes doulcettes et de bonne grace  and then hommenay drank to the decretals and their very good health  o dives decretales tant par vous est le vin bon bon trouveo divine decretals how good you make good wine taste  the miracle would be greater said pantagruel if they made bad wine taste good  the most that can now be done by the devout for the decretals is to palliate the guilt of their forger whose name like that of the greek macpherson is unknown  if the early christian centuries and the middle ages were chiefly occupied with pious frauds with forgeries of gospels epistles and decretals the impostors of the renaissance were busy as an oxford scholar said when he heard of a new ms of the greek testament with something really important that is with classical imitations  after the turks took constantinople when the learned greeks were scattered all over southern europe when many genuine classical manuscripts were recovered by the zeal of scholars when the plays of menander were seen once and then lost for ever it was natural that literary forgery should thrive  as yet scholars were eager rather than critical they were collecting and unearthing rather than minutely examining the remains of classic literature they had found so much and every year were finding so much more that no discovery seemed impossible  the lost books of livy and cicero the songs of sappho the perished plays of sophocles and aeschylus might any day be brought to light  this was the very moment for the literary forger but it is improbable that any forgery of the period has escaped detection  three or four years ago some one published a book to show that the annals of tacitus were written by poggio bracciolini  this paradox gained no more converts than the bolder hypothesis of hardouin  the theory of hardouin was all that the ancient classics were productions of a learned company which worked in the thirteenth century under severus archontius  hardouin made some exceptions to his sweeping general theory  ciceros writings were genuine he admitted so were plinys of virgil the georgics the satires and epistles of horace herodotus and homer  all the rest of the classics were a magnificent forgery of the illiterate thirteenth century which had scarce any greek and whose latin abundant in quantity in quality left much to be desired  among literary forgers or passers of false literary coin at the time of the renaissance annius is the most notorious  annius his real vernacular name was nanni was born at viterbo in 1432  he became a dominican and after publishing his forged classics rose to the position of maitre du palais to the pope alexander borgia with caesar borgia it is said that annius was never on good terms he persisted in preaching the sacred truth to his highness and this according to the detractors of annius was the only use he made of the sacred truth  there is a legend that caesar borgia poisoned the preacher 1502 but people usually brought that charge against caesar when any one in any way connected with him happened to die  annius wrote on the history and empire of the turks who took constantinople in his time but he is better remembered by his antiquitatum variarum volumina xvii cum comment  fr jo annii these fragments of antiquity included among many other desirable things the historical writings of fabius pictor the predecessor of livy  one is surprised that annius when he had his hand in did not publish choice extracts from the libri lintei the ancient roman annals written on linen and preserved in the temple of juno moneta  among the other discoveries of annius were treatises by berosus manetho cato and poems by archilochus  opinion has been divided as to whether annius was wholly a knave or whether he was himself imposed upon  or again whether he had some genuine fragments and eked them out with his own inventions  it is observed that he did not dovetail the really genuine relics of berosus and manetho into the works attributed to them  this may be explained as the result of ignorance or of cunning there can be no certain inference  even the dominicans as bayle says admit that anniuss discoveries are false though they excuse them by averring that the pious man was the dupe of others  but a learned lutheran has been found to defend the antiquitates of the dominican  it is amusing to remember that the great and erudite rabelais was taken in by some pseudoclassical fragments  the joker of jokes was hoaxed  he published says mr besant a couple of latin forgeries which he proudly called ex reliquiis venerandae antiquitatis consisting of a pretended will and a contract  the name of the book is ex reliquiis venerandae antiquitatis  lucii cuspidii testamentum  item contractus venditionis antiquis romanorum temporibus initus  lugduni apud gryphium 1532 pomponius laetus and jovianus pontanus were apparently authors of the hoax  socrates said that he would never lift up his hand against his father parmenides  the fathers of the church have not been so respectfully treated by literary forgers during the renaissance the flowers of theology of st bernard which were to be a primrose path ad gaudia paradisi strasburg 1478 were really it seems the production of jean de garlande  athanasius his eleven books concerning the trinity are attributed to vigilius a colonial bishop in northern africa  among false classics were two comic latin fragments with which muretus beguiled scaliger meursius has suffered posthumously from the attribution to him of a very disreputable volume indeed  in 1583 a book on consolations by cicero was published at venice containing the reflections with which cicero consoled himself for the death of tullia  it might as well have been attributed to mrs blimber and described as replete with the thoughts by which that lady supported herself under the affliction of never having seen cicero or his tusculan villa  the real author was charles sigonius of modena sigonius actually did discover some ciceronian fragments and if he was not the builder at least he was the restorer of tullys lofty theme  in 1693 francois nodot conceiving the world had not already enough of petronius arbiter published an edition in which he added to the works of that lax though accomplished author nodots story was that he had found a whole ms of petronius at belgrade and he published it with a translation of his own latin into french  still dissatisfied with the existing supply of petronius humour was marchena a writer of spanish books who printed at bale a translation and edition of a new fragment  this fragment was very cleverly inserted in a presumed lacuna  in spite of the ironical style of the preface many scholars were taken in by this fragment and their credulity led marchena to find a new morsel of catullus this time at herculaneum  eichstadt a jena professor gravely announced that the same fragment existed in a ms in the university library and under pretence of giving various readings corrected marchenas faults in prosody  another sham catullus by corradino a venetian was published in 1738  the most famous forgeries of the eighteenth century were those of macpherson chatterton and ireland  space fortunately does not permit a discussion of the ossianic question  that fragments of ossianic legend if not of ossianic poetry survive in oral gaelic traditions seems certain  how much macpherson knew of these and how little he used them in the bombastic prose which napoleon loved and spelled ocean it is next to impossible to discover  the case of chatterton is too well known to need much more than mention the most extraordinary poet for his years who ever lived began with the forgery of a sham feudal pedigree for mr bergum a pewterer ireland started on his career in much the same way unless irelands confessions be themselves a fraud based on what he knew about chatterton  once launched in his career chatterton drew endless stores of poetry from rowleys ms and the muniment chest in st mary redcliffes  jacob bryant believed in them and wrote an apology for the credulous  bryant who believed in his own system of mythology might have believed in anything  when chatterton sent his discoveries to walpole himself somewhat of a mediaeval imitator gray and mason detected the imposture and walpole his feelings as an antiquary injured took no more notice of the boy chattertons death was due to his precocity  had his genius come to him later it would have found him wiser and better able to command the fatal demon of intellect for which he had to find work like michael scott in the legend  the end of the eighteenth century which had been puzzled or diverted by the chatterton and macpherson frauds witnessed also the great and famous shakespearian forgeries  we shall never know the exact truth about the fabrication of the shakespearian documents and vortigern and the other plays  we have indeed the confession of the culprit  habemus confitentem reum but mr w h ireland was a liar and a solicitors clerk so versatile and accomplished that we cannot always trust him even when he is narrating the tale of his own iniquities  the temporary but wide and turbulent success of the ireland forgeries suggests the disagreeable reflection that criticism and learning are or a hundred years ago were worth very little as literary touchstones a polished and learned society a society devoted to shakespeare and to the stage was taken in by a boy of eighteen  young ireland not only palmed off his sham prose documents most makeshift imitations of the antique but even his ridiculous verses on the experts james boswell went down on his knees and thanked heaven for the sight of them and feeling thirsty after these devotions drank hot brandy and water  dr parr was not less readily gulled and probably the experts like malone who held aloof were as much influenced by jealousy as by science  the whole story of young irelands forgeries is not only too long to be told here but forms the topic of a novel the talk of the town by mr james payn the frauds in his hands lose neither their humour nor their complicated interest of plot  to be brief then mr samuel ireland was a gentleman extremely fond of old literature and old books  if we may trust the confessions 1805 of his candid son mr w h ireland a more harmless and confiding old person than samuel never collected early english tracts  living in his learned society his son mr w h ireland acquired not only a passion for black letters but a desire to emulate chatterton  his first step in guilt was the forgery of an autograph on an old pamphlet with which he gratified samuel ireland  he also wrote a sham inscription on a modern bust of cromwell which he represented as an authentic antique  finding that the critics were taken in and attributed this new bust to the old sculptor simeon ireland conceived a very low and not unjustifiable opinion of critical tact  critics would find merit in anything which seemed old enough  irelands next achievement was the forgery of some legal documents concerning shakespeare  just as the bad man who deceived the guileless mr shapira forged his deuteronomy on the blank spaces of old synagogue rolls so young ireland used the cutoff ends of old rent rolls  he next bought up quantities of old flyleaves of books and on this ancient paper he indicted a sham confession of faith which he attributed to shakespeare  being a strong evangelical young mr ireland gave a very protestant complexion to this edifying document  and still the critics gaped and wondered and believed  irelands method was to write in an ink made by blending various liquids used in the marbling of paper for bookbinding  this stuff was supplied to him by a bookbinders apprentice  when people asked questions as to whence all the new shakespeare manuscripts came he said they were presented to him by a gentleman who wished to remain anonymous  finally the impossibility of producing this gentleman was one of the causes of the detection of the fraud  according to himself ireland performed prodigies of acuteness  once he had forged at random the name of a contemporary of shakespeare  he was confronted with a genuine signature which of course was quite different  he obtained leave to consult his anonymous gentleman rushed home forged the name again on the model of what had been shown to him and returned with this signature as a new gift from his benefactor  that nameless friend had informed him he swore that there were two persons of the same name and that both signatures were genuine  irelands impudence went the length of introducing an ancestor of his own with the same name as himself among the companions of shakespeare  if vortigern had succeeded and it was actually put on the stage with all possible pomp ireland meant to have produced a series of pseudoshakespearian plays from william the conqueror to queen elizabeth  when busy with vortigern he was detected by a friend of his own age who pounced on him while he was at work as lasus pounced on onomacritus  the discoverer however consented to stand in with ireland and did not divulge his secret  at last after the fiasco of vortigern suspicion waxed so strong and disagreeable inquiries for the anonymous benefactor were so numerous that ireland fled from his fathers house  he confessed all and according to his own account fell under the undying wrath of samuel ireland  any reader of irelands confessions will be likely to sympathise with old samuel as the dupe of his son  the whole story is told with a curious mixture of impudence and humour and with great plausibility  young ireland admits that his desire for laughter was almost irresistible when peoplelearned pompous sagacious peoplelistened attentively to the papers  one feels half inclined to forgive the rogue for the sake of his youth his cleverness his humour  but the confessions are not improbably almost as apocryphal as the original documents  they were written for the sake of money and it is impossible to say how far the same mercenary motive actuated ireland in his forgeries  dr ingleby in his shakespeare fabrications takes a very rigid view of the conduct not only of william but of old samuel ireland  sam according to dr ingleby was a partner in the whole imposture and the confession was only one element in the scheme of fraud  old samuel was the fagin of a band of young literary dodgers  he positively trained his whole family to trade in forgery and as for mr w h ireland he was the most accomplished liar that ever lived which is certainly a distinction in its way  the point of the joke is that after the whole conspiracy exploded people were anxious to buy examples of the forgeries  mr w h ireland was equal to the occasion  he actually forged his own or according to dr ingleby his fathers forgeries and by thus increasing the supply he deluged the market with sham shams with imitations of imitations  if this accusation be correct it is impossible not to admire the colossal impudence of mr w h ireland  dr ingleby in the ardour of his honest indignation pursues william into his private life which it appears was far from exemplary  but literary criticism should be content with a mans works his domestic life is matter as aristotle often says for a separate kind of investigation  old ritson used to say that every literary impostor deserved hanging as much as a common thief  w h irelands merits were never recognised by the law  how old ritson would have punished the old corrector it is better only guessing as the wicked say according to clough in regard to their own possible chastisement  the difficulty is to ascertain who the apocryphal old corrector really was  the story of his misdeeds was recently brought back to mind by the death at an advanced age of the learned shakespearian mr j payne collier mr collier was to put it mildly the shapira of the old corrector he brought that artists works before the public but why how deceived or how influenced it is once more better only guessing mr collier first introduced to the public notice his singular copy of a folio shakespeare second edition loaded with ancient manuscript emendations in 1849  his account of this book was simple and plausible  he chanced one day to be in the shop of mr rudd the bookseller in great newport street when a parcel of secondhand volumes arrived from the country  when the parcel was opened the heart of the bibliophile began to sing for the packet contained two old folios one of them an old folio shakespeare of the second edition 1632  the volume mark this was much cropped greasy and imperfect  now the student of mr hamiltons inquiry into the whole affair is already puzzled  in later days mr collier said that his folio had previously been in the possession of a mr parry  on the other hand mr parry then a very aged man failed to recognise his folio in mr colliers for his copy was cropped whereas the leaves of mr colliers example were not mutilated  here then inquiry pp  12 61 we have two descriptions of the outward aspect of mr colliers dubious treasure  in one account it is much cropped by the bookbinders cruel shears in the other its unmutilated condition is contrasted with that of a copy which has been cropped  in any case mr collier hoped he says to complete an imperfect folio he possessed with leaves taken from the folio newly acquired for thirty shillings  but the volumes happened to have the same defects and the healing process was impossible  mr collier chanced to be going into the country when in packing the folio he had bought of rudd he saw it was covered with manuscript corrections in an old hand these he was inclined to attribute to one thomas perkins whose name was written on the flyleaf and who might have been a connection of richard perkins the actor flor 1633  the notes contained many various readings and very numerous changes in punctuation  some of these mr collier published in his notes and emendations 1852 and in an edition of the plays  there was much discussion much doubt and the folio of the old corrector who was presumed to have marked the book in the theatre during early performances was exhibited to the society of antiquaries  then mr collier presented the treasure to the duke of devonshire who again lent it for examination to the british museum  mr hamilton published in the times july 1859 the results of his examination of the old corrector  it turned out that the old corrector was a modern myth he had first made his corrections in pencil and in a modern hand and then he had copied them over in ink and in a forged ancient hand  the same word sometimes recurred in both handwritings  the ink which looked old was really no english ink at all not even irelands mixture  it seemed to be sepia sometimes mixed with a little indian ink  mr hamilton made many other sad discoveries he pointed out that mr collier had published from a dulwich ms a letter of mrs alleynes the actors wife referring to shakespeare as mr shakespeare of the globe  now the dulwich ms was mutilated and blank in the very place where this interesting reference should have occurred  such is a skeleton history of the old corrector his works and ways  it is probable thatthanks to his assiduitiesnew shakespearian documents will in future be received with extreme scepticism and this is all the fruit except acres of newspaper correspondence which the world has derived from mr colliers greasy and imperfect but unique corrected folio  the recency and to a shakespearian critic the importance of these forgeries obscures the humble merit of surtees with his ballads of the slaying of antony featherstonhaugh and of bartrams dirge surtees left clever lacunae in these songs collected from oral tradition and furnished notes so learned that they took in sir walter scott  there are moments when i half suspect the shirra himsel who blamelessly forged so many extracts from old plays of having composed kinmont willie  to compare old scott of satchells account of kinmont willie with the ballad is to feel uncomfortable doubts  but this is a rank impiety  the last ballad forgery of much note was the set of sham macedonian epics and popular songs all about alexander the great and other heroes which a schoolmaster in the rhodope imposed on m verkovitch  the trick was not badly done and the imitation of ballad slang was excellent  the oera linda book too was successful enough to be translated into english  with this latest effort of the tenth muse the crafty muse of literary forgery we may leave a topic which could not be exhausted in a ponderous volume  we have not room even for the forged letters of shelley to which mr browning being taken in thereby wrote a preface nor for the forged letters of mr ruskin which occasionally hoax all the newspapers    bibliomania in france    the love of books for their own sake for their paper print binding and for their associations as distinct from the love of literature is a stronger and more universal passion in france than elsewhere in europe  in england publishers are men of business in france they aspire to be artists  in england people borrow what they read from the libraries and take what gaudy clothbinding chance chooses to send them  in france people buy books and bind them to their hearts desire with quaint and dainty devices on the morocco covers  books are lifelong friends in that country in england they are the guests of a week or of a fortnight  the greatest french writers have been collectors of curious editions they have devoted whole treatises to the love of books  the literature and history of france are full of anecdotes of the good and bad fortunes of bibliophiles of their bargains discoveries disappointments  there lies before us at this moment a small library of books about booksthe bibliophile francais in seven large volumes les sonnets dun bibliophile la bibliomanie en 1878 la bibliotheque dun bibliophile 1885 and a dozen other works of janin nodier beraldi pieters didot great collectors who have written for the instruction of beginners and the pleasure of every one who takes delight in printed paper  the passion for books like other forms of desire has its changes of fashion  it is not always easy to justify the caprices of taste the presence or absence of half an inch of paper in the uncut margin of a book makes a difference of value that ranges from five shillings to a hundred pounds  some books are run after because they are beautifully bound some are competed for with equal eagerness because they never have been bound at all  the uninitiated often make absurd mistakes about these distinctions some time ago the daily telegraph reproached a collector because his books were uncut whence argued the journalist it was clear that he had never read them  uncut of course only means that the margins have not been curtailed by the binders plough  it is a point of sentiment to like books just as they left the hands of the old printersof estienne aldus or louis elzevir  it is because the passion for books is a sentimental passion that people who have not felt it always fail to understand it  sentiment is not an easy thing to explain  englishmen especially find it impossible to understand tastes and emotions that are not their ownthe wrongs of ireland till quite recently the aspirations of eastern roumelia the demands of greece  if we are to understand the bookhunter we must never forget that to him books are in the first place relics  he likes to think that the great writers whom he admires handled just such pages and saw such an arrangement of type as he now beholds  moliere for example corrected the proofs for this edition of the precieuses ridicules when he first discovered what a labour it is to publish a book and how green neuf an author is the first time they print him  or it may be that campanella turned over with hands unstrung and still broken by the torture these leaves that contain his passionate sonnets here again is the copy of theocritus from which some pretty page may have read aloud to charm the pagan and pontifical leisure of leo x this gargantua is the counterpart of that which the martyred dolet printed for or pirated from alas maitre francois rabelais  this woeful ballade with the woodcut of three thieves hanging from one gallows came near being the last dying speech and confession of francois villon  this shabby copy of the eve of st agnes is precisely like that which shelley doubled up and thrust into his pocket when the prow of the piratical felucca crashed into the timbers of the don juan  some rare books have these associations and they bring you nearer to the authors than do the modern reprints  bibliophiles will tell you that it is the early readings they care forthe authors first fancies and those more hurried expressions which he afterwards corrected  these readings have their literary value especially in the masterpieces of the great but the sentiment after all is the main thing  other books come to be relics in another way  they are the copies which belonged to

touch these books with the faroff contact of the hands of kings and cardinals scholars and coquettes pedants poets and precieuses the people who are unforgotten in the mob that inhabited dead centuries  so universal and ardent has the love of magnificent books been in france that it would be possible to write a kind of bibliomaniac history of that country  all her rulers kings cardinals and ladies have had time to spare for collecting  without going too far back to the time when bertha span and charlemagne was an amateur we may give a few specimens of an anecdotical history of french bibliolatry beginning as is courteous with a lady  can a woman be a bibliophile is a question which was once discussed at the weekly breakfast party of guilbert de pixerecourt the famous book lover and playwright the corneille of the boulevards  the controversy glided into a discussion as to how many books a man can love at a time but historical examples prove that french women and italian witness the princess deste may be bibliophiles of the true strain  diane de poictiers was their illustrious patroness  the mistress of henri ii possessed in the chateau danet a library of the first triumphs of typography  her taste was wide in range including songs plays romances divinity her copies of the fathers were bound in citron morocco stamped with her arms and devices and closed with clasps of silver  in the love of books as in everything else diane and henri ii were inseparable the interlaced h and d are scattered over the covers of their volumes the lily of france is twined round the crescents of diane or round the quiver the arrows and the bow which she adopted as her cognisance in honour of the maiden goddess  the books of henri and of diane remained in the chateau danet till the death of the princesse de conde in 1723 when they were dispersed  the son of the famous madame de guyon bought the greater part of the library which has since been scattered again and again  m leopold double a wellknown bibliophile possessed several examples 15  henry iii scarcely deserves perhaps the name of a booklover for he probably never read the works which were bound for him in the most elaborate way  but that great historian alexandre dumas takes a far more friendly view of the kings studies and in la dame de monsoreau introduces us to a learned monarch  whether he cared for the contents of his books or not his books are among the most singular relics of a character which excites even morbid curiosity  no more debauched and worthless wretch ever filled a throne but like the bad man in aristotle henri iii was full of repentance  when he was not dancing in an unseemly revel he was on his knees in his chapel  the board of one of his books of which an engraving lies before me bears his cipher and crown in the corners but the centre is occupied in front with a picture of the annunciation while on the back is the crucifixion and the breeding heart through which the swords have pierced  his favourite device was the deathshead with the motto memento mori or spes mea deus while he was still only duc danjou henri loved marie de cleves princesse de conde  on her sudden death he expressed his grief as he had done his piety by aid of the petits fers of the bookbinder maries initials were stamped on his bookcovers in a chaplet of laurels  in one corner a skull and crossbones were figured in the other the motto mort mest vie while two curly objects which did duty for tears filled up the lower corners  the books of henri iii even when they are absolutely worthless as literature sell for high prices and an inane treatise on theology decorated with his sacred emblems lately brought about 120 pounds in a london sale  francis i as a patron of all the arts was naturally an amateur of bindings  the fates of books were curiously illustrated by the story of the copy of homer on large paper which aldus the great venetian printer presented to francis i  after the death of the late marquis of hastings better known as an owner of horses than of books his possessions were brought to the hammer  with the instinct the flair as the french say of the bibliophile m ambroise firmin didot the biographer of aldus guessed that the marquis might have owned something in his line  he sent his agent over to england to the country town where the sale was to be held m didot had his reward  among the books which were dragged out of some mouldy storeroom was the very aldine homer of francis i with part of the original binding still clinging to the leaves  m didot purchased the precious relic and sent it to what m fertiault who has written a century of sonnets on bibliomania calls the hospital for books   le dos humide je leponge ou manque un coin vite une allonge pour tous jai maison de sante   m didot of course did not practise this amateur surgery himself but had the arms and devices of francis i restored by one of those famous binders who only work for dukes millionnaires and rothschilds  during the religious wars and the troubles of the fronde it is probable that few people gave much time to the collection of books the illustrious exceptions are richelieu and cardinal mazarin who possessed a snuffy davy of his own an indefatigable prowler among bookstalls and dingy purlieus in gabriel naude  in 1664 naude who was a learned and ingenious writer the apologist for great men suspected of magic published the second edition of his avis pour dresser une bibliotheque and proved himself to be a true lover of the chase a mighty hunter of books before the lord  naudes advice to the collector is rather amusing  he pretends not to care much for bindings and quotes senecas rebuke of the roman bibliomaniacs quos voluminum suorum frontes maxime placent tituliquewho chiefly care for the backs and lettering of their volumes  the fact is that naude had the wealth of mazarin at his back and we know very well from the remains of the cardinals library which exist that he liked as well as any man to see his cardinals hat glittering on red or olive morocco in the midst of the beautiful tooling of the early seventeenth century  when once he got a book he would not spare to give it a worthy jacket naudes ideas about buying were peculiar  perhaps he sailed rather nearer the wind than even monkbarns would have cared to do  his favourite plan was to buy up whole libraries in the gross speculative lots as the dealers call them  in the second place he advised the booklover to haunt the retreats of libraires fripiers et les vieux fonds et magasins  here he truly observes that you may find rare books brochesthat is unbound and uncut just as mr symonds bought two uncut copies of laon and cythna in a bristol stall for a crown  you may get things for four or five crowns that would cost you forty or fifty elsewhere says naude thus a few years ago m paul lacroix bought for two francs in a paris shop the very copy of tartuffe which had belonged to louis xiv  the example may now be worth perhaps 200 pounds  but we are digressing into the pleasures of the modern sportsman  it was not only in secondhand bookshops that naude hunted but among the dealers in waste paper  thus did poggio find quintilian on the counter of a woodmerchant and masson picked up agobardus at the shop of a binder who was going to use the ms to patch his books withal  rossi who may have seen naude at work tells us how he would enter a shop with a yardmeasure in his hand buying books we are sorry to say by the ell  the stalls where he had passed were like the towns through which attila or the tartars had swept with ruin in their trainut non hominis unius sedulitas sed calamitas quaedam per omnes bibliopolarum tabernas pervasisse videatur  naude had sorrows of his own  in 1652 the parliament decreed the confiscation of the splendid library of mazarin which was perhaps the first free library in europethe first that was open to all who were worthy of right of entrance  there is a painful description of the sale from which the booklover will avert his eyes  on mazarins return to power he managed to collect again and enrich his stores which form the germ of the existing bibliotheque mazarine  among princes and popes it is pleasant to meet one man of letters and he the greatest of the great age who was a bibliophile  the enemies and rivals of molierede vise de villiers and the rest are always reproaching himwith his love of bouquins  there is some difference of opinion among philologists about the derivation of bouquin but all bookhunters know the meaning of the word  the bouquin is the small rare volume black with tarnished gold which lies among the wares of the stallkeeper patient in rain and dust till the hunter comes who can appreciate the quarry  we like to think of moliere lounging through the narrow streets in the evening returning perhaps from some noble house where he has been reading the proscribed tartuffe or giving an imitation of the rival actors at the hotel bourgogne  absent as the contemplateur is a dingy bookstall wakens him from his reverie  his lace ruffles are soiled in a moment with the learned dust of ancient volumes  perhaps he picks up the only work out of all his library that is known to existun ravissant petit elzevir de imperio magni mogolis lugd  bat 1651  on the titlepage of this tiny volume one of the minute series of republics which the elzevirs published the poet has written his rare signature j b p moliere with the price the book cost him 1 livre 10 sols  il nest pas de bouquin qui sechappe de ses mains says the author of la guerre comique the last of the pamphlets which flew about during the great literary quarrel about lecole des femmes thanks to m soulie the catalogue of molieres library has been found though the books themselves have passed out of view  there are about three hundred and fifty volumes in the inventory but molieres widow may have omitted as valueless it is the foible of her sex many rusty bouquins now worth far more than their weight in gold  moliere owned no fewer than two hundred and forty volumes of french and italian comedies  from these he took what suited him wherever he found it  he had plenty of classics histories philosophic treatises the essays of montaigne a plutarch and a bible  we know nothing to the regret of bibliophiles of molieres taste in bindings  did he have a comic mask stamped on the leather that device was chased on his plate or did he display his cognizance and arms the two apes that support a shield charged with three mirrors of truth  it is certainla bruyere tells us as muchthat the sillier sort of booklover in the seventeenth century was much the same sort of person as his successor in our own time  a man tells me he has a library says la bruyere de la mode i ask permission to see it  i go to visit my friend and he receives me in a house where even on the stairs the smell of the black morocco with which his books are covered is so strong that i nearly faint he does his best to revive me shouts in my ear that the volumes have gilt edges that they are elegantly tooled that they are of the good edition    and informs me that he never reads that he never sets foot in this part of his house that he will come to oblige me  i thank him for all his kindness and have no more desire than himself to see the tanners shop that he calls his library  colbert the great minister of louis xiv was a bibliophile at whom perhaps la bruyere would have sneered  he was a collector who did not read but who amassed beautiful books and looked forward as business men do to the day when he would have time to study them after grolier de thou and mazarin colbert possessed probably the richest private library in europe  the ambassadors of france were charged to procure him rare books and manuscripts and it is said that in a commercial treaty with the porte he inserted a clause demanding a certain quantity of levant morocco for the use of the royal bookbinders  england in those days had no literature with which france deigned to be acquainted  even into england however valuable books had been imported and we find colbert pressing the french ambassador at st jamess to bid for him at a certain sale of rare heretical writings  people who wanted to gain his favour approached him with presents of books and the city of metz gave him two real curiositiesthe famous metz bible and the missal of charles the bald  the elzevirs sent him their best examples and though colbert probably saw more of the gilt covers of his books than of their contents at least he preserved and handed down many valuable works  as much may be said for the reprobate cardinal dubois who with all his faults was a collector  bossuet on the other hand left little or nothing of interest except a copy of the 1682 edition of moliere whom he detested and condemned to the punishment of those who laugh  even this book which has a curious interest has slipped out of sight and may have ceased to exist  if colbert and dubois preserved books from destruction there are collectors enough who have been rescued from oblivion by books  the diplomacy of dhoym is forgotten the plays of longepierre and his quarrels with j b rousseau are known only to the literary historian  these great amateurs have secured an eternity of gilt edges an immortality of morocco  absurd prices are given for any trash that belonged to them and the writer of this notice has bought for four shillings an elzevir classic which when it bears the golden fleece of longepierre is worth about 100 pounds longepierre dhoym mccarthy and the duc de la valliere with all their treasures are less interesting to us than graille coche and loque the neglected daughters of louis xv  they found some pale consolation in their little cabinets of books in their various liveries of olive citron and red morocco  a lady amateur of high bookcollecting reputation the comtesse de verrue was represented in the beckford sale by one of three copies of lhistoire de melusine of melusine the twyformed fairy and ancestress of the house of lusignan  the comtesse de verrue one of the few women who have really understood bookcollecting 16 was born january 18 1670 and died november 18 1736  she was the daughter of charles de luynes and of his second wife anne de rohan when only thirteen she married the comte de verrue who somewhat injudiciously presented her a fleur de quinze ans as ronsard says at the court of victor amadeus of savoy  it is thought that the countess was less cruel than the fleur angevine of ronsard  for some reason the young matron fled from the court of turin and returned to paris where she built a magnificent hotel and received the most distinguished company  according to her biographer the countess loved science and art jusquau delire and she collected the furniture of the period without neglecting the blue china of the glowing orient  in ebony bookcases she possessed about eighteen thousand volumes bound by the greatest artists of the day without care for the present without fear of the future doing good pursuing the beautiful protecting the arts with a tender heart and open hand the countess passed through life calm happy beloved and admired  she left an epitaph on herself thus rudely translated   here lies in sleep secure a dame inclined to mirth who by way of making sure chose her paradise on earth   during the revolution to like wellbound books was as much as to proclaim one an aristocrat  condorcet might have escaped the scaffold if he had only thrown away the neat little horace from the royal press which betrayed him for no true republican but an educated man  the great libraries from the chateaux of the nobles were scattered among all the bookstalls  true sons of freedom tore off the bindings with their gilded crests and scutcheons  one revolutionary writer declared and perhaps he was not far wrong that the art of binding was the worst enemy of reading  he always began his studies by breaking the backs of the volumes he was about to attack  the art of bookbinding in these sad years took flight to england and was kept alive by artists robust rather than refined like thompson and roger payne  these were evil days when the binder had to cut the aristocratic coat of arms out of a book cover and glue in a gilt cap of liberty as in a volume in an oxford amateurs collection  when napoleon became emperor he strove in vain to make the troubled and feverish years of his power produce a literature  he himself was one of the most voracious readers of novels that ever lived  he was always asking for the newest of the new and unfortunately even the new romances of his period were hopelessly bad  barbier his librarian had orders to send parcels of fresh fiction to his majesty wherever he might happen to be and great loads of novels followed napoleon to germany spain italy russia  the conqueror was very hard to please  he read in his travelling carriage and after skimming a few pages would throw a volume that bored him out of the window into the highway  he might have been tracked by his trail of romances as was hopomythumb in the fairy tale by the white stones he dropped behind him  poor barbier who ministered to a passion for novels that demanded twenty volumes a day was at his wits end  he tried to foist on the emperor the romances of the year before last but these napoleon had generally read and he refused with imperial scorn to look at them again  he ordered a travelling library of three thousand volumes to be made for him but it was proved that the task could not be accomplished in less than six years  the expense if only fifty copies of each example had been printed would have amounted to more than six million francs a roman emperor would not have allowed these considerations to stand in his way but napoleon after all was a modern  he contented himself with a selection of books conveniently small in shape and packed in sumptuous cases  the classical writers of france could never content napoleon and even from moscow in 1812 he wrote to barbier clamorous for new books and good ones  long before they could have reached moscow napoleon was flying homeward before kotousoff and benningsen  napoleon was the last of the booklovers who governed france  the duc daumale a famous bibliophile has never come to his own and of m gambetta it is only known that his devotional library at least has found its way into the market  we have reached the era of private bookfanciers  of nodier who had three libraries in his time but never a virgil and of pixerecourt the dramatist who founded the societe des bibliophiles francais  the romantic movement in french literature brought in some new fashions in book hunting  the original editions of ronsard des portes belleau and du bellay became invaluable while the writings of gautier petrus borel and others excited the passion of collectors  pixerecourt was a believer in the works of the elzevirs  on one occasion when he was outbid by a friend at an auction he cried passionately i shall have that book at your sale and the other poor bibliophile soon falling into a decline and dying pixerecourt got the volume which he so much desired  the superstitious might have been excused for crediting him with the gift of jettaturaof the evil eye  on pixerecourt himself the evil eye fell at last his theatre the gaiete was burned down in 1835 and his creditors intended to impound his beloved books  the bibliophile hastily packed them in boxes and conveyed them in two cabs and under cover of night to the house of m paul lacroix  there they languished in exile till the affairs of the manager were settled  pixerecourt and nodier the most reckless of men were the leaders of the older school of bibliomaniacs  the former was not a rich man the second was poor but he never hesitated in face of a price that he could not afford  he would literally ruin himself in the accumulation of a library and then would recover his fortunes by selling his books  nodier passed through life without a virgil because he never succeeded in finding the ideal virgil of his dreamsa clean uncut copy of the right elzevir edition with the misprint and the two passages in red letters  perhaps this failure was a judgment on him for the trick by which he beguiled a certain collector of bibles  he invented an edition and put the collector on the scent which he followed vainly till he died of the sickness of hope deferred  one has more sympathy with the eccentricities of nodier than with the mere extravagance of the new haute ecole of bibliomaniacs the school of millionnaires royal dukes and rothschilds  these amateurs are reckless of prices and by their competition have made it almost impossible for a poor man to buy a precious book  the dukes the americans the public libraries snap them all up in the auctions  a glance at m gustave brunets little volume la bibliomanie en 1878 will prove the excesses which these people commit  the funeral oration of bossuet over henriette marie of france 1669 and henriette anne of england 1670 quarto in the original binding are sold for 200 pounds  it is true that this copy had possibly belonged to bossuet himself and certainly to his nephew  there is an example as we have seen of the 1682 edition of moliereof moliere whom bossuet detestedwhich also belonged to the eagle of meaux  the manuscript notes of the divine on the work of the poor player must be edifying and in the interests of science it is to be hoped that this book may soon come into the market  while pamphlets of bossuet are sold so dear the first edition of homerthe beautiful edition of 1488 which the three young florentine gentlemen publishedmay be had for 100 pounds yet even that seems expensive when we remember that the copy in the library of george iii cost only seven shillings  this exquisite homer sacred to the memory of learned friendships the chief offering of early printing at the altar of ancient poetry is really one of the most interesting books in the world  yet this homer is less valued than the tiny octavo which contains the ballades and huitains of the scamp francois villon 1533  the history of the holy grail lhystoire du sainct greaal  paris 1523 in a binding stamped with the four crowns of louis xiv is valued at about 500 pounds  a chivalric romance of the old days which was treasured even in the time of the grand monarque when old french literature was so much despised is certainly a curiosity  the rabelais of madame de pompadour in morocco seems comparatively cheap at 60 pounds  there is something piquant in the idea of inheriting from that famous beauty the work of the colossal genius of rabelais 17  the natural sympathy of collectors to middle fortune born is not with the rich men whose sport in bookhunting resembles the battue we side with the poor hunters of the wild game who hang over the fourpenny stalls on the quais and dive into the dusty boxes after literary pearls  these devoted men rise betimes and hurry to the stalls before the common tide of passengers goes by  early morning is the best moment in this as in other sports  at half past seven in summer the bouquiniste the dealer in cheap volumes at second hand arrays the books which he purchased over night the stray possessions of ruined families the outcasts of libraries  the old fashioned bookseller knew little of the value of his wares it was his object to turn a small certain profit on his expenditure  it is reckoned that an energetic businesslike old bookseller will turn over 150000 volumes in a year  in this vast number there must be pickings for the humble collector who cannot afford to encounter the children of israel at sothebys or at the hotel drouot  let the enthusiast in conclusion throw a handful of lilies on the grave of the martyr of the love of booksthe poet albert glatigny poor glatigny was the son of a garde champetre his education was accidental and his poetic taste and skill extraordinarily fine and delicate  in his life of starvation he had often to sleep in omnibuses and railway stations he frequently spent the price of a dinner on a new book  he lived to read and to dream and if he bought books he had not the wherewithal to live  still he bought themand he died  his own poems were beautifully printed by lemerre and it may be a joy to him si mentem mortalia tangunt that they are now so highly valued that the price of a copy would have kept the author alive and happy for a month    old french titlepages    nothing can be plainer as a rule than a modern english titlepage its only beauty if beauty it possesses consists in the arrangement and massing of lines of type in various sizes  we have returned almost to the primitive simplicity of the oldest printed books which had no titlepages properly speaking at all or merely gave with extreme brevity the name of the work without printers mark or date or place  these were reserved for the colophon if it was thought desirable to mention them at all  thus in the blackletter example of guido de columnas history of troy written about 1283 and printed at strasburg in 1489 the titlepage is blank except for the words   hystoria troiana guidonis   standing alone at the top of the leaf  the colophon contains all the rest of the information happily completed in the city of strasburg in the year of grace mcccclxxxix about the feast of st urban  the printer and publisher give no name at all  this early simplicity is succeeded in french books from say 1510 and afterwards by the insertion either of the printers trademark or in blackletter books of a rough woodcut illustrative of the nature of the volume  the woodcuts have occasionally a rude kind of grace with a touch of the classical taste of the early renaissance surviving in extreme decay  illustration with title page  les demandes tamours auec les refpofesioyeufes  demade refponfe  an excellent example is the titlepage of les demandes damours avec les responses joyeuses published by jacques moderne at lyon 1540  there is a certain pagan breadth and joyousness in the figure of amor and the man in the hood resembles traditional portraits of dante  there is more humour and a good deal of skill in the titlepage of a book on late marriages and their discomforts les dictz et complainctes de trop tard marie jacques moderne lyon 1540 where we see the elderly and comfortable couple sitting gravely under their own figtree  illustration of les dictz et complainctes  jacques moderne was a printer curious in these quaint devices and used them in most of his books  for example in how satan and the god bacchus accuse the publicans that spoil the wine bacchus and satan exactly like each other as sir wilfrid lawson will not be surprised to hear are encouraging dishonest tavernkeepers to stew in their own juice in a caldron over a huge fire  from the same popular publisher came a little tract on various modes of sport if the name of sport can be applied to the netting of fish and birds the work is styled livret nouveau auquel sont contenuz xxv receptes de prendre poissons et oiseaulx avec les mains  a countryman clad in a goats skin with the head and horns drawn over his head as a hood is dragging ashore a net full of fishes  there is no more characteristic frontispiece of this blackletter sort than the woodcut representing a gallows with three men hanging on it which illustrates villons ballade des pendus and is reproduced in mr john paynes poems of master francis villon of paris london 1878 18  earlier in date than these vignettes of jacques moderne but much more artistic and refined in design are some frontispieces of small octavos printed en lettres rondes about 1530  in these rubricated letters are used with brilliant effect  one of the best is the titlepage of galliot du pres edition of le rommant de la rose paris 1529 19  galliot du pres artist however surpassed even the charming device of the lover plucking the rose in his titlepage of the same date for the small octavo edition of alain chartiers poems which we reproduce here  illustration of title page  the arrangement of letters and the use of red make a charming frame as it were to the drawing of the mediaeval ship with the motto vogue la galee  titlepages like these with designs appropriate to the character of the text were superseded presently by the fashion of badges devices and mottoes  as courtiers and ladies had their private badges not hereditary like crests but personalthe crescent of diane the salamander of francis i the skulls and crossbones of henri iii the marguerites of marguerite with mottoes like the le banny de liesse le traverseur des voies perilleuses tout par soulas and the like so printers and authors had their emblems and their private literary slogans  these they changed accordinging  another illustration titled  le pastissier francois mdclv title page  to fancy or the vicissitudes of their lives  clement marots motto was la mort ny mord  it is indicated by the letters l m n m in the curious title of an edition of marots works published at lyons by jean de tournes in 1579  the portrait represents the poet when the tide of years had borne him far from his youth far from ladolescence clementine  another illustration titled  le pastissier francois 1655 showing a kitchen scene  the unfortunate etienne dolet perhaps the only publisher who was ever burned used an ominous device a trunk of a tree with the axe struck into it  in publishing les marguerites de la marguerite des princesses tres illustre royne de navarre jean de tournes employed a pretty allegorical device  love with the bandage thrust back from his eyes and with the bow and arrows in his hand has flown up to the sun which he seems to touch like prometheus in the myth when he stole the fire a shower of flowers and flames falls around him  groueleau of paris had for motto nul ne sy frotte with the thistle for badge  these are beautifully combined in the titlepage of his version of apuleius lamour de cupido et de psyche paris 1557  there is probably no better date for frontispieces both for ingenuity of device and for elegance of arrangement of title than the years between 1530 and 1560  by 1562 when the first edition of the famous fifth book of rabelais was published the printers appear to have thought devices wasted on popular books and the title of the masters posthumous chapters is printed quite simply  in 153235 there was a more adventurous tastewitness the title of gargantua  this beautiful title decorates the first known edition with a date of the first book of rabelais  it was sold most appropriately devant nostre dame de confort  why should so glorious a relic of the master have been carried out of england at the sunderland sale  all the early titles of francois justes lyons editions of rabelais are on this model  by 1542 he dropped the framework of architectural design  by 1565 richard breton in paris was printing rabelais with a frontispiece of a classical dame holding a heart to the sun a figure which is almost in the taste of stothard or flaxman  the taste for vignettes engraved on copper not on wood was revived under the elzevirs  their pretty little titlepages are not so well known but that we offer examples  in the essay on the elzevirs in this volume will be found a copy of the vignette of the imitatio christi and of le pastissier francois a reproduction is given here pp 114 115  the artists they employed had plenty of fancy not backed by very profound skill in design  in the same genre as the bigwigged classicism of the elzevir vignettes in an age when louis xiv and moliere in tragedy wore laurel wreaths over vast perruques are the early frontispieces of molieres own collected works  probably the most interesting of all french titlepages are those drawn by chauveau for the two volumes les oeuvres de m de moliere published in 1666 by guillaume de luynes  the first shows moliere in two characters as mascarille and as sganarelle in le cocu imaginaire  contrast the fullblown jollity of the fourbum imperator in his hat and feather and wig and vast canons and tremendous shoetie with the lean melancholy of jealous sganarelle  these are two notable aspects of the genius of the great comedian  the apes below are the supporters of his scutcheon  the second volume shows the muse of comedy crowning mlle de moliere armande bejart in the dress of agnes while her husband is in the costume apparently of tartuffe or of sganarelle in lecole des femmes  tartuffe had not yet been licensed for a public stage the interest of the portraits and costumes makes these titlepages precious they are historical documents rather than mere curiosities  these titlepages of moliere are the highwater mark of french taste in this branch of decoration  in the old quarto first editions of corneilles early plays such as le cid paris 1637 the printers used lax and sprawling combinations of flowers and fruit  these a little better executed were the staple of ribou de luynes quinet and the other parisian booksellers who one after another failed to satisfy moliere as publishers  the basket of fruits on the titlepage of iphigenie par m racine barbin paris 1675 is almost but not quite identical with the similar ornament of de vises la cocue imaginaire ribou paris 1662  many of molieres plays appearing first separately in small octavo were adorned with frontispieces illustrative of some scene in the comedy  thus in the misanthrope rihou 1667 we see alceste green ribbons and all discoursing with philinte or perhaps listening to the famous sonnet of oronte it is not easy to be quite certain but the expression of alcestes face looks rather as if he were being baited with a sonnet  from the close of the seventeenth century onwards the taste for titlepages declined except when moreau or gravelot drew vignettes on copper with abundance of cupids and nymphs  these were designed for very luxurious and expensive books for others men contented themselves with a bald simplicity which has prevailed till our own time  in recent years the employment of publishers devices has been less unusual and more agreeable  thus poulet malassis had his armes parlantes a chicken very uncomfortably perched on a rail  in england we have the cipher and bees of messrs macmillan the trees of life and knowledge of messrs kegan paul and trench the ship which was the sign of messrs longmans early place of business and doubtless other symbols all capable of being quaintly treated in a titlepage    a bookmans purgatory    thomas blinton was a bookhunter  he had always been a bookhunter ever since at an extremely early age he had awakened to the errors of his ways as a collector of stamps and monograms  in bookhunting he saw no harm nay he would contrast its joys in a rather pharisaical style with the pleasures of shooting and fishing  he constantly declined to believe that the devil came for that renowned amateur of black letter g steevens  dibdin himself who tells the story with obvious anxiety and alarm pretends to refuse credit to the ghastly narrative  his language says dibdin in his account of the bookhunters end was too frequently the language of imprecation  this is rather good as if dibdin thought a gentleman might swear pretty often but not too frequently  although i am not disposed to admit dibdin goes on the whole of the testimony of the good woman who watched by steevenss bedside although my prejudices as they may be called will not allow me to believe that the windows shook and that strange noises and deep groans were heard at midnight in his room yet no creature of common sense and this woman possessed the quality in an eminent degree could mistake oaths for prayers and so forth  in short dibdin clearly holds that the windows did shake without a blast like the banners in branxholme hall when somebody came for the goblin page  but thomas blinton would hear of none of these things  he said that his taste made him take exercise that he walked from the city to west kensington every day to beat the covers of the bookstalls while other men travelled in the expensive cab or the unwholesome metropolitan railway  we are all apt to hold favourable views of our own amusements and for my own part i believe that trout and salmon are incapable of feeling pain  but the flimsiness of blintons theories must be apparent to every unbiassed moralist his harmless taste really involved most of the deadly sins or at all events a fair working majority of them  he coveted his neighbours books  when he got the chance he bought books in a cheap market and sold them in a dear market thereby degrading literature to the level of trade  he took advantage of the ignorance of uneducated persons who kept bookstalls  he was envious and grudged the good fortune of others while he rejoiced in their failures  he turned a deaf ear to the appeals of poverty he was luxurious and laid out more money than he should have done on his selfish pleasures often adorning a volume with a morocco binding when mrs blinton sighed in vain for some old point dalencon lace  greedy proud envious stingy extravagant and sharp in his dealings blinton was guilty of most of the sins which the church recognises as deadly  on the very day before that of which the affecting history is now to be told blinton had been running the usual round of crime  he had as far as intentions went defrauded a bookseller in holywell street by purchasing from him for the sum of two shillings what he took to be a very rare elzevir  it is true that when he got home and consulted willems he found that he had got hold of the wrong copy in which the figures denoting the numbers of pages are printed right and which is therefore worth exactly nuppence to the collector  but the intention is the thing and blintons intention was distinctly fraudulent  when he discovered his error then his language as dibdin says was that of imprecation  worse if possible than this blinton had gone to a sale begun to bid for les essais de michel seigneur de montaigne foppens mdclix and carried away by excitement had plunged to the extent of 15 pounds which was precisely the amount of money he owed his plumber and gasfitter a worthy man with a large family  then meeting a friend if the bookhunter has friends or rather an accomplice in lawless enterprise blinton had remarked the glee on the others face  the poor man had purchased a little old olaus magnus with woodcuts representing werewolves firedrakes and other fearful wildfowl and was happy in his bargain  but blinton with fiendish joy pointed out to him that the index was imperfect and left him sorrowing  deeds more foul have yet to be told  thomas blinton had discovered a new sin so to speak in the collecting way  aristophanes says of one of his favourite blackguards not only is he a villain but he has invented an original villainy  blinton was like this  he maintained that every man who came to notoriety had at some period published a volume of poems which he had afterwards repented of and withdrawn  it was blintons hideous pleasure to collect stray copies of these unhappy volumes these peches de jeunesse which always and invariably bear a gushing inscription from the author to a friend  he had all lord john mannerss poems and even mr ruskins  he had the ode to despair of smith now a comic writer and the love lyrics of brown who is now a permanent undersecretary than which nothing can be less gay nor more permanent  he had the amatory songs which a dignitary of the church published and withdrew from circulation  blinton was wont to say he expected to come across triolets of a tribune by mr john bright and original hymns for infant minds by mr henry labouchere if he only hunted long enough  on the day of which i speak he had secured a volume of lovepoems which the author had done his best to destroy and he had gone to his club and read all the funniest passages aloud to friends of the author who was on the club committee  ah was this a kind action in short blinton had filled up the cup of his iniquities and nobody will be surprised to hear that he met the appropriate punishment of his offence  blinton had passed on the whole a happy day notwithstanding the error about the elzevir  he dined well at his club went home slept well and started next morning for his office in the city walking as usual and intending to pursue the pleasures of the chase at all the bookstalls  at the very first in the brompton road he saw a man turning over the rubbish in the cheap box  blinton stared at him fancied he knew him thought he didnt and then became a prey to the glittering eye of the other  the stranger who wore the conventional cloak and slouched soft hat of strangers was apparently an accomplished mesmerist or thoughtreader or adept or esoteric buddhist  he resembled mr isaacs zanoni in the novel of that name mendoza in codlingsby the soulless man in a strange story mr home mr irving bishop a buddhist adept in the astral body and most other mysterious characters of history and fiction  before his awful will blintons mere modern obstinacy shrank back like a child abashed  the stranger glided to him and whispered buy these  these were a complete set of auerbachs novels in english which i need not say blinton would never have dreamt of purchasing had he been left to his own devices  buy these repeated the adept or whatever he was in a cruel whisper  paying the sum demanded and trailing his vast load of german romance poor blinton followed the fiend  they reached a stall where amongst much trash glatignys jour de lan dun vagabond was exposed  look said blinton there is a book i have wanted some time glatignys are getting rather scarce and it is an amusing trifle   nay buy that said the implacable stranger pointing with a hooked forefinger at alisons history of europe in an indefinite number of volumes  blinton shuddered  what buy that and why  in heavens name what could i do with it  buy it repeated the persecutor and that indicating the ilios of dr schliemann a bulky work and these pointing to all mr theodore alois buckleys translations of the classics and these glancing at the collected writings of the late mr hain friswell and at a life in more than one volume of mr gladstone  the miserable blinton paid and trudged along carrying the bargains under his arm  now one book fell out now another dropped by the way  sometimes a portion of alison came ponderously to earth sometimes the gentle life sunk resignedly to the ground  the adept kept picking them up again and packing them under the arms of the weary blinton  the victim now attempted to put on an air of geniality and tried to enter into conversation with his tormentor  he does know about books thought blinton and he must have a weak spot somewhere  so the wretched amateur made play in his best conversational style he talked of bindings of maioli of grolier of de thou of derome of clovis eve of roger payne of trautz and eke of bauzonnet  he discoursed of first editions of black letter and even of illustrations and vignettes  he approached the topic of bibles but here his tyrant with a fierce yet timid glance interrupted him  buy those he hissed through his teeth  those were the complete publications of the folk lore society  blinton did not care for folk lore very bad men never do but he had to act as he was told  then without pause or remorse he was charged to acquire the ethics of aristotle in the agreeable versions of williams and chase  next he secured strathmore chandos under two flags and two little wooden shoes and several dozens more of ouidas novels  the next stall was entirely filled with schoolbooks old geographies livys delectuses arnolds greek exercises ollendorffs and what not  buy them all hissed the fiend  he seized whole boxes and piled them on blintons head  he tied up ouidas novels in two parcels with string and fastened each to one of the buttons above the tails of blintons coat  you are tired asked the tormentor  never mind these books will soon be off your hands  so speaking the stranger with amazing speed hurried blinton back through holywell street along the strand and up to piccadilly stopping at last at the door of blintons famous and very expensive binder  the binder opened his eyes as well he might at the vision of blintons treasures  then the miserable blinton found himself as it were automatically and without any exercise of his will speaking thus  here are some things i have picked upextremely rareand you will oblige me by binding them in your best manner regardless of expense  morocco of course crushed levant morocco double every book of them petits fers my crest and coat of arms plenty of gilding  spare no cost  dont keep me waiting as you generally do for indeed bookbinders are the most dilatory of the human species  before the astonished binder could ask the most necessary questions blintons tormentor had hurried that amateur out of the room  come on to the sale he cried  what sale said blinton  why the beckford sale it is the thirteenth day a lucky day  but i have forgotten my catalogue  where is it  in the third shelf from the top on the righthand side of the ebony bookcase at home  the stranger stretched out his arm which swiftly elongated itself till the hand disappeared from view round the corner  in a moment the hand returned with the catalogue  the pair sped on to messrs sothebys auctionrooms in wellington street  every one knows the appearance of a great booksale  the long table surrounded by eager bidders resembles from a little distance a roulette table and communicates the same sort of excitement  the amateur is at a loss to know how to conduct himself  if he bids in his own person some bookseller will outbid him partly because the bookseller knows after all he knows little about books and suspects that the amateur may in this case know more  besides professionals always dislike amateurs and in this game they have a very great advantage  blinton knew all this and was in the habit of giving his commissions to a broker  but now he felt and very naturally as if a demon had entered into him  tirante il bianco valorosissimo cavaliere was being competed for an excessively rare romance of chivalry in magnificent red venetian morocco from canevaris library  the book is one of the rarest of the venetian press and beautifully adorned with canevaris devicea simple and elegant affair in gold and colours  apollo is driving his chariot across the green waves towards the rock on which winged pegasus is pawing the ground though why this action of a horse should be called pawing the animal notoriously not possessing paws it is hard to say  round this graceful design is the inscription greek text straight not crooked  in his ordinary mood blinton could only have admired tirante il bianco from a distance  but now the demon inspiring him he rushed into the lists and challenged the great mr  the napoleon of bookselling  the price had already reached five hundred pounds  six hundred cried blinton  guineas said the great mr   seven hundred screamed blinton  guineas replied the other  this arithmetical dialogue went on till even mr  struck his flag with a sigh when the maddened blinton had said six thousand  the cheers of the audience rewarded the largest bid ever made for any book  as if he had not done enough the stranger now impelled blinton to contend with mr  for every expensive work that appeared  the audience naturally fancied that blinton was in the earlier stage of softening of the brain when a man conceives himself to have inherited boundless wealth and is determined to live up to it  the hammer fell for the last time  blinton owed some fifty thousand pounds and exclaimed audibly as the influence of the fiend died out i am a ruined man  then your books must be sold cried the stranger and leaping on a chair he addressed the audience  gentlemen i invite you to mr blintons sale which will immediately take place  the collection contains some very remarkable early english poets many first editions of the french classics most of the rarer aldines and a singular assortment of americana  in a moment as if by magic the shelves round the room were filled with blintons books all tied up in big lots of some thirty volumes each  his early molieres were fastened to old french dictionaries and schoolbooks  his shakespeare quartos were in the same lot with tattered railway novels  his copy almost unique of richard barnfields much too affectionate shepheard was coupled with odd volumes of chips from a german workshop and a cheap imperfect example of tom browns schooldays  hookess amanda was at the bottom of a lot of american devotional works where it kept company with an elzevir tacitus and the aldine hypnerotomachia  the auctioneer put up lot after lot and blinton plainly saw that the whole affair was a knockout  his most treasured spoils were parted with at the price of waste paper  it is an awful thing to be present at ones own sale  no man would bid above a few shillings well did blinton know that after the knockout the plunder would be shared among the grinning bidders  at last his adonais uncut bound by lortic went in company with some old bradshaws the court guide of 1881 and an odd volume of the sunday at home for sixpence  the stranger smiled a smile of peculiar malignity blinton leaped up to protest the room seemed to shake around him but words would not come to his lips  then he heard a familiar voice observe as a familiar grasp shook his shoulder  tom tom what a nightmare you are enjoying  he was in his own armchair where he had fallen asleep after dinner and mrs blinton was doing her best to arouse him from his awful vision  beside him lay lenfer du bibliophile vu et decrit par charles asselineau  paris  tardieu mdccclx   if this were an ordinary tract i should have to tell how blintons eyes were opened how he gave up bookcollecting and took to gardening or politics or something of that sort  but truth compels me to admit that blintons repentance had vanished by the end of the week when he was discovered marking m claudins catalogue surreptitiously before breakfast  thus indeed end all our remorses  lancelot falls to his own love again as in the romance  much and justly as theologians decry a deathbed repentance it is perhaps the only repentance that we do not repent of  all others leave us ready when occasion comes to fall to our old love again and may that love never be worse than the taste for old books  once a collector always a collector  moi qui parle i have sinned and struggled and fallen  i have thrown catalogues unopened into the wastepaper basket  i have withheld my feet from the paths that lead to sothebys and to putticks  i have crossed the street to avoid a bookstall  in fact like the prophet nicholas i have been known to be steady for weeks at a time  and then the fatal moment of temptation has arrived and i have succumbed to the soft seductions of eisen or cochin or an old book on angling  probably grolier was thinking of such weaknesses when he chose his devices tanquam ventus and quisque suos patimur manes  like the wind we are blown about and like the people in the aeneid we are obliged to suffer the consequences of our own extravagance    ballade of the unattainable    the books i cannot hope to buy their phantoms round me waltz and wheel they pass before the dreaming eye ere sleep the dreaming eye can seal a kind of

  the biographer of mrs aphra behn refutes the vulgar error that a dutchman cannot love  whether or not a lady can love books is a question that may not be so readily settled  mr ernest quentin bauchart has contributed to the discussion of this problem by publishing a bibliography in two quarto volumes of books which have been in the libraries of famous beauties of old queens and princesses of france  there can be no doubt that these ladies were possessors of exquisite printed books and manuscripts wonderfully bound but it remains uncertain whether the owners as a rule were bibliophiles whether their hearts were with their treasures incredible as it may seem to us now literature was highly respected in the past and was even fashionable  poets were in favour at court and fashion decided that the great must possess books and not only books but books produced in the utmost perfection of art and bound with all the skill at the disposal of clovis eve and padeloup and duseuil  therefore as fashion gave her commands we cannot hastily affirm that the ladies who obeyed were really book lovers  in our more polite age fashion has decreed that ladies shall smoke and bet and romp but it would be premature to assert that all ladies who do their duty in these matters are born romps or have an unaffected liking for cigarettes  history however maintains that many of the renowned dames whose books are now the most treasured of literary relics were actually inclined to study as well as to pleasure like marguerite de valois and the comtesse de verrue and even madame de pompadour  probably books and arts were more to this ladys liking than the diversions by which she beguiled the tedium of louis xv and many a time she would rather have been quiet with her plays and novels than engaged in conscientiously conducted but distasteful revels  like a true frenchman m bauchart has only written about french lady booklovers or about women who like mary stuart were more than half french  nor would it be easy for an english author to name outside the ranks of crowned heads like elizabeth any englishwomen of distinction who had a passion for the material side of literature for binding and first editions and large paper and engravings in early states  the practical sex when studious is like the same sex when fond of equestrian exercise  a lady says my heyes hes an orse and he must go according to leechs groom  in the same way a studious girl or matron says this is a book and reads it if read she does without caring about the date or the state or the publishers name or even very often about the authors  i remember before the publication of a novel now celebrated seeing a privately printed vellumbound copy on large paper in the hands of a literary lady  she was holding it over the fire and had already made the vellum covers curl wide open like the shells of an afflicted oyster  when i asked what the volume was she explained that it is a book which a poor man has written and hes had it printed to see whether some one wont be kind enough to publish it  i ventured perhaps pedantically to point out that the poor man could not be so very poor or he would not have made so costly an experiment on dutch paper  but the lady said she did not know how that might be and she went on toasting the experiment  in all this there is a fine contempt for everything but the spiritual aspect of literature there is an aversion to the mere coquetry and display of morocco and red letters and the toys which amuse the minds of men  where ladies have caught the bibliomania i fancy they have taken this pretty fever from the other sex  but it must be owned that the books they have possessed being rarer and more romantic are even more highly prized by amateurs than examples from the libraries of grolier and longepierre and dhoym  m baucharts book is a complete guide to the collector of these expensive relics  he begins his dream of fair women who have owned books with the pearl of the valois marguerite dangouleme the sister of francis i  the remains of her library are chiefly devotional manuscripts  indeed it is to be noted that all these ladies however frivolous possessed the most devout and pious books and whole collections of prayers copied out by the pen and decorated with miniatures marguerites library was bound in morocco stamped with a crowned m in interlacs sown with daisies or at least with conventional flowers which may have been meant for daisies  if one could choose perhaps the most desirable of the specimens extant is le premier livre du prince des poetes homere in salels translation  for this translation ronsard writes a prologue addressed to the manes of salel in which he complains that he is ridiculed for his poetry he draws a characteristic picture of homer and salel in elysium among the learned lovers   qui parmi les fleurs devisent au giron de leur dame   marguerites manuscript copy of the first book of the iliad is a small quarto adorned with daisies fleurs delis and the crowned m  it is in the duc daumales collection at chantilly  the books of diane de poitiers are more numerous and more famous  when first a widow she stamped her volumes with a laurel springing from a tomb and the motto sola vivit in illo  but when she consoled herself with henri ii she suppressed the tomb and made the motto meaningless  her crescent shone not only on her books but on the palace walls of france in the louvre fontainebleau and anet and her initial d is inextricably interlaced with the h of her royal lover  indeed henri added the d to his own cypher and this must have been so embarrassing for his wife catherine that people have goodnaturedly tried to read the curves of the ds as cs  the ds and the crescents and the bows of his diana are impressed even on the covers of henris book of hours  catherines own cypher is a double c enlaced with an h or double ks katherine combined in the same manner  these unlike the dh are surmounted with a crownthe one advantage which the wife possessed over the favourite  among dianes books are various treatises on medicines and on surgery and plenty of poetry and italian novels  among the books exhibited at the british museum in glass cases is dianes copy of bembos history of venice  an american collector mr barlow of new york is happy enough to possess her singularitez de la france antarctique antwerp 1558  catherine de medicis got splendid books on the same terms as foreign pirates procure english novelsshe stole them  the marshal strozzi dying in the french service left a noble collection on which catherine laid her hands  brantome says that strozzis son often expressed to him a candid opinion about this transaction what with her own collection and what with the marshals catherine possessed about four thousand volumes  on her death they were in peril of being seized by her creditors but her almoner carried them to his own house and de thou had them placed in the royal library unluckily it was thought wiser to strip the books of the coats with catherines compromising device lest her creditors should single them out and take them away in their pockets  hence books with her arms and cypher are exceedingly rare  at the sale of the collections of the duchesse de berry a book of hours of catherines was sold for 2400 pounds  mary stuart of scotland was one of the lady booklovers whose taste was more than a mere following of the fashion  some of her books like one of marie antoinettes were the companions of her captivity and still bear the sad complaints which she entrusted to these last friends of fallen royalty  her notebook in which she wrote her latin prose exercises when a girl still survives bound in red morocco with the arms of france  in a book of hours now the property of the czar may be partly deciphered the quatrains which she composed in her sorrowful years but many of them are mutilated by the binders shears  the queen used the volume as a kind of album  it contains the signatures of the countess of schrewsbury as m bauchart has it of walsingham of the earl of sussex and of charles howard earl of nottingham  there is also the signature your most infortunat arbella seymour and fr bacon  this remarkable manuscript was purchased in paris during the revolution by peter dubrowsky who carried it to russia  another book of hours of the queens bears this inscription in a sixteenth century hand  ce sont les heures de marie setuart renne marguerite de blacuod de rosay  in de blacuod it is not very easy to recognise blackwood  marguerite was probably the daughter of adam blackwood who wrote a volume on mary stuarts sufferings edinburgh 1587  the famous marguerite de valois the wife of henri iv had certainly a noble library and many beautifully bound books stamped with daisies are attributed to her collections  they bear the motto expectata non eludet which appears to refer first to the daisy margarita which is punctual in the spring or rather is the constellated flower that never sets and next to the lady who will keep tryst  but is the lady marguerite de valois though the books have been sold at very high prices as relics of the leman of la mole it seems impossible to demonstrate that they were ever on her shelves that they were bound by clovis eve from her own design no mention is made of them in any contemporary document and the judicious are reduced to conjectures  yet they form a most important collection systematically bound science and philosophy in citron morocco the poets in green and history and theology in red  in any case it is absurd to explain expectata non eludet as a reference to the lily of the royal arms which appears on the centre of the daisypied volumes  the motto in that case would run expectata lilia non eludent  as it stands the feminine adjective expectata in the singular must apply either to the lady who owned the volumes or to the margarita her emblem or to both  yet the ungrammatical rendering is that which m bauchart suggests  many of the books marguerites or not were sold at prices over 100 pounds in london in 1884 and 1883  the macrobius and theocritus and homer are in the cracherode collection at the british museum  the daisy crowned ronsard went for 430 pounds at the beckford sale  these prices will probably never be reached again  if anne of austria the mother of louis xiv was a bibliophile she may be suspected of acting on the motive love me love my books about her affection for cardinal mazarin there seems to be no doubt the cardinal had a famous library and his royal friend probably imitated his tastes  in her time and on her volumes the originality and taste of the skilled binder le gascon begin to declare themselves  the fashionable passion for lace to which la fontaine made such sacrifices affected the art of book decorations and le gascons beautiful patterns of gold points and dots are copies of the productions of venice  the queenmothers books include many devotional treatises for whatever other fashions might come and go piety was always constant before the revolution anne of austria seems to have been particularly fond of the lives and works of saint theresa and saint francois de sales and john of the cross  but she was not unread in the old french poets such as coquillart she condescended to ariosto she had that dubious character theophile de viaud beautifully bound she owned the rabelais of 1553 and what is particularly interesting m de lignerolles possesses her copy of leschole des femmes comedie par j b p moliere  paris  guillaume de luynes 1663  in 12 degree sign red morocco gilt edges and the queens arms on the covers  this relic is especially valuable when we remember that lecole des femmes and arnolphes sermon to agnes and his comic threats of future punishment first made envy take the form of religious persecution  the devout queenmother was often appealed to by the enemies of moliere yet anne of austria had not only seen his comedy but possessed this beautiful example of the first edition  m paul lacroix supposes that this copy was offered to the queenmother by moliere himself  the frontispiece arnolphe preaching to agnes is thought to be a portrait of moliere but in the reproduction in m louis lacours edition it is not easy to see any resemblance  apparently anne did not share the views even in her later years of the converted prince de conty for several comedies and novels remain stamped with her arms and device  the learned marquise de rambouillet the parent of all the precieuses must have owned a good library but nothing is chronicled save her celebrated book of prayers and meditations written out and decorated by jarry  it is bound in red morocco double with green and covered with vs in gold  the marquise composed the prayers for her own use and jarry was so much struck with their beauty that he asked leave to introduce them into the book of hours which he had to copy for the prayers are often so silly said he that i am ashamed to write them out  here is an example of the devotions which jarry admired a prayer to saint louis  it was published in miscellanies bibliographiques by m prosper blanchemain   priere a saintlouis roy de france  grand roy bien que votre couronne ayt este des plus esclatantes de la terre celle que vous portez dans le ciel est incomparablement plus precieuse  lune estoit perissable lautre est immortelle et ces lys dont la blancheur se pouvoit ternir sont maintenant

sceptre quil le preserve dheresie quil y face toujours regner saintement vostre illustre sang et que tous ceux qui ont lhonneur den descendre soient pour jamais fideles a son eglise   the daughter of the marquise the fair julie heroine of that long courting by m de montausier survives in those records as the possessor of la guirlande de julie the manuscript book of poems by eminent hands  but this manuscript seems to have been all the library of julie therein she could constantly read of her own perfections  to be sure she had also lhistoire de gustave adolphe a hero for whom like major dugald dalgetty she cherished a supreme devotion  in the guirlande chapelains verses turn on the pleasing fancy that the protestant lion of the north changed into a flower like paul limayrac in m banvilles ode requests julie to take pity on his altered estate   sois pitoyable a ma langueur et si je nay place en ton coeur que je laye au moins sur ta teste   these verses were reckoned consummate  the guirlande is still with happier fate than attends most books in the hands of the successors of the duc and duchesse de montausier  like julie madame de maintenon was a precieuse but she never had time to form a regular library  her books however were bound by duseuil a binder immortal in the verse of pope or it might be more correct to say that madame de maintenons own books are seldom distinguishable from those of her favourite foundation st cyr the most interesting is a copy of the first edition of esther in quarto 1689 bound in red morocco and bearing in racines hand a madame la marquise de maintenon offert avec respectracine  doubtless racine had the book bound before he presented it  people are discontented writes his son louis if you offer them a book in a simple marbled paper cover  i could wish that this worthy custom were restored for the sake of the art of binding and also because amateur poets would be more chary of their presentation copies  it is no doubt wise to turn these gifts with their sides against the inner walls of bookcases to be bulwarks against the damp but the trouble of acknowledging worthless presents from strangers is considerable 20  another interesting example of madame de maintenons collections is daciers remarques critiques sur les oeuvres dhorace bearing the arms of louis xiv but with his wifes signature on the flyleaf 1681  of madame de montespan ousted from the royal favour by madame de maintenon who married into the family where she had been governess there survives one bookish relic of interest  this is oeuvres diverses par un auteur de sept ans in quarto red morocco printed on vellum and with the arms of the mother of the little duc du maine 1678  when madame de maintenon was still playing mother to the children of the king and of madame de montespan she printed those works of her eldest pupil  these ladies were only bibliophiles by accident and were devoted in the first place to pleasure piety or ambition  with the comtesse de verrue whose epitaph will be found on an earlier page we come to a genuine and even fanatical collector  madame de verrue 16701736 got every kind of diversion out of life and when she ceased to be young and fair she turned to the joys of shopping in early years pleine de coeur elle le donna sans comptes  in later life she purchased or obtained on credit everything that caught her fancy also sans comptes  my aunt says the duc de luynes was always buying and never baulked her fancy  pictures books coins jewels engravings gems over 8000 tapestries and furniture were all alike precious to madame de verrue  her snuff boxes defied computation she had them in gold in tortoiseshell in porcelain in lacquer and in jasper and she enjoyed the delicate fragrance of sixty different sorts of snuff  without applauding the smoking of cigarettes in drawingrooms we may admit that it is less repulsive than steady applications to tobacco in madame de verrues favourite manner  the countess had a noble library for old tastes survived in her commodious heart and new tastes she anticipated  she possessed the romance of the rose and villon in editions of galliot du pre 15291533 undeterred by the satire of boileau  she had examples of the pleiade though they were not again admired in france till 1830  she was also in the most modern fashion of to day for she had the beautiful quarto of la fontaines contes and bouchiers illustrated moliere large paper  and what i envy her more she had perraults fairy tales in blue moroccothe blue rose of the folklorist who is also a bookhunter  it must also be confessed that madame de verrue had a large number of books such as are usually kept under lock and key books which her heirs did not care to expose at the sale of her library  once i myself moi chetif owned a novel in blue morocco which had been in the collection of madame de verrue  in her old age this exemplary woman invented a peculiarly comfortable armchair which like her novels was covered with citron and violet morocco the nails were of silver  if madame de verrue has met the baroness bernstein their conversation in the elysian fields must be of the most gallant and interesting description  another literary lady of pleasure madame de pompadour can only be spoken of with modified approval  her great fault was that she did not check the decadence of taste and sense in the art of bookbinding  in her time came in the habit of binding books if binding it can be called with flat backs without the nerves and sinews that are of the very essence of bookcovers  without these no binding can be permanent none can secure the lasting existence of a volume  it is very deeply to be deplored that by far the most accomplished living english artist in bookbinding has reverted to this old and most dangerous heresy  the most original and graceful tooling is of much less real value than permanence and a book bound with a flat back without nerfs might practically as well not be bound at all  the practice was the herald of the french and may open the way for the english revolution  of what avail were the ingenious mosaics of derome to stem the tide of change when the books whose sides they adorned were not really bound at all  madame de pompadours books were of all sorts from the inevitable works of devotions to devotions of another sort and the hours of erycina ridens  one of her treasures had singular fortunes a copy of daphnis and chloe with the regents illustrations and those of cochin and eisen paris quarto 1757 red morocco  the covers are adorned with billing and cooing doves with the arrows of eros with burning hearts and sheep and shepherds  eighteen years ago this volume was bought for 10 francs in a village in hungary  a bookseller gave 8 pounds for it in paris  m bauchart paid for it 150 pounds and as it has left his shelves probably he too made no bad bargain  madame de pompadours apology for herodotus la haye 1735
