51824417	personal narrative of a pilgrimage to almadinah  meccah  by  captain sir richard f burton  kcmg frgs c c c  edited by his wife isabel burton  “our notions of mecca must be drawn from the arabians as no unbeliever is permitted to enter the city our travellers are silent”—gibbon chap 50   memorial edition  in two volumes  volume ii  pxii arabic dark and the desert and destriers me ken and the glaive and the joust and paper and pen almutanabbi  part ii  almadinah continued  p1 a pilgrimage  to  almadinah and meccah  chapter xxi  the people of almadinah  almadinah contains but few families descended from the prophet’s auxiliaries i heard only of four whose genealogy is undoubted these were—  1 the bayt alansari or descendants of abu ayyub a most noble race whose tree ramifies through a space of fifteen hundred years they keep the keys of the kuba mosque and are imams in the harim but the family is no longer wealthy or powerful  2 the bayt abu jud they supply the harim with imams and mu’ezzinsfnl i was told that there are now but two surviving members of this family a boy and a girl  3 the bayt alsha’ab a numerous race some of the members travel professionally others trade and others are employed in the harim  4 the bayt alkarrani who are mostly engaged in commerce  there is also a race called alnakhawilahfn2 who  p2according to some are descendants of the ansar whilst others derive them from yazid the son of mu’awiyah the latter opinion is improbable as the caliph in question was a mortal foe to ali’s family which is inordinately venerated by these people as far as i could ascertain they abuse the shaykhayn abu bakr and omar all my informants agreed upon this point but none could tell me why they neglected to bedevil osman the third object of hatred to the shi’ah persuasion they are numerous and warlike yet they are despised by the townspeople because they openly profess heresy and are moreover of humble degree they have their own priests and instructors although subject to the orthodox kazi marry in their own sect are confined to low offices such as slaughtering animals sweeping and gardening and are not allowed to enter the harim during life or to be carried to it after death their corpses are taken down an outer street called the darb aljanazah—road of biers—to their own cemetery near albakia they dress and speak arabic like the townspeople but the arabs pretend to distinguish them by a peculiar look denoting their degradation it is doubtless the mistake of effect for cause about all such  “tribes of the wandering foot and weary breast”  number of reports are current about the horrid  p3customs of these people and their community of womenfn3 with the persian pilgrims who pass through the town it need scarcely be said that such tales coming from the mouths of fanatic foes are not to be credited i regret not having had an opportunity to become intimate with any of the nakhawilah from whom curious information might be elicited orthodox moslems do not like to be questioned about such hateful subjects when i attempted to learn something from one of my acquaintance shaykh ula aldin of a kurd family settled at almadinah a man who had travelled over the east and who spoke five languages to perfection he coldly replied that he had never consorted with these heretics sayyids and sharifsfn4 the descendants of the prophet here abound the benu hosayn of almadinah have their headquarters at suwayrkiyahfn5 the former place contains six or seven families the latter ninetythree or ninetyfour anciently they were much more numerous and such was their power that for centuries they retained charge of the prophet’s tomb they  p4subsist principally upon their amlak property in land for which they have titledeeds extending back to mohammed’s day and aukaf religious bequests popular rumour accuses them of frequent murders for the sake of succession at almadinah they live chiefly at the hosh ibn sa’ad a settlement outside the town and south of the darb aljanazah there is however no objection to their dwelling within the walls and they are taken to the harim after death if there be no evil report against the individual their burialplace is the bakia cemetery the reason of this toleration is that some are supposed to be sunni or orthodox and even the most heretical keep their “rafzfn6” heresy a profound secret most learned arabs believe that they belong like the persians to the sect of ali the truth however is so vaguely known that i could find out none of the peculiarities of their faith till i met a shirazi friend at bombay the benu hosayn are spare dark men of badawi appearance and they dress in the old arab style still affected by the sharifs—a kufiyah kerchief on the headfn7 and a banish a long and widesleeved garment resembling our magicians’ gown thrown over the white cotton kamis shirt in public they always carry swords even when others leave weapons at home there are about two hundred families of sayyid alawiyah—descendants of ali by any of his wives but fatimah they bear no distinctive mark in dress or appearance and are either employed at the  p5temple or engage at trade of the khalifiyah or descendants of abbas there is i am told but one household the bayt alkhalifah who act as imams in the harim and have charge of hamzah’s tomb some declare that there are a few of the siddikiyah or descendants from abu bakr others ignore them and none could give me any information about the benu najjar  the rest of the population of almadinah is a motley race composed of offshoots from every nation in alislam the sanctity of the city attracts strangers who purposing to stay but a short time become residents after finding some employment they marry have families die and are buried there with an eye to the spiritual advantages of the place i was much importuned to stay at almadinah the only known physician was one shaykh abdullah sahib an indian a learned man but of so melancholic a temperament and so ascetic in his habits that his knowledge was entirely lost to the public “why dost thou not” said my friends “hire a shop somewhere near the prophet’s mosque there thou wilt eat bread by thy skill and thy soul will have the blessing of being on holy ground” shaykh nur also opined after a short residence at almadinah that it was bara jannati shahr a “very heavenly city” and little would have induced him to make it his home the present ruling race at almadinah in consequence of political vicissitudes is the “sufatfn8” sons of turkish fathers by arab mothers these halfcastes are now numerous and have managed to secure the highest and most lucrative offices besides turks there are families originally from the maghrib takruris egyptians in considerable numbers settlers from alyaman and other parts of arabia syrians kurds afghans daghistanis from the caucasus and a few jawis—java moslems the sindis i was told reckon about one hundred families who are exceedingly despised for their  p6cowardice and want of manliness whilst the baluch and the afghan are respected the indians are not so numerous in proportion here as at meccah still hindustani is by no means uncommonly heard in the streets they preserve their peculiar costume the women persisting in showing their faces and in wearing tight exceedingly tight pantaloons this together with other reasons secures for them the contempt of the arabs at almadinah they are generally small shopkeepers especially druggists and sellers of kumash cloth and they form a society of their own the terrible cases of misery and starvation which so commonly occur among the improvident indians at jeddah and meccah are here rare  the hanafi school holds the first rank at almadinah as in most parts of alislam although many of the citizens and almost all the badawin are shafe’is the reader will have remarked with astonishment that at one of the fountainheads of the faith there are several races of schismatics the benu hosayn the benu ali and the nakhawilah at the town of safra there are said to be a number of the zuyud schismaticsfn9 who visit almadinah and have settled in force at meccah and some declare that the bayazi sectfn10 also exists  the citizens of almadinah are a favoured race although the city is not like meccah the grand mart of the moslem world or the meetingplace of nations they pay no taxes and reject the idea of a “miri” or landcess with extreme disdain “are we the children of the prophet” they exclaim “to support or to be supported” the wahhabis not understanding the argument taxed them  p7as was their wont in specie and in materials for which reason the very name of those puritans is an abomination as has before been shown all the numerous attendants at the mosque are paid partly by the sultan partly by aukaf the rents of houses and lands bequeathed to the shrine and scattered over every part of the moslem world when a madani is inclined to travel he applies to the mudir alharim and receives from him a paper which entitles him to the receipt of a considerable sum at constantinople “the “ikram” honorarium as it is called varies with the rank of the recipient the citizens being divided into these four orders viz  first and highest the sadat sayyidsfn11 and imams who are entitled to twelve purses or about £60 of these there are said to be three hundred families  the khanahdan who keep open house and receive poor strangers gratis their ikram amounts to eight purses and they number from a hundred to a hundred and fifty families  the ahalifn12 burghers or madani properly speaking who have homes and families and were born in almadinah they claim six purses  the mujawirin strangers as egyptians or indians settled at though not born in almadinah their honorarium is four purses  the madani traveller on arrival at constantinople reports his arrival to his consul the wakil alharamayn this “agent of the two holy places” applies to the nazir alaukaf or “intendant of bequests” the latter  p8after transmitting the demand to the different officers of the treasury sends the money to the wakil who delivers it to the applicant this gift is sometimes squandered in pleasure more often profitably invested either in merchandise or in articles of homeuse presents of dress and jewellery for the women handsome arms especially pistols and balasfn13 yataghans silk tassels amber pipepieces slippers and embroidered purses they are packed up in one or two large sahharahs and then commences the labour of returning home gratis besides the ikram most of the madani when upon these begging trips are received as guests by great men at constantinople the citizens whose turn it is not to travel await the aukaf and sadakat bequests and almsfn14 forwarded every year by the damascus caravan besides which as has been before explained the harim supplies even those not officially employed in it with many perquisites  without these advantages almadinah would soon be abandoned to cultivators and badawin though commerce is here honourable as everywhere in the east business is “slackfn15” because the higher classes prefer the idleness of administering their landed estates and being servants to the mosque i heard of only four respectable houses alisawi alsha’ab abd aljawwad and a family from alshark the eastern regionfn16 they all deal in grain cloth and provisions and perhaps the richest have a capital of twenty thousand dollars caravans in  p9the cold weather are constantly passing between almadinah and egypt but they are rather bodies of visitors to constantinople than traders travelling for gain corn is brought from jeddah by land and imported into yambu’ or via alrais a port on the red sea one day and a half’s journey from safra there is an active provision trade with the neighbouring badawin and the syrian hajj supplies the citizens with apparel and articles of luxury—tobacco dried fruits sweetmeats knives and all that is included under the word “notions” there are few storekeepers and their dealings are petty because articles of every kind are brought from egypt syria and constantinople as a general rule labour is exceedingly expensivefn17 and at the visitation time a man will demand fifteen or twenty piastres from a stranger for such a trifling job as mending an umbrella handicraftsmen and artisans—carpenters masons locksmiths potters and others—are either slaves or foreigners mostly egyptiansfn18 this proceeds partly from the pride of the people they are taught from their childhood that the madani is a favoured being to be respected however vile or schismatic and that the vengeance of allah will fall upon any one who ventures to abuse much more to strike himfn19 they receive a stranger at the shop window with the haughtiness of pashas and take pains to show him by words as well as by looks that they consider themselves as  p10“good gentlemen as the king only not so rich” added to this pride are indolence and the true arab prejudice which even in the present day prevents a badawi from marrying the daughter of an artisan like castilians they consider labour humiliating to any but a slave nor is this as a clever french author remarks by any means an unreasonable idea since heaven to punish man for disobedience caused him to eat daily bread by the sweat of his brow besides there is degradation moral and physical in handiwork compared with the freedom of the desert the loom and the file do not conserve courtesy and chivalry like the sword and spear man “extends his tongue” to use an arab phrase when a cuff and not a stab is to be the consequence of an injurious expression even the ruffian becomes polite in california where his brotherruffian carries his revolver and those european nations who were most polished when every gentleman wore a rapier have become the rudest since civilisation disarmed them  by the tariff quoted below it will be evident that almadinah is not a cheap placefn20 yet the citizens  p11despite their being generally in debt manage to live well their cookery like that of meccah has borrowed something from egypt turkey syria persia and india as all orientals they are exceedingly fond of clarified butterfn21  p12i have seen the boy mohammed drink off nearly a tumblerfull although his friends warned him that it would make him as fat as an elephant when a man cannot enjoy clarified butter in these countries it is considered a sign that his stomach is out of order and all my excuses of a melancholic temperament were required to be in full play to prevent the infliction of fried meat swimming in grease or that guestdishfn22 rice saturated with melted—perhaps i should say—rancid butter the “samn” of alhijaz however is often fresh being brought in by the badawin it has not therefore the foul flavour derived from the old and impregnated skinbag which distinguishes the “ghi” of indiafn23 the house of a madani in good circumstances is comfortable for the building is substantial and the attendance respectable black slavegirls here perform the complicated duties of servantmaids in england they are taught to sew to cook and to wash besides sweeping the house and drawing water for domestic use hasinah the “charmer” a decided misnomer costs from 40 to 50 if she be a mother her value is less but neathandedness propriety of demeanour and skill in feminine accomplishments raise her to 100£25 a little black boy perfect in all his points and tolerably intelligent costs about a thousand piastres girls are dearer and eunuchs fetch double that sum the older the children become the  p13more their value diminishes and no one would purchase save under exceptional circumstances an adult slave because he is never parted with but for some incurable vice the abyssinian mostly galla girls so much prized because their skins are always cool in the hottest weather are here rare they seldom sell for less than £20 and they often fetch £60 i never heard of a jariyah bayza a white slave girl being in the market at almadinah in circassia they fetch from £100 to £400 prime cost and few men in alhijaz could afford so expensive a luxury the bazar at almadinah is poor and as almost all the slaves are brought from meccah by the jallabs or drivers after exporting the best to egypt the town receives only the refusefn24  the personal appearance of the madani makes the stranger wonder how this mongrel population of settlers has acquired a peculiar and almost an arab physiognomy they are remarkably fair the effect of a cold climate sometimes the cheeks are lighted up with red and the hair is a dark chestnut—at almadinah i was not stared at as a white man the cheeks and different parts of the children’s bodies are sometimes marked with mashali or tashrih not the three long stripes of the meccansfn25 but little scars generally in threes in some points they approach very near the true arab type that is to say the badawi of ancient and noble family the cheekbones are high and saillant the eye small more round than long  p14 piercing fiery deepset and brown rather than black the head is small the ears wellcut the face long and oval though not unfrequently disfigured by what is popularly called the “lanternjaw” the forehead high bony broad and slightly retreating and the beard and mustachios scanty consisting of two tufts upon the chin with generally speaking little or no whisker these are the points of resemblance between the city and the country arab the difference is equally remarkable the temperament of the madani is not purely nervous like that of the badawi but admits a large admixture of the bilious and though rarely the lymphatic the cheeks are fuller the jaws project more than in the pure race the lips are more fleshy more sensual and illfitting the features are broader and the limbs are stouter and more bony the beard is a little thicker and the young arabs of the towns are beginning to imitate the turks in that abomination to their ancestors—shaving personal vanity always a ruling passion among orientals and a hopeless wish to emulate the flowing beards of the turks and the persians—perhaps the only nations in the world who ought not to shave the chin—have overruled even the religious objections to such innovation i was more frequently appealed to at almadinah than anywhere else for some means of removing the opprobrium “kusah” or scantbearded man they blacken the beard with gallnuts henna and other preparations especially the egyptian mixture composed of sulphate of iron one part ammoniure of iron one part and gallnuts two parts infused in eight parts of distilled water it is a very bad dye much refinement of dress is now found at almadinah—constantinople the paris of the east supplying it with the newest fashions respectable men wear either a benish or a jubbah the latter as at meccah is generally of some light and flashy colour gamboge yellow tender green or bright pink  p15this is the sign of a “dressy” man if you have a single coat it should be of some modest colour as a dark violet to appear always in the same tender green or bright pink would excite derision but the hijazis poor and rich always prefer these tulip tints the proper badan or long coat without sleeves still worn in truly arab countries is here confined to the lowest classes that ugliest of headdresses the red tunisian cap called “tarbushfn26” is much used only the arabs have too much regard for their eyes and faces to wear it as the turks do without a turband it is with regret that one sees the most graceful headgear imaginable the kufiyah and the aakal proscribed except amongst the sharifs and the badawin the women dress like the men handsomely indoors they wear i am told a sudayriyah or boddice of calico and other stuffs like the choli of india which supports the bosom without the evils of european stays over this is a saub or white shirt of the white stuff called halaili or burunjuk with enormous sleeves and flowing down to the feet the sarwal or pantaloons are not wide like the egyptians’ but rather tight approaching to the indian cut without its exaggerationfn27 abroad they throw over the head a silk or a cotton milayah generally chequered white and blue the burka faceveil all over alhijaz is white a decided improvement in point of cleanliness upon that of egypt women of all ranks die the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands black and trace thin lines down the inside of the  p16fingers by first applying a plaster of henna and then a mixture called “shadar” of gallnuts alum and lime the hair parted in the centre is plaited into about twenty little twists called jadilahfn28 of ornaments as usual among orientals they have a vast variety ranging from brass and spangles to gold and precious stones and they delight in strong perfumes musk civet ambergris attar of rose oil of jasmine aloewood and extract of cinnamon both sexes wear constantinople slippers the women draw on khuff inner slippers of bright yellow leather serving for socks and covering the ankle with papush of the same material sometimes lined with velvet and embroidered with a gold sprig under the hollow of the foot in mourning the men show no difference of dress like good moslems to whom such display of grief is forbidden but the women who cannot dissociate the heart and the toilette evince their sorrow by wearing white clothes and by doffing their ornaments this is a modern custom the accurate burckhardt informs us that in his day the women of almadinah did not wear mourning  the madani generally appear abroad on foot few animals are kept here on account i suppose of the expense of feeding them the cavalry are mounted on poor egyptian nags the horses generally ridden by rich men are generally nijdi costing from 200 to 300 camels are numerous but those bred in alhijaz are small weak and consequently little prized dromedaries of good breed called ahrarfn29 the noble and namani from the place of that name are to be had for any sum between 10 and 400 they are diminutive but exceedingly swift surefooted sagacious thoroughbred with eyes like the  p17antelope’s and muzzles that would almost enter a tumbler mules are not found at almadinah although popular prejudice does not now forbid the people to mount them asses come from egypt and meccah i am told that some good animals are to be found in the town and that certain ignoble badawi clans have a fine breed but i never saw any of beasts intended for food the sheep is the only common one in this part of alhijaz there are three distinct breeds the larger animal comes from nijd and the anizah badawin who drive a flourishing trade the smaller is a native of the country both are the common arab species of a tawny colour with a long fat tail occasionally one meets with what at aden is called the berberah sheep a totally different beast—white with a black broad face a dewlap and a short fat tail that looks as if twisted up into a knot it was doubtless introduced by the persians cows are rare at almadinah beef throughout the east is considered an unwholesome food and the badawi will not drink cow’s milk preferring that of the camel the ewe and the goat the flesh of the latter animal is scarcely ever eaten in the city except by the poorest classes  the manners of the madani are graver and somewhat more pompous than those of any arabs with whom i ever mixed this they appear to have borrowed from their rulers the turks but their austerity and ceremoniousness are skindeep in intimacy or in anger the garb of politeness is thrown off and the screaming arab voice the voluble copious and emphatic abuse and the mania for gesticulation return in all their deformity they are great talkers as the following little trait shows when a man is opposed to more than his match in disputing or bargaining instead of patiently saying to himself s’il crache il est mort he interrupts the adversary with a sall’ ala mohammed—bless the prophet every good moslem is obliged to obey such requisition by responding allahumma  p18 salli alayh—o allah bless him but the madani curtails the phrase to “a’nfn30” supposing it to be an equivalent and proceeds in his loquacity then perhaps the baffled opponent will shout out wahhid ie “attest the unity of the deity” when instead of employing the usual religious phrases to assert that dogma he will briefly ejaculate “al” and hurry on with the course of conversation as it may be supposed these wars of words frequently end in violent quarrels for to do the madani justice they are always ready to fight the desperate old feud between the “juwwa” and the “barra”—the town and the suburbs—has been put down with the greatest difficulty the boys indeed still keep it up turning out in bodies and making determined onslaughts with sticks and stonesfn31  it is not to be believed that in a town garrisoned by turkish troops full of travelled traders and which supports itself by plundering hajis the primitive virtues of the arab could exist the meccans a dark people say of the madani that their hearts are black as their skins are whitefn32 this is of course exaggerated but it is not too  p19 much to assert that pride pugnacity a peculiar point of honour and a vindictiveness of wonderful force and patience are the only characteristic traits of arab character which the citizens of almadinah habitually display here you meet with scant remains of the chivalry of the desert a man will abuse his guest even though he will not dine without him and would protect him bravely against an enemy and words often pass lightly between individuals which suffice to cause a blood feud amongst badawin the outward appearance of decorum is conspicuous amongst the madani there are no places where corinthians dwell as at meccah cairo and jeddah adultery if detected would be punished by lapidation according to the rigour of the koranic lawfn33 and simple immorality by religious stripes or if of repeated occurrence by expulsion from the city but scandals seldom occur and the women i am told behave with great decencyfn34 abroad they have the usual moslem  p20pleasures of marriage lyingsin circumcision feasts holy isitations and funerals at home they employ themselves with domestic matters and especially in scolding “hasinah” and “za’afaran” in this occupation they surpass even the notable english housekeeper of the middle orders of society—the latter being confined to “knagging” at her slavey whereas the arab lady is allowed an unbounded extent of vocabulary at shaykh hamid’s house however i cannot accuse the women of  “swearing into strong shudders the immortal gods who heard them”  they abused the black girls with unction but without any violent expletives at meccah however the old lady in whose house i was living would when excited by the melancholy temperament of her eldest son and his irregular hours of eating scold him in the grossest terms not unfrequently ridiculous in the extreme for instance one of her assertions was that he—the son—was the offspring of an immoral mother which assertion one might suppose reflected not indirectly upon herself so in egypt i have frequently heard a father when reproving his boy address him by “o dog son of a dog” and “o spawn of an infidel—of a jew—of a christian” amongst the men of almadinah i remarked a considerable share of hypocrisy their mouths were as full of religious salutations exclamations and hackneyed quotations from the koran as of indecency and vile abuse—a point in which they resemble the persians as before  p21 observed they preserve their reputation as the sons of a holy city by praying only in public at constantinople they are by no means remarkable for sobriety intoxicating liquors especially araki are made in almadinah only by the turks the citizens seldom indulge in this way at home as detection by smell is imminent among a people of waterbibbers during the whole time of my stay i had to content myself with a single bottle of cognac coloured and scented to resemble medicine the madani are like the meccans a curious mixture of generosity and meanness of profuseness and penuriousness but the former quality is the result of ostentation the latter is a characteristic of the semitic race long ago made familiar to europe by the jew the citizens will run deeply in debt expecting a good season of devotees to pay off their liabilities or relying upon the next begging trip to turkey and such a proceeding contrary to the custom of the moslem world is not condemned by public opinion above all their qualities personal conceit is remarkable they show it in their strut in their looks and almost in every word “i am such an one the son of such an one” is a common expletive especially in times of danger and this spirit is not wholly to be condemned as it certainly acts as an incentive to gallant actions but it often excites them to vie with one another in expensive entertainments and similar vanities the expression so offensive to english ears inshallah bukra—please god tomorrow—always said about what should be done today is here common as in egypt or in india this procrastination belongs more or less to all orientals but arabia especially abounds in the tawakkal al’ allah ya shaykh—place thy reliance upon allah o shaykh—enjoined when a man should depend upon his own exertions upon the whole however though alive to the infirmities of the madani character i thought favourably of it finding among this people more of the redeeming point manliness  p22than in most eastern nations with whom i am acquainted  the arabs like the egyptians all marry yet as usual they are hard and facetious upon that illtreated subject—matrimony it has exercised the brain of their wits and sages who have not failed to indite notable things concerning it saith “harikar alhakim” dominie doall to his nephew nadan sir witless whom he would dissuade from taking to himself a wife “marriage is joy for a month and sorrow for a life and the paying of settlements and the breaking of back ie under the load of misery and the listening to a womans tongue” and again we have in verse—  “they said ‘marry’ i replied ‘far be it from me to take to my bosom a sackful of snakes i am free—why then become a slave may allah never bless womankind’”  and the following lines are generally quoted as affording a kind of bird’seye view of female existence—  “from 10 years of age unto 20 a repose to the eyes of beholdersfn35 from 20 unto 30 still fair and full of flesh from 30 unto 40 a mother of many boys and girls from 40 unto 50 an old woman of the deceitful from 50 unto 60 slay her with a knife from 60 unto 70 the curse of allah upon them one and all”  another popular couplet makes a most unsupported assertion—  “they declare womankind to be heaven to man i say ‘allah give me jahannam and not this heaven’”  yet the fair sex has the laugh on its side for these railers at almadinah as at other places invariably marry the  p23marriage ceremony is tedious and expensive it begins with a khitbah or betrothal the father of the young man repairs to the parent or guardian of the girl and at the end of his visit exclaims “the fatihah we beg of your kindness your daughter for our son” should the other be favourable to the proposal his reply is “welcome and congratulation to you but we must perform istikharahfn36 religious lot casting” and when consent is given both pledge themselves to the agreement by reciting the fatihah then commence negotiations about the mahr or sum settled upon the bridefn37 and after the smoothing of this difficulty follow feastings of friends and relatives male and female the marriage itself is called akd alnikah or ziwaj a walimah or banquet is prepared by the father of the aris groom at his own house and the kazi attends to perform the nuptial ceremony the girl’s consent being obtained through her wakil any male relation whom she commissions to act for her then with great pomp and circumstance the aris visits his arusah bride at her father’s house and finally with a zuffah or procession and sundry ceremonies at the harim she is brought to her new home arab funerals are as simple as their marriages are complicated neither naddabah myriologist or hired keener nor indeed any female even a relation is present at burials as in other parts of the moslem worldfn38 and it is esteemed disgraceful  p24for a man to weep aloud the prophet ho doubtless had heard of those pagan mournings where an effeminate and unlimited display of woe was often terminated by licentious excesses like the christian’s halfheathen “wakes” forbad aught beyond a decent demonstration of grief and his strong good sense enabled him to see through the vanity of professional mourners at almadinah the corpse is interred shortly after decease the bier is carried though the streets at a moderate pace by friends and relativesfn39 these bringing up the rear every man who passes lends his shoulder for a minute a mark of respect to the dead and also considered a pious and a prayerful act arrived at the harim they carry the corpse in visitation to the prophet’s window and pray over it at osman’s niche finally it is interred after the usual moslem fashion in the cemetery albakia  almadinah though pillaged by the wahhabis still abounds in books near the harim are two madrasah or colleges the mahmudiyah so called from sultan mahmud and that of bashir agha both have large stores of theological and other works i also heard of extensive private collections particularly of one belonging to the najib alashraf or chief of the sharifs a certain mohammed jamal allayl whose father is wellknown in india besides which there is a large wakf or bequest of books presented to the mosque or entailed upon particular familiesfn40 the celebrated mohammed ibn abdillah alsannusifn41 has removed  p25 his collection amounting it is said to eight thousand volumes from almadinah to his house in jabal kubays at meccah the burialplace of the prophet therefore no longer lies open to the charge of utter ignorance brought against it by my predecessorfn42 the people now praise their olema for learning and boast a superiority in respect of science over meccah yet many students leave the place for damascus and cairo where the riwak alharamayn college of the two shrines in the azhar mosque university is always crowded and though omar effendi boasted to me that his city was full of lore he did not appear the less anxious to attend the lectures of egyptian professors but none of my informants claimed for almadinah any facilities of studying other than the purely religious sciencesfn43 philosophy medicine arithmetic mathematics and algebra cannot be learnt here i was careful to inquire about the occult sciences remembering that paracelsus had travelled in arabia and that the count cagliostro giuseppe balsamo who claimed the meccan sharif as his father asserted that about ad 1765 he had studied alchemy at almadinah the only trace i could find was a superficial knowledge of the magic mirror but after denying the madani the praise of varied learning it must be owned that their quick observation and retentive memories have stored up for  p26them an abundance of superficial knowledge culled from conversations in the market and in the camp i found it impossible here to display those feats which in sind southern persia eastern arabia and many parts of india would be looked upon as miraculous most probably one of the company had witnessed the performance of some italian conjuror at constantinople or alexandria and retained a lively recollection of every manœuvre as linguists they are not equal to the meccans who surpass all orientals excepting only the armenians the madani seldom know turkish and more rarely still persian and indian those only who have studied in egypt chaunt the koran well the citizens speak and pronouncefn44 their language purely they are not equal to the people of the southern hijaz still their arabic is refreshing after the horrors of cairo and maskat  the classical arabic be it observed in consequence of an extended empire soon split up into various dialects as the latin under similar circumstances separated into the neoroman patois of italy sicily provence and languedoc and though niebuhr has been deservedly  p27censured for comparing the koranic language to latin and the vulgar tongue to italian still there is a great difference between them almost every word having undergone some alteration in addition to the manifold changes and simplifications of grammar and syntax the traveller will hear in every part of arabia that some distant tribe preserves the linguistic purity of its ancestors uses final vowels with the noun and rejects the addition of the pronoun which apocope in the verb now renders necessaryfn45 but i greatly doubt the existence of such a race of philologists in alhijaz however it is considered graceful in an old man especially when conversing publicly to lean towards classical arabic on the contrary in a youth this would be treated as pedantic affectation and condemned in some such satiric quotation as  “there are two things colder than ice a young old man and an old young man”  fn1 ibn jubayr relates that in his day a descendant of belal the original

doctrine from the persians believing in a transmigration of the soul which gradually purified is at last “orbed into a perfect star” they are scrupulous of caste and will not allow a jew or a frank to touch a piece of their furniture yet they erect guesthouses for infidels in this they resemble the shi’ahs who are far more particular about ceremonial purity than the sunnis they use ablutions before

opinions differ as regards his kiramat saint’s miracles some disciples look upon him as the mahdi the forerunner of the prophet others consider him a clever impostor his peculiar dogma is the superiority of live over dead saints whose tombs are therefore not to be visited—a new doctrine in a maliki abbas pasha loved and respected him and as he refused all presents built him a new zawiyah oratory at bulak and when the egyptian ruler’s mother was at almadinah she called upon him three times it is said before he would receive her his followers and disciples are scattered in numbers about

chapter xvi fn44 the only abnormal sound amongst the consonants heard here and in alhijaz generally is the pronouncing of k arabic a hard g—for instance “gur’an” for “kur’an” a koran and haggi or hakki my right this g however is pronounced deep in the throat and does not resemble the corrupt egyptian pronunciation of the jim j arabic a letter which the copts knew not and which their modern descendants cannot articulate in alhijaz the only abnormal sounds amongst the vowels are o for u as khokh a peach and arabic for arabic as ohod for uhud the two short vowels fath and kasr are correctly pronounced the former never becoming a short e as in egypt el for al and yemen for yaman or a short i as in syria “min” for “man” who c these vowels however are differently articulated in every part of the arab world so says st jerome of the hebrew “nec refert atrum salem aut salim nominetur cum vocalibus in medio literis perraro utantur hebraei et pro voluntate lectorum ac varietate

person singular and the second person singular masculine  p28chapter xxii  a visit to the saints’ cemetery  a splendid comet blazing in the western sky had aroused the apprehensions of the madani they all fell to predicting the usual disasters—war famine and pestilence—it being still an article of moslem belief that the dread star foreshows all manner of calamities men discussed the probability of abd almajid’s immediate decease for here as in rome  “when beggars die there are no comets seen the heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes”  and in every strange atmospheric appearance about the time of the hajj the hijazis are accustomed to read tidings of the dreaded rih alasfarfnl  whether the event is attributable to the zu zuwabah—the “lord of the forelock”—or whether it was a case of post hoc ergò propter hoc i would not commit myself by deciding but influenced by some cause or other the hawazim and the hawamid subfamilies of the benuharb began to fight about this time with prodigious fury these tribes are generally at feud and the least provocation fans their smouldering wrath into a flame the hawamid number it is said between three and four thousand fighting men and the hawazim not more than seven hundred the latter however are considered a race of desperadoes who pride themselves upon never retreating  p29and under their fiery shaykhs abbas and abu ali they are a thorn in the sides of their disproportionate foe on the present occasion a hamidahfn2 happened to strike the camel of a hazimi which had trespassed upon which the hazimi smote the hamidah and called him a rough name the hamidah instantly shot the hazimi the tribes were called out and they fought with asperity for some days during the whole of the afternoon of tuesday the 30th of august the sound of firing amongst the mountains was distinctly heard in the city through the streets parties of badawin sword and matchlock in hand or merely carrying quarterstaves on their shoulders might be seen hurrying along frantic at the chance of missing the fray the townspeople cursed them privily expressing a hope that the whole race of vermin might consume itself and the pilgrims were in no small trepidation fearing the desertion of their camelmen and knowing what a blaze is kindled in this inflammable land by an ounce of gunpowder i afterwards heard that the badawin fought till night and separated after losing on both sides ten men  this quarrel put an end to any lingering possibility of my prosecuting my journey to maskatfn3 as originally intended i had on the way from yambu’ to almadinah privily made a friendship with one mujrim of the benuharb the “sinful” as his name ancient and classical amongst the arabs means understood that i had some motive of secret interest to undertake the perilous journey he could not promise at first to guide me as his beat lay between yambu’ almadinah meccah and jeddah but he offered to make all inquiries about the route and to  p30 bring me the result at noonday a time when the household was asleep he had almost consented at last to travel with me about the end of august in which case i should have slipped out of hamid’s house and started like a badawi towards the indian ocean but when the war commenced mujrim who doubtless wished to stand by his brethren the hawazim began to show signs of recusancy in putting off the day of departure to the end of september at last when pressed he frankly told me that no traveller—nay not a badawi—could leave the city in that direction even as far as historic khaybarfn4 which information i afterwards ascertained to be correct it was impossible to start alone and when in despair i had recourse to shaykh hamid he seemed to think me mad for wishing to wend northwards when all the world was hurrying towards the south my disappointment was bitter at first but consolation soon suggested itself under the most favourable circumstances a badawitrip from almadinah to maskat fifteen or sixteen hundred miles would require at least ten months whereas under pain of losing my commissionfn5 i was ordered to be at bombay before the end of march moreover entering arabia by alhijaz as has before been said i was obliged to leave behind all my instruments except a watch and a pocketcompass so the benefit rendered to geography by my trip would have been scanty still remained  p31 to me the comfort of reflecting that possibly at meccah some opportunity of crossing the peninsula might present itself at any rate i had the certainty of seeing the strange wild country of the hijaz and of being present at the ceremonies of the holy city i must request the reader to bear with a visitation once more we shall conclude it with a ride to albakiafn6 this venerable spot is frequented by the pious every day after the prayer at the prophet’s tomb and especially on fridays  our party started one morning—on donkeys as usual for my foot was not yet strong—along the darb aljanazah round the southern wall of the town the locomotion was decidedly slow principally in consequence of the tentropes which the hajis had pinned down literally all over the plain and falls were by no means unfrequent at last we arrived at the end of the darb where i committed myself by mistaking the decaying place of those miserable schismatics the nakhawilahfn7 for albakia the glorious cemetery of the saints hamid corrected my blunder with tartness to which i replied as tartly that in our country—afghanistan—we burned the body of every heretic upon whom we could lay our hands this truly islamitic custom was heard with general applause and as the little dispute ended we stood at the open gate of albakia then having dismounted i sat down on a low dakkah or stone bench within the walls to obtain a general view and to prepare for the most fatiguing of the visitations  there is a tradition that seventy thousand or according to others a hundred thousand saints all with faces like full moons shall cleave on the last day the yawning bosom  p32 of albakiafn8 about ten thousand of the ashab companions of the prophet and innumerable sadat are here buried their graves are forgotten because in the olden time tombstones were not placed over the last restingplaces of mankind the first of flesh who shall arise is mohammed the second abu bakr the third omar then the people of albakia amongst whom is osman the fourth caliph and then the incolae of the jannat alma’ala the meccan cemetery the hadis “whoever dies at the two harims shall rise with the sure on the day of judgment” has made these spots priceless in value and even upon earth they might be made a mine of wealth like the catacombs at rome albakia is literally full of the odour of sanctity and a single item of the great aggregate here would render any other moslem town famous it is a pity that this people refuses to exhume its relics  the first person buried in albakia was osman bin maz’un the first of the muhajirs who died at almadinah in the month of sha’aban ah 3 the prophet kissed the forehead of the corpse and ordered it to be interred within sight of his abodefn9 in those days the field was covered with the tree gharkad the vegetation was cut down the ground was levelled and osman was placed in the centre of the new cemetery with his own hands mohammed planted two large upright stones at the head and the feet of his faithful followerfn10 and in process of time a dome covered the spot ibrahim the prophet’s infant second  p33 son was laid by osman’s side after which albakia became a celebrated cemetery  the burialplace of the saints is an irregular oblong surrounded by walls which are connected with the suburb at their southwest angle the darb aljanazah separates it from the enceinte of the town and the eastern desert road beginning from the bab aljumah bounds it on the north around it palm plantations seem to flourish it is small considering the extensive use made of it all that die at almadinah strangers as well as natives except only heretics and schismatics expect to be interred in it it must be choked with corpses which it could never contain did not the moslem style of burial greatly favour rapid decomposition and it has all the inconveniences of “intramural sepulture” the gate is small and ignoble a mere doorway in the wall inside there are no flowerplots no tall trees in fact none of the refinements which lightens the gloom of a christian burialplace the buildings are simple they might even be called mean almost all are the common arab mosque cleanly whitewashed and looking quite new the ancient monuments were levelled to the ground by sa’ad the wahhabi and his puritan followers who waged pitiless warfare against what must have appeared to them magnificent mausolea deeming as they did a loose heap of stones sufficient for a grave in burckhardt’s time the whole place was a “confused accumulation of heaps of earth wide pits and rubbish without a singular regular tombstone” the present erections owe their existence i was told to the liberality of the sultans abd alhamid and mahmud  a poor pilgrim has lately started on his last journey and his corpse unattended by friends or mourners is carried upon the shoulders of hired buriers into the cemetery suddenly they stay their rapid steps and throw the body upon the ground there is a lifelike pliability  p34 about it as it falls and the tight cerements so define the outlines that the action makes me shudder it looks almost as if the dead were conscious of what is about to occur they have forgotten their tools one man starts to fetch them and three sit down to smoke after a time a shallow grave is hastily scooped outfn11 the corpse is packed in it with such unseemly haste that earth touches it in all directions—cruel carelessness among moslems who believe this to torture the sentient framefn12 one comfort suggests itself the poor man being a pilgrim has died “shahid”—in martyrdom ere long his spirit shall leave albakia  “and he on honeydew shall feed and drink the milk of paradise”  i entered the holy cemetery right foot forwards as if it were a mosque and barefooted to avoid suspicion of being a heretic for though the citizens wear their shoes in the bakia they are much offended at seeing the persians follow their example we began by the general benedictionfn13 “peace be upon ye o people of albakia peace be upon ye o admitted to the presence of the  p35 most high receive ye what ye have been promised peace be upon ye martyrs of albakia one and all we verily if allah please are about to join you o allah pardon us and them and the mercy of god and his blessings” after which we recited the chapter alikhlas and the testification then raised our hands mumbled the fatihah passed our palms down our faces and went on  walking down a rough narrow path which leads from the western to the eastern extremity of albakia we entered the humble mausoleum of the caliph osman—osman “almazlum” or the “illtreated” he is called by some moslems when he was slainfn14 his friends wished to bury him by the prophet in the hujrah and ayishah made no objection to the measure but the people of egypt became violent swore that the corpse should neither be buried nor be prayed over and only permitted it to be removed upon the threat of habibah one of the “mothers of the moslems” and daughter of abu sufiyan to expose her countenance during the night that followed his death osman was carried out by several of his friends to albakia from which however they were driven away and obliged to deposit their burden in a garden eastward of and outside the saints’ cemetery it was called hisn kaukab and was looked upon as an inauspicious place of sepulture till marwan included it in albakia we stood before osman’s monument repeating “peace be upon thee o our lord osman son of affanfn15 peace be upon  p36 thee o caliph of allah’s apostle peace be upon thee o writer of allah’s book peace be upon thee in whose presence the angels are ashamedfn16 peace be upon thee o collector of the koran peace be upon thee o soninlaw of the prophet peace be upon thee o lord of the two lights the two daughters of mohammedfn17 peace be upon thee who fought the battle of the faith allah be satisfied with thee and cause thee to be satisfied and render heaven thy habitation peace be upon thee and the mercy of allah and his blessing and praise be to allah lord of the three worlds” this supplication concluded in the usual manner after which we gave alms and settled with ten piastres the demands of the khadimfn18 who takes charge of the tomb this doubledisbursing process had to be repeated at each station  then moving a few paces to the north we faced eastwards and performed the visitation of abu sa’id alkhazari a sahib or companion of the prophet whose sepulchre lies outside albakia the third place visited was a dome containing the tomb of our lady halimah the badawi wetnurse who took charge of mohammedfn19  p37 she is addressed hus “peace be upon thee o halimah the auspiciousfn20 peace be upon thee who performed thy trust in suckling the best of mankind peace be upon thee o wetnurse of almustafa the chosen peace be upon thee o wetnurse of almujtaba the acceptedfn21 may allah be satisfied with thee and cause thee to be satisfied and render heaven thy house and habitation and verily we have come visiting thee and by means of thee drawing near to allah’s prophet and through him to god the lord of the heavens and the earthsfn22”  after which fronting the north we stood before a low enclosure containing ovals of loose stones disposed side by side these are the martyrs of albakia who received the crown of glory at the hands of almuslimfn23 the general of the archheretic yazidfn24 the prayer here recited differs so little from that addressed to the martyrs of ohod that i will not transcribe it the fifth station is near the centre of the cemetery at the tomb of ibrahim who died to the eternal regret of alislam some say six months old others in his second year he was the son  p38 of mariyah the coptic girl sent as a present to mohammed by jarih the mukaukas or governor of alexandria the prophet with his own hand piled earth upon the grave and sprinkled it with water—a ceremony then first performed—disposed small stones upon it and pronounced the final salutation for which reason many holy men were buried in this part of the cemetery every one being ambitious to lie in ground which has been honored by the apostle’s hands then we visited alnafi maula son of omar generally called imam nafi alkari or the koran chaunter and near him the great doctor imam malik ibn anas a native of almadinah and one of the most dutiful of her sons the eighth station is at the tomb of ukayl bin abi talib brother of alifn25 then we visited the spot where lie interred all the prophet’s wives khadijah who lies at meccah alone excepted mohammed married fifteen wives of whom nine survived him after the “mothers of the moslems” we prayed at the tombs of mohammed’s daughters said to be ten in number  in compliment probably to the hajj the beggars mustered strong that morning at albakia along the walls and at the entrance of each building squatted ancient dames all engaged in anxious contemplation of every approaching face and in pointing to dirty cotton napkins spread upon the ground before them and studded with a few coins gold silver or copper according to the expectations of the proprietress they raised their voices to demand largesse some promised to recite fatihahs and the most audacious seized visitors by the skirts of their  p39 garments fakihs ready to write “ys” or anything else demanded of them covered the little heaps and eminences of the cemetery all begging lustily and looking as though they would murder you when told how beneficent is allah—polite form of declining to be charitable at the doors of the tombs old housewives and some young ones also struggled with you for your slippers as you doffed them and not unfrequently the charge of the pair was divided between two inside when the boys were not loud enough or importunate enough for presents they were urged on by the adults and seniors the relatives of the “khadims” and hangerson unfortunately for me shaykh hamid was renowned for taking charge of wealthy pilgrims the result was that my purse was lightened of three dollars i must add that although at least fifty female voices loudly promised that morning for the sum of ten parahs each to supplicate allah in behalf of my lame foot no perceptible good came of their efforts  before leaving albakia we went to the eleventh station fn26 the kubbat alabbasiyah or dome of abbas originally built by the abbaside caliphs in ah 519 it is a larger and a handsomer building than its fellows and it is situated on the righthand side of the gate as you enter the crowd of beggars at the door testified to its importance they were attracted by the persians who assemble here in force to weep and to pray crossing the threshold with some difficulty i walked round a mass of tombs which occupies the centre of the building leaving but a narrow passage between it and the walls it is railed round and covered over with several “kiswahs” of green cloth worked with white letters it looked like a confused  p40 heap but it might have appeared irregular to me by the reason of the mob around the eastern portion contains the body of alhasan the son of ali and grandson of the prophetfn27 the imam zayn alabidin son of alhosayn and greatgrandson to the prophet the imam mohammed albakir fifth imam son to zayn alabidin and his son the imam a’afar alsadik—all four descendants of the prophet and buried in the same grave with abbas ibn abd almuttalib uncle to mohammed it is almost needless to say that these names are subjects of great controversy almusudi mentions that here was found an inscribed stone declaring it to be the tomb of the lady fatimah of hasan her brother of ali bin hosayn of mohammed bin ali and of ja’afar bin mohammed ibn jubayr describing albakia mentions only two in this tomb abbas and hasan the head of the latter he says in the direction of the former’s feet other authors  p41 relate that in it about the ninth century of the hijrah was found a wooden box covered with freshlooking red felt cloth with bright brass nails and they believe it to have contained the corpse of ali placed here by his own son hasan  standing opposite this mysterious tomb we repeated with difficulty by reason of the persians weeping the following supplication—“peace be upon ye o family of the prophet o lord abbas the free from impurity and uncleanness and father’s brother to the best of men and thou too o lord hasan grandson of the prophet and thou also o lord zayn alabidinfn28 peace be upon ye one and all for verily god hath been pleased to deliver you from all guile and to purify you with all purity the mercy of allah and his blessings be upon ye and verily he is the praised the mighty” after which freeing ourselves from the hands of greedy boys we turned round and faced the southern wall close to which is a tomb attributed to the lady fatimahfn29 i will not repeat the prayer it being the same as that recited in the harim  p42 issuing from the hot and crowded dome we recovered our slippers after much trouble and found that our garments had suffered from the frantic gesticulations of the persians we then walked to the gate of albakia stood facing the cemetery upon an elevated piece of ground and delivered the general benediction  “o allah o allah o allah o full of mercy o abounding in beneficence lord of length of days and prosperity and goodness o thou who when asked grantest and when prayed for aid aidest have mercy upon the companions of thy prophet of the muhajirin and the ansar have mercy upon them one and all  p43 have mercy upon bdullah bin hantal” and so on specifying their names “and make paradise their restingplace their habitation their dwelling and their abode o allah accept our ziyarat and supply our wants and lighten our griefs and restore us to our homes and comfort our fears and disappoint not our hopes and pardon us for on no other do we rely and let us depart in thy faith and after the practice of thy prophet and be thou satisfied with us o allah forgive our past offences and leave us not to our evil natures during the glance of an eye or a lesser time and pardon us and pity us and let us return to our houses and homes safe” ie spiritually and physically “fortunate abstaining from what is unlawful reestablished after our distresses and belonging to the good thy servants upon whom is no fear nor do they know distress repentance o lord repentance o merciful repentance o pitiful repentance before death and pardon after death i beg pardon of allah thanks be to allah praise be to allah amen o lord of the three worlds”  after which issuing from albakiafn30 we advanced  p44 northwards leaving the city gate on the left hand till we came to a small kubbah dome close to the road it is visited as containing the tomb of the prophet’s paternal aunts especially of safiyah daughter of abd almuttalib sister of hamzah and one of the many heroines of early alislam hurrying over our devotions here—for we were tired indeed—we applied to a sakka for water and entered a little coffeehouse near the gate of the town after which we rode home  i have now described at a wearying length i fear the spots visited by every zair at almadinah the guidebooks mention altogether between fifty and fiftyfive mosques and other holy places most of which are now unknown even by name to the citizens the most celebrated of these are the few following which i describe from hearsay about three miles to the northwest of the town close to the wady alakik lies the mosque called alkiblatayn—“the two directions of prayer” some give this title to the masjid altakwa at kubafn31 others assert that the prophet after visiting and eating  p45 at the house of an old woman named umm mabshar went to pray the midday prayer in the mosque of the benu salmah he had performed the prostration with his face towards jerusalem when suddenly warned by revelation he turned southwards and concluded his orisons in that directionfn32 i am told it is a mean dome without inner walls outer enclosures or minaret  the masjid benu zafar some write the word tifr is also called masjid albaghlah—of the shemule—because according to almatari on the ridge of stone to the south of this mosque are the marks where the prophet leaned his arm and where the shemule duldul sent by the mukaukas as a present with mariyah the coptic girl and yafur the donkey placed its hoofs at the mosque was shown a slab upon which the prophet sat hearing recitations from the koran and historians declare that by following his example many women have been blessed with offspringfn33 this mosque is to the east of albakia  the masjid aljumah—of friday—or alanikah—of the sandheaps—is in the valley near kuba where mohammed prayed and preached on the first friday after his flight from meccah fn34  the masjid alfazikh—of dateliquor—is so called because when abu ayyub and others of the ansar were sitting with cups in their hands they heard that intoxicating  p46 draughts were for the future forbidden upon which they poured the liquor upon the ground here the prophet prayed six days whilst he was engaged in warring down the benu nazir jews the mosque derives its other name alshams—of the sun—because being erected on rising ground east of and near kuba it receives the first rays of morning light  to the eastward of the masjid alfazikh lies the masjid alkurayzah erected on a spot where the prophet descended to attack the jewish tribe of that name returning from the battle of the moat wayworn and tired with fighting he here sat down to wash and comb his hair when suddenly appeared to him the archangel gabriel in the figure of a horseman dressed in a corslet and covered with dust “the angels of allah” said the preternatural visitor “are still in arms o prophet and it is allah’s will that thy foot return to the stirrup i go before thee to prepare a victory over the infidels the sons of kurayzah” the legend adds that the dust raised by the angelic host was seen in the streets of almadinah but that mortal eye fell not upon horseman’s form the prophet ordered his followers to sound the battlecall gave his flag to ali—the arab token of appointing a commanderinchief—and for twentyfive days invested the habitations of the enemy this hapless tribe was exterminated sentence of death being passed upon them by sa’ad ibn ma’az an ausi whom they constituted their judge because he belonged to an allied tribe six hundred men were beheaded in the marketplace of almadinah their property was plundered and their wives and children were reduced to slavery  “tantane relligio potuit suadere malorum”  the masjid mashrabat umm ibrahim or mosque of the garden of ibrahim’s mother is a place where mariyah the copt had a garden and became the mother of  p47 ibrahim the prophet’s second sonfn35 it is a small building in what is called the awali or highest part of the almadinah plain to the north of the masjid benu kurayzah and near the eastern harrah or ridgefn36  northwards of albakia is or was a small building called the masjid alijabah—of granting—from the following circumstance one day the prophet stopped to perform his devotions at this place which then belonged to the benu mu’awiyah of the tribe of aus he made a long dua or supplication and then turning to his companions exclaimed “i have asked of allah three favours two hath he vouchsafed to me but the third was refused” those granted were that the moslems might never be destroyed by famine or by deluge the third was that they might not perish by internecine strife  the masjid alfath of victory vulgarly called the “four mosques” is situated in the wady alsayhfn37 which comes from the direction of kuba and about half a mile to the east of “alkiblatayn” the largest is called the masjid alfath or alahzab—of the troops—and is alluded to in the koran here it is said the prophet prayed for three days during the battle of the moat also called the affair “alahzab” the last fought with the infidel kuraysh under abu sufiyan after three days of devotion a cold and violent blast arose with rain  p48 and sleet and discomfited the foe the prophet’s prayer having here been granted it is supposed by ardent moslems that no petition put up at the mosque alahzab is ever neglected by allah the form of supplication is differently quoted by different authors when alshafe’i was in trouble and fear of harun alrashid by the virtue of this formula he escaped all danger i would willingly offer so valuable a prophylactory to my readers only it is of an unmanageable length the doctors of alislam also greatly differ about the spot where the prophet stood on this occasion most of them support the claims of the masjid alfath the most elevated of the four to that distinction below and to the south of the highest ground is the masjid salman alfarsi the persian from whose brain emanated the bright idea of the moat at the mature age of two hundred and fifty some say three hundred and fifty after spending his life in search of a religion from a magus fireworshipperfn38 becoming successively a jew and a nazarene he ended with being a moslem and a companion of mohammed during his eventful career he had been ten times sold into slavery below salman’s mosque is the masjid ali and the smallest building on the south of the hill is called masjid abu bakr all these places owe their existence to alwalid the caliph they were repaired at times by his successors  the masjid alrayah—of the banner—was originally built by alwalid upon a place where the prophet pitched his tent during the war of the moat others call it alzubab after a hill upon which it stands alrayah is separated from the masjid alfath by a rising ground called jabal sula or jabal sawabfn39 the former  p49 being on the eastern whilst the latter lies upon the western declivity of the hill the position of this place is greatly admired as commanding the fairest view of the harim  about a mile and a half southeast of albakia is a dome called kuwwat islam the “strength of alislam” here the apostle planted a dry palmstick which grew up blossomed and bore fruit at once moreover on one occasion when the moslems were unable to perform the pilgrimage mohammed here produced the appearance of a ka’abah an arafat and all the appurtenances of the hajj i must warn my readers not to condemn the founder of alislam for these puerile inventions  the masjid onayn lies south of hamzah’s tomb it is on a hill called jabal alrumat the shooters’ hill and here during the battle of ohod stood the archers of alislam according to some the prince of martyrs here received his deathwound others place that event at the masjid alaskar or the masjid alwadyfn40  besides these fourteen i find the names and nothing but the names of forty mosques the reader loses little by my unwillingness to offer him a detailed list of such appellations as masjid benu abd alashhal masjid benu harisah masjid benu harim masjid alfash masjid alsukiya masjid benu bayazah masjid benu hatmah  “cum multis aliis quæ nunc perscribere longum est”  fn1 the cholera see chapter xviii fn2 the word hawamid is plural of hamidah hawazin of hazimi fn3 anciently there was a caravan from maskat to almadinah my friends could not tell me when the line had been given up but all were agreed that for years they had not seen an oman caravan the pilgrims preferring to enter alhijaz via jeddah fn4 according to abulfeda khaybar is six stations ne of almadinah it is four according to alidrisi but my

i believe to be too far fn5 the parliamentary limit of an officer’s leave from india is five years if he overstay that period he forfeits his commission to me the comfort of reflecting that possibly at meccah some opportunity of crossing the peninsula might present itself at any rate i had the certainty of seeing the strange wild country of the hijaz and of being present at the ceremonies of the holy city i must request the reader to bear with a visitation once more we shall conclude it with a ride to albakiafn6 this venerable spot is frequented by the pious every day after the prayer at the prophet’s tomb and especially on fridays fn6 the name means “the place of many roots” it is also called bakia algharkad—the place of many roots of the tree rhamnus gharkad is translated in different ways some term it the lote others the tree of the jews forskal sub voce fn7 see chapter xxi ante fn8 the same is said of the makbarah benu salmah or salim a cemetery to the west of almadinah below rising ground called jabal sula it has long ago been deserted see chapter xiv fn9 in those days almadinah had no walls and was clear of houses on the east of the harim fn10 these stones were removed by almarwan who determined that osman’s grave should not be distinguished from his fellows for this act the lieutenant of mu’awiyah was reproved and blamed by pious moslems fn11 it ought to be high enough for the tenant to sit upright when answering the interrogatory angels fn12 because of this superstition in every part of alislam some contrivance is made to prevent the earth pressing upon the body fn13 this blessing is in mohammed’s words as the beauty of the arabic shows ayishah relates that in the month safar ah 11 one night the prophet who was beginning to suffer from the headache which caused his death arose from his couch and walked out into the darkness whereupon she followed him in a fit of jealousy thinking he might be about to visit some other wife he went to albakia delivered the above benediction which others give somewhat differently raised his hands three times and turned to go home ayishah hurried back but she could not conceal her agitation from her husband who asked her what she had done upon her confessing her suspicions he sternly informed her that he had gone forth by order of the archangel gabriel to bless and to intercede for the people of albakia some authors relate a more facetious termination of the colloquy—mc de perceval essai c vol iii p 314 fn14 “limping osman” as the persians contemptuously call him was slain by rebels and therefore became a martyr according to the sunnis the shi’ahs justify the murder saying it was the act of an “ijma almuslimin” or the general consensus of alislam which in their opinion ratifies an act of “lynch law” fn15 this specifying the father affan proves him to have been a moslem abu bakr’s father “kahafah” and omar’s “alkhattab” are not mentioned by name in the ceremonies of visitation fn16 the christian reader must remember that the moslems rank angelic nature under certain conditions below human nature fn17 osman married two daughters of the prophet a circumstance which the sunnis quote as honourable to him the shi’ahs on the contrary declare that he killed them both by illtreatment fn18 these men are generally descendants of the saint whose tomb they own they receive pensions from the mudir of the mosque and retain all fees presented to them by visitors some families are respectably supported in this way fn19 this woman according to some accounts also saved mohammed’s life when an arab kahin or diviner foreseeing that the child was destined to subvert the national faith urged the bystanders to bury their swords in his bosom the sharifs of meccah still entrust their children to the badawin that they may be hardened by the discipline of the desert and the late pasha of egypt gave one of his sons in charge of the anizah tribe near akabah burckhardt travels in arabia vol i p 427 makes some sensible remarks about this custom which cannot be too much praised fn20 al “sadiyah” a double entendre it means auspicious and also alludes to halimah’s tribe the benu sa’ad fn21 both these words are titles of the prophet almustafa means the “chosen” almujtaba the “accepted” fn22 there being according to the moslems many heavens and many earths fn23 see chapter xx fn24 the shafe’i school allows its disciples to curse alyazid the son of mu’awiyah whose cruelties to the descendants of the prophet and crimes and vices have made him the judas iscariot of alislam i have heard hanafi moslems especially sayyids revile him but this is not strictly speaking correct the shi’ahs of course place no limits to their abuse of him you first call a man “omar” then “shimr” the slayer of alhosayn and lastly “yazid” beyond which insult does not extend fn25 ukayl or akil as many write the name died at damascus during the caliphate of almu’awiyah some say he was buried there others that his corpse was transplanted to almadinah and buried in a place where formerly his house known as “dar ukayl” stood fn26 some are of opinion that the ceremonies of ziyarat formerly did and still should begin here but the order of visitation differs infinitely and no two authors seem to agree i was led by shaykh hamid and indulged in no scruples fn27 burckhardt makes a series of mistakes upon this subject “hassan ibn aly whose trunk only lies buried here in el bakia his head having been sent to cairo where it is preserved in the fine mosque called elhassanya” the mosque alhasanayn the “two hasans” is supposed to contain only the head of alhosayn which when the crusaders took ascalon was brought from thence by sultan salih or beybars and conveyed to cairo as i have said before the persians in egypt openly show their contempt of this tradition it must be remembered that alhasan died poisoned at almadinah by his wife ja’adah alhosayn on the other hand was slain and decapitated at kerbela according to the shi’ahs zayn alabidin obtained from yazid after a space of forty days his father’s head and carried it back to kerbela for which reason the event is known to the persians as “chilleyeh sar o tan” the “forty days of separation between the head and trunk” they vehemently deny that the body lies at kerbela and the head at cairo others again declare that alhosayn’s head was sent by yazid to amir bin alas the governor of almadinah and was by him buried near fatimah’s tomb nor are they wanting who declare that after yazid’s death the head was found in his treasury and was shrouded and buried at damascus such is the uncertainty which hangs over the early history of alislam fn28 the names of the fifth and sixth imams mohammed albakia and ja’afar alsadik were omitted by hamid as doubtful whether they are really buried here or not fn29 moslem historians seem to delight in the obscurity which hangs over the lady’s last restingplace as if it were an honour even for the receptacle of her ashes to be concealed from the eyes of men some place her in the harim relying upon this tradition “fatimah feeling about to die rose up joyfully performed the greater ablution dressed herself in pure garments spread a mat upon the floor of her house near the prophet’s tomb lay down fronting the kiblah placed her hand under her cheek and said to her attendant “i am pure and in a pure dress now let no one uncover my body but bury me where i lie” when ali returned he found his wife dead and complied with her last wishes omar bin abd alaziz believed this tradition when he included the room in the mosque and generally in alislam fatimah is supposed to be buried in the harim those who suppose the prophet’s daughter to be buried in albakia rely upon a saying of the imam hasan “if men will not allow me to sleep beside my grandsire place me in albakia by my mother” they give the following account of his death and burial his body was bathed and shrouded by ali and omar salmah others say that asma bint umays the wife of abu bakr was present with fatimah who at her last hour complained of being carried out as was the custom of those days to burial like a man asma promised to make her a covered bier like a bride’s litter of palm sticks in shape like what she had seen in abyssinia whereupon fatimah smiled for the first time after her father’s death and exacted from her a promise to allow no one entrance as long as her corpse was in the house ayishah shortly afterwards knocking at the door was refused admittance by asma the former complained of this to her father and declared that her stepmother had been making a bride’s litter to carry out the corpse abu bakr went to the door and when informed by his wife that all was the result of fatimah’s orders he returned home making no objection the death of the prophet’s daughter was concealed by her own desire from high and low she was buried at night and none accompanied her bier or prayed at her grave except ali and a few relatives the shi’ahs found a charge of irreverence and disrespect against abu bakr for absence on this occasion the third place which claims fatimah’s honoured remains is a small mosque in albakia south of the sepulchre of abbas it was called bayt alhuzn—house of mourning—because here the lady passed the end of her days lamenting the loss of her father her tomb appears to have formerly been shown there now visitors pray and pray only twice—at the harim and in the kubbat alabbasiyah fn30 the other celebrities in albakia are—  fatimah bint as’ad mother of ali she was buried with great religious pomp the prophet shrouded her with his own garment to prevent hell from touching her dug her grave lay down in it that it might never squeeze or be narrow to her assisted in carrying the bier prayed over her and proclaimed her certain of future felicity over her tomb was written “the grave hath not closed upon one like fatimah daughter of as’ad” historians relate that mohammed lay down in only four graves 1 khadijah’s at meccah 2 kasim’s her son by him 3 that of umm ruman ayishah’s mother 4 that of abdullah almazni a friend and companion  abd alrahman bin auf was interred near osman bin maz’un ayishah offered to bury him in her house near the prophet but he replied that he did not wish to narrow her abode and that he had promised to sleep by the side of his friend maz’un i have already alluded to the belief that none has been able to occupy the spare place in the hujrah  ibn hufazah alsahmi who was one of the ashab alhijratayn who had accompanied both flights the greater and the lesser here died of a wound received at ohod and was buried in shawwal ah 3 one month after osman bin maz’un  abdullah bin mas’ud who according to others is buried at kufah  sa’ad ibn zararah interred near osman bin maz’un  sa’ad bin ma’az who was buried by the prophet he died of a wound received during the battle of the moat  abd alrahman alausat son of omar the caliph he was generally known as abu shahmah the “father of fat” he sickened and died after receiving from his father the religious flogging—impudicitiae causa  abu sufiyan bin alharis grandson of abd almuttalib he was buried near abdullah bin ja’afar altayyar popularly known as the “most generous of the arabs” and near ukayl bin abi talib the brother of ali mentioned above  these are the principal names mentioned by popular authors the curious reader will find in old histories a multitude of others whose graves are now utterly forgotten at almadinah fn31 see chapter xix fn32 the story is related in another way whilst mohammed was praying the asr or afternoon prayer at the harim he turned his face towards meccah some of the companions ran instantly to all the mosques informing the people of the change in many places they were not listened to but the benu salmah who were at prayer instantly faced southwards to commemorate their obedience the mosque was called alkiblatayn fn33 i cannot say whether this valuable stone be still at the mosque benu tifr but i perfectly remember that my friend larking had a mutilated sphynx in his garden at alexandria which was found equally efficacious fn34 see chapter xvii fn35 mohammed’s eldest son was kasim who died in his infancy and was buried at meccah hence the prophet’s pædonymic abu kasim the sire of kasim fb36 ayishah used to relate that she was exceedingly jealous of the coptic girl’s beauty and of the prophet’s love for her mohammed seeing this removed mariyah from the house of harisat bin alnuman in which he had placed her to the awali of almadinah where the mosque now is oriental authors use this term “awali” highgrounds to denote the plains to the eastward and southward of the city opposed to alsafilah the lower ground on the w and nw fn37 i am very doubtful about this location of the masjid alfath fn38 a magus a magician one supposed to worship fire the other rival sect of the time was the sabœan who adored the heavenly bodies fn39 the mosque of “reward in heaven” it is so called because during the war of the moat the prophet used to live in a cave there and afterwards he made it a frequent resort for prayer fn40 hamzah’s fall is now placed at the kubbat almasra see chapter xx  p50chapter xxiii  the damascus caravan  the damascus caravan was to set out on the 27th zu’l ka’adah 1st september i had intended to stay at almadinah till the last moment and to accompany the kafilat altayyarah or the “flying caravan” which usually leaves on the 2nd zu’l hijjah two days after that of damascus  suddenly arose the rumour that there would be no tayyarahfnl and that all pilgrims must proceed with the damascus caravan or await the rakb this is a dromedary caravan in which each person carries only his saddlebags it usually descends by the road called alkhabt and makes meccah on the fifth day the sharif zayd sa’ad the robber’s only friend had paid him an unsuccessful visit schinderhans demanded back his shaykhship in return for a safeconduct through his country “otherwise” said he “i will cut the throat of every hen that ventures into the passes”  the sharif zayd returned to almadinah on the 25th zu’l ka’adah 30th august early on the morning of the next day shaykh hamid returned hurriedly from the bazar exclaiming “you must make ready at once effendi—there will be no tayyarah—all hajis start tomorrow—allah will make it easy to you—have you  p51 your waterskins in order—you are to travel down the darb alsharki where you will not see water for three days”  poor hamid looked horrorstruck as he concluded this fearful announcement which filled me with joy burckhardt had visited and had described the darb alsultani the road along the coast but no european had as yet travelled down by harun alrashid’s and the lady zubaydah’s celebrated route through the nijd desert  not a moment however was to be lost we expected to start early the next morning the boy mohammed went forth and bought for eighty piastres a shugduf which lasted us throughout the pilgrimage and for fifteen piastres a shibriyah or cot to be occupied by shaykh nur who did not relish sleeping on boxes the youth was employed all day with sleeves tucked up and working like a porter in covering the litter with matting and rugs in mending broken parts and in providing it with large pockets for provisions inside and outside with pouches to contain the gugglets of cooled water  meanwhile shaykh nur and i having inspected the waterskins found that the rats had made considerable rents in two of them there being no workman procurable at this time for gold i sat down to patch the damaged articles whilst nur was sent to lay in supplies for fourteen days the journey is calculated at eleven days but provisions are apt to spoil and the badawi camelmen expect to be fed besides which pilferers abound by my companion’s advice i took wheatflour rice turmeric onions dates unleavened bread of two kinds cheese limes tobacco sugar tea and coffee  hamid himself started upon the most important part of our business faithful camelmen are required upon a road where robberies are frequent and stabbings occasional and where there is no law to prevent desertion or to limit new and exorbitant demands after a time he  p52 returned accompanied by a boy and a badawi a short thin wellbuilt old man with regular features a white beard and a cool clear eye his limbs as usual were scarred with wounds mas’ud of the rahlah a subfamily of the hamidah family of the benuharb came in with a dignified demeanour applied his dexter palm to oursfn2 sat down declined a pipe accepted coffee and after drinking it looked at us to show that he was ready for negotiation we opened the proceedings with “we want men and not camels” and the conversation proceeded in the purest hijazifn3 after much discussion we agreed if compelled to travel by the darb alsharki to pay twenty dollars for two camelsfn4 and to advance arbun or earnestmoney to half that amountfn5 the shaykh bound himself to provide us with good animals which moreover were to be changed in case of accidents he was also to supply his beasts with water and to accompany us to arafat and back but absolutely refusing to carry my large chest he declared that the tent under the shugduf was burden enough for one camel and that the green box of drugs the saddlebags and the provisionsacks surmounted by nur’s cot were amply sufficient for the other on our part we bound ourselves to feed the  p53 shaykh and his son supplying them either with raw or with cooked provender and upon our return to meccah from mount arafat to pay the remaining hire with a discretionary present  hamid then addressed to me flowery praises of the old badawi after which turning to the latter he exclaimed “thou wilt treat these friends well o mas’ud the harbi” the ancient replied with a dignity that had no pomposity in it—“even as abu shawarib—the father of mustachiosfn6—behaveth to us so will we behave to him” he then arose bade us be prepared when the departuregun sounded saluted us and stalked out of the room followed by his son who under pretext of dozing had mentally made an inventory of every article in the room ourselves especially included  when the badawin disappeared shaykh hamid shook his head advising me to give them plenty to eat and never to allow twentyfour hours to elapse without dipping hand in the same dish with them in order that the party might always be “malihin”—on terms of saltfn7 he concluded  p54 with a copious lecture upon the villainy of badawin and on their habit of drinking travellers’ water i was to place the skins on a camel in front and not behind to hang them with their mouths carefully tied and turned upwards contrary to the general practice always to keep a good store of liquid and at night to place it under the safeguard of the tent  in the afternoon omar effendi and others dropped in to take leave they found me in the midst of preparations sewing sacks fitting up a pipe patching waterbags and packing medicines my fellowtraveller had brought me some pencilsfn8 and a penknife as “forgetmenots” for we were by no means sure of meeting again he hinted however at another escape from the paternal abode and proposed if possible to join the dromedarycaravan shaykh hamid said the same but i saw by the expression of his face that his mother and wife would not give him leave from home so soon after his return  towards eveningtime the barr almanakhah became a scene of exceeding confusion the town of tents lay upon the ground camels were being laden and were roaring under the weight of litters and cots boxes and baggage horses and mules galloped about men were rushing wildly in all directions on worldly errands or hurrying to pay a farewell visit to the prophet’s tomb women and children sat screaming on the ground or ran to and fro distracted or called their vehicles to escape the danger of being crushed every now and then a random shot excited all into the belief that the departuregun had sounded at times we heard a volley from the robbers’ hills which elicited a general groan for the pilgrims were still to use their own phrase “between fear  p55 and hope” and consequently still far from “one of the two comfortsfn9” then would sound the loud “jhinjhin” of the camels’ bells as the stately animals paced away with some grandee’s gilt and emblazoned litter the sharp plaint of the dromedary and the loud neighing of excited steeds  about an hour after sunset all our preparations were concluded save only the shugduf at which the boy mohammed still worked with untiring zeal he wisely remembered that he had to spend in it the best portion of a week and a half the evening was hot we therefore dined outside the house i was told to repair to the harim for the ziyarat alwida’a or the “farewell visitation” but my decided objection to this step was that we were all to part—how soon—and when to meet again we knew not my companions smiled consent assuring me that the ceremony could be performed as well at a distance as in the temple  then shaykh hamid made me pray a twobow prayer and afterwards facing towards the harim to recite this supplication with raised hands  “o apostle of allah we beg thee to entreat almighty allah that he cut off no portion of the good resulting to us from this visit to thee and to thy harim may he cause us to return safe and prosperous to our birthplaces aid then us in the progeny he hath given us and continue to us his benefits and make us thankful for our daily bread o allah let not this be the last of our visitations to thy apostles tomb yet if thou summon us before such blessing verily in my death i bear witness as in my life” here the forefinger of the right hand is extended that the members of the body may take part with the tongue and the heart “that there  p56 is no god but allah one and without partner and verily that our lord mohammed is his servant and his apostle o allah grant us in this world weal and in the future weal and save us from the torments of hellfire praise to thee o lord lord of glory greater than man can describe and peace be upon the apostle and laud to allah the lord of the three worlds” this concludes as usual with the testification and the fatihah pious men on such an occasion go to the rauzah where they strive if possible to shed a tear—a single drop being a sign of acceptance—give alms to the utmost of their ability vow piety repentance and obedience and retire overwhelmed with grief at separating themselves from their prophet and intercessor it is customary too before leaving almadinah to pass at least one night in vigils at the harim and for learned men to read through the koran once before the tomb  then began the uncomfortable process of paying off little bills the eastern creditor always for divers reasons waits the last moment before he claims his debt shaykh hamid had frequently hinted at his difficulties the only means of escape from which he said was to rely upon allah he had treated me so hospitably that i could not take back any part of the £5 lent to him at suez his three brothers received a dollar or two each and one or two of his cousins hinted to some effect that such a proceeding would meet with their approbation  the luggage was then carried down and disposed in packs upon the ground before the house so as to be ready for loading at a moment’s notice many flying parties of travellers had almost started on the high road and late in the evening came a new report that the body of the caravan would march about midnight we sat up till about two am when having heard no gun and having seen no camels we lay down to sleep through the sultry remnant of the hours of darkness  p57thus gentle reader was spent my last night at almadinah  i had reason to congratulate myself upon having passed through the first danger meccah is so near the coast that in case of detection the traveller might escape in a few hours to jeddah where he would find an english viceconsul protection from the turkish authorities and possibly a british cruiser in the harbour but at almadinah discovery would entail more serious consequences the next risk to be run was the journey between the two cities where it would be easy for the local officials quietly to dispose of a suspected person by giving a dollar to a badawi  fn1 the “tayyarah” or “flying caravan” is lightly laden and travels by forced marches fn2 this “musafahah” as it is called is the arab fashion of shaking hands they apply the palms of the right hands flat to each other without squeezing the fingers and then raise the hand to the forehead fn3 on this occasion i heard three new words “kharitah” used to signify a single trip to meccah without return to almadinah “ta’arifah” going out from meccah to mount arafat and “tanzilah” return from mount arafat to meccah fn4 and part of an extra animal which was to carry water for the party had we travelled by the darb alsultani we should have paid 6½ dollars instead of 10 for each beast fn5 the system of advances as well as earnest money is common all over arabia in some places aden for instance i have heard of twothirds the price of a cargo of coffee being required from the purchaser before the seller would undertake to furnish a single bale fn6 most men of the shafe’i school clip their mustachios exceedingly short some clean shave the upper lip the imperial and the parts of the beard about the corners of the mouth and the forepart of the cheeks i neglected so to do which soon won for me the epithet recorded above arabs are vastly given to “nicknaming god’s creatures” their habit is the effect of acute observation and the want of variety in proper names sonnini appears not to like having been called the “father of a nose” but there is nothing disrespectful in these personal allusions in arabia you must be “father” of something and it is better to be father of a feature than father of a cooking pot or father of a strong smell “abuzirt” fn7 salt among the hindus is considered the essence and preserver of the seas it was therefore used in their offerings to the gods the old idea in europe was that salt is a body composed of various elements into which it cannot be resolved by human means hence it became the type of an indissoluble tie between individuals homer calls salt sacred and divine and whoever ate it with a stranger was supposed to become his friend by the greek authors as by the arabs hospitality and salt are words expressing a kindred idea when describing the badawin of alhijaz i shall have occasion to notice their peculiar notions of the saltlaw fn8 the import of such articles shows the march of progress in alhijaz during the last generation schoolmasters used for pencils bits of bar lead beaten to a point fn9 the “two comforts” are success and despair the latter according to the arabs being a more enviable state of feeling than doubt or hope deferred  p58chapter xxiv  from almadinah to alsuwayrkiyah  four roads lead from almadinah to meccah the “darb alsultani” or “sultan’s highway” follows the line of coast this general passage has been minutely described by my exact predecessor the “tarik alghabir” a mountain path is avoided by the mahmil and the great caravans on account of its rugged passes water abounds along the whole line but there is not a single village and the sobh badawin who own the soil are inveterate plunderers the route called “wady alkura” is a favourite with dromedary caravans on this road are two or three small settlements regular wells and free passage through the benu amr tribe the darb alsharki or “eastern road” down which i travelled owes its existence to the piety of the lady zubaydah wife of harun alrashid that munificent princess dug wells from baghdad to almadinah and built we are told a wall to direct pilgrims over the shifting sandsfn1 there is a fifth road or rather mountain path concerning which i can give no information  at eight am on wednesday the 26th zu’l ka’adah  p59 31st august 1853 as we were sitting at the window of hamid’s house after our early meal suddenly appeared in hottest haste mas’ud our camelshaykh he was accompanied by his son a bold boy about fourteen years of age who fought sturdily about the weight of each package as it was thrown over the camel’s back and his nephew an ugly pockmarked lad too lazy even to quarrel we were ordered to lose no time in loading all started into activity and at nine am i found myself standing opposite the egyptian gate surrounded by my friends who had accompanied me thus far on foot to take leave with due honour after affectionate embraces and parting mementoes we mounted the boy mohammed and i in the litter and shaykh nur in his cot then in company with some turks and meccans for mas’ud owned a string of nine camels we passed through the little gate near the castle and shaped our course towards the north on our right lay the palmgroves which conceal this part of the city far to the left rose the domes of hamzah’s mosques at the foot of mount ohod and in front a band of road crowded with motley groups stretched over a barren stony plain  after an hour’s slow march bending gradually from north to northeast we fell into the nijd highway and came to a place of renown called alghadir or the basinfn2 this is a depression conducting the drainage of the plain towards the northern hills the skirts of ohod still limited the prospect to the left on the right was the bir rashid well of rashid and the little whitewashed dome of ali alurays a descendant from zayn alabidin—the tomb is still a place of visitation there we halted and turned to take farewell of the holy city all the  p60 pilgrims dismounted and gazed at the venerable minarets and the green dome—spots upon which their memories would for ever dwell with a fond and yearning interest  remounting at noon we crossed a fiumara which runs according to my camelshaykh from north to south we were therefore emerging from the madinah basin the sky began to be clouded and although the air was still full of samum cold draughts occasionally poured down from the hills arabs fear this  “bitter change of fierce extremes extremes by change more fierce”  and call that a dangerous climate which is cold in the hot season and hot in the cold travelling over a rough and stony path dotted with thorny acacias we arrived about two pm at the bed of lava heard of by burckhardtfn3 the  p61 aspect of the country was volcanic abounding in basalts and scoriae more or less porous sand veiled the black bed whose present dimensions by no means equal the descriptions of arabian historians i made diligent enquiries about the existence of active volcanoes in this part of alhijaz and heard of none  at five pm travelling towards the east we entered a bughazfn4 or pass which follows the course of a wide fiumara walled in by steep and barren hills—the portals of a region too wild even for badawin the torrentbed narrowed where the turns were abrupt and the drift of heavy stones with a watermark from six to seven feet  p62 high showed that after rains a violent stream runs from east and southeast to west and northwest the fertilising fluid is close to the surface evidenced by a spare growth of acacia camelgrass and at some angles of the bed by the daum or theban palmfn5 i remarked what was technically called “hufrah” holes dug for water in the sand and the guide assured me that somewhere near there is a spring flowing from the rocks  after the long and sultry afternoon beasts of burden began to sink in numbers the fresh carcases of asses ponies and camels dotted the wayside those that had been allowed to die were abandoned to the foul carrionbirds the rakham vulture and the yellow ukab and all whose throats had been properly cut were surrounded by troops of takruri pilgrims these halfstarved wretches cut steaks from the choice portions and slung them over their shoulders till an opportunity of cooking might arrive i never saw men more destitute they carried wooden bowls which they filled with water by begging their only weapon was a small knife tied in a leathern sheath above the elbow and their costume an old skullcap strips of leather like sandals under the feet and a long dirty shirt or sometimes a mere rag covering the loins some were perfect savages others had been finelooking men broadshouldered thinflanked and longlimbed many were lamed by fatigue and by thorns and looking at most of them i fancied death depicted in their forms and features  after two hours’ slow marching up the fiumara eastwards we saw in front of us a wall of rock and turning abruptly southwards we left the bed and ascended rising ground already it was night an hour however elapsed before we saw at a distance the twinkling fires and heard the watchcries of our camp it was  p63 pitched in a hollow under hills in excellent order the pasha’s pavilion surrounded by his soldiers and guards disposed in tents with sentinels regularly posted protecting the outskirts of the encampment one of our men whom we had sent forward met us on the way and led us to an open place where we unloaded the camels raised our canvas home lighted fires and prepared with supper for a good night’s rest living is simple on such marches the pouches inside and outside the shugduf contain provisions and water with which you supply yourself when inclined at certain hours of the day ambulant vendors offer sherbet lemonade hot coffee and waterpipes admirably preparedfn6 chibuks may be smoked in the litter but few care to do so during the samum the first thing however called for at the haltingplace is the pipe and its delightfully soothing influence followed by a cup of coffee and a “forty winks” upon the sand will awaken an appetite not to be roused by other means how could waterton the traveller abuse a pipe during the nighthalt provisions are cooked rice or kichri a mixture of pulse and rice is eaten with chutnee and limepickle varied occasionally by tough mutton and indigestible goat  we arrived at ja alsharifah at eight pm after a march of about twentytwo milesfn7 this haltingplace is  p64 the rendezvous of caravans it lies 50° southeast of almadinah and belongs rather to nijd than to alhijaz  at three am on thursday sept 1 we started up at the sound of the departuregun struck the tent loaded the camels mounted and found ourselves hurrying through a gloomy pass in the hills to secure a good place in the caravan this is an object of some importance as during the whole journey marching order must not be broken we met with a host of minor accidents camels falling shugdufs bumping against one another and plentiful abuse pertinaciously we hurried on till six am at which hour we emerged from the black pass the large crimson sun rose upon us disclosing through purple mists a hollow of coarse yellow gravel based upon a hard whitish clay about five miles broad by twelve long it collects the waters of the high grounds after rain and distributes the surplus through an exit towards the northwest a gap in the low undulating hills around entering it we dismounted prayed broke our fast and after half an hour’s halt proceeded to cross its breadth the appearance of the caravan was most striking as it threaded its slow way over the smooth surface of the khabt low plainfn8 to judge by the eye the host was composed of at fewest seven thousand souls on foot on horseback in litters or bestriding the splendid camels of syriafn9 there were eight gradations of pilgrims  p65 the lowest hobbled with heavy staves then came the riders of asses of camels and of mules respectable men especially arabs were mounted on dromedaries and the soldiers had horses a led animal was saddled for every grandee ready whenever he might wish to leave his litter women children and invalids of the poorer classes sat upon a “haml musattah”—rugs and cloths spread over the two large boxes which form the camel’s loadfn10 many occupied shibriyahs a few shugdufs and only the wealthy and the noble rode in takhtrawan litters carried by camels or mulesfn11 the morning beams fell brightly upon the glancing arms which surrounded the stripped mahmilfn12 and upon the scarlet and gilt conveyances of the grandees not the least beauty of the spectacle was its wondrous variety of detail no man was dressed like his neighbour no camel was caparisoned no horse was  p66 clothed in uniform as it were and nothing stranger than the contrasts a band of halfnaked takruri marching with the pasha’s equipage and longcapped bearded persians conversing with tarbush’d and shaven turks  the plain even at an early hour reeked with vapours distilled by the fires of the samum about noon however the air became cloudy and nothing of colour remained save that milky white haze dull but glaring withal which is the prevailing daytint in these regions at midday we reached a narrowing of the basin where from both sides “irk” or low hills stretch their last spurs into the plain but after half a mile it again widened to upwards of two miles at two pm friday sept 2 we turned towards the southwest ascended stony ground and found ourselves one hour afterwards in a desolate rocky flat distant about twentyfour miles of unusually winding road from our last station “mahattah ghurabfn13” or the raven’s station lies 10° southwest from ja alsharifah in the irregular masses of hill on the frontier of alhijaz where the highlands of nijd begin   after pitching the tent we prepared to recruit our supply of water for mas’ud warned me that his camels had not drunk for ninety hours and that they would soon sink under the privation the boy mohammed mounting a dromedary set off with the shaykh and many waterbags giving me an opportunity of writing out my journal they did not return home until after nightfall a delay caused by many adventures the wells are in a fiumara as usual about two miles distant from the haltingplace and the soldiers regular as well as irregular occupied the water and exacted hard coin in exchange for it the men are not to blame they would die of starvation but for this resource the boy mohammed had been engaged in several quarrels but after  p67 snapping his pistol at a persian pilgrim’s head he came forth triumphant with two skins of sweetish water for which we paid ten piastres he was in his glory there were many meccans in the caravan among them his elder brother and several friends the sharif zayd had sent he said to ask why he did not travel with his compatriots that evening he drank so copiously of clarified butter and ate dates mashed with flour and other abominations to such an extent that at night he prepared to give up the ghost  we passed a pleasant hour or two before sleeping i began to like the old shaykh mas’ud who seeing it entertained me with his genealogy his battles and his family affairs the rest of the party could not prevent expressing contempt when they heard me putting frequent questions about torrents hills badawin and the directions of places “let the father of moustachios ask and learn” said the old man “he is friendly with the badawinfn14 and knows better than you all” this reproof was intended to be bitter as the poet’s satire—  “all fools have still an itching to deride   and fain would be upon the laughing side”  it called forth however another burst of merriment for the jeerers remembered my nickname to have belonged to that pestilent heretic sa’ud the wahhabi  on saturday the 3rd september the hateful signalgun awoke us at one am in arab travel there is nothing more disagreeable than the sariyah or nightmarch and yet the people are inexorable about it “choose early darkness daljah for your wayfarings” said the prophet “as the calamities of the earth serpents and wild beasts appear not at night” i can scarcely find words to express the weary horrors of the long dark march during which the hapless traveller fuming if a european with disappointment in his hopes of “seeing the country” p68 is compelled to sit upon the back of a creeping camel the daysleep too is a kind of lethargy and it is all but impossible to preserve an appetite during the hours of heat  at halfpast five am after drowsily stumbling through hours of outer gloom we entered a spacious basin at least six miles broad and limited by a circlet of low hill it was overgrown with camelgrass and acacia shittim trees mere vegetable mummies in many places the water had left a mark and here and there the ground was pitted with mudflakes the remains of recently dried pools after an hour’s rapid march we toiled over a rugged ridge composed of broken and detached blocks of basalt and scoriæ fantastically piled together and dotted with thorny trees shaykh mas’ud passed the time in walking to and fro along his line of camels addressing us with a khallikum guddam “to the front of the litter” as we ascended and a khallikum wara “to the rear” during the descent it was wonderful to see the animals stepping from block to block with the sagacity of mountaineers assuring themselves of their forefeet before trusting all their weight to advance not a camel fell either here or on any other ridge they moaned however piteously for the sudden turns of the path puzzled them the ascents were painful the descents were still more so the rocks were sharp deep holes yawned between the blocks and occasionally an acacia caught the shugduf almost overthrowing the hapless bearer by the suddenness and the tenacity of its clutch this passage took place during daylight but we had many at night which i shall neither forget nor describe  descending the ridge we entered another hillencircled basin of gravel and clay in many places basalt in piles and crumbling strata of hornblende schiste disposed edgeways green within and without blackened by sun and rain cropped out of the ground at halfpast ten we  p69 found ourselves in an “acaciabarren” one of the things which pilgrims dread here shugdufs are bodily pulled off the camel’s back and broken upon the hard ground the animals drop upon their knees the whole line is deranged and every one losing temper attacks his moslem brother the road was flanked on the left by an iron wall of black basalt noon brought us to another ridge whence we descended into a second wooded basin surrounded by hills  here the air was filled with those pillars of sand so graphically described by abyssinian bruce they scudded on the wings of the whirlwind over the plain—huge yellow shafts with lofty heads horizontally bent backwards in the form of clouds and on more than one occasion camels were thrown down by them it required little stretch of fancy to enter into the arabs’ superstition these sandcolumns are supposed to be jinnis of the waste which cannot be caught a notion arising from the fitful movements of the electrical windeddy that raises them and as they advance the pious moslem stretches out his finger exclaiming “iron o thou illomened onefn15”  during the forenoon we were troubled by the samum which instead of promoting perspiration chokes up and hardens the skin the arabs complain greatly of its violence on this line of road here i first remarked the difficulty with which the badawin bear thirst ya latif—“o merciful” lord—they exclaimed at times and yet they behaved like menfn16 i had ordered them to place the  p70 watercamel in front so as to exercise due supervision shaykh mas’ud and his son made only an occasional reference to the skins but his nephew a short thin pockmarked lad of eighteen whose black skin and woolly head suggested the idea of a semiafrican and ignoble origin was always drinking except when he climbed the camel’s back and dozing upon the damp load forgot his thirst in vain we ordered we taunted and we abused him he would drink he would sleep but he would not work  at one pm we crossed a fiumara and an hour afterwards we pursued the course of a second mas’ud called this the wady alkhunak and assured me that it runs from the east and the southeast in a north and northwest direction to the madinah plain early in the afternoon we reached a diminutive flat on the fiumara bank beyond it lies a mahjar or stony ground black as usual in alhijaz and over its length lay the road white with dust and with the sand deposited by the camels’ feet having arrived before the pasha we did not know where to pitch many opining that the caravan would traverse the mahjar and halt beyond it we soon alighted however pitched the tent under a burning sun and were imitated by the rest of the party mas’ud called the place hijriyah according to my computation it is twentyfive miles from ghurab and its direction is southeast twentytwo degrees  late in the afternoon the boy mohammed started with a dromedary to procure water from the higher part of the fiumara here are some wells still called bir harun after the great caliph the youth returned soon with two bags filled at an expense of nine piastres this being the 28th zu’l ka’adah many pilgrims busied themselves  p71 rather fruitlessly with endeavours to sight the crescent moon they failed but we were consoled by seeing through a gap in the western hills a heavy cloud discharge its blessed load and a cool night was the result  we loitered on sunday the 4th september at alhijriyah although the shaykh forewarned us of a long march but there is a kind of discipline in these great caravans a gunfn17 sounds the order to strike the tents and a second bids you move off with all speed there are short halts of half an hour each at dawn noon the afternoon and sunset for devotional purposes and these are regulated by a cannon or a culverin at such times the syrian and persian servants who are admirably expert in their calling pitch the large green tents with gilt crescents for the dignitaries and their harims the last restingplace is known by the hurrying forward of these “farrash” or tent “lascars” who are determined to be the first on the ground and at the well a discharge of three guns denotes the station and when the caravan moves by night a single cannon sounds three or four halts at irregular intervals the principal officers were the emir hajj one ashgar ali pasha a veteran of whom my companions spoke slightingly because he had been the slave of a slave probably the pipebearer of some grandee who in his youth had been pipebearer to some other grandee under him was a wakil or lieutenant who managed the executive the emir alsurrah—called simply alsurrah or the purse—had charge of the caravantreasure and of remittances to the holy cities and lastly there was a commander of the  p72 forces bashat alaskar his host consisted of about a thousand irregular horsemen bashbuzuks half bandits half soldiers each habited and armed after his own fashion exceedingly dirty picturesquelooking brave and in such a country of no use whatever  leaving alhijriyah at seven am we passed over the grim stonefield by a detestable footpath and at nine o’clock struck into a broad fiumara which runs from the east towards the northwest its sandy bed is overgrown with acacia the senna plant different species of euphorbiae the wild capparis and the daum palm up this line we travelled the whole day about six pm we came upon a basin at least twelve miles broad which absorbs the water of the adjacent hills accustomed as i have been to mirage a long thin line of salt efflorescence appearing at some distance on the plain below us when the shades of evening invested the view completely deceived me even the arabs were divided in opinion some thinking it was the effects of the rain which fell the day before others were more acute it is said that beasts are never deceived by the mirage and this as far as my experience goes is correct may not the reason be that most of them know the vicinity of water rather by smell than by sight upon the horizon beyond the plain rose dark fortlike masses of rock which i mistook for buildings the more readily as the shaykh had warned me that we were approaching a populous place at last descending a long steep hill we entered upon the level ground and discovered our error by the crunching sound of the camels’ feet upon large curling flakes of nitrous salt overlying caked mudfn18 those civilised birds the kite and the crow warned us that we were in the vicinity of man it was not however before eleven pm that we entered the confines of alsuwayrkiyah the fact was  p73 made patent to us by the stumbling and the falling of our dromedaries over the little ridges of dried clay disposed in squares upon the fields there were other obstacles such as garden walls wells and hovels so that midnight had sped before our weary camels reached the restingplace a rumour that we were to halt here the next day made us think lightly of present troubles it proved however to be false  during the last four days i attentively observed the general face of the country this line is a succession of low plains and basins here quasicircular there irregularly oblong surrounded by rolling hills and cut by fiumaras which pass through the higher ground the basins are divided by ridges and flats of basalt and greenstone averaging from one hundred to two hundred feet in height the general form is a huge prism sometimes they are tabletopped from almadinah to alsuwayrkiyah the low beds of sandy fiumaras abound from alsuwayrkiyah to alzaribah their place is taken by “ghadir” or hollows in which water stagnates and beyond alzaribah the traveller enters a region of watercourses tending west and southwest the versant is generally from the east and southeast towards the west and northwest water obtained by digging is good where rain is fresh in the fiumaras saltish so as to taste at first unnaturally sweet in the plains and bitter in the basins and lowlands where nitre effloresces and rain has had time to become tainted the landward faces of the hills are disposed at a sloping angle contrasting strongly with the perpendicularity of their seaward sides and i found no inner range corresponding with and parallel to the maritime chain nowhere had i seen a land in which earth’s anatomy lies so barren or one richer in volcanic and primary formationsfn19 especially  p74 towards the south the hills were abrupt and highly vertical with black and barren flanks ribbed with furrows and fissures with wide and formidable precipices and castellated summits like the work of man the predominant formation was basalt called the arabs’ hajar jahannam or hellstone here and there it is porous and cellular in some places compact and black and in others coarse and gritty of a tarry colour and when fractured shining with bright points hornblende is common at almadinah and throughout this part of alhijaz it crops out of the ground edgeways black and brittle greenstone diorite and actinolite are found though not so abundantly as those above mentioned the granites called in arabic suwanfn20 abound some are largegrained of a pink colour and appear in blocks which flaking off under the influence of the atmosphere form ooidal blocks and boulders piled in irregular heaps others are grey and compact enough to take a high polish when cut the syenite is generally coarse although there is occasionally found a rich red variety of that stone i did not see eurite or euritic porphyry except in small pieces and the same may be said of the petrosilex and the milky and waxy quartzfn21 in some parts particularly between yambu’ and almadinah there is an abundance of tawny  p75 yellow gneiss markedly stratified the transition formations are represented by a fine calcareous sandstone of a bright ochre colour it is used at meccah to adorn the exteriors of houses bands of this stone being here and there inserted into the courses of masonry there is also a small admixture of the greenish sandstone which abounds at aden the secondary formation is represented by a fine limestone in some places almost fit for the purposes of lithography and a coarse gypsum often of a tufaceous nature for the superficial accumulations of the country i may refer the reader to any description of the desert between cairo and suez  fn1 the distance from baghdad to almadinah is 180 parasangs according to ’abd alkarim “voyage de l’inde a la mecque” translated by m langles paris 1797 this book is a

fourteen to eighteen were observed each night on the third of jamadi alakhir after the isha prayers a fire burst out in the direction of alhijaz eastward it resembled a vast city with a turretted and battlemental fort in which men appeared drawing the flame about as it were whilst it roared burned and melted like a sea everything that came in its way presently red and bluish streams bursting from it ran close to almadinah and at the same time the city was fanned by a cooling zephyr from the same direction alkistlani an eyewitness asserts that “the brilliant light of the volcano made the face of the country as bright as day and the interior of the harim was as if the sun shone upon it so that men worked and required nought of the sun and moon the latter of which was also eclipsed” several saw the light at meccah at tayma in nijd six days’ journey from almadinah and at busra of syria reminding men of the prophet’s saying “a fire shall burst forth from the direction of alhijaz its light shall make visible the necks of the camels at busra” historians relate that the length of the stream was four parasangs from fourteen to sixteen miles its breadth four miles 56 to the degree and its depth about nine feet it flowed like a torrent with the waves of a sea the rocks melted by its heat stood up as a wall and for a time it prevented the passage of badawin who coming from that direction used to annoy the citizens jamal matari one of the historians of almadinah relates that the flames which destroyed the stones spared the trees and he asserts that some men sent by the governor to inspect the fire felt no heat also that the feathers of an arrow shot into it were burned whilst the shaft remained whole this he attributes to the sanctity of the trees within the harim on the contrary alkistlani asserts the fire to have been so vehement that no one could approach within two arrowflights and that it melted the outer half of a rock beyond the limits of the sanctuary leaving the inner parts unscathed the kazi the governor and the citizens engaged in devotional exercises and during the whole length of the thursday and the friday nights all even the women and children with

which on the line of march were dismounted and placed upon camels at the halt they were restored to their carriages the badawin think much of these harmless articles to which i have seen a gunner apply a match thrice before he could induce a discharge in a “moral” point of view therefore they are far more valuable than our twelvepounders fn18 hereabouts the arabs call these places “bahr milh” or “sea of salt” in other regions “bahr bila ma” or “waterless sea” fn19 being but little read in geology i submitted after my return to bombay a few specimens collected on the way to a learned friend

productions of the country with little alteration it might be made to express all the requirements of our modern geology fn21 note to third edition—this country may have contained gold but the superficial formation has long been exhausted at cairo i washed some sand brought from the eastern shore of the red sea north of alwijh and found it worth my while i had a plan for working the

dr walne  p76chapter xxv  the badawin of alhijaz  the arab may be divided into three races—a classification which agrees equally well with genesitic genealogy the traditions of the country and the observations of modern physiologistsfn1  p77the first race indigens or autochthones are those subcaucasian tribes which may still be met with in the province of mahrah and generally along the coast between maskat and hazramaut fn2 the mahrah the janabah and the gara especially show a low development for which hardship and privation alone will not satisfactorily accountfn3 these are arab alaribah for whose inferiority oriental fable accounts as usual by thaumaturgy  the principal advenæ are the noachians a great chaldaean or mesopotamian tribe which entered arabia about  p78 2200 ac and by slow and gradual encroachments drove before them the ancient owners and seized the happier lands of the peninsula the great anzah and the nijdi families are types of this race which is purely caucasian and shows a highly nervous temperament together with those signs of “blood” which distinguish even the lower animals the horse and the camel the greyhound and the goat of arabia these advenae would correspond with the arab almutarribah or arabicized arabs of the eastern historiansfn4  the third family an ancient and a noble race dating from ac 1900 and typified in history by ishmael still occupies the socalled sinaitic peninsula these arabs however do not and never did extend beyond the limits of the mountains where still dwelling in the presence of their brethren they retain all the wild customs and the untamable spirit of their forefathers they are distinguished from the pure stock by an admixture of egyptian bloodfn5  p79 and by preserving the ancient characteristics of the nilotic family the ishmaelities are subcaucasian and are denoted in history as the arab almustarribah the insititious or halfcaste arab  oriental ethnography which like most eastern sciences luxuriates in nomenclative distinction recognises a fourth race under the name of arab almustajamah these “barbarized arabs” are now represented by such a population as that of meccah  that aus and khazraj the himyaritic tribes which emigrated to alhijaz mixed with the amalikah the jurham and the katirah also races from alyaman and with the hebrews a northern branch of the semitic family we have ample historical evidence and they who know how immutable is race in the desert will scarcely doubt that the badawi of alhijaz preserves in purity the blood transmitted to him by his ancestorsfn6  p80 i will not apologise for entering into details concerning the personale of the badawinfn7 a precise physical portrait of race it has justly been remarked is the sole deficiency in the pages of bruce and of burckhardt  the temperament of the hijazi is not unfrequently the pure nervous as the height of the forehead and the fine texture of the hair prove sometimes the bilious and rarely the sanguine elements predominate the lymphatic i never saw he has large nervous centres and wellformed spine and brain a conformation favourable to longevity bartema well describes his colour as a “dark leonine” it varies from the deepest spanish to a chocolate hue and its varieties are attributed by the people to blood the skin is hard dry and soon wrinkled by exposure the xanthous complexion is rare though not unknown in cities but the leucous does not exist the crinal hair is frequently lightened by bleaching and the pilar is browner than the crinal the voice is strong and clear but rather barytone than bass in anger it becomes a shrill chattering like the cry of a wild animal the look of a chief is dignified and grave even to pensiveness the “respectable man’s” is selfsufficient and fierce the lower orders look ferocious stupid and inquisitive yet there is not much difference in this point between men of the same tribe who have similar pursuits which engender  p81 similar passions expression is the grand diversifier of appearance among civilised people in the desert it knows few varieties  the badawi cranium is small ooidal long high narrow and remarkable in the occiput for the development of gall’s second propensity the crown slopes upwards towards the region of firmness which is elevated whilst the sides are flat to a fault the hair exposed to sun wind and rain acquires a coarseness not natural to itfn8 worn in kurunfn9—ragged elflocks—hanging down to the breast or shaved in the form shushah a skullcap of hair nothing can be wilder than its appearance the face is made to be a long oval but want of flesh detracts from its regularity the forehead is high broad and retreating the upper portion is moderately developed but nothing can be finer than the lower brow and the frontal sinuses stand out indicating bodily strength and activity of character the temporal fossa are deep the bones are salient and the elevated zygomata combined with the “lanternjaw” often give a “death’shead” appearance to the face the eyebrows are long bushy and crooked broken as it were at the angle where “order” is supposed to be and bent in sign of thoughtfulness most popular writers following de pagefn10 describe the arab eye as large ardent  p82 and black the badawi of the hijaz and indeed the race generally has a small eye round restless deepset and fiery denoting keen inspection with an ardent temperament and an impassioned character its colour is dark brown or greenbrown and the pupil is often speckled the habit of pursing up the skin below the orbits and half closing the lids to exclude glare plants the outer angles with premature crows’feet another peculiarity is the sudden way in which the eye opens especially under excitement this combined with its fixity of glance forms an expression now of lively fierceness then of exceeding sternness whilst the narrow space between the orbits impresses the countenance in repose with an intelligence not destitute of cunning as a general rule however the expression of the badawi face is rather dignity than that cunning for which the semitic race is celebrated and there are lines about the mouth in variance with the stern or the fierce look of the brow the ears are like those of arab horses small wellcut “castey” and elaborate with many elevations and depressions the nose is pronounced generally aquiline but sometimes straight like those greek statues which have been treated as prodigious exaggerations of the facial angle for the most part it is a wellmade feature with delicate nostrils below which the septum appears in anger they swell and open like a blood mare’s i have however seen in not a few instances pert and offensive “pugs” deep furrows descend from the wings of the nose showing an uncertain temper now too grave then too gay the mouth is irregular the lips are either bordes denoting rudeness and want of taste or they form a mere line in the latter case there is an appearance of undue development in the upper portion of the countenance especially when the jaws are ascetically thin and the chin weakly retreats the latter p83 feature however is generally well and strongly made the teeth as usual among orientals are white even short and broad—indications of strength some tribes trim their mustaches according to the “sunnat” the shafe’i often shave them and many allow them to hang persianlike over the lips the beard is represented by two tangled tufts upon the chin where whisker should be the place is either bare or is thinly covered with straggling pile  the badawin of alhijaz are short men about the height of the indians near bombay but weighing on an average a stone more as usual in this stage of society stature varies little you rarely see a giant and scarcely ever a dwarf deformity is checked by the spartan restraint upon population and no weakly infant can live through a badawi life the figure though spare is square and well knit fulness of limb seldom appears but about spring when milk abounds i have seen two or three muscular figures but never a fat man the neck is sinewy the chest broad the flank thin and the stomach indrawn the legs though fleshless are well made especially when the knee and ankle are not bowed by too early riding the shins do not bend cucumberlike to the front as in the african racefn11 the arms are thin with muscles like whipcords and the hands and feet are in point of size and delicacy a link between europe and india as in the celt the arab thumb is remarkably long extending almost to the first joint of the indexfn12 which with its easy rotation makes it a perfect prehensile instrument the palm also is fleshless smallboned and p84 elastic with his small active figure it is not strange that the wildest badawi gait should be pleasing he neither unfits himself for walking nor distorts his ankles by turning out his toes according to the farcical rule of fashion and his shoulders are not dressed like a drillsergeant’s to throw all the weight of the body upon the heels yet there is no slouch in his walk it is light and springy and errs only in one point sometimes becoming a strut  such is the badawi and such he has been for ages the national type has been preserved by systematic intermarriage the wild men do not refuse their daughters to a stranger but the soninlaw would be forced to settle among them and this life which has its charms for a while ends in becoming wearisome here no evil results are anticipated from the union of first cousins and the experience of ages and of a mighty nation may be trusted every badawi has a right to marry his father’s brother’s daughter before she is given to a stranger hence “cousin” bint amm in polite phrase signifies a “wifefn13” our physiologistsfn14 adduce the sangre azul of spain and the case of the lower animals to prove that degeneracy inevitably follows “breedinginfn15”  p85 either they have theorised from insufficient facts or civilisation and artificial living exercise some peculiar influence or arabia is a solitary exception to a general rule the fact which i have mentioned is patent to every eastern traveller  after this long description the reader will perceive with pleasure that we are approaching an interesting theme the first question of mankind to the wanderer—“what are the women like” truth compels me to state that the women of the hijazi badawin are by no means comely although the benu amur boast of some pretty girls yet they are far inferior to the highbosomed beauties of nijd and i warn all men that if they run to alhijaz in search of the charming face which appears in my sketchbook as “a badawi girl” they will be bitterly disappointed the dress was arab but it was worn by a fairy of the west the hijazi woman’s eyes are fierce her features harsh and her face haggard like all people of the south she soon fades and in old age her appearance is truly witchlike withered crones abound in the camps where old men are seldom seen the sword and the sun are fatal to    “a green old age unconscious of decay”  the manners of the badawin are free and simple “vulgarity” and affectation awkwardness and embarrassment are weeds of civilised growth unknown to the people of the desertfn16 yet their manners are sometimes dashed with a strange ceremoniousness when two frends meet they either embrace or both extend the right hands clapping palm to palm their foreheads are either pressed together or their heads are moved from side to side whilst for minutes together mutual inquiries are made and answered it is a breach of decorum even when eating to turn the back upon a person and if a badawi  p86 does it he intends an insult when a man prepares coffee he drinks the first cup the sharbat kajari of the persians and the sulaymani of egyptfn17 render this precaution necessary as a friend approaches the camp—it is not done to strangers for fear of startling them—those who catch sight of him shout out his name and gallop up saluting with lances or firing matchlocks in the air this is the wellknown la’ab albarut or gunpowder play badawin are generally polite in language but in anger temper is soon shown and although life be in peril the foulest epithets—dog drunkard liar and infidel—are discharged like pistolshots by both disputants  the best character of the badawi is a truly noble compound of determination gentleness and generosity usually they are a mixture of worldly cunning and great simplicity sensitive to touchiness goodtempered souls solemn and dignified withal fond of a jest yet of a grave turn of mind easily managed by a laugh and a soft word and placable after passion though madly revengeful after injury it has been sarcastically said of the benuharb that there is not a man  “que s’il ne violoit voloit tuoit bruloit ne fut assez bonne personne”  the reader will inquire like the critics of a certain modern humourist how the fabric of society can be supported by such material in the first place it is a kind of societe leonine in which the fiercest the strongest and the craftiest obtains complete mastery over his fellows and this gives a  p87 keystone to the arch secondly there is the terrible bloodfeud which even the most reckless fear for their posterity and thirdly though the revealed law of the koran being insufficient for the desert is openly disregarded the immemorial customs of the kazi alarab the judge of the arabsfn18 form a system stringent in the extreme  the valour of the badawi is fitful and uncertain man is by nature an animal of prey educated by the complicated relations of society but readily relapsing into his old habits ravenous and sanguinary propensities grow apace in the desert but for the same reason the recklessness of civilisation is unknown there savages and semibarbarians are always cautious because they have nothing valuable but their lives and limbs the civilised man on the contrary has a hundred wants or hopes or aims without which existence has for him no charms arab ideas of bravery do not prepossess us their romances full of foolhardy feats and impossible exploits might charm for a time but would not become the standard works of a really fighting peoplefn19 nor would a truly valorous race admire  p88 the cautious freebooters who safely fire down upon caravans from their eyries arab wars too are a succession of skirmishes in which five hundred men will retreat after losing a dozen of their number in this partisanfighting the first charge secures a victory and the vanquished fly till covered by the shades of night then come cries and taunts of women deep oaths wild poetry excitement and reprisals which will probably end in the flight of the former victor when peace is to be made both parties count up their dead and the usual bloodmoney is paid for excess on either side generally however the feud endures till all becoming weary of it some great man as the sharif of meccah is called upon to settle the terms of a treaty which is nothing but an armistice after a few months’ peace a glance or a word will draw blood for these hates are old growths and new dissensions easily shoot up from them  but contemptible though their battles be the badawin are not cowards the habit of danger in raids and bloodfeuds the continual uncertainty of existence the desert the chase the hard life and exposure to the air blunting the nervous system the presence and the practice of weapons horsemanship sharpshooting and martial exercises habituate them to look death in the face like men and powerful motives will make them heroes the english it is said fight willingly for liberty our neighbours for glory the spaniard fights or rather fought for religion and the pundonor and the irishman fights for the fun of fighting gain and revenge draw the arab’s sword yet then he uses it fitfully enough without the gay gallantry of the p89 french or the persistent stay of the anglosaxon to become desperate he must have the allpowerful stimulants of honour and of fanaticism frenzied by the insults of his women or by the fear of being branded as a coward he is capable of any mad deedfn20 and the obstinacy produced by strong religious impressions gives a steadfastness to his spirit unknown to mere enthusiasm the history of the badawi tells this plainly some unobserving travellers indeed have mistaken his exceeding cautiousness for stark cowardice the incongruity is easily read by one who understands the principles of badawi warfare with them as amongst the red indians one death dims a victory and though reckless when their passions are thoroughly aroused though heedless of danger when the voice of honour calls them the badawin will not sacrifice themselves for light motives besides they have as has been said another and a potent incentive to cautiousness whenever peace is concluded they must pay for victory  there are two things which tend to soften the ferocity of badawi life these are in the first place intercourse with citizens who frequently visit and entrust their children to the people of the black tents  and secondly the social position of the women  the rev charles robertson author of a certain  p90 “lecture on poetry addressed to working men” asserts that passion became love under the influence of christianity and that the idea of a virgin mother spread over the sex a sanctity unknown to the poetry or to the philosophy of greece and romefn21 passing over the objections of deified eros and immortal psyche and of the virgin mother—symbol of moral purity—being common to every old and material faithfn22 i believe that all the noble tribes of savages display the principle thus we might expect to find wherever the fancy the imagination and the ideality are strong some traces of a sentiment innate in the human organisation it exists says mr catlin amongst the north american indians and even the gallas and the somal of africa are not wholly destitute of it but when the barbarian becomes a semibarbarian as are the most polished orientals or as were the classical authors of greece and rome then women fall from their proper place in society become mere articles of luxury and sink into the lowest moral condition in the next stage “civilisation” they rise again to be “highly accomplished” and not a little frivolous  p91miss martineau when travelling through egypt once visited a harim and there found among many things especially in ignorance of books and of bookmaking materials for a heartbroken wail over the degradation of her sex the learned lady indulges too in sundry strong and unsavoury comparisons between the harim and certain haunts of vice in europe on the other hand male travellers generally speak lovingly of the harim sonnini no admirer of egypt expatiates on “the generous virtues the examples of magnanimity and affectionate attachment the sentiments ardent yet gentle forming a delightful unison with personal charms in the harims of the mamluks”  as usual the truth lies somewhere between the two extremes human nature all the world over differs but in degree everywhere women may be “capricious coy and hard to please” in common conjunctures in the hour of need they will display devoted heroism any chronicler of the afghan war will bear witness that warm hearts noble sentiments and an overflowing kindness to the poor the weak and the unhappy are found even in a harim europe now knows that the moslem husband provides separate apartments and a distinct establishment for each of his wives unless as sometimes happens one be an old woman and the other a child and confessing that envy hatred and malice often flourish in polygamy the moslem asks is monogamy open to no objections as far as my limited observations go polyandry is the only state of society in which jealousy and quarrels about the sex are the exception and not the rule of life  in quality of doctor i have seen a little and heard much of the harim it often resembles a european home composed of a man his wife and his mother and i have seen in the west many a “happy fireside” fitter to make miss martineau’s heart ache than any harim in grand cairo  p92 were it not evident that the spiritualising of sexuality by sentiment of propensity by imagination is universal among the highest orders of mankind—c’est l’etoffe de la nature que l’imagination a brodee says voltaire—i should attribute the origin of “love” to the influence of the arabs’ poetry and chivalry upon european ideas rather than to mediaeval christianity certain “fathers of the church” it must be remembered did not believe that women have souls the moslems never went so far  in nomad life tribes often meet for a time live together whilst pasturage lasts and then separate perhaps for a generation under such circumstances youths who hold with the italian that  “perduto e tutto il tempo che in amor non si spende”  will lose heart to maidens whom possibly by the laws of the clan they may not marryfn23 and the light o’ love will fly her home the fugitives must brave every danger for revenge at all times the badawi’s idol now becomes the lodestar of his existence but the arab lover will dare all consequences “men have died and the worms have eaten them but not for love” may be true in the west it is false in the east this is attested in every tale where love and not ambition is the groundwork of the narrativefn24 and nothing can be more tender more  p93 pathetic than the use made of these separations and long absences by the old arab poets whoever peruses the suspended poem of labid will find thoughts at once so plaintive and so noble that even dr carlyle’s learned verse cannot wholly deface their charm  the warriorbard returns from afar he looks upon the traces of hearth and home still furrowing the desert ground in bitterness of spirit he checks himself from calling aloud upon his lovers and his friends he melts at the remembrance of their departure and long indulges in the absorbing theme then he strengthens himself by the thought of nawara’s inconstancy how she left him and never thought of him again he impatiently dwells upon the charms of the places which detain her advocates flight from the changing lover and the false friend and in the exultation with which he feels his swift dromedary start under him upon her rapid course he seems to seek and finds some consolation for women’s perfidy and forgetfulness yet he cannot abandon nawara’s name or memory again he dwells with yearning upon scenes of past felicity and he boasts of his prowess—a fresh reproach to her—of his gentle birth and of his hospitality he ends with an encomium upon his clan to which he attributes as a noble arab should all the virtues of man this is goldsmith’s deserted village in alhijaz but the arab with equal simplicity and pathos has a fire a force of language and a depth of feeling which the irishman admirable as his verse is could never rival  as the author of the peninsular war well remarks women in troubled times throwing off their accustomed feebleness and frivolity become helpmates meet for man the same is true of pastoral life fn25 here between the   p94 extremes of fierceness and sensibility the weaker sex remedying its great want power rises itself by courage physical as well as moral in the early days of alislam if history be credible arabia had a race of heroines within the last century ghaliyah the wife of a wahhabi chief opposed mohammed ali himself in many a bloody field a few years ago when ibn asm popularly called ibn rumi chief of the zubayd clan about rabigh was treacherously slain by the turkish general kurdi osman his sister a fair young girl determined to revenge him she fixed upon the “arafatday” of pilgrimage for the accomplishment of her designs disguised herself in male attire drew her kerchief in the form lisam over the lower part of her face and with lighted match awaited her enemy the turk however was not present and the girl was arrested to win for herself a local reputation equal to the “maid” of salamanca thus it is that the arab has learned to swear that great oath “by the honour of my women”  the badawin are not without a certain platonic affection which they call hawa or ishk uzri—pardonable lovefn26 they draw the fine line between amant and amoureux this is derided by the townspeople little suspecting how much such a custom says in favour of the wild men arabs like other orientals hold that in such matters man is saved not by faith but by want of faith they have also a saying not unlike ours—  “she partly is to blame who has been tried he comes too near who comes to be denied”  p95the evil of this system is that they like certain southerns—pensano sempre al male—always suspect which may be worldlywise and also always show their suspicions which is assuredly foolish for thus they demoralise their women who might be kept in the way of right by selfrespect and by a sense of duty  from ancient periods of the arab’s history we find him practising knighterrantry the wildest form of chivalryfn27 “the songs of antar” says the author of the “crescent and the cross” “show little of the true chivalric spirit” what thinks the reader of sentiments like thesefn28 “this valiant man” remarks antar who was “ever interested for the weaker sex” “hath defended the honour of women” we read in another place “mercy my lord is the noblest quality of the noble” again “it is the most ignominious of deeds to take freeborn women prisoners” “bear not malice o shibub” quoth the hero “for of malice good never came” is there no true greatness in this sentiment—“birth is the boast of the faineant noble is the youth who beareth every ill who clotheth himself in mail during the noontide heat and who wandereth through the outer darkness of night” and why does the “knight of knights” love ibla because “she is blooming as the sun at dawn with hair black as the midnight shades with paradise in her eye her bosom an enchantment and a form waving like the tamarisk when the soft wind blows from the hills of nijd” yes but his chest expands also with the thoughts of her “faith purity and affection”—it is her moral as well as her material excellence that makes her p96 the hero’s “hope and hearing and sight” briefly in antar i discern  “a love exalted high by all the glow of chivalry”  and i lament to see so many intelligent travellers misjudging the arab after a superficial experience of a few debased syrians or sinaites the true children of antar my lord lindsay have not “ceased to be gentlemen”  in the days of ignorance it was the custom for badawin when tormented by the tender passion which seems to have attacked them in the form of “possession” for long years to sigh and wail and wander doing the most truculent deeds to melt the obdurate fair when arabia islamized the practice changed its element for proselytism  the fourth caliph is fabled to have travelled far redressing the injured punishing the injurer preaching to the infidel and especially protecting women—the chief end and aim of knighthood the caliph almu’tasim heard in the assembly of his courtiers that a woman of sayyid family had been taken prisoner by a “greek barbarian” of ammoria the man on one occasion struck her when she cried “help me o mu’tasim” and the clown said derisively “wait till he cometh upon his pied steed” the chivalrous prince arose sealed up the winecup which he held in his hand took oath to do his knightly devoir and on the morrow started for ammoria with seventy thousand men each mounted on a piebald charger having taken the place he entered it exclaiming “labbayki labbayki”—“here am i at thy call” he struck off the caitiff’s head released the lady with his own hands ordered the cupbearer to bring the sealed bowl and drank from it exclaiming “now indeed wine is good”  to conclude this part of the subject with another farfamed instance when almutanabbi the poet prophet and warrior of hams ah 354 started together with his  p97 son on their last journey the father proposed to seek a place of safety for the night “art thou the mutanabbi” exclaimed his slave “who wrote these lines—  “‘i am known to the night the wild and the steed to the guest and the sword to the paper and reedfn29’”  the poet in reply lay down to sleep on tigris’ bank in a place haunted by thieves and disdaining flight lost his life during the hours of darkness  it is the existence of this chivalry among the “children of antar” which makes the society of badawin “damned saints” perchance and “honourable villains” so delightful to the traveller who like the late haji wali dr wallin understands and is understood by them nothing more naïve than his lamentations at finding himself in the “loathsome company of persians” or among arab townspeople whose “filthy and cowardly minds” he contrasts with the “high and chivalrous spirit of the true sons of the desert” your guide will protect you with blade and spear even against his kindred and he expects you to do the same for him you may give a man the lie but you must lose no time in baring your sword if involved in dispute with overwhelming numbers you address some elder dakhilak ya shaykh—i am thy protected o sir—and he will espouse your quarrel with greater heat and energy indeed than if it were his ownfn30 but why multiply instances  the language of love and war and all excitement is poetry and here again the badawi excels travellers complain that the wild men have ceased to sing this is true if “poet” be limited to a few authors whose existence  p98 everywhere depends upon the accidents of patronage or political occurrences a far stronger evidence of poetic feeling is afforded by the phraseology of the arab and the highly imaginative turn of his commonest expressions destitute of the poetic taste as we define it he certainly is as in the milesian wit and fancy vivacity and passion are too strong for reason and judgment the reins which guide apollo’s carfn31 and although the badawin no longer boast a labid or a maysunah yet they are passionately fond of their ancient bardsfn32 a man skilful in reading almutanabbi and the suspended poems would be received by them with the honours paid by civilisation to the travelling millionairefn33 and their elders have a goodly store of ancient and modern war songs legends and love ditties which all enjoy  p99i cannot well explain the effect of arab poetry to one who has not visited the desertfn34 apart from the pomp of words and the music of the soundfn35 there is a dreaminess of idea and a haze thrown over the object infinitely attractive but indescribable description  p100 indeed would rob the song of indistinctness its essence to borrow a simile from a sister art the arab poet sets before the mental eye the dim grand outlines of picture—which must be filled up by the reader guided only by a few glorious touches powerfully standing out and by the sentiment which the scene is intended to express—whereas we europeans and moderns by stippling and minute touches produce a miniature on a large scale so objective as to exhaust rather than to arouse reflection as the poet is a creator the arab’s is poetry the european’s versical description fn36 the language “like a faithful wife following the mind and giving birth to its offspring” and free from that “luggage of particles” which clogs our modern tongues leaves a mysterious vagueness between the relation of word to word which materially assists the sentiment not the sense of the poem when verbs and nouns have each one many different significations only the radical or general idea suggests itselffn37 rich and varied synonyms illustrating the finest shades of meaning are artfully used now scattered to startle us by distinctness now to form as it were a star about which dimly seen satellites revolve and to cut short a disquisition  p101 which might be prolonged indefinitely there is in the semitic dialect a copiousness of rhyme which leaves the poet almost unfettered to choose the desired expressionfn38 hence it is that a stranger speaking arabic becomes poetical as naturally as he would be witty in french and philosophic in german truly spake mohammed aldamiri “wisdom hath alighted upon three things—the brain of the franks the hands of the chinese and the tongues of the arabs”  the name of harami—brigand—is still honourable among the hijazi badawin slain in raid or foray a man is said to die ghandur or a brave he on the other hand who is lucky enough as we should express it to die in his bed is called fatis carrion the corps creve of the klephts his weeping mother will exclaim “o that my son had perished of a cut throat” and her attendant crones will suggest with deference that such evil came of the will of allah it is told of the lahabah a sept of the auf near rabigh that a girl will refuse even her cousin unless in the absence of other opportunities he plunder some article from the hajj caravan in front of the pasha’s links detected twenty years ago the delinquent would have been impaled now he escapes with a ribroasting fear of the bloodfeud and the certainty of a shut road to future travellers prevent the turks proceeding to extremes they conceal their weakness by pretending that p102 the sultan hesitates to wage a war of extermination with the thieves of the holy land  it is easy to understand this respect for brigands whoso revolts against society requires an iron mind in an iron body and these mankind instinctively admires however misdirected be their energies thus in all imaginative countries the brigand is a hero even the assassin who shoots his victim from behind a hedge appeals to the fancy in tipperary or on the abruzzian hills romance invests his loneliness with grandeur if he have a wife or a friend’s wife romance becomes doubly romantic and a tithe of the superfluity robbed from the rich and bestowed upon the poor will win to gasparoni the hearts of a people the true badawi style of plundering with its numerous niceties of honour and gentlemanly manners gives the robber a consciousness of moral rectitude “strip off that coat o certain person and that turband” exclaims the highwayman “they are wanted by the daughter of my paternal uncle wife” you will of course if necessary lend ready ear to an order thus politely attributed to the wants of the fair sex if you will add a few obliging expressions to the bundle and offer latro a cup of coffee and a pipe you will talk half your toilette back to your own person and if you can quote a little poetry you will part the best of friends leaving perhaps only a pair of sandals behind you but should you hesitate latro lamenting the painful necessity touches up your back with the heel of his spear if this hint suffice not he will make things plain by the lance’s point and when blood shows the tigerpart of humanity appears between badawin to be tamely plundered especially of the marefn39 is a lasting disgrace a man of  p103 family lays down his life rather than yield even to overpowering numbers this desperation has raised the courage of the badawin to high repute amongst the settled arabs who talk of single braves capable like the homeric heroes of overpowering three hundred men  i omit general details about the oftendescribed sar or vendetta the price of blood is 800  200l or rather that sum imperfectly expressed by live stock all the khamsah or a’amam blood relations of the slayer assist to make up the required amount rating each animal at three or four times its proper value on such occasions violent scenes arise from the conflict of the arab’s two pet passions avarice and revenge the “avenger of blood” longs to cut the foe’s throat on the other hand how let slip an opportunity of enriching himself his covetousness is intense as are all his passions he has always a project of buying a new dromedary or of investing capital in some marvellous colt the consequence is that he is insatiable still he receives bloodmoney with a feeling of shame and if it be offered to an old woman—the most revengeful variety of our species be it remarked—she will dash it to the ground and clutch her knife and fiercely swear by allah that she will not “eat” her son’s blood  the badawi considers himself a man only when mounted on horseback lance in hand bound for a foray or a fray and carolling some such gaiety as—  “a steede a steede of matchlesse speede a sword of metal keene all else to noble minds is drosse all else on earth is meane”  even in his sports he affects those that imitate war preserving the instinctive qualities which lie dormant in civilisation he is an admirable sportsman the children  p104 men in miniature begin with a rude system of gymnastics when they can walk “my young ones play upon the backs of camels” was the reply made to me by a jahayni badawi when offered some egyptian plaything the men pass their time principally in hawking shooting and riding the “sakrfn40” i am told is the only falcon in general use they train it to pursue the gazelle which  p105 greyhounds pull down when fatigued i have heard much of their excellent marksmanship but saw only moderate practice with a long matchlock rested and fired at standing objects doublebarreled guns are rare amongst themfn41 their principal weapons are matchlocks and firelocks pistols javelins spears swords and the dagger called jambiyah the sling and the bow have long been given up the guns come from egypt syria and turkey for the badawi cannot make although he can repair this arm he particularly values a good old barrel seven spans long and would rather keep it than his coat consequently a family often boasts of four or five guns which descend from generation to generation their price varies from two to sixty dollars the badawin collect nitre in the country make excellent charcoal and import sulphur from egypt and india their powder however is coarse and weak for hares and birds they cut up into slugs a bar of lead hammered out to a convenient size and they cast bullets in moulds they are fond of ballpractice firing as every sensible man does at short distances and striving at extreme precision they are ever backing themselves with wagers and will shoot for a sheep the loser inviting his friends to a feast on festivals they boil the head and use it as mark and prize those who affect excellence are said to fire at a bullet hanging by a thread curious however to relate the badawin of alhijaz have but just learned the art general in persia and barbary of shooting from horseback at speed  pistols have been lately introduced into the hijaz and are not common amongst the badawin the citizens incline to this weapon as it is derived from constantinople in the desert a tolerable pair with flint locks may be worth thirty dollars ten times their price in england  p106the spearsfn42 called kanat or reeds are made of male bamboos imported from india they are at least twelve feet long iron shod with a tapering point beneath which are one or two tufts of black ostrich feathersfn43 besides the mirzak or javelin they have a spear called shalfah a bamboo or a palm stick garnished with a head about the breadth of a man’s hand  no good swords are fabricated in alhijaz the khalawiyah and other desert clans have made some poor attempts at blades they are brought from persia india and egypt but i never saw anything of value  the darakah or shield also comes from india it is the common cutch article supposed to be made of rhinoceros hide and displaying as much brass knob and gold wash as possible the badawin still use in the remoter parts diraa or coats of mail worn by horsemen over buff jackets  the dagger is made in alyaman and other places it has a vast variety of shapes each of which as usual has its proper names generally they are but little curved whereas the gadaymi of alyaman and hazramaut is almost a semicircle with tapering blade wooden handle and scabbard of the same material overlaid with brass at the point of the scabbard is a round knob and the weapon is so long that a man when walking cannot swing his right  p107 arm in narrow places he must enter sideways but it is the mode always to appear in dagger and the weapon like the french soldier’s coupechoux is really useful for such bloodless purposes as cutting wood and gathering grass in price they vary from one to thirty dollars  the badawin boast greatly of swordplay but it is apparently confined to delivering a tremendous slash and to jumping away from the returncut instead of parrying either with sword or shield the citizens have learned the turkish scimitarplay which in grotesqueness and general absurdity rivals the east indian school none of these orientals knows the use of the point which characterises the highest school of swordsmanship  the hijazi badawin have no game of chance and dare not i am told ferment the juice of the daum palm as proximity to aden has taught the wild men of alyamanfn44 their music is in a rude state the principal instrument is the tabl or kettledrum which is of two kinds one the smaller used at festivals the other a large copper “tomtom” for martial purposes covered with leather and played upon pulpitlike with fist and not with stick besides which they have the onestringed rubabah or guitar that “monotonous but charming instrument of the desert” in another place i have described their dancing which is an ignoble spectacle  the badawin of alhijaz have all the knowledge necessary for procuring and protecting the riches of savage life they are perfect in the breeding the training and the selling of cattle they know sufficient of astronomy to guide themselves by night and are acquainted  p108 with the names of the principal stars their local memory is wonderful and such is their instinct in the art of asar or tracking that it is popularly said of the zubayd clan which lives between meccah and almadinah a man will lose a shecamel and know her fouryearold colt by its foot always engaged in rough exercises and perilous journeys they have learned a kind of farriery and a simple system of surgery in cases of fracture they bind on splints with cloth bands and the patient drinks camel’s milk and clarified butter till he is cured cuts are carefully washed sprinkled with meal gunpowder and sewn up they dress gunshot wounds with raw camel’s flesh and rely entirely upon nature and diet when bitten by snakes or stung by scorpions they scarify the wound with a razor recite a charm and apply to it a dressing of garlicfn45 the wealthy have fiss or ringstones brought from india and used with a formula of prayer to extract venom some few possess the tariyak theriack of alirak—the great counterpoison internal as well as external of the east the poorer classes all wear the za’al or hibas of alyaman two yarns of black sheep’s wool tied round the leg under the knee and above the ankle when bitten the sufferer tightens these cords above the injured part which he immediately scarifies thus they act as tourniquets these ligatures also cure cramps—and there is no other remedy the badawi knowledge of medicine is unusually limited in this part of arabia where even simples are not required by a people who rise with dawn eat little always breathe desert air and “at night make the camels their curfew” the great tonic is clarified butter and the kay or actual cautery is used even for rheumatism this counterirritant together with a curious and artful phlebotomy  p109 blood being taken as by the italians from the toes the fingers and other parts of the body are the arab panaceas they treat scaldhead with grease and sulphur ulcers which here abound without however assuming the fearful type of the “helcoma yemenense” are cauterised and stimulated by verdigris the evil of which fracastorius sang is combated by sudorifics by unguents of oil and sulphur and especially by the sandbath the patient buried up to the neck remains in the sun fasting all day in the evening he is allowed a little food this rude course of “packing” lasts for about a month it suits some constitutions but others especially europeans have tried the sandbath and died of fever mules’ teeth roasted and imperfectly pounded remove cataract teeth are extracted by the farrier’s pincers and the worm which throughout the east is supposed to produce toothache falls by fumigation and finally after great fatigue or when suffering from cold the body is copiously greased with clarified butter and exposed to a blazing fire  mohammed and his followers conquered only the more civilised badawin and there is even to this day little or no religion amongst the wild people except those on the coast or in the vicinity of cities the faith of the badawi comes from alislam whose hold is weak but his customs and institutions the growth of his climate his nature and his wants are still those of his ancestors cherished ere meccah had sent forth a prophet and likely to survive the day when every vestige of the ka’abah shall have disappeared of this nature are the hijazi’s pagan oaths his heathenish names few being moslem except “mohammed” his ordeal of licking redhot iron his salkh or scarification—proof of manliness—his blood revenge and his eating carrion ie the body of an animal killed without the usual formula and his lending his wives to strangers all these i hold to be remnants of some old  p110 creed nor should i despair of finding among the badawin bordering upon the great desert some lingering system of idolatry  the badawin of alhijaz call themselves shafe’i but what is put into the mouths of their brethren in the west applies equally well here “we pray not because we must drink the water of ablution we give no alms because we ask them we fast not the ramazan month because we starve throughout the year and we do no pilgrimage because the world is the house of allah” their blunders in religious matters supply the citizens with many droll stories and it is to be observed that they do not like the greek pirates or the italian bandits preserve a religious element in their plunderings they make no vows and they carefully avoid offerings  the ceremonies of badawi life are few and simple—circumcisions marriages and funerals of the former rite there are two forms taharah as usual in alislam and salkh an arab invention derived from the times of paganismfn46 during wahhabi rule it was forbidden under pain of death but now the people have returned to it the usual age for taharah is between five and six among  p111 some classes however it is performed ten years later on such occasions feastings and merrymakings take place as at our christenings  women being a marketable commodity in barbarism as in civilisation the youth in alhijaz is not married till his father can afford to buy him a bride there is little pomp or ceremony save firing of guns dancing singing and eating mutton the “settlement” is usually about thirty sound spanish dollarsfn47 half paid down and the other owed by the bridegroom to the father the brothers or the kindred of his spouse some tribes will take animals in lieu of ready money a man of wrath not contented with his bride puts her away at once if peaceably inclined by a short delay he avoids scandal divorces are very frequent among badawin and if the settlement money be duly paid no evil comes of themfn48  the funerals of the wild men resemble those of the citizens only they are more simple the dead being buried where they die the corpse after ablution is shrouded in any rags procurable and women and hired weepers  p112 not being permitted to attend it is carried to the grave by men only a hole is dug according to moslem custom dry wood which everywhere abounds is disposed to cover the corpse and an oval of stones surrounding a mound of earth keeps out jackals and denotes the spot these badawin have not like the wild sindis and baluchis favourite cemeteries to which they transport their dead from afar  the traveller will find no difficulty in living amongst the hijazi badawin “trust to their honour and you are safe” as was said of the crow indians “to their honesty and they will steal the hair off your head” but the wanderer must adopt the wild man’s motto omnia mea mecum porto he must have good nerves be capable of fatigue and hardship possess some knowledge of drugs shoot and ride well speak arabic and turkish know the customs by reading and avoid offending against local prejudices by causing himself for instance to be called taggaa the payment of a small sum secures to him a rafikfn49 and this “friend” after once engaging in the task will be faithful “we have eaten salt together” nahnu malihin is still a bond of friendship there are however some tribes who require to renew the bond every twentyfour hours as otherwise to use their own phrase “the salt is not in their stomachs” caution must be exercised in choosing a companion who has not too many blood feuds there is no objection to carrying a copper watch and a pocket compass and a koran could be fitted with secret pockets for notes and pencil strangers should especially avoid handsome weapons these tempt the badawin’s cupidity more than gold the other extreme defencelessness is equally objectionable it is needless to say that the traveller must never be seen writing anything but charms and must on no account sketch in public he should be careful in questioning and rather lead up  p113 to information than ask directly it offends some badawin besides denoting ignorance and curiosity to be asked their names or those of their clans a man may be living incognito and the tribes distinguish themselves when they desire to do so by dress personal appearance voice dialect and accentuation points of difference plain to the initiated a few dollars suffice for the road and if you would be “respectable” a taste which i will not deprecate some such presents as razors and tarbushes are required for the chiefs  the government of the arabs may be called almost an autonomy the tribes never obey their shaykhs unless for personal considerations and as in a civilised army there generally is some sharpwitted and brazenfaced individual whose voice is louder than the general’s in their leonine society the sword is the greater administrator of law  relations between the badawi tribes of alhijaz are of a threefold character they are either ashab kiman or akhwan  ashab or “comrades” are those who are bound by oath to an alliance offensive and defensive they intermarry and are therefore closely connected  kimanfn50 or foes are tribes between whom a blood feud the cause and the effect of deadly enmity exists  akhawat or “brotherhood” denotes the tie between the stranger and the badawi who asserts an immemorial and inalienable right to the soil upon which his forefathers fed their flocks trespass by a neighbour instantly causes war territorial increase is rarely attempted for if of a whole clan but a single boy escape he will one day assert his claim to the land and be assisted by all the ashab or p114 allies of the slain by paying to man woman or child a small sum varying according to your means from a few pence worth of trinkets to a couple of dollars you share bread and salt with the tribe you and your horse become dakhil protected and every one must afford you brotherhelp if traveller or trader attempt to pass through the land without paying alakhawah or alrifkah as it is termed he must expect to be plundered and resisting to be slain it is no dishonour to pay it and he clearly is in the wrong who refuses to conform to custom the rafik under different names exists throughout this part of the world at sinai he was called a ghafir a rabia in eastern arabia amongst the somal an abban and by the gallas a mogasa i have called the tax “blackmail” it deserves a better name being clearly the rudest form of those transitdues and octrois which are in nowise improved by “progress” the ahl baytfn51 or dwellers in the black tents levy the tax from the ahl hayt or the people of walls that is to say townsmen and villagers who have forfeited right to be held badawin it is demanded from bastard arabs and from tribes who like the hutaym and the khalawiyah have been born basely or have become “nidering” and these people are obliged to pay it at home as well as abroad then it becomes a sign of disgrace and the pure clans like the benu harb will not give their damsels in marriage to “brothers”  besides this akhawattax and the pensions by the porte to chiefs of clans the wealth of the badawi consists in his flocks and herds his mare and his weapons some clans are rich in horses others are celebrated for camels and not a few for sheep asses or greyhounds the ahamidah tribe as has been mentioned possesses few animals it subsists by plunder and by presents from  p115 pilgrims the principal wants of the country are sulphur lead cloths of all kinds sugar spices coffee corn and rice arms are valued by the men and it is advisable to carry a stock of birmingham jewellery for the purpose of conciliating womankind in exchange the badawin give sheepfn52 cattle clarified butter milk wool and hides which they use for waterbags as the egyptians and other easterns do potteries but as there is now a fair store of dollars in the country it is rarely necessary to barter  the arab’s dress marks his simplicity it gives him a nationality as according to john evelyn “prodigious breeches” did to the swiss it is remarkably picturesque and with sorrow we see it now confined to the wildest badawin and a few sharifs to the practised eye a hijazi in tarbush and caftan is ridiculous as a basque or a catalonian girl in a cachemire and a little chip the necessary dress of a man is his saub tobe a blue calico shirt reaching from neck to ankles tight or loosesleeved opening at the chest in front and rather narrow below so that the wearer when running must either hold it up or tuck it into his belt the latter article called hakw is a plaited leathern thong twisted round the waist very tightly so as to support the back the trousers and the futah or loincloth of cities are looked upon as signs of effeminacy in cold weather the chiefs wear over the shirt an aba or cloak these garments are made in nijd and the eastern districts they are of four colours white black red and brownstriped the best are of camels’ hair and may cost fifteen dollars the worst of sheep’s wool are worth only three both are cheap as they last for years the mahramah headcloth comes from syria which with nijd supplies also the kufiyah or headkerchief the ukalfn53 fillets bound over  p116 the kerchief are of many kinds the bishr tribe near meccah make a kind of crown like the gloria round a saint’s head with bits of wood in which are set pieces of mothero’pearl sandals too are of every description from the simple sole of leather tied on with thongs to the handsome and elaborate chaussure of meccah the price varies from a piastre to a dollar and the very poor walk barefooted a leathern bandoleer called majdal passed over the left shoulder and reaching to the right hip supports a line of brass cylinders for cartridgesfn54 the other crossbelt almasdar made of leather ornamented with brass rings hangs down at the left side and carries a kharizah or hidecase for bullets and finally the hizam or waistbelt holds the dagger and extra cartridge cases a badawi never appears in public unarmed  women wear like their masters dark blue cotton tobes but larger and looser when abroad they cover the head with a yashmak of black stuff or a poppycoloured burka nosegay of the egyptian shape they wear no pantaloons and they rarely affect slippers or sandals the hair is twisted into majdul little pigtails and copiously anointed with clarified butter the rich perfume the skin with rose and cinnamonscented oils and adorn the hair with alshayh absinthium sweetest herb of the desert their ornaments are bracelets collars ear and noserings of gold silver or silvergilt the poorer classes have strings of silver coins hung round the neck  the true badawi is an abstemious man capable of living for six months on ten ounces of food per diem the milk of a single camel and a handful of dates dry or fried in clarified butter suffice for his wants he despises the obese and all who require regular and plentiful meals sleeps on a mat and knows neither luxury nor comfort freezing during one quarter and frying for three quarters of the year but though he can endure hunger like all  p117 savages he will gorge when an opportunity offers i never saw the man who could refrain from water upon the line of march and in this point they contrast disadvantageously with the hardy wahhabis of the east and the rugged mountaineers of jabal shammar they are still “acridophagi” and even the citizens far prefer a dish of locusts to the fasikh which act as anchovies sardines and herrings in egypt they light a fire at night and as the insects fall dead they quote this couplet to justify their being eaten—  “we are allowed two carrions and two bloods the fish and locust the liver and the spleenfn55”  where they have no crops to lose the people are thankful for a fall of locusts in alhijaz the flights are uncertain during the last five years almadinah has seen but few they are prepared for eating by boiling in salt water and drying four or five days in the sun a “wet” locust to an arab is as a snail to a briton the head is plucked off the stomach drawn the wings and the prickly part of the legs are plucked and the insect is ready for the table locusts are never eaten with sweet things which would be nauseous the dish is always “hot” with salt and pepper or onions fried in clarified butter when it tastes nearly as well as a plate of stale shrimps  the favourite food on the line of march is meat cut into strips and sundried this with a bag of milkballsfn56  p118 and a little coffee must suffice for journey or campaign the badawin know neither fermented nor distilled liquors although ikhs ya’l khammar fie upon thee drunkard is a popular phrase preserving the memory of another state of things some clans though not all smoke tobacco it is generally the growth of the country called hijazi or kazimiyah a green weed very strong with a foul smell and costing about one piastre per pound the badawin do not relish persian tobacco and cannot procure latakia it is probably the pungency of the native growth offending the delicate organs of the desertmen that caused nicotiana to be proscribed by the wahhabis who revived against its origin a senseless and obsolete calumny  the almost absolute independence of the arabs and of that noble race the north american indians of a former generation has produced a similarity between them worthy of note because it may warn the anthropologist not always to detect in coincidence of custom identity of origin both have the same wild chivalry the same fiery sense of honour and the same boundless hospitality elopements from tribe to tribe the blood feud and the vendetta are common to the to both are grave and cautious in demeanour and formal in manner—princes in rags or paint the arabs plunder pilgrims the indians bands of trappers both glory in forays raids and cattlelifting and both rob according to certain rules both are alternately brave to desperation and shy of danger both are remarkable for nervous and powerful eloquence dry humour satire whimsical tales frequent tropes boasts and ruffling style pithy proverbs extempore songs and languages wondrous in their complexity both recognising no other occupation but war and the chase despise artificers and the effeminate people of cities as the gamecock spurns the vulgar roosters of the poultryyardfn57 the p119 chivalry of the western wolds like that of the eastern wilds salutes the visitor by a charge of cavalry by discharging guns and by wheeling around him with shouts and yells the “brave” stamps a red hand upon his mouth to show that he has drunk the blood of a foe of the utaybah “harami” it is similarly related that after mortal combat he tastes the dead man’s gore  of these two chivalrous races of barbarians the badawi claims our preference on account of his treatment of women his superior development of intellect and the glorious page of history which he has filled  the tribes of alhijaz are tediously numerous it will be sufficient to enumerate the principal branches of the badawi tree without detailing the hundred little offshoots which it has put forth in the course of agesfn58  those ancient clans the abs and adnan have almost died out the latter it is said still exists in the neighbourhood of taif and the abs i am informed are to be found near kusayr cosseir on the african coast but not in alhijaz of the aus khazraj and nazir details have been given in a previous chapter the benu harb is now the ruling clan in the holy land it is divided by genealogists into two great bodies first the benu salim and secondly the masruhfn59 or “roaming tribes”  p120the benu salim again have eight subdivisions viz—  1 ahamidah ahmadifn60 this clan owns for chief shaykh sa’ad of the mountains it is said to contain about 3500 men its principal subclan is the hadari 2 hawazim hazimi the rival tribe 3000 in number it is again divided into muzayni and zahiri 3 sobh sobhi 3500 habitat near albadr 4 salaymah salimi also called aulad salim 5 sa’adin sa’adani 6 mahamid mahmadi 8000 7 rahalah rihayli 1000 8 timam tamimi  the masruh tree splits into two great branches benu auf and benu amurfn61 the former is a large clan extending from wady nakia arabic near nijd to rabigh and almadinah they have few horses but many dromedaries camels and sheep and are much feared by the people on account of their warlike and savage character they separate into ten subdivisions viz—  1  sihliyah sihli about 2000 in number 2  sawaid sa’idi 1000 3  rukhasah rakhis 4  kassanin kassan this subclan claims origin from the old “gassan” stock and is found in considerable numbers at wady nakia and other places near almadinah 5  ruba’ah rabai 6  khazarah khuzayri 7  lahabah lahaybi 1500 in number 8  faradah faradi 9  benu ali alawi 10 zubayd zubaydi near meccah a numerous clan of fighting thieves  also under the benu amur—as the word is popularly pronounced—are ten subfamilies  1  marabitah murabti they nrs 15 principally inhabit the land about alfara arabic a collection of settlements four marches south of almadinah number about 10000 men and have droves of sheep and camels but few horses 2  hussar hasir 3  benu jabir jabiri p121 4  rabaykah rubayki  5  hisnan hasuni 6  bizan bayzani 7  badarin badrani 8  biladiyah biladi 9  jaham the singular and plural forms are the same 10 shatarah shitayrifn62   the great anizah race now i was told inhabits khaybar and it must not visit almadinah without a rafik or protector properly speaking there are no outcasts in alhijaz as in alyaman and the somali country but the hitman pl of hutaym or hitaym inhabiting the seaboard about yambu’ are taxed by other badawin as low and vile of origin the unchastity of the women is connived at by the men who however are brave and celebrated as marksmen they make eat and sell cheese for which reason that food is despised by the harb and the khalawiyah pl of khalawi are equally despised they are generally blacksmiths have a fine breed of greyhounds and give asses as a dowry which secures for them the derision of their fellows  mr c cole h b m’s viceconsul at jeddah was kind enough to collect for me notices of the different tribes in central and southern hijaz his informants divide the great clan juhaynah living about yambu’ and yambu’ alnakhl into five branches viz—  1  benu ibrahimah in number about 5000 2  ishran 700 3  benu malik 6000 p122 4  arwah 5000 5  kaunah 3000 thus giving a total of 19700 men capable of carrying armsfn63  the same gentleman whose labours in eastern arabia during the coast survey of the “palinurus” are well known to the indian world gives the following names of the tribes under allegiance to the sharif of meccah  1  sakif thakif alyaman 2000 2  sakif alshamfn64 1000 3  benu malik 6000 4  nasirah 3000 5  benu sa’ad 4000 6  huzayh hudhayh 5000 7  bakum begoum 5000 8  adudah 500 9  bashar 1000 10 sa’id 1500 11 zubayd 4000 12 aydah 1000   the following is a list of the southern hijazi tribes kindly forwarded to me by the abbe hamilton after his return from a visit to the sharif at taif  1  ghamid albadawy “of the nomades” 30000 2  ghamid alhazar “the settled” 40000 3  zahran 38000 4  benu malik 30000 5  nasirah 15000 6  asir 40000 7  tamum  8  bilkarn     together 80000 9  benu ahmar 10000 10 utaybah living north of meccah no number given 11 shu’abin 12 daraysh 2000 p123 13 benu sufyan 15000 14 alhullad 3000   it is evident that the numbers given by this traveller include the women and probably the children of the tribes some exaggeration will also be suspected  the principal clans which practise the pagan salkh or excoriation are in alhijaz the huzayl and the benu sufyan together with the following families in altahamah  1  juhadilah 2  kabakah 3  benu fahm 4  benu mahmud 5  saramu  6  majarish 7  benu yazid   i now take leave of a subject which cannot but be most uninteresting to english readers  fn1 in holy writ as the indigens are not alluded to—only the noachian race being described—we find two divisions 1 the children of joktan great grandson of shem mesopotamians settled in southern arabia “from mesha musa or meccah to sephar” zafar a “mount of the east”—genesis x 30 that is to say they occupied the lands from altahamah to mahrah 2 the children of ishmael and his egyptian wife they peopled only the wilderness of paran in the sinaitic peninsula and the parts adjacent dr aloys sprenger life of mohammed p 18 throws philosophic doubt upon the ishmaelitish descent of mohammed who in personal appearance was a pure caucasian without any mingling of egyptian blood and the ishmaelitish origin of the whole arab race is an utterly untenable theory years ago our great historian sensibly remarked that “the name saracens used by ptolemy and pliny in a more confined by ammianus and procopius in a larger sense has been derived ridiculously from sarah the wife of abraham” in gibbon’s observation the erudite interpreter of the one primaeval language—the acute bibliologist who metamorphoses the quail of the wilderness into a “ruddy goose”—detects “insidiousness” and “a spirit of restless and rancorous hostility” against revealed religion he proceeds on these sound grounds to attack the accuracy the honesty and the learning of the mighty dead this may be christian zeal it is not christian charity of late years it has been the fashion for every aspirant to ecclesiastical honours to deal a blow at the ghost of gibbon and as has before been remarked mr foster gratuitously attacked burckhardt whose manes had long rested in the goodwill of man this contrasts offensively with lord lindsay’s happy compliment to the memory of the honest swiss and the amiable eulogy quoted by dr keith from the quarterly vol xxiii and thus adopted as his own it may seem folly to defend the historian of the decline and fall against the compiler of the historical geography of arabia but continental orientalists have expressed their wonder at the appearance in this nineteenth century of the “voice of israel from mount sinai” and the “india in greece” they should be informed that all our eastern students are not votaries of such obsolete vagaries fn2 this is said without any theory according to all historians of long inhabited lands the advenae—whether migratory tribes or visitors—find indigens or greek fn3 they are described as having small heads with low brows and illformed noses strongly contrasting with the jewish feature irregular lines black skins and frames for the most part frail and slender for a physiological description of this race i must refer my readers to the writings of dr carter of bombay the medical officer of the palinurus when engaged on the survey of eastern arabia with ample means of observation he has not failed to remark the similarity between the lowest type of badawi and the indigens of india as represented by the bhils and other jungle races this from a man of science who is not writing up to a theory may be considered strong evidence in favour of variety in the arabian family the fact has long been suspected but few travellers have given their attention to the subject since the downfall of sir william jones’ indian origin theory i am convinced that there is not in arabia “one arab face cast of features and expression” as was formerly supposed to be the case and i venture to recommend the subject for consideration to future observers fn4 of this mesopotamian race there are now many local varieties the subjects of the four abyssinian and christian sovereigns who succeeded yusuf the jewish “lord of the pit” produced in alyaman the modern “akhdam” or “serviles” the “hujur” of alyaman and oman are a mixed race whose origin is still unknown and to quote no more cases the “ebna” mentioned by the ibn ishak were descended from the persian soldiers of anushirwan who expelled the abyssinian invader fn5 that the copts or ancient egyptians were “halfcaste arabs” a mixed people like the abyssinians the gallas the somal and the kafirs an arab graft upon an african stock appears highly probable hence the old nilotic race has been represented as woollyheaded and of negro feature thus leo africanus makes the africans to be descendants of the arabs hence the tradition that egypt was peopled by aethiopia and has been gradually whitened by admixture of persian and median greek and roman blood hence too the fancied connection of aethiopia with cush susiana khuzistan or the lands about the tigris thus learned virgil confounding the western with the eastern aethiopians alludes to  “usque coloratos nilus devexus ad indos”  and strabo maintains the people of mauritania to be indians who had come with hercules we cannot but remark in southern arabia the footprints of the hindu whose superstitions like the phoenix which flew from india to expire in egypt passed over to arabia with dwipa sukhatra socotra for a resting place on its way to the regions of the remotest west as regards the difference between the japhetic and semitic tongues it may be remarked that though nothing can be more distinct than sanscrit and arabic yet that pahlavi and hebrew prof bohlen on genesis present some remarkable points of resemblance i have attempted in a work on sind to collect words common to both families and further research convinces me that such vocables as the arabic taur arabic the persian tora persian and the latin “taurus” denote an ancient rapprochement whose mysteries still invite the elucidation of modern science fn6 the sharif families affect marrying female slaves thereby showing the intense pride which finds no arab noble enough for them others take to wife badawi girls their blood therefore is by no means pure the worst feature of their system is the forced celibacy of their daughters they are never married into any but sharif families consequently they often die in spinsterhood the effects of this custom are most pernicious for though celibacy exists in the east it is by no means synonymous with chastity here it springs from a morbid sense of honour and arose it is popularly said from an affront taken by a sharif against his daughter’s husband but all arabs condemn the practice fn7 i use this word as popular abuse has fixed it every orientalist knows that badawin bedouin is the plural form of badawi an “ism alnisbah” or adjective derived from badu a desert “some words notoriously corrupt” says gibbon “are fixed and as it were naturalised in the vulgar tongue” the word “badawi” is not insulting like “turk” applied to an osmanli or “fellah” to the egyptian but you affront the wild man by mistaking his clan for a lower one “ya hitaymi” for instance addressed to a harb badawi makes him finger his dagger fn8 this coarseness is not a little increased by a truly badawi habit of washing the locks with—arabic it is not considered wholly impure and is also used for the eyes upon which its ammonia would act as a rude stimulant the only cosmetic is clarified butter freely applied to the body as well as to the hair fn9 “kurun” arabic properly means “horns” the sharifs generally wear their hair in “haffah” arabic long locks hanging down both sides of the neck and shaved away about a finger’s breadth round the forehead and behind the neck fn10 this traveller describes the modern mesopotamian and northern race which as its bushy beard—unusual feature in pure arab blood—denotes is mixed with central asian in the north as might be expected the camels are hairy whereas in alhijaz and in the low parts of alyaman a whole animal does not give a handful fit for weaving the arabs attribute this as we should to heat which causes the longer hairs to drop off fn11 “magnum inter arabes et africanos discrimen efficit greek arabum parvula membra sicut nobilis aequi africanum tamen flaccum crassum longumque ita quiescens erectum tamen parum distenditur argumentum validissimum est ad indagandam egyptorum originem nilotica enim gens membrum habet africanum” fn12 whereas the saxon thumb is thick flat and short extending scarcely half way to the middle joint of the index fn13 a similar unwillingness to name the wife may be found in some parts of southern europe where probably jealousy or possibly asiatic custom has given rise to it among the maltese it appears in a truly ridiculous way eg “dice la mia moglie con rispetto parlando c” says the husband adding to the word spouse a “saving your presence” as if he were speaking of something offensive fn14 dr howe report on idiotcy in massachusetts 1848 asserts that “the law against the marriage of relations is made out as clearly as though it were written on tables of stone” he proceeds to show that in seventeen households where the parents were connected by blood of ninetyfive children one was a dwarf one deaf twelve scrofulous and fortyfour idiots—total fiftyeight diseased fn15 yet the celebrated “flying childers” and all his race were remarkably bred in there is still in my humble opinion much mystery about the subject to be cleared up only by the studies of physiologists fn16 this sounds in english like an “irish bull” i translate “badu” as the dictionaries do “a desert” fn17 the sharbat kajari is the “acquetta” of persia and derives its name from the present royal family it is said to be a mixture of verdigris with milk if so it is a very clumsy engine of state policy in egypt and mosul sulaymani the common name for an afghan is used to signify “poison” but i know not whether it be merely euphuistic or confined to some species the banks of the nile are infamous for these arts and mohammed ali pasha imported it is said professional poisoners from europe fn18 throughout the world the strictness of the lex scripta is in inverse ratio to that of custom whenever the former is lax the latter is stringent and vice versa thus in england where law leaves men comparatively free they are slaves to a grinding despotism of conventionalities unknown in the land of tyrannical rule this explains why many men accustomed to live under despotic governments feel fettered and enslaved in the socalled free countries hence also the reason why notably in a republic there is less private and practical liberty than under a despotism the “kazi alarab” judge of the arabs is in distinction to the kazi alshara or the kazi of the koran the former is almost always some sharpwitted greybeard with a minute knowledge of genealogy and precedents a retentive memory and an eloquent tongue fn19 thus the arabs being decidedly a parsimonious people indulge in exaggerated praises and instances of liberality hatim tai whose generosity is unintelligible to europeans becomes the arab model of the “open hand” generally a high beau ideal is no proof of a people’s practical preeminence and when exaggeration enters into it and suits the public taste a low standard of actuality may be fairly suspected but to convince the oriental mind you must dazzle it hence in part the superhuman courage of antar the liberality of hatim the justice of omar and the purity of laila and majnun under circumstances more trying than aught chronicled in mathilde or in the newest american novel fn20 at the battle of bissel when mohammed ali of egypt broke the 40000 guerillas of faisal son of sa’ud the wahhabi whole lines of the benu asir tribe were found dead and tied by the legs with ropes this system of colligation dates from old times in arabia as the “affair of chains” zat alsalasil proves it is alluded to by the late sir henry elliot in his “appendix to the arabs in sind”—a work of remarkable sagacity and research according to the “beglarnameh” it was a “custom of the people of hind and sind whenever they devote themselves to death to bind themselves to each other by their mantles and waistbands” it seems to have been an ancient practice in the west as in the east the cimbri to quote no other instances were tied together with cords when attacked by marius tactic truly worthy of savages to prepare for victory by expecting a defeat fn21 though differing in opinion upon one subject from the rev mr robertson the lamented author of this little work i cannot refrain from expressing the highest admiration of those noble thoughts those exalted views and those polished sentiments which combining the delicacy of the present with the chivalry of a past age appear in a style  “as smooth as woman and as strong as man”  would that it were in my power to pay a more adequate tribute to his memory fn22 even juno in the most meaningless of idolatries became according to pausanias lib ii cap 38 a virgin once every year and be it observed that alislam the faith not the practice popularly decided to debase the social state of womankind exalts it by holding up to view no fewer than two examples of perfection in the prophet’s household khadijah his first wife was a minor saint and the lady fatimah is supposed to have been spiritually unspotted by sin and materially ever a virgin even after giving birth to hasan and to hosayn fn23 there is no objection to intermarriage between equal clans but the higher will not give their daughters to the lower in dignity fn24 for instance “a certain religious man was so deeply affected with the love of a king’s daughter that he was brought to the brink of the grave” is a favourite inscriptive formula usually the hero “sickens in consequence of the heroine’s absence and continues to the hour of his death in the utmost grief and anxiety” he rarely kills himself but sometimes when in love with a pretty infidel he drinks wine and he burns the koran the “hated rival” is not a formidable person but there are for good reasons great jealousy of female friends and not a little fear of the beloved’s kinsmen such are the material sentiments the spiritual part is a thread of mysticism upon which all the pearls of adventure and incident are strung fn25 it is curious that these pastoral races which supply poetry with nambypamby colinades figure as the great tragedians of history the scythians the huns the arabs and the tartars were all shepherds they first armed themselves with clubs to defend their flocks from wild beasts then they learned warfare and improved means of destruction by petty quarrels about pastures and finally united by the commanding genius of some skinclad caesar or napoleon they fell like avalanches upon those valleys of the world—mesopotamia india and egypt—whose enervate races offered them at once temptations to attack and certainty of success fn26 even amongst the indians as a race the least chivalrous of men there is an oath which binds two persons of different sex in the tie of friendship by making them brother and sister to each other fn27 richardson derives our “knight” from nikht arabic a tilter with spears and “caitiff” from khattaf arabic a snatcher or ravisher fn28 i am not ignorant that the greater part of “antar” is of modern and disputed origin still it accurately expresses arab sentiment fn29 i wish that the clever orientalist who writes in the saturday review would not translate “allayl” by lenes sub nocte susurri the arab bard alluded to no such effeminacies fn30 the subject of “dakhl” has been thoroughly exhausted by burckhardt and layard it only remains to be said that the turks through ignorance of the custom have in some cases made themselves contemptible by claiming the protection of women fn31 it is by no means intended to push this comparison of the arab’s with the hibernian’s poetry the former has an intensity which prevents our feeling that “there are too many flowers for the fruit” the latter is too often a mere blaze of words which dazzle and startle but which decomposed by reflection are found to mean nothing witness  “the diamond turrets of shadukiam and the fragrant bowers of amberabad”  fn32 i am informed that the benu kahtan still improvise but i never heard them the traveller in arabia will always be told that some remote clan still produces mighty bards and uses in conversation the terminal vowels of the classic tongue but he will not believe these assertions till personally convinced of their truth the badawi dialect however though debased is still as of yore purer than the language of the citizens during the days when philology was a passion in the east those stephens and johnsons of semitic lore firuzabadi and alzamakhshari wandered from tribe to tribe and from tent to tent collecting words and elucidating disputed significations their grammatical expeditions are still remembered and are favourite stories with scholars fn33 i say “skilful in reading” because the arabs like the spaniards hate to hear their language mangled by mispronunciation when burckhardt who spoke badly began to read verse to the badawin they could not refrain from a movement of impatience and used to snatch the book out of his hands fn34 the civilized poets of the arab cities throw the charm of the desert over their verse by images borrowed from its scenery—the dromedary the mirage and the well—as naturally as certain of our songsters confessedly haters of the country babble of lowing kine shady groves spring showers and purling rills fn35 some will object to this expression arabic being a harsh and guttural tongue but the sound of language in the first place depends chiefly upon the articulator who thinks german rough in the mouth of a woman with a suspicion of a lisp or that english is the dialect of birds when spoken by an italian secondly there is a music far more spiritstirring in harshness than in softness the languages of castile and of tuscany are equally beautiful yet who does not prefer the sound of the former the gutturality of arabia is less offensive than that of the highlands of barbary professor willis of cambridge attributes the broad sounds and the guttural consonants of mountaineers and the people of elevated plains to the physical action of cold conceding this to be a partial cause i would rather refer the phenomenon to the habit of loud speaking acquired by the dwellers in tents and by those who live much in the open air the todas of the neilgherry hills have given the soft tamil all the harshness of arabic and he who hears them calling to each other from the neighbouring peaks can remark the process of broadening vowel and gutturalising consonant on the other hand the gallas and the persians also a mountainpeople but inhabiting houses speak comparatively soft tongues the cairenes actually omit some of the harshest sounds of arabia turning makass into ma’as and sakka into sa’a it is impossible to help remarking the bellowing of the badawi when he first enters a dwellingplace and the softening of the sound when he has become accustomed to speak within walls moreover it is to be observed there is a great difference of articulation not pronunciation among the several badawi clans the benu auf are recognised by their sharp loud and sudden speech which the citizens compare to the barking of dogs the benu amr on the contrary speak with a soft and drawling sound the hutaym in addition to other peculiarities add a pleonastic “ah” to soften the termination of words as a’atini hawajiyah for hawaiji “give me my clothes” fn36 the germans have returned for inspiration to the old eastern source ruckert was guided by jalal aldin to the fountains of sufyism and even the french have of late made an inroad into teutonic mysticism successfully enough to have astonished racine and horrified la harpe fn37 this however does not prevent the language becoming optionally most precise in meaning hence its high philosophical character the word “farz” for instance means radically “cutting” secondarily “ordering” or “paying a debt” after which come numerous meanings foreign to the primal sense such as a shield part of a tinderbox an unfeathered arrow and a particular kind of date in theology it is limited to a single signification namely a divine command revealed in the koran under these circumstances the arabic becomes in grammar logic rhetoric and mathematics as perfect and precise as greek i have heard europeans complain that it is unfit for mercantile transactions—perhaps fn38 as a general rule there is a rhyme at the end of every second line and the unison is a mere fringe—a long a for instance throughout the poem sufficing for the delicate ear of the arab in this they were imitated by the old spaniards who neglecting the consonants merely required the terminating vowels to be alike we speak of the “sort of harmonious simple flow which atones for the imperfect nature of the rhyme” but the fine organs of some races would be hurt by that ponderous unison which a people of blunter senses find necessary to produce an impression the reader will feel this after perusing in “percy’s reliques” rio verde rio verde and its translation fn39 in our knightly ages the mare was ridden only by jugglers and charlatans did this custom arise from the hatred of and contempt for the habits of the arabs imported into europe by the crusaders certainly the popular eastern idea of a frank was formed in those days and survives to these fn40 baron von hammerpurgstall in the “falknerklee” calls this bird the “sakerfalke” hence the french and english names sacre and saker the learned john beckmann history of inventions discoveries and origins sub voce derives falconry from india where “as early as the time of ctesias hares and foxes were hunted by means of rapacious birds” i believe however that no trace of this sport is found in the writings of the hindus beckmann agrees with giraldus against other literati that the ancient greeks knew the art of hawking and proves from aristotle that in thrace men trained falcons but aristotle alludes to the use of the bird as an owl is employed in italy the falcon is described as frightening not catching the birds Œlian corroborates aristotle’s testimony pliny however distinctly asserts that the hawks strike their prey down “in italy it was very common” says the learned beckmann “for martial and apuleius speak of it as a thing everywhere known hence the science spread over europe and reached perfection at the principal courts in the twelfth century” the emperor frederic ii wrote “de arte venandi cum avibus” and the royal author was followed by a host of imitators in the vulgar tongue though i am not aware that the hindus ever cultivated the art Œlian it must be confessed describes their style of training falcons exactly similar to that in use among the modern persians sindians and arabs the emperor frederic owes the “capella” or hood to the badawi and talks of the “most expert falconers” sent to him with various kinds of birds by some of the kings of arabia the origin of falconry is ascribed by almas’udi on the authority of adham bin muhriz to the king alharis bin mu’awiyah and in dr sprenger’s admirable translation the reader will find pp 426 428 much information upon the subject the persians claim the invention for their just king anushirawan contemporary with mohammed thence the sport passed into turkey where it is said the sultans maintained a body of 6000 falconers and frederic barbarossa in the twelfth century brought falcons to italy we may fairly give the honour of the invention to central asia fn41 here called “bandukiyah bi ruhayn” or the twomouthed gun the leathern cover is termed “gushat” it is a bag with a longringed tassel at the top of the barrel and a strap by which it is slung to the owner’s back fn42 i described elsewhere the mirzak or javelin fn43 ostriches are found in alhijaz where the badawin shoot after coursing them the young ones are caught and tamed and the eggs may be bought in the madinah bazar throughout arabia there is a belief that the ostrich throws stones at the hunter the superstition may have arisen from the pebbles being flung up behind by the bird’s large feet in his rapid flight or it may be a mere “foolery of fancy” even in lands which have long given up animalworship wherever a beast is conspicuous or terrible it becomes the subject of some marvellous tale so the bear in persia imitates a moolah’s dress the wolf in france is a human being transformed and the beaver of north america also a metamorphosis belts trees so as to fell them in the direction most suitable to his after purpose fn44 not that the “agrebi” of bir hamid and other parts have much to learn of us in vice the land of alyaman is i believe the most demoralised country and sana’a the most depraved city in arabia the fair sex distinguishes itself by a peculiar laxity of conduct which is looked upon with an indulgent eye and the men drink and gamble to say nothing of other peccadilloes with perfect impunity fn45 in alyaman it is believed that if a man eat three heads of garlic in good mountainsamn or clarified butter for forty days his blood will kill the snake that draws it fn46 circumcisionis causa apud arabos

the maria theresa the spanish government has refused to perpetuate its pillardollar which at one time was so great a favourite in the east the traveller wonders how “maria theresas” still supply both shores of the red sea the marvel is easily explained the austrians receive silver at milan and stamp it for a certain percentage this coin was doubtless preferred by the badawin for its superiority to the currency of the day they make from it ornaments for their women and decorations for their weapons the generic term for dollars is “riyal fransah” fn48 torale sicut est mos judaicus et persicus non

means “rising up in rebellion or enmity against” as well as the popular signification a “people” in some parts of arabia it is used for a “plundering party” fn51 bayt in the plural buyut is used in this sense to denote the tents of the nomades “bayt” radically means a “nightingplace” thence a tent a house a lair c c fn52 some tribes will not sell their sheep keeping them for guests or feasts fn53 so the word is pronounced at meccah the dictionaries give “aakal” which in eastern arabia is corrupted to “igal” fn54 called “tatarif” plural of tatrifah a cartridge fn55 the liver and the spleen are both supposed to be “congealed blood” niebuhr has exhausted the names and the description of the locust in alhijaz they have many local and fantastic terms the smallest kind for instance is called jarad iblis satan’s locust fn56 this is the kurut of sind and the kashk of persia the buttermilk separated from the butter by a little water is simmered over a slow fire thickened with wheaten flour about a handful to a gallon wellmixed so that no knots remain in it and allowed to cool the mixture is then put into a bag and strained after which salt is sprinkled over it the mass begins to harden after a few hours when it is made up into balls and dried in the sun fn57 the north american trappers adopted this natural prejudice the “free trapper” called his more civilized confrere “mangeur de lard” fn58 burckhardt shrank from the intricate pedigree of the meccan sharifs i have seen a work upon the subject in four folio volumes in point of matter equivalent to treble the number in europe the best known genealogical works are alkalkashandi originally in seventyfive books extended to one hundred the umdat altullab by ibn khaldun the “tohfat alarab fi ansar alarab” a wellknown volume by alsiyuti and lastly the sirat alhalabi in six volumes 8vo of the latter work there is an abridgment by mohammed albanna aldimyati in two volumes 8vo but both are rare and consequently expensive fn59 i

bayzanah 800 7  benu yahya 800 and he makes the total of the benu harb about aljadaydah amount to 35000 men i had no means of personally ascertaining the correctness of this information fn63 the reader will remember that nothing like exactitude in numbers can be expected from an arab some rate the benu harb at 6000 others equally well informed at 15000 others again at 80000 the reason of this is that whilst one is speaking of the whole race another may be limiting it to his own tribe and its immediate allies fn64 “sham” which properly speaking means damascus or syria in southern arabia and eastern africa is universally applied to alhijaz  p124 chapter xxvi  from alsuwayrkiyah to meccah  we have now left the territory of almadinah alsuwayrkiyah which belongs to the sharif of meccah is about twentyeight miles distant from hijriyah and by dead reckoning ninetynine miles along the road from the prophet’s burialplace its bearing from the last station was sw 11° the town consisting of about one hundred houses is built at the base and on the sides of a basaltic mass which rises abruptly from the hard clayey plain the summit is converted into a rude fortalice—without one no settlement can exist in alhijaz—by a bulwark of uncut stone piled up so as to make a parapet the lower part of the town is protected by a mud wall with the usual semicircular towers inside there is a bazar well supplied with meat principally mutton by the neighbouring badawin and wheat barley and dates are grown near the town there is little to describe in the narrow streets and the mud houses which are essentially arab the fields around are divided into little square plots by earthen ridges and stone walls some of the palms are finegrown trees and the wells appear numerous the water is near the surface and plentiful but it has a brackish taste highly disagreeable after a few days’ use and the effects are the reverse of chalybeate  the town belongs to the benu hosayn a race of  p125 schismatics mentioned in the foregoing pages they claim the allegiance of the badawi tribes around principally mutayr and i was informed that their fealty to the prince of meccah is merely nominal   the morning after our arrival at alsuwayrkiyah witnessed a commotion in our little party hitherto they had kept together in fear of the road among the number was one ali bin ya sin a perfect “old man of the sea” by profession he was a “zemzemi” or dispenser of water from the holy wellfn1 and he had a handsome “palazzo” at the foot of abu kubays in meccah which he periodically converted into a boardinghouse though past sixty very decrepit bent by age whitebearded and toothless he still acted cicerone to pilgrims and for that purpose travelled once every year to almadinah these trips had given him the cunning of a veteran voyageur he lived well and cheaply his homemade shugduf the model of comfort was garnished with soft cushions and pillows whilst from the pockets protruded select bottles of pickled limes and similar luxuries he had his travelling shishah waterpipefn2 and at the haltingplace disdaining the crowded reeking tent he had a contrivance for converting his vehicle into a habitation he was a type of the arab old man he mumbled all day and threequarters of the night for he had des insomnies his nerves were so fine that if any  p126 one mounted his shugduf the unfortunate was condemned to lie like a statue fidgety and priggishly neat nothing annoyed him so much as a moment’s delay or an article out of place a rag removed from his watergugglet or a cookingpot imperfectly free from soot and i judged his avarice by observing that he made a point of picking up and eating the grains scattered from our pomegranates exclaiming that the heavenly seed located there by arab superstition might be one of those so wantonly wasted   ali bin ya sin returning to his native city had not been happy in his choice of a companion this time the other occupant of the handsome shugduf was an ignoblefaced egyptian from almadinah this illsuited pair clave together for awhile but at alsuwayrkiyah some dispute about a copper coin made them permanent foes with threats and abuse such as none but an egyptian could tamely hear ali kicked his quondam friend out of the vehicle but terrified after reflection by the possibility that the man now his enemy might combine with two or three syrians of our party to do him a harm and frightened by a few black looks the senior determined to fortify himself by a friend connected with the boy mohammed’s family he easily obtained an introduction to me he kissed my hand with great servility declared that his servant had behaved disgracefully and begged my protection together with an occasional attendance of my “slave”  this was readily granted in pity for the old man who became immensely grateful he offered at once to take shaykh nur into his shugduf the indian boy had already reduced to ruins the frail structure of his shibriyah by lying upon it lengthways whereas prudent travellers sit in it crosslegged and facing the camel moreover he had been laughed to scorn by the badawin who seeing him pull up his dromedary to mount and dismount had questioned his sex and determined him to be  p127 a woman of the “miyanfn3” i could not rebuke them the poor fellow’s timidity was a ridiculous contrast to the badawi’s style of mounting a pull at the camel’s head the left foot placed on the neck an agile spring and a scramble into the saddle shaykh nur elated by the sight of old ali’s luxuries promised himself some joyous hours but next morning he owned with a sigh that he had purchased splendour at the extravagant price of happiness—the senior’s tongue never rested throughout the livelong night  during our halfhalt at alsuwayrkiyah we determined to have a small feast we bought some fresh dates and we paid a dollar and a half for a sheep hungry travellers consider “liver and fry” a dish to set before a shaykh on this occasion however our enjoyment was marred by the water even soyer’s dinners would scarcely charm if washed down with cups of a certain mineralspring found at epsom  we started at ten am monday 5th september in a southeasterly direction and travelled over a flat thinly dotted with desert vegetation at one pm we passed a basaltic ridge and then entering a long depressed line of country a kind of valley paced down it five tedious hours the samum as usual was blowing hard and it seemed to affect the travellers’ tempers in one place i saw a turk who could not speak a word of arabic violently disputing with an arab who could not understand a word of turkish the pilgrim insisted upon adding to the camel’s load a few dry sticks such as are picked up for cooking the camelman as perseveringly threw off the extra burthen they screamed with rage hustled each other and at last the turk dealt the arab a heavy blow i afterwards heard that the pilgrim was mortally wounded that night his stomach being ripped  p128 open with a dagger on enquiring what had become of him i was assured that he had been comfortably wrapped up in his shroud and placed in a halfdug grave this is the general practice in the case of the poor and solitary whom illness or accident incapacitates from proceeding it is impossible to contemplate such a fate without horror the torturing thirst of a woundfn4 the burning sun heating the brain to madness and—worst of all for they do not wait till death—the attacks of the jackal the vulture and the raven of the wild   at six pm before the light of day had faded we traversed a rough and troublesome ridge descending it our course lay in a southerly direction along a road flanked on the left by low hills of red sandstone and bright porphyry about an hour afterwards we came to a basalt field through whose blocks we threaded our way painfully and slowly for it was then dark at eight pm the camels began to stumble over the dwarf dykes of the wheat and barley fields and presently we arrived at our haltingplace a large village called alsufayna the plain was already dotted with tents and lights we found the baghdad caravan whose route here falls into the darb alsharki it consists of a few persians and kurds and collects the people of northeastern arabia wahhabis and others they are escorted by the agayl tribe and by the fierce mountaineers of jabal shammar scarcely was our tent pitched when the distant pattering of musketry and an ominous tapping of the kettledrum sent all my companions in different directions to enquire what was the cause of quarrel the baghdad cafilah though not more than 2000 in number men women and children had been proving to the damascus caravan that being perfectly ready to fight they were not going to yield any point of precedence from that time the two bodies  p129 encamped in different places i never saw a more pugnacious assembly a look sufficed for a quarrel once a wahhabi stood in front of us and by pointing with his finger and other insulting gestures showed his hatred to the chibuk in which i was peaceably indulging it was impossible to refrain from chastising his insolence by a polite and smiling offer of the offending pipe this made him draw his dagger without a thought but it was sheathed again for we all cocked our pistols and these gentry prefer steel to lead we had travelled about seventeen miles and the direction of alsufayna from our last halting place was southeast five degrees though it was night when we encamped shaykh mas’ud set out to water his moaning camels they had not quenched their thirst for three days he returned in a depressed state having been bled by the soldiery at the well to the extent of forty piastres or about eight shillings  after supper we spread our rugs and prepared to rest and here i first remarked the coolness of the nights proving at this season of the year a considerable altitude above the sea as a general rule the atmosphere stagnated between sunrise and ten am when a light wind rose during the forenoon the breeze strengthened and it gradually diminished through the afternoon often about sunset there was a gale accompanied by dry storms of dust at alsufayna though there was no nightbreeze and little dew a blanket was necessary and the hours of darkness were invigorating enough to mitigate the effect of the sand and samumridden day before sleeping i was introduced to a namesake one shaykh abdullah of meccah having committed his shugduf to his son a lad of fourteen he had ridden forward on a dromedary and had suddenly fallen ill his objects in meeting me were to ask for some medicine and for a temporary seat in my shugduf the latter i offered with pleasure as the boy mohammed was  p130 longing to mount a camel the shaykh’s illness was nothing but weakness brought on by the hardships of the journey he attributed it to the hot wind and to the weight of a bag of dollars which he had attached to his waistbelt he was a man about forty long thin pale and of a purely nervous temperament and a few questions elicited the fact that he had lately and suddenly given up his daily opium pill i prepared one for him placed him in my litter and persuaded him to stow away his burden in some place where it would be less troublesome he was my companion for two marches at the end of which he found his own shugduf i never met amongst the arab citizens a better bred or a better informed man at constantinople he had learned a little french italian and greek and from the properties of a shrub to the varieties of honeyfn5 he was full of “ useful knowledge” and openable as a dictionary we parted near meccah where i met him only once and then accidentally in the valley of muna   at halfpast five am on tuesday the 6th of september we rose refreshed by the cool comfortable night and loaded the camels i had an opportunity of inspecting alsufayna it is a village of fifty or sixty mudwalled flatroofed houses defended by the usual rampart around it lie ample dategrounds and fields of wheat barley and maize its bazar at this season of the year is well supplied even fowls can be procured  we travelled towards the southeast and entered a country destitute of the low ranges of hill which from almadinah southwards had bounded the horizon after  p131 a two miles’ march our camels climbed up a precipitous ridge and then descended into a broad gravel plain from ten to eleven am our course lay southerly over a high tableland and we afterwards traversed for five hours and a half a plain which bore signs of standing water this day’s march was peculiarly arabia it was a desert peopled only with echoes—a place of death for what little there is to die in it—a wilderness where to use my companion’s phrase there is nothing but hefn6 nature scalped flayed discovered all her skeleton to the gazer’s eye the horizon was a sea of mirage gigantic sandcolumns whirled over the plain and on both sides of our road were huge piles of bare rock standing detached upon the surface of sand and clay here they appeared in oval lumps heaped up with a semblance of symmetry there a single boulder stood with its narrow foundation based upon a pedestal of low domeshapen rock all were of a pink coarsegrained granite which flakes off in large crusts under the influence of the atmosphere i remarked one block which could not measure fewer than thirty feet in height through these scenes we travelled till about halfpast four pm when the guns suddenly roared a halt there was not a trace of human habitation around us a few parched shrubs and the granite heaps were the only objects diversifying the hard clayey plain shaykh mas’ud correctly guessed the cause of our detention at the inhospitable “haltingplace of the mutayr” badawin “cook your bread and boil your coffee” said the old man “the camels will rest for awhile and the gun will sound at nightfall”   we had passed over about eighteen miles of ground and our present direction was southwest twenty degrees of alsufayna  at halfpast ten that evening we heard the signal for  p132 departure and as the moon was still young we prepared for a hard night’s work we took a southwesterly course through what is called a wa’ar—rough ground covered with thicket darkness fell upon us like a pall the camels tripped and stumbled tossing their litters like cockboats in a short sea at times the shugdufs were well nigh torn off their backs when we came to a ridge worse than usual old mas’ud would seize my camel’s halter and accompanied by his son and nephew bearing lights encourage the animals with gesture and voice it was a strange wild scene the black basaltic field was dotted with the huge and doubtful forms of spongyfooted camels with silent tread looming like phantoms in the midnight air the hot wind moaned and whirled from the torches flakes and sheets of flame and fiery smoke whilst ever and anon a swifttravelling takhtrawan drawn by mules and surrounded by runners bearing gigantic mashals or cressetsfn7 threw a passing glow of red light upon the dark road and the dusky multitude on this occasion the rule was “every man for himself” each pressed forward into the best path thinking only of preceding his neighbour the syrians amongst whom our little party had become entangled proved most unpleasant companions they often stopped the way insisting upon their right to precedence on one occasion a horseman had the audacity to untie the halter of my dromedary and thus to cast us adrift as it were in order to make room for some excluded friend i seized my sword but shaykh abdullah stayed my hand and addressed the intruder in terms sufficiently violent to make him slink away nor was this the only occasion on which my  p133 companion was successful with the syrians he would begin with a mild “move a little o my father” followed if fruitless by “out of the way o father of syriafn8” and if still ineffectual advancing to a “begone o he” this ranged between civility and sternness if without effect it was supported by revilings to the “abusers of the salt” the “yazid” the “offspring of shimr” another remark which i made about my companion’s conduct well illustrates the difference between the eastern and the western man when traversing a dangerous place shaykh abdullah the european attended to his camel with loud cries of “hai haifn9” and an occasional switching shaykh abdullah the asiatic commended himself to allah by repeated ejaculations of ya satir ya sattarfn10  p134the morning of wednesday september 7th broke as we entered a wide plain in many places were signs of water lines of basalt here and there seamed the surface and wide sheets of the tufaceous gypsum called by the arabs sabkhah shone like mirrors set in the russet framework of the flat this substance is found in cakes often a foot long by an inch in depth curled by the sun’s rays and overlying clay into which water had sunk after our harassing night day came on with a sad feeling of oppression greatly increased by the unnatural glare—  “in vain the sight dejected to the ground stoop’d for relief thence hot ascending streams and keen reflection pain’d”  we were disappointed in our expectations of water which usually abounds near this station as its name alghadir denotes at ten am we pitched the tent in the first convenient spot and we lost no time in stretching our cramped limbs upon the bosom of mother earth from the haltingplace of the mutayr to alghadir is a march of about twenty miles and the direction southwest twentyone degrees alghadir is an extensive plain which probably presents the appearance of a lake after heavy rains it is overgrown in parts with desert vegetation and requires nothing but a regular supply of water to make it useful to man on the east it is bounded by a wall of rock at whose base are three wells said to have been dug by the caliph harun they are guarded by a burj or tower which betrays symptoms of decay  in our anxiety to rest we had strayed from the damascus caravan amongst the mountaineers of shammar our shaykh mas’ud manifestly did not like the company for shortly after three pm he insisted upon our striking the tent and rejoining the hajj which lay encamped about two miles distant in the western part of the basin we  p135 loaded therefore and half an hour before sunset found ourselves in more congenial society to my great disappointment a stir was observable in the caravan i at once understood that another nightmarch was in store for us  at six pm we again mounted and turned towards the eastern plain a heavy shower was falling upon the western hills whence came damp and dangerous blasts between nine pm and the dawn of the next day we had a repetition of the last night’s scenes over a road so rugged and dangerous that i wondered how men could prefer to travel in the darkness but the camels of damascus were now worn out with fatigue they could not endure the sun and our time was too precious for a halt my night was spent perched upon the front bar of my shugduf encouraging the dromedary and that we had not one fall excited my extreme astonishment at five am thursday 8th september we entered a wide plain thickly clothed with the usual thorny trees in whose strong grasp many a shugduf lost its covering and not a few were dragged with their screaming inmates to the ground about five hours afterwards we crossed a high ridge and saw below us the camp of the caravan not more than two miles distant as we approached it a figure came running out to meet us it was the boy mohammed who heartily tired of riding a dromedary with his friend and possibly hungry hastened to inform my companion abdullah that he would lead him to his shugduf and to his son the shaykh a little offended by the fact that for two days not a friend nor an acquaintance had taken the trouble to see or to inquire about him received mohammed roughly but the youth guessing the grievance explained it away by swearing that he and all the party had tried in vain to find us this wore the semblance of truth it is almost impossible to come upon any one who strays from his place in so large and motley a body  p136at eleven am we had reached our station it is about wentyfour miles from alghadir and its direction is southeast ten degrees it is called albirkat the tank from a large and now ruinous cistern built of hewn stone by the caliph harunfn11 the land belongs to the utaybah badawin the bravest and most ferocious tribe in alhijaz and the citizens denote their dread of these banditti by asserting that to increase their courage they drink their enemy’s bloodfn12 my companions shook their heads when questioned upon the subject and prayed that we might not become too well acquainted with them—an illomened speech  the pasha allowed us a rest of five hours at albirkat we spent them in my tent which was crowded with shaykh abdullah’s friends to requite me for this inconvenience he prepared for me an excellent waterpipe a cup of coffee which untainted by cloves and by cinnamon would have been delicious and a dish of dry fruits as we were now near the holy city all the meccans were busy canvassing for lodgers and offering their services to pilgrims quarrels too were of hourly occurrence in our party was an arnaut a whitebearded old man so  p137 decrepit that he could scarcely stand and yet so violent that no one could manage him but his african slave a brazenfaced little wretch about fourteen years of age words were bandied between this angry senior and shaykh mas’ud when the latter insinuated sarcastically that if the former had teeth he would be more intelligible the arnaut in his rage seized a pole raised it and delivered a blow which missed the camelman but which brought the striker headlong to the ground mas’ud exclaimed with shrieks of rage “have we come to this that every oldwoman turk smites us” our party had the greatest trouble to quiet the quarrellers the arab listened to us when we threatened him with the pasha but the arnaut whose rage was “like redhot steel” would hear nothing but our repeated declarations that unless he behaved more like a pilgrim we should be compelled to leave him and his slave behind  at four pm we left albirkat and travelled eastwards over rolling ground thickly wooded there was a network of footpaths through the thickets and clouds obscured the moon the consequence was inevitable loss of way about 2 am we began ascending hills in a southwesterly direction and presently we fell into the bed of a large rockgirt fiumara which runs from east to west the sands were overgrown with saline and salsolaceous plants the coloquintida which having no support spreads along the groundfn13 the senna with its small green leaf the rhazya strictafn14 and a large luxuriant variety of the asclepias giganteafn15 cottoned over with  p138 mist and dew at 6 am sept 9th we left the fiumara and turning to the west we arrived about an hour afterwards at the station alzaribah “the valley” is an undulating plain amongst high granite hills in many parts it was faintly green water was close to the surface and rain stood upon the ground during the night we had travelled about twentythree miles and our present station was southeast 56° from our last  having pitched the tent and eaten and slept we prepared to perform the ceremony of alihram assuming the pilgrimgarb as alzaribah is the mikat or the appointed placefn16 between the noonday and the afternoon prayers a barber attended to shave our heads cut our nails and trim our mustachios then having bathed and perfumed ourselves—the latter is a questionable  p139 point—we donned the attire which is nothing but two new cotton cloths each six feet long by three and a half broad white with narrow red stripes and fringes in fact the costume called aleddeh in the baths at cairofn17 one of these sheets technically termed the rida is thrown over the back and exposing the arm and shoulder is knotted at the right side in the style wishah the izar is wrapped round the loins from waist to knee and knotted or tucked in at the middle supports itself our heads were bare and nothing was allowed upon the instepfn18 it is said that some clans of arabs still preserve this religious but most uncomfortable costume it is doubtless of ancient date and to this day in the regions lying west of the red sea it continues to be the common dress of the people  after the toilette we were placed with our faces in the direction of meccah and ordered to say aloudfn19 “i vow this ihram of hajj the pilgrimage and the umrah the little pilgrimage to allah almighty” having thus performed a twobow prayer we repeated without rising from the sitting position these words “o allah verily i purpose the hajj and the umrah then enable me to accomplish the two and accept them both of me and make both blessed to me” followed the talbiyat or exclaiming—  “here i am o allah here am i— no partner hast thou here am i verily the praise and the grace are thine and the empire—  p140 no partner hast thou here am ifn20” and we were warned to repeat these words as often as possible until the conclusion of the ceremonies then shaykh abdullah who acted as director of our consciences bade us be good pilgrims avoiding quarrels immorality bad language and light conversation we must so reverence life that we should avoid killing game causing an animal to fly and even pointing it out for destructionfn21 nor should we scratch ourselves save with the open palm lest vermin be destroyed or a hair uprooted by the nail we were to respect the sanctuary by sparing the trees and not to pluck a single blade of grass as regards personal considerations we were to abstain from all oils perfumes and unguents from washing the head with mallow or with lote leaves from dyeing shaving cutting or vellicating a single pile or hair and though we might take advantage of shade and even form it with upraised hands we must by no means cover our sconces for each infraction of these ordinances we must sacrifice a sheepfn22 and it is commonly said by moslems that none  p141 but the prophet could be perfect in the intricacies of pilgrimage old ali began with an irregularity he declared that age prevented his assuming the garb but that arrived at meccah he would clear himself by an offering  the wife and daughters of a turkish pilgrim of our party assumed the ihram at the same time as ourselves they appeared dresse in white garments and they had exchanged the lisam that coquettish fold of muslin which veils without concealing the lower part of the face for a hideous mask made of split dried and plaited palmleaves with two “bulls’eyes” for lightfn23 i could not help laughing when these strange figures met my sight and to judge from the shaking of their shoulders they were not less susceptible to the merriment which they had caused  at three pm we left alzaribah travelling towards the southwest and a wondrously picturesque scene met the eye crowds hurried along habited in the pilgrimgarb whose whiteness contrasted strangely with their black skins their newly shaven heads glistening in the sun and their long black hair streaming in the wind the rocks rang with shouts of labbayk labbayk at a pass we fell in with the wahhabis accompanying the baghdad caravan screaming “here am i” and guided by a large loud kettledrum they followed in double file the camel of a standardbearer whose green flag bore in huge white letters the formula of the moslem creed they were wildlooking mountaineers dark and fierce with hair twisted into thin dalik or plaits each was armed with a long spear a matchlock or a dagger they were seated upon coarse wooden saddles without cushions or stirrups a fine saddlecloth alone denoting a  p142 chief the women emulated the men they either guided their own dromedaries or sitting in pillion they clung to their husbands veils they disdained and their countenances certainly belonged not to a “soft sex” these wahhabis were by no means pleasant companions most of them were followed by spare dromedaries either unladen or carrying waterskins fodder fuel and other necessaries for the march the beasts delighted in dashing furiously through our file which being lashed together head and tail was thrown each time into the greatest confusion and whenever we were observed smoking we were cursed aloud for infidels and idolaters  looking back at alzaribah soon after our departure i saw a heavy nimbus settle upon the hilltops a sheet of rain being stretched between it and the plain the low grumbling of thunder sounded joyfully in our ears we hoped for a shower but were disappointed by a duststorm which ended with a few heavy drops there arose a report that the badawin had attacked a party of meccans with stones and the news caused men to look exceeding grave  at five pm we entered the wide bed of the fiumara down which we were to travel all night here the country falls rapidly towards the sea as the increasing heat of the air the direction of the watercourses and signs of violence in the torrentbed show the fiumara varies in breadth from a hundred and fifty feet to threequarters of a mile its course i was told is towards the southwest and it enters the sea near jeddah the channel is a coarse sand with here and there masses of sheet rock and patches of thin vegetation  at about halfpast five pm we entered a suspiciouslooking place on the right was a stony buttress along whose base the stream when there is one swings and to this depression was our road limited by the rocks and thorn trees which filled the other half of the channel  p143 the left side was a precipice grim and barren but not so abrupt as its brother opposite us the way seemed barred by piles of hills crest rising above crest into the far blue distance day still smiled upon the upper peaks but the lower slopes and the fiumara bed were already curtained with grey sombre shade  a damp seemed to fall upon our spirits as we approached this valley perilous i remarked that the voices of the women and children sank into silence and the loud labbayk of the pilgrims were gradually stilled whilst still speculating upon the cause of this phenomenon it became apparent a small curl of the smoke like a lady’s ringlet on the summit of the righthand precipice caught my eye and simultaneous with the echoing crack of the matchlock a hightrotting dromedary in front of me rolled over upon the sands—a bullet had split its heart—throwing the rider a goodly somersault of five or six yards  ensued terrible confusion women screamed children cried and men vociferated each one striving with might and main to urge his animal out of the place of death but the road being narrow they only managed to jam the vehicles in a solid immovable mass at every matchlock shot a shudder ran through the huge body as when the surgeon’s scalpel touches some more sensitive nerve the irregular horsemen perfectly useless galloped up and down over the stones shouting to and ordering one another the pasha of the army had his carpet spread at the foot of the lefthand precipice and debated over his pipe with the officers what ought to be done no good genius whispered “crown the heights”  then it was that the conduct of the wahhabis found favour in my eyes they came up galloping their camels—  “torrents less rapid and less rash—  with their elflocks tossing in the wind and their flaring  p144 matches casting a strange lurid light over their features taking up a position one body began to fire upon the utaybah robbers whilst two or three hundred dismounting swarmed up the hill under the guidance of the sharif zayd i had remarked this nobleman at almadinah as a model specimen of the pure arab like all sharifs he is celebrated for bravery and has killed many with his own handfn24 when urged at alzaribah to ride into meccah he swore that he would not leave the caravan till in sight of the walls and fortunately for the pilgrims he kept his word presently the firing was heard far in our rear the robbers having fled the head of the column advanced and the dense body of pilgrims opened out our forced halt was now exchanged for a flight it required much management to steer our desertcraft clear of danger but shaykh mas’ud was equal to the occasion that many were not was evident by the boxes and baggage that strewed the shingles i had no means of ascertaining the number of men killed and wounded reports were contradictory and exaggeration unanimous the robbers were said to be a hundred and fifty in number their object was plunder and they would eat the shot camels but their principal ambition was the boast “we the utaybah on such and such a p145 night stopped the sultan’s mahmil one whole hour in the pass”  at the beginning of the skirmish i had primed my pistols and sat with them ready for use but soon seeing that there was nothing to be done and wishing to make an impression—nowhere does bobadil now “go down” so well as in the east—i called aloud for my supper shaykh nur exanimate with fear could not move the boy mohammed ejaculated only an “oh sir” and the people around exclaimed in disgust “by allah he eats” shaykh abdullah the meccan being a man of spirit was amused by the spectacle “are these afghan manners effendim” he enquired from the shugduf behind me “yes” i replied aloud “in my country we always dine before an attack of robbers because that gentry is in the habit of sending men to bed supperless” the shaykh laughed aloud but those around him looked offended i thought the bravado this time mal place but a little event which took place on my way to jeddah proved that it was not quite a failure  as we advanced our escort took care to fire every large dry asclepias to disperse the shades which buried us again the scene became wondrous wild—  “full many a waste i’ve wander’d o’er clomb many a crag cross’d many a shore but by my halidome a scene so rude so wild as this yet so sublime in barrenness ne’er did my wandering footsteps press where’er i chanced to roam”  on either side were ribbed precipices dark angry and towering above till their summits mingled with the glooms of night and between them formidable looked the chasm down which our host hurried with shouts and discharges of matchlocks the torchsmoke and the nightfires of flaming asclepias formed a canopy sable  p146 above and livid red below it hung over our heads like a sheet and divided the cliffs into two equal parts here the fire flashed fiercely from a tall thorn that crackled and shot up showers of sparks into the air there it died away in lurid gleams which lit up a truly stygian scene as usual however the picturesque had its inconveniences there was no path rocks stonebanks and trees obstructed our passage the camels now blind in darkness then dazzled by a flood of light stumbled frequently in some places slipping down a steep descent in others sliding over a sheet of mud there were furious quarrels and fierce language between camelmen and their hirers and threats to fellowtravellers in fact we were united in discord i passed that night crying “hai hai” switching the camel and fruitlessly endeavouring to fustigate mas’ud’s nephew who resolutely slept upon the waterbags during the hours of darkness we made four or five halts when we boiled coffee and smoked pipes but man and beasts were beginning to suffer from a deadly fatigue  dawn saturday sept 10th found us still travelling down the fiumara which here is about a hundred yards broad the granite hills on both sides were less precipitous and the borders of the torrentbed became natural quays of stiff clay which showed a watermark of from twelve to fifteen feet in height in many parts the bed was muddy and the moist places as usual caused accidents i happened to be looking back at shaykh abdullah who was then riding in old ali bin ya sin’s fine shugduf suddenly the camel’s four legs disappeared from under him his right side flattening the ground and the two riders were pitched severally out of the smashed vehicle abdullah started up furious and with great zest abused the badawin who were absent “feed these arabs” he exclaimed quoting a turkish proverb “and  p147 they will fire at heaven” but i observed that when shaykh mas’ud came up the citizen was only gruff  we then turned northward and sighted almazik more generally known as wady laymun the valley of limes on the right bank of the fiumara stood the meccan sharif’s state pavilion green and gold it was surrounded by his attendants and he had prepared to receive the pasha of the caravan we advanced half a mile and encamped temporarily in a hillgirt bulge of the fiumara bed at eight am we had travelled about twentyfour miles from alzaribah and the direction of our present station was southwest 50°  shaykh mas’ud allowed us only four hours’ halt he wished to precede the main body after breaking our fast joyously upon limes pomegranates and fresh dates we sallied forth to admire the beauties of the place we are once more on classic ground—the ground of the ancient arab poets—  “deserted is the village—waste the halting place and home at mina o’er rijam and ghul wild beasts unheeded roam on rayyan hill the channel lines have left their naked trace timeworn as primal writ that dints the mountain’s flinty  facefn25”—  and this wady celebrated for the purity of its air has from remote ages been a favourite resort of the meccans nothing can be more soothing to the brain than the darkgreen foliage of the limes and pomegranates and from  p148 the base of the southern hill bursts a bubbling stream whose    “chaire fresche e dolci acque”  flow through the gardens filling them with the most delicious of melodies the gladdest sound which nature in these regions knows  exactly at noon mas’ud seized the halter of the foremost camel and we started down the fiumara troops of badawi girls looked over the orchard walls laughingly and children came out to offer us fresh fruit and sweet water at two pm travelling southwest we arrived at a point where the torrentbed turns to the right and quitting it we climbed with difficulty over a steep ridge of granite before three o’clock we entered a hillgirt plain which my companions called “sola” in some places were clumps of trees and scattered villages warned us that we were approaching a city far to the left rose the blue peaks of taif and the mountain road a white thread upon the nearer heights was pointed out to me here i first saw the tree or rather shrub which bears the balm of gilead erst so celebrated for its tonic and stomachic propertiesfn26 i told shaykh mas’ud to break off a  p149 twig which he did heedlessly the act was witnessed by our party with a roar of laughter and the astounded shaykh was warned that he had become subject to an atoning sacrifice fn27 of course he denounced me as the instigator and i could not fairly refuse assistance the tree has of late years been carefully described by many botanists i will only say that the bark resembled in colour a cherrystick pipe the inside was a light yellow and the juice made my fingers stick together  at four pm we came to a steep and rocky pass up which we toiled with difficulty the face of the country was rising once more and again presented the aspect of numerous small basins divided and surrounded by hills as we  p150 jogged on we were passed by the cavalcade of no less a personage than the sharif of meccah abd almuttalib bin ghalib is a dark beardless old man with african features derived from his mother he was plainly dressed in white garments and a white muslin turbandfn28 which made him look jet black he rode an ambling mule and the only emblem of his dignity was the large green satin umbrella borne by an attendant on footfn29 scattered around him were about forty matchlock men mostly slaves at long intervals after their father came his four sons riza bey abdullah ali and ahmad the latter still a child the three elder brothers rode splendid dromedaries at speed they were young men of light complexion with the true meccan cast of features showily dressed in bright coloured silks and armed to denote their rank with sword and goldhilted daggerfn30  p151we halted as evening approached and strained our eyes but all in vain to catch sight of meccah which lies in a winding valley by shaykh abdullah’s direction i recited after the usual devotions the following prayer the reader is forewarned that it is difficult to preserve the flowers of oriental rhetoric in a european tongue  p152o allah verily this is thy safeguard amn and thy harim into it whoso entereth becometh safe amin so deny harrim my flesh and blood my bones and skin to hellfire o allah save me from thy wrath on the day when thy servants shall be raised from the dead i conjure thee by this that thou art allah besides whom is none thou only the merciful the compassionate and have mercy upon our lord mohammed and upon the progeny of our lord mohammed and upon his followers one and all” this was concluded with the “talbiyat” and with an especial prayer for myself  we again mounted and night completed our disappointment about one am i was aroused by general excitement “meccah meccah” cried some voices “the sanctuary o the sanctuary” exclaimed others and all burst into loud “labbayk” not unfrequently broken by sobs i looked out from my litter and saw by the light of the southern stars the dim outlines of a large city a shade darker than the surrounding plain we were passing over the last ridge by a cutting called the saniyat kuda’a the windingplace of the cutfn31 the “winding path” is flanked on both sides by watchtowers which command the darb alma’ala or road leading from the north into meccah thence we passed into the ma’abidah northern suburb where the sharif’s palace is builtfn32 after this on the left hand came  p153 the deserted abode of the sharif bin aun now said to be a “haunted housefn33” opposite to it lies the jannat alma’ala the holy cemetery of meccah thence turning to the right we entered the sulaymaniyah or afghan quarter here the boy mohammed being an inhabitant of the shamiyah or syrian ward thought proper to display some apprehension the two are on bad terms children never meet without exchanging volleys of stones and men fight furiously with quarterstaves sometimes despite the terrors of religion the knife and sabre are drawn but their hostilities have their code if a citizen be killed there is a subscription for bloodmoney an inhabitant of one quarter passing singly through another becomes a guest once beyond the walls he is likely to be beaten to insensibility by his hospitable foes  at the sulaymaniyah we turned off the main road into a byway and ascended by narrow lanes the rough heights of jabal hindi upon which stands a small whitewashed and crenellated building called a fort thence descending we threaded dark streets in places crowded with rude cots and dusky figures and finally at two am we found ourselves at the door of the boy mohammed’s house  p154from wady laymun to meccah the distance according to my calculation was about twentythree miles the direction southeast fortyfive degrees we arrived on the morning of sunday the 7th zu’l hijjah 11th september 1853 and had one day before the beginning of the pilgrimage to repose and visit the harim  i conclude this chapter with a few remarks upon the watershed of alhijaz the country in my humble opinion has a compound slope southwards and westwards i have however little but the conviction of the modern arabs to support the assertion that this part of arabia declines from the north all declare the course of water to be southerly and believe the fountain of arafat to pass underground from baghdad the slope as geographers know is still a disputed point ritter jomard and some old arab authors make the country rise towards the south whilst wallin and others express an opposite opinion from the sea to almusahhal is a gentle rise the watermarks of the fiumaras show that almadinah is considerably above the coast though geographers may not be correct in claiming for jabal radhwa a height of six thousand feet yet that elevation is not perhaps too great for the plateau upon which stands the apostle’s burialplace from almadinah to alsuwayrkiyah is another gentle rise and from the latter to alzaribah stagnating water denotes a level i believe the report of a perennial lake on the eastern boundary of alhijaz as little as the river placed by ptolemy between yambu’ and meccah no badawi could tell me of this feature which had it existed would have changed the whole conditions and history of the p155 country we know the greek’s river to be a fiumara and the lake probably owes its existence to a similar cause a heavy fall of rain beginning at alzaribah is a decided fall which continues to the sea the arafat torrent sweeps from east to west with great force sometimes carrying away the habitations and even injuring the sanctuaryfn34  fn1 there are certain officers called zemzemi who distribute the holy water in the case of a respectable pilgrim they have a large jar of the shape described in chap iv marked with his names and titles and sent every morning to his lodgings if he be generous one or more will be placed in the harim that men may drink in his honour the zemzemi expects a present varying from five to eleven dollars fn2 the shishah smoked on the camel is a tin canister divided into two compartments the lower half for the water the upper one for the tobacco the cover is pierced with holes to feed the fire and a short hookahsnake projects from one side fn3 the hindustani “sir” badawin address it slightingly to indians chapter xii fn4 when indians would say “he was killed upon the spot” they use the picturesque phrase “he asked not for water” fn5 the arabs are curious in and fond of honey meccah alone affords eight or nine different varieties the best and in arab parlance the “coldest” is the green kind produced by bees that feed upon a thorny plant called “sihhah” the white and red honeys rank next the worst is the asal asmar brown honey which sells for something under a piastre per pound the abyssinian mead is unknown in alhijaz but honey enters into a variety of dishes fn6 “la siwa hu” ie where there is none but allah fn7 this article an iron cylinder with bands mounted on a long pole corresponds with the european cresset of the fifteenth century the pasha’s cressets are known by their smell a little incense being mingled with the wood by this means the badawin discover the dignitary’s place fn8 “abu sham” a familiar address in alhijaz to syrians they are called “abusers of the salt” from their treachery and “offspring of shimr” the execrated murderer of the imam hosayn because he was a native of that country such is the detestation in which the shi’ah sect especially the persians hold syria and the syrians that i hardly ever met with a truly religious man who did not desire a general massacre of the polluted race and history informs us that the plains of syria have repeatedly been drenched with innocent blood shed by sectarian animosity yet jalal aldin history of jerusalem says “as to damascus all learned men fully agree that it is the most eminent of cities after meccah and almadinah” hence its many titles “the smile of the prophet” the “great gate of pilgrimage” “sham sharif” the “right hand of the cities of syria” c c and many sayings of mohammed in honour of syria are recorded he was fond of using such syriac words as “bakhun bakhun” to ali and “kakhun kakhun” to hosayn i will not enter into the curious history of the latter word which spread to egypt and slightly altered passed through latin mythology into french english german italian and other modern european tongues fn9 there is a regular language to camels “ikh ikh” makes them kneel “yahh yahh” urges them on “hai hai” induces caution and so on fn10 both these names of the almighty are of kindred origin the former is generally used when a woman is in danger of exposing her face by accident or an animal of falling fn11 a “birkat” in this part of arabia may be an artificial cistern or a natural basin in the latter case it is smaller than a “ghadir” this road was a favourite with harun alrashid the pious tyrant who boasted that every year he performed either a pilgrimage or a crusade the reader will find in d’herbelot an account of the celebrated visit of harun to the holy cities nor less known in oriental history is the pilgrimage of zubaydah khatun wife of harun and mother of amin by this route fn12 some believe this literally others consider it a phrase expressive of bloodthirstiness it is the only suspicion of cannibalism if i may use the word now attaching to alhijaz possibly the disgusting act may occasionally have taken place after a stern fight of more than usual rancour who does not remember the account of the turkish officer licking his blood after having sabred the corpse of a russian spy it is said that the mutayr and the utaybah are not allowed to enter meccah even during the pilgrimage season fn13 coloquintida is here used as in most parts of the east medicinally the pulp and the seeds of the ripe fruit are scooped out and the rind is filled with milk which is exposed to the night air and drunk in the morning fn14 used in arabian medicine as a refrigerant and tonic it abounds in sind and afghanistan where according to that most practical of botanists the lamented dr stocks it is called “ishwarg” fn15 here called ashr according to seetzen it bears the longsought apple of sodom yet if truth be told the soft green bag is as unlike an apple as can be imagined nor is the hard and brittle yellow rind of the ripe fruit a whit more resembling the arabs use the thick and acrid milk of the green bag with steel filings as a tonic and speak highly of its effects they employ it also to intoxicate or narcotise monkeys and other animals which they wish to catch it is esteemed in hindu medicine the nubians and indians use the filaments of the fruit as tinder they become white and shining as flosssilk the badawin also have applied it to a similar purpose our egyptian travellers call it the “silktree” and in northern africa where it abounds europeans make of it stuffing for the mattresses which are expensive and highly esteemed for their coolness and cleanliness in bengal a kind of gutta percha is made by boiling the juice this weed so common in the east may one day become in the west an important article of commerce fn16 “alihram” literally meaning “prohibition” or “making unlawful” equivalent to our “mortification” is applied to the ceremony of the toilette and also to the dress itself the vulgar pronounce the word “heram” or “l’ehram” it is opposed to “ihlal” “making lawful” or “returning to laical life” the further from meccah it is assumed provided that it be during the three months of hajj the greater is the religious merit of the pilgrim consequently some come from india and egypt in the dangerous attire those coming from the north assume the pilgrimgarb at or off the village of rabigh fn17 these sheets are not positively necessary any clean cotton cloth not sewn in any part will serve equally well servants and attendants expect the master to present them with an “ihram” fn18 sandals are made at meccah expressly for the pilgrimage the poorer classes cut off the upper leathers of an old pair of shoes fn19 this niyat as it is technically called is preferably performed aloud some authorities however direct it to be meditated sottovoce fn20 “talbiyat” is from the word labbayka “here i am” in the cry— “labbayk’ allahumma labbayk’ labbayka la sharika laka labbayk’ inna ’lhamda wa ’l ni’amata laka wa ’l mulk la sharika laka labbayk’” some add “here i am and i honour thee i the son of thy two slaves beneficence and good are all between thy hands” a single talbiyah is a “shart” or positive condition and its repetition is a sunnat or custom of the prophet the “talbiyat” is allowed in any language but is preferred in arabic it has a few varieties the form above given is the most common fn21 the object of these ordinances is clearly to inculcate the strictest observance of the “truce of god” pilgrims however are allowed to slay if necessary “the five noxious” viz a crow a kite a scorpion a rat and a biting dog fn22 the victim is sacrificed as a confession that the offender deems himself worthy of death the offerer is not allowed to taste any portion of his offering fn23 the reason why this “ugly” must be worn is that a woman’s veil during the pilgrimage ceremonies is not allowed to touch her face fn24 the sharifs are born and bred to fighting the peculiar privileges of their caste favour their development of pugnacity thus the modern diyah or price of blood being 800 dollars for a common moslem the chiefs demand for one of their number double that sum with a sword a camel a female slave and other items and if one of their slaves or servants be slain a fourfold price the rigorous way in which this custom is carried out gives the sharif and his retainer great power among the arabs as a general rule they are at the bottom of all mischief it was a sharif hosayn bin ali who tore down and trampled upon the british flag at mocha a sharif abd alrahman of waht who murdered captain mylne near lahedge a page might be filled with the names of the distinguished ruffians fn25 in these lines of labid the “mina” alluded to must not we are warned by the scholiast be confounded with “mina” vulg “muna” the valley of victims ghul and rayyan are hills

remain” de sacy’s moallaka de lebid p 289 i neither saw nor heard of any but some months afterwards i was delighted to hear from the abbe hamilton that he had discovered in one of the rock monuments a “lithographed proof” of the presence of sesostris rhameses ii fn26 the “balsamon” of theophrastus and dioscorides a corruption of the arabic “balisan” or “basham” by which name the badawin know it in the valley of the jordan it was worth its weight in silver and kings warred for what is now a weed cleopatra by a commission brought it to egypt it was grown at heliopolis the last tree died there we are told by niebuhr in the early part of the seventeenth century according to others in ad 1502 a circumstance the more curious as it was used by the copts in chrisome and by europe for anointing kings from egypt it was carried to alhijaz where it now grows wild on sandy and stony grounds but i could not discover the date of its naturalisation moslems generally believe it to have been presented to solomon by bilkis queen of sheba bruce relates that it was produced at mohammed’s prayer from the blood of the badrmartyr in the gospel of infancy book i ch 8 we read—“9 hence they joseph and mary went out to that sycamore which is now called matarea the modern and arabic name for heliopolis 10 and in matarea the lord jesus caused a well to spring forth in which st mary washed his coat 11 and a balsam is produced or grows in that country from the sweat which ran down there from the lord jesus” the sycamore is still shown and the learned recognise in this ridiculous old legend the “hierosykaminon” of pagan egypt under which isis and horus sat hence sir j maundeville and an old writer allude reverently to the sovereign virtues of “bawme” i believe its qualities to have been exaggerated but have found it useful in dressing wounds burckhardt vol ii p 124 alludes to but appears not to have seen it the best balsam is produced upon stony hills like arafat and muna in hot weather incisions are made in the bark and the soft gum which exudes is collected in bottles the best kind is of the consistence of honey and yellowishbrown like treacle it is frequently adulterated with water when if my informant shaykh abdullah speak truth it becomes much lighter in weight i never heard of the vipers which pliny mentions as abounding in these trees and which bruce declares were shown to him alive at jeddah and at yambu’ dr carter found the balm under the name of luban dukah among the gara tribe of eastern arabia and botanists have seen it at aden we may fairly question its being originally from the banks of the jordan fn27 this being one of the “muharramat” or actions forbidden to a pilgrim at all times say the moslems there are three vile trades viz those of the harik

to abyssinia the umbrella is the sign of royalty the arabs of meccah and sena’a probably derived the custom from the hindus fn30 i purposely omit long descriptions of the sharif my fellowtravellers messrs didier and hamilton being far more competent to lay the subject before the public a few political remarks may not be deemed out of place the present sharif despite his civilised training at constantinople is and must be a fanatic bigoted man he applied for the expulsion of the british viceconsul at jeddah on the grounds that an infidel should not hold position in the holy land his pride and reserve have made him few friends although the meccans with their enthusiastic nationality extol his bravery to the skies and praise him for conduct as well as for courage his position at present is anomalous ahmad pasha of alhijaz rules politically as representative of the sultan the sharif who like the pope claims temporal as well as spiritual dominion attempts to command the authorities by force of bigotry the pasha heads the turkish now the ruling party the sharif has in his interest the arabs and the badawin both thwart each other on all possible occasions quarrels are bitter and endless there is no government and the vessel of the state is in danger of being waterlogged in consequence of the squabbling between her two captains when i was at meccah all were in a ferment the sharif having it is said insisted upon the pasha leaving taif the position of the turks in alhijaz becomes every day more dangerous want of money presses upon them and reduces them to degrading measures in february 1853 the pasha hired a forced loan from the merchants and but for mr cole’s spirit and firmness the english proteges would have been compelled to contribute their share after a long and animated discussion the pasha yielded the point by imprisoning his recusant subjects who insisted upon indians paying like themselves he waited in person with an apology upon mr cole though established at jeddah since 1838 the french and english consuls contented with a proxy never required a return of visit from the governor if the turks be frequently reduced to such expedients for the payment of their troops they will soon be swept from the land on the other hand the sharif approaches a crisis his salary paid by the sultan may be roughly estimated at £15000 per annum if the turks maintain their footing in arabia it will probably be found that an honourable retreat at stambul is better for the thirtyfirst descendant of the prophet than the turbulent life of meccah or that a reduced allowance of £500 per annum would place him in a higher spiritual though in a lower temporal position since the above was written the sharif abd almuttalib has been deposed the arabs of alhijaz united in revolt against the sultan but after a few skirmishes they were reduced to subjection by their old ruler the sharif bin aun fn31 saniyat means a “winding path” and kuda’a “the cut” formerly meccah had three gates 1 bab alma’ala northeast 2 bab alumrah or bab alzahir on the jeddah road west and 3 bab almasfal on the yaman road these were still standing in the twelfth century but the walls were destroyed it is better to enter meccah by day and on foot but this is not a matter of vital consequence in pilgrimage fn32 it is a large whitewashed building with extensive wooden balconied windows but no pretensions to architectural splendour around it trees grow and amongst them i remarked a young cocoa alidrisi ad 1154 calls the palace almarba’ah this may be a clerical error for to the present day all know it as alma’abidah pronounced almab’da the nubian describes it as a “stone castle three miles from the town in a palm garden” the word “ma’abidah” says kutb aldin means a “body of servants” and is applied generally to this suburb because here was a body of badawin in charge of the masjid alijabah a mosque not now existing fn33 i cannot conceive what made the accurate niebuhr fall into the strange error that “apparitions are unknown in arabia” arabs fear to sleep alone to enter the bath at night to pass by cemeteries during dark and to sit amongst ruins simply for fear of apparitions and arabia together with persia has supplied half the western world with its ghost stories and tales of angels demons and fairies to quote milton the land is struck “with

 the boy mohammed left me in the street and having at last persuaded the sleepy and tired indian porter by violent kicks and testy answers to twenty cautious queries to swing open the huge gate of his fortress he rushed up stairs to embrace his mother after a minute i heard the zaghritahfn1 lululu or shrill cry which in these lands welcomes the wanderer home the sound so gladdening to the returner sent a chill to the stranger’s heart  presently the youth returned his manner had changed from a boisterous and jaunty demeanour to one of grave and attentive courtesy—i had become his guest he led me into the gloomy hall seated me upon a large carpeted mastabah or platform and told his bara miyanfn2 great sir the hindustani porter to bring a light p160 meanwhile a certain shuffling of slippered feet above informed my ears that the kabirahfn3 the mistress of the house was intent on hospitable thoughts when the camels were unloaded appeared a dish of fine vermicelli browned and powdered with loaf sugar the boy mohammed i and shaykh nur lost no time in exerting our right hands and truly after our hungry journey we found the kunafah delicious after the meal we procured cots from a neighbouring coffeehouse and we lay down weary and anxious to snatch an hour or two of repose at dawn we were expected to perform our tawaf alkudum or “circumambulation of arrival” at the harim  scarcely had the first smile of morning beamed upon the rugged head of the eastern hill abu kubaysfn4 when we arose bathed and proceeded in our pilgrimgarb to the sanctuary we entered by the bab alziyadah or principal northern door descended two long flights of steps traversed the cloister and stood in sight of the bayt allah  there at last it lay the bourn of my long and weary pilgrimage realising the plans and hopes of many and many a year the mirage medium of fancy invested the  p161 huge catafalque and its gloomy pall with peculiar charms there were no giant fragments of hoar antiquity as in egypt no remains of graceful and harmonious beauty as in greece and italy no barbarous gorgeousness as in the buildings of india yet the view was strange unique—and how few have looked upon the celebrated shrine i may truly say that of all the worshippers who clung weeping to the curtain or who pressed their beating hearts to the stone none felt for the moment a deeper emotion than did the haji from the farnorth it was as if the poetical legends of the arab spoke truth and that the waving wings of angels not the sweet breeze of morning were agitating and swelling the black covering of the shrine but to confess humbling truth theirs was the high feeling of religious enthusiasm mine was the ecstasy of gratified pride  few moslems contemplate for the first time the ka’abah without fear and awe there is a popular jest against new comers that they generally inquire the direction of prayer this being the kiblah or fronting place moslems pray all around it a circumstance which of course cannot take place in any spot of alislam but the harim the boy mohammed therefore left me for a few minutes to myself but presently he warned me that it was time to begin advancing we entered through the bab benu shaybah the “gate of the sons of the shaybahfn5” old woman there we raised our  p162 hands repeated the labbayk the takbir and the tahlil after which we uttered certain supplications and drew our hands down our faces then we proceeded to the shafe’is’ place of worship—the open pavement between the makam ibrahim and the well zemzem—where we performed the usual twobow prayer in honour of the mosque this was followed by a cup of holy water and a present to the sakkas or carriers who for the consideration distributed in my name a large earthen vaseful to poor pilgrims  the word zemzem has a doubtful origin some derive it from the zam zam or murmuring of its waters others from zam zam fill fill ie the bottle hagar’s impatient exclamation when she saw the stream sale translates it stay stay and says that hagar called out in the egyptian language to prevent her son wandering the hukama or rationalists of alislam who invariably connect their faith with the worship of venus especially and the heavenly bodies generally derive zemzem from the persian and make it signify the “great luminary” hence they say the zemzem as well as the ka’abah denoting the cuthite or ammonian worship of sun and fire deserves man’s reverence so the persian poet khakani addresses these two buildings—  “o ka’abah thou traveller of the heavens” “o venus thou fire of the world”  thus wahid mohammed founder of the wahidiyah sect identifies the kiblah and the sun wherefore he says the door fronts the east by the names yaman “righthand” sham “lefthand” kubul or the east wind “fronting” and dubur or the west wind “from the back” it is evident that worshippers fronted the rising sun according to the hukama the original black stone represents venus “which in the border of the heavens is a star of the planets” and symbolical of the  p163 generative power of nature “by whose passive energy the universe was warmed into life and motion” the hindus accuse the moslems of adoring the bayt ullah  “o moslem if thou worship the ka’abah why reproach the worshippers of idols”  says rai manshar and musaylimah who in his attempt to found a fresh faith gained but the historic epithet of “liar” allowed his followers to turn their faces in any direction mentally ejaculating “i address myself to thee who hast neither side nor figure” a doctrine which might be sensible in the abstract but certainly not material enough and prideflattering to win him many converts in arabia  the produce of zemzem is held in great esteem it is used for drinking and religious ablution but for no baser purposes and the meccans advise pilgrims always to break their fast with it it is apt to cause diarrhoea and boils and i never saw a stranger drink it without a wry face sale is decidedly correct in his assertion the flavour is a saltbitter much resembling an infusion of a teaspoonful of epsom salts in a large tumbler of tepid water moreover it is exceedingly “heavy” to the digestion for this reason turks and other strangers prefer rainwater collected in cisterns and sold for five farthings a gugglet it was a favourite amusement with me to watch them whilst they drank the holy water and to taunt their scant and irreverent potations  the strictures of the calcutta review no 41 art 1 based upon the taste of zemzem are unfounded in these days a critic cannot be excused for such hasty judgments at calcutta or bombay he would easily find a jar of zemzem water which he might taste for himself upon this passage mr w muir life of mahomet vol i p cclviii remarks that “the flavour of stale water bottled up for months would not be a criterion of the same water freshly drawn” but it might easily be analysed  the water is transmitted to distant regions in glazed  p164 earthern jars covered with basketwork and sealed by the zemzemis religious men break their lenten fast with it apply it to their eyes to brighten vision and imbibe a few drops at the hour of death when satan stands by holding a bowl of purest water the price of the departing soul of course modern superstition is not idle about the waters of zemzem the copious supply of the well is considered at meccah miraculous in distant countries it facilitates the pronounciation of arabic to the student and everywhere the nauseous draught is highly meritorious in a religious point of view  we then advanced towards the eastern angle of the ka’abah in which is inserted the black stone and standing about ten yards from it repeated with upraised hands “there is no god but allah alone whose covenant is truth and whose servant is victorious there is no god but allah without sharer his is the kingdom to him be praise and he over all things is potent” after which we approached as close as we could to the stone a crowd of pilgrims preventing our touching it that time we raised our hands to our ears in the first position of prayer and then lowering them exclaimed “o allah i do this in thy belief and in verification of thy book and in pursuance of thy prophet’s example—may allah bless him and preserve o allah i extend my hand to thee and great is my desire to thee o accept thou my supplication and diminish my obstacles and pity my humiliation and graciously grant me thy pardon” after which as we were still unable to reach the stone we raised our hands to our ears the palms facing the stone as if touching it recited the various religious formulae the takbir the tahlil and the hamdilah blessed the prophet and kissed the fingertips of the right hand the prophet used to weep when he touched the black stone and said that it was the place for the pouring forth of tears according to most authors the  p165 second caliph also used to kiss it for this reason most moslems except the shafe’i school must touch the stone with both hands and apply their lips to it or touch it with the fingers which should be kissed or rub the palms upon it and afterwards draw them down the face under circumstances of difficulty it is sufficient to stand before the stone but the prophet’s sunnat or practice was to touch it lucian mentions adoration of the sun by kissing the hand  then commenced the ceremony of tawaffn6 or circumambulation our route being the mataf—the low oval of polished granite immediately surrounding the ka’abah i  p166 repeated after my mutawwif or ciceronefn7 “in the name of allah and allah is omnipotent i purpose to circuit seven circuits unto almighty allah glorified and exalted” this is technically called the niyat intention of tawaf then we began the prayer “o allah i do this in thy belief and in verification of thy book and in faithfulness to thy covenant and in perseverance of the example of the apostle mohammed—may allah bless him and preserve” till we reached the place almultazem between the corner of the black stone and the ka’abah door here we ejaculated “o allah thou hast rights so pardon my transgressing them” opposite the door we repeated “o allah verily the house is thy house and the sanctuary thy sanctuary and the safeguard thy safeguard and this is the place of him who flies to thee from hell fire” at the little building called makam ibrahim we said “o allah verily this is the place of abraham who took refuge with and fled to thee from the fire—o deny my flesh and blood my skin and bones to the eternal flames” as we paced slowly round the north or irak corner of the ka’abah we exclaimed “o allah verily i take refuge with thee from polytheism and disobedience and hypocrisy and evil conversation and evil thoughts concerning family and property and progeny” when fronting the mizab or spout we repeated the words “o allah verily i beg of thee faith which shall not decline and a certainty which shall not perish and the good aid of thy prophet mohammed—may allah bless him and preserve o allah shadow me in thy shadow on that day when there is no shade but thy shadow and cause me to drink from the cup of thine apostle mohammed—may allah bless him and preserve—that pleasant draught after which is no thirst to all eternity o lord of honour and glory” turning the  p167 west corner or the rukn alshami we exclaimed “o allah make it an acceptable pilgrimage and a forgiveness of sins and a laudable endeavour and a pleasant action in thy sight and a store which perisheth not o thou glorious o thou pardoner” this was repeated thrice till we arrived at the yamani or south corner where the crowd being less importunate we touched the wall with the right hand after the example of the prophet and kissed the fingertips finally between the south angle and that of the black stone where our circuit would be completed we said “o allah verily i take refuge with thee from infidelity and i take refuge with thee from want and from the tortures of the tomb and from the troubles of life and death and i fly to thee from ignominy in this world and the next and i implore thy pardon for the present and for the future o lord grant to me in this life prosperity and in the next life prosperity and save me from the punishment of fire”  thus finished a shaut or single course round the house of these we performed the first three at the pace called harwalah very similar to the french pas gymnastique or tarammul that is to say “moving the shoulders as if walking in sand” the four latter are performed in ta’ammul slowly and leisurely the reverse of the sai or running these seven ashwat or courses are called collectively one usbu arabic the moslem origin of this custom is too well known to require mention after each taufah or circuit we being unable to kiss or even to touch the black stone fronted towards it raised our hands to our ears exclaimed “in the name of allah and allah is omnipotent” kissed our fingers and resumed the ceremony of circumambulation as before with “allah in thy belief” c  at the conclusion of the tawaf it was deemed advisable to attempt to kiss the stone for a time i stood  p168 looking in despair at the swarming crowd of badawi and other pilgrims that besieged it but the boy mohammed was equal to the occasion during our circuit he had displayed a fiery zeal against heresy and schism by foully abusing every persian in his pathfn8 and the inopportune introduction of hard words into his prayers made the latter a strange patchwork as “ave maria purissima—arrah dont ye be letting the pig at the pot—sanctissima” and so forth he might for instance be repeating “and i take refuge with thee from ignominy in this world” when “o thou rejected one son of the rejected” would be the interpolation addressed to some longbearded khorasani—“and in that to come”—“o hog and brother of a hoggess” and so he continued till i wondered that none dared to turn and rend him after vainly addressing the pilgrims of whom nothing could be seen but a mosaic of occupits and shoulderblades the boy mohammed collected about half a dozen stalwart meccans with whose assistance by sheer strength we wedged our way into the thin and lightlegged crowd the badawin turned round upon us like wildcats but  p169 they had no daggers the season being autumn they had not swelled themselves with milk for six months and they had become such living mummies that i could have managed singlehanded half a dozen of them after thus reaching the stone despite popular indignation testified by impatient shouts we monopolised the use of it for at least ten minutes whilst kissing it and rubbing hands and forehead upon it i narrowly observed it and came away persuaded that it is an aerolite it is curious that almost all travellers agree upon one point namely that the stone is volcanic ali bey calls it “mineralogically” a “block of volcanic basalt whose circumference is sprinkled with little crystals pointed and strawlike with rhombs of tilered feldspath upon a dark background like velvet or charcoal except one of its protuberances which is reddish” burckhardt thought it was “a lava containing several small extraneous particles of a whitish and of a yellowish substance”  having kissed the stone we fought our way through the crowd to the place called almultazem here we pressed our stomachs chests and right cheeks to the ka’abah raising our arms high above our heads and exclaiming “o allah o lord of the ancient house free my neck from hellfire and preserve me from every ill deed and make me contented with that daily bread which thou hast given to me and bless me in all thou hast granted” then came the istighfar or begging of pardon “i beg pardon of allah the most high who there is no other god but he the living the eternal and unto him i repent myself” after which we blessed the prophet and then asked for ourselves all that our souls most desiredfn9  p170 after embracing the multazem we repaired to the shafe’is’ place of prayer near the makam ibrahim and there recited two prostrations technically called sunnat altawaf or the apostle’s practice of circumambulation the chapter repeated in the first was “say thou o infidels” in the second “say thou he is the one godfn10” we then went to the door of the building in which is zemzem there i was condemned to another nauseous draught and was deluged with two or three skinfuls of water dashed over my head en douche this ablution causes sins to fall from the spirit like dustfn11 during the potation we prayed “o allah verily i beg of thee plentiful daily bread and profitable learning and the healing of every disease” then we returned towards the black stone stood far away opposite because unable to touch it ejaculated the takbir the tahlil and the hamdilah and thoroughly worn out with scorched feet and a burning head—both extremities it must be remembered were bare and various delays had detained us till ten am—i left the mosquefn12  the boy mohammed had miscalculated the amount of lodging in his mother’s house she being a widow  p171 and a lone woman had made over for the season all the apartments to her brother a lean old meccan of true ancient type vulturefaced kiteclawed with a laugh like a hyena and a mere shell of body he regarded me with no favouring eye when i insisted as a guest upon having some place of retirement but he promised that after our return from arafat a little storeroom should be cleared out for me with that i was obliged to be content and to pass that day in the common male drawingroom of the house a vestibule on the ground floor called in egypt a takhtabushfn13 entering to the left a was a large mastabah or platform and at the bottom b a second of smaller dimensions and foully dirty behind this was a dark and unclean storeroom c containing the hajis’ baggage opposite the mastabah was a firepan for pipes and coffee d superintended by a family of lean indians and by the side e a doorless passage led to a bathingroom f and staircase g  i had scarcely composed myself upon the carpeted mastabah when the remainder was suddenly invaded by the turkish or rather slavoturk pilgrims inhabiting the house and a host of their visitors they were large hairy men with gruff voices and square figures they did not take the least notice of me although feeling the intrusion i stretched out my legs with a provoking nonchalancefn14 at last one of them addressed me in turkish to which i  p172 replied by shaking my head his question being interpreted to me in arabic i drawled out “my native place is the land of khorasan” this provoked a stern and stony stare from the turks and an “ugh” which said plainly enough “then you are a pestilent heretic” i surveyed them with a selfsatisfied simper stretched my legs a trifle farther and conversed with my waterpipe presently when they all departed for a time the boy mohammed raised by request my green box of medicines and deposited it upon the mastabah thus defining as it were a line of demarcation and asserting my privilege to it before the turks most of these men were of one party headed by a colonel of nizam whom they called a bey my acquaintance with them began roughly enough but afterwards with some exceptions who were gruff as an english butcher when accosted by a lean foreigner they proved to be kindhearted and not unsociable men it often happens to the traveller as the charming mrs malaprop observes to find intercourse all the better by beginning with a little aversion  in the evening accompanied by the boy mohammed and followed by shaykh nur who carried a lantern and a prayingrug i again repaired to the “navel of the worldfn15 this time aesthetically to enjoy the delights of the hour after the “gaudy babbling and remorseful day” the moon now approaching the full tipped the brow of abu kubays and lit up the spectacle with a more solemn light in the midst stood the huge bierlike erection—  “black as the wings which some spirit of ill o’er a sepulchre flings”—  p173 except where the moonbeams streaked it like jets of silver falling upon the darkest marble it formed the point of rest for the eye the little pagodalike buildings and domes around it with all their gilding and fretwork vanished one object unique in appearance stood in view—the temple of the one allah the god of abraham of ishmael and of their posterity sublime it was and expressing by all the eloquence of fancy the grandeur of the one idea which vitalised alislam and the strength and steadfastness of its votaries  the oval pavement round the ka’abah was crowded with men women and children mostly divided into parties which followed a mutawwif some walking staidly and others running whilst many stood in groups to prayer what a scene of contrasts here stalked the badawi woman in her long black robe like a nun’s serge and poppycoloured faceveil pierced to show two fiercely flashing orbs there an indian woman with her semitartar features nakedly hideous and her thin legs encased in wrinkled tights hurried round the fane every now and then a corpse borne upon its wooden shell circuited the shrine by means of four bearers whom other moslems as is the custom occasionally relieved a few fairskinned turks lounged about looking cold and repulsive as their wont is in one place a fast calcutta khitmugar stood with turband awry and arms akimbo contemplating the view jauntily as those “gentlemen’s gentlemen” will do in another some poor wretch with arms thrown on high so that every part of his person might touch the ka’abah was clinging to the curtain and sobbing as though his heart would break  from this spectacle my eyes turned towards abu kubays the city extends in that direction halfway up the grim hill the site might be compared at a humble distance to bath some writers liken it to florence but conceive a florence without beauty to the south  p174 lay jabal jiyad the greaterfn16 also partly built over and crowned with a fort which at a distance looks less useful than romanticfn17 a flood of pale light was sparkling upon its stony surface below the minarets became pillars of silver and the cloisters dimly streaked by oil lamps bounded the views of the temple with horizontal lines of shade  before nightfall the boy mohammed rose to feed the mosque pigeons for whom he had brought a pocketful of barley he went to the place where these birds flock—the line of pavement leading from the isolated arch to the eastern cloisters during the day women and children are to be seen sitting here with small piles of grain upon little plaited trays of basketwork for each they demand a copper piece and religious pilgrims consider it their duty to provide the reverend bluerocks with a plentiful meal  the hindu pandits assert that shiwa and his spouse under the forms and names of kapoteshwara pigeon god and kapotesi dwelt at meccah the dove was the device of the old assyrian empire because it is supposed semiramis was preserved by that bird the meccan pigeons resembling those of venice are held sacred probably in consequence of the wild traditions of the arabs about noah’s dove some authors declare that in mohammed’s time among the idols of the meccan pantheon was a pigeon carved in wood and above it another which ali mounting upon the prophet’s shoulder pulled down this might have been a hindu a jewish or a christian symbol the moslems connect the pigeon  p175 on two occasions with their faith first when that bird appeared to whisper in mohammed’s ear and secondly during the flight to almadinah moreover in many countries they are called “allah’s proclaimers” because their movement when cooing resembles prostration  almost everywhere the pigeon has entered into the history of religion which probably induced mr lascelles to incur the derision of our grandfathers by pronouncing it a “holy bird” at meccah they are called the doves of the ka’abah and they never appear at table they are remarkable for propriety when sitting upon the holy building this may be a minor miracle i would rather believe that there is some contrivance on the roof my friend mr bicknell remarks “this marvel however having of late years been suspended many discern another omen of the approach of the longpredicted period when unbelievers shall desecrate the sacred soil”  late in the evening i saw a negro in the state called malbus—religious frenzy to all appearance a takruri he was a fine and a powerful man as the numbers required to hold him testified he threw his arms wildly about him uttering shrill cries which sounded like le le le le and when held he swayed his body and waved his head from side to side like a chained and furious elephant straining out the deepest groans the africans appear unusually subject to this nervous state which seen by the ignorant and the imaginative would at once suggest “demoniacal possessionfn18” either their organisation is more impressionable or more probably the hardships privations and fatigues endured whilst wearily traversing inhospitable wilds and perilous seas have exalted their  p176 imaginations to a pitch bordering upon frenzy often they are seen prostrate on the pavement or clinging to the curtain or rubbing their foreheads upon the stones weeping bitterly and pouring forth the wildest ejaculations  that night i stayed in the harim till two am wishing to see if it would be empty but the morrow was to witness the egress to arafat many therefore passed the hours of darkness in the harim numerous parties of pilgrims sat upon their rugs with lanterns in front of them conversing praying and contemplating the ka’abah the cloisters were full of merchants who resorted there to “talk shop” and to vend such holy goods as combs toothsticks and rosaries before ten pm i found no opportunity of praying the usual two prostrations over the grave of ishmael after waiting long and patiently at last i was stepping into the vacant place when another pilgrim rushed forward the boy mohammed assisted by me instantly seized him and despite his cries and struggles taught him to wait till midnight we sat chatting with the different ciceroni who came up to offer their services i could not help remarking their shabby and dirty clothes and was informed that during pilgrimage when splendour is liable to be spoiled they wear out old dresses and appear endimanches for the muharram fete when most travellers have left the city presently my two companions exhausted with fatigue fell asleep i went up to the ka’abah with the intention of “annexing” a bit of the torn old kiswat or curtain but too many eyes were looking on at this season of the year the kiswat is much tattered at the base partly by pilgrims’ fingers and partly by the strain of the cord which confines it when the wind is blowing it is considered a mere peccadillo to purloin a bit of the venerable stuff but as the officers of the temple make money by selling it they certainly would visit detection with an  p177 unmerciful application of the quarterstaff the piece in my possession was given to me by the boy mohammed before i left meccah waistcoats cut out of the kiswah still make the combatants invulnerable in battle and are considered presents fit for princes the moslems generally try to secure a strip of this cloth as a mark for the koran or for some such purpose the opportunity however was favourable for a survey and with a piece of tape and the simple processes of stepping and spanning i managed to measure all the objects concerning which i was curious  at last sleep began to weigh heavily upon my eyelids i awoke my companions and in the dizziness of slumber they walked with me through the tall narrow street from the bab alziyadah to our home in the shamiyah the brilliant moonshine prevented our complaining as other travellers have had reason to do of the darkness and the difficulty of meccah’s streets the town too appeared safe there were no watchmen and yet people slept everywhere upon cots placed opposite their open doors arrived at the house we made some brief preparations for snatching a few hours’ sleep upon the mastabah a place so stifling that nothing but utter exhaustion could induce lethargy there  fn1 the egyptian word is generally pronounced “zaghrutah” the plural is zagharit corrupted to ziraleet the classical arabic term is “tahlil” the persians call the cry “kil” it is peculiar to women and is formed by raising the voice to its highest pitch vibrating it at the same time by rolling the tongue whose modulations express now joy now grief to my ear it always resembled the brainpiercing notes of a fife dr buchanan

certainly deserves to be the sepulchre of the first murderer the worship however was probably imported from india where agni the fire god was as the vedas prove the object of man’s earliest adoration fn5 the popular legend of this gate is that when abraham and his son were ordered to rebuild the ka’abah they found the spot occupied by an old woman she consented to remove her house on condition that the key of the new temple should be entrusted to her and to her descendants for ever and ever the origin of this is that benu shaybah means the “sons of an old woman” as well as “descendants of shaybah” and history tells us that the benu shaybah are derived from one shaybah bin osman bin talhah bin shaybah bin talhah bin abd aldar who was sent by mu’awiyah to make some alterations in the ka’abah according to others the ka’abah key was committed to the charge of osman bin talhah by the prophet fn6 the moslem in circumambulation presents his left shoulder the hindu’s pradakshina consists in walking round with the right side towards the fane or idol possibly the former may be a modification of the latter which would appear to be the original form of the rite its conjectural significance is an imitation of the procession of the heavenly bodies the motions of the spheres and the dances of the angels these are also imitated in the circular whirlings of the darwayshes and alshahristani informs us that the arab philosophers believed this sevenfold circumambulation to be symbolical of the motion of the planets round the sun it was adopted by the greeks and romans whose ambarvalia and amburbalia appear to be eastern superstitions introduced by numa or by the priestly line of princes into their pantheism and our processions round the parish preserve the form of the ancient rites whose life is long since fled moslem moralists have not failed to draw spiritual food from this mass of materialism “to circuit the bayt ullah” said the pir raukhan as soc vol xi and dabistan vol iii “miyan bayazid” “and to be free from wickedness and crime and quarrels is the duty enjoined by religion but to circuit the house of the friend of allah ie the heart to combat bodily propensities and to worship the angels is the business of the mystic path” thus sa’adi in his sermons—which remind the englishman of “poor yorick”—“he who travels to the ka’abah on foot makes a circuit of the ka’abah but he who performs the pilgrimage of the ka’abah in his heart is encircled by the ka’abah” and the greatest moslem divines sanction this visible representation of an invisible and heavenly shrine by declaring that without a material medium it is impossible for man to worship the eternal spirit fn7 the mutawwif or dalil is the guide at meccah fn8 in ad 1674 some wretch smeared the black stone with impurity and every one who kissed it retired with a sullied beard the persians says burckhardt were suspected of this sacrilege and now their illfame has spread far at alexandria they were described to me as a people who defile the ka’abah it is scarcely necessary to say that a shi’ah as well as a sunni would look upon such an action with lively horror the people of meccah however like the madani have turned the circumstance to their own advantage and make an occasional “avanie” thus nine or ten years ago on the testimony of a boy who swore that he saw the inside of the ka’abah defiled by a persian they rose up cruelly beat the schismatics and carried them off to their peculiar quarter the shamiyah forbidding their ingress to the ka’abah indeed till mohammed ali’s time the persians rarely ventured upon a pilgrimage and even now that man is happy who gets over it without a beating the defilement of the black stone was probably the work of some jew or greek who risked his life to gratify a furious bigotry fn9 prayer is granted at fourteen places besides almultazem viz—  1  at the place of circumambulation 2  under the mizab or spout of the ka’abah 3

these superstitions i must remark belong only to the vulgar fn12 strictly speaking we ought after this to have performed the ceremony called alsai or the running seven times between mounts safa and marwah fatigue put this fresh trial completely out of the question fn13 i have been diffuse in my description of this vestibule as it is the general way of laying out a groundfloor at meccah during the pilgrimage time the lower hall is usually converted into a shop for the display of goods especially when situated in a populous quarter fn14 this is equivalent to throwing oneself upon the sofa in europe only in the east it asserts a decided claim to superiority the west would scarcely view it in that light fn15 ibn haukal begins his cosmography with meccah “because the temple of the lord is situated there and the holy ka’abah is the navel of the earth and meccah is styled in sacred writ the parent city or the mother of towns” unfortunately ibn haukal like most other moslem travellers and geographers says no more about meccah fn16 to distinguish it from the jiyad above the cemetery alma’ala over which khalid entered meccah some topographers call the jiyad upon which the fort is built

before the damascus and the egyptian caravans made the road dangerous our delay arose from the tyrannical conduct of the boy mohammed who insisted upon leaving his little nephew behind it was long before he yielded i then placed the poor child who was crying bitterly in the litter between us and at last we started  we followed the road by which the caravans entered meccah it was covered with whiterobed pilgrims some few wending their way on footfn1 others riding and all men barefooted and bareheaded most of the wealthier classes mounted asses the scene was as usual one of strange contrasts badawin bestriding swift dromedaries turkish dignitaries on fine horses the most picturesque beggars and the most uninteresting nizam not a little wrangling mingled with the loud bursts of talbiyat dead animals dotted the ground and carcasses had been cast into a dry tank the birkat alshami which caused every badawi to  p179 hold his nosefn2 here on the right of the road the poorer pilgrims who could not find houses had erected huts and pitched their ragged tents traversing the suburb alma’b’dah ma’abadah in a valley between the two barren prolongations of kayka’an and khandamah we turned to the northeast leaving on the left certain barracks of turkish soldiery and the negro militia here stationed with the saniyat kuda’a in the background then advancing about 3000 paces over rising ground we passed by the conical head of jabal nurfn3 and entered the plain of many namesfn4 it contained nothing but a few whitewashed walls surrounding places of prayer and a number of stone cisterns some well preserved others in ruins all however were dry and watervendors crowded the roadside gravel and lumps of granite grew there like grass and from under every large stone as shaykh mas’ud took a delight in showing a small scorpion with tail curled over its back fled parthianlike from the invaders of its home at eleven am ascending a mudarraj or flight of stone steps about thirty yards broad we passed without difficulty for we were in advance of the caravans over the akabah or steepsfn5 and the narrow hillgirt entrance to the low gravel basin in which muna lies   p180 muna

distant about three miles from meccah it is a long narrow straggling village composed of mud and stone houses of one or two stories built in the common arab style traversing a narrow street we passed on the left the great devil which shall be described at a future time after a quarter of an hour’s halt spent over pipes and coffee we came to an open space where stands the mosque “alkhayf” here according to some arabs adam lies his head being at one end of one long wall and his feet at another whilst the dome covers his omphalic region grand preparations for fireworks were being made in this square i especially remarked a fireship  p181 which savoured strongly of stambul after passing through the town we came to batn almuhassir “the basin of the troublerfn9” satan at the beginning of a descent leading to muzdalifah the approacher where the road falls into the valley of the arafat torrent  at noon we reached the muzdalifah also called mashar alharam the “place dedicated to religious ceremoniesfn10” it is known in alislam as “the minaret without the mosque” opposed to masjid nimrah which is the “mosque without the minaret” halfway between muna and arafat it is about three miles from both there is something peculiarly striking in the distant appearance of the tall solitary tower rising abruptly from the desolate valley of gravel flanked with buttresses of yellow rock no wonder that the ancient arabs loved to give the highsounding name of this oratory to distant places in their giant caliphempire  here as we halted to perform the midday prayer we were overtaken by the damascus caravan it was a grand spectacle the mahmil no longer naked as upon the line of march flashed in the sun all green and gold around the moving host of whiterobed pilgrims hovered a crowd of badawin male and female all mounted on swift dromedaries and many of them armed to the teeth as their drapery floated in the wind and their faces were veiled with the “lisam” it was frequently difficult to  p182 distinguish the sex of the wild being flogging its animal to speed these people as has been said often resort to arafat for bloodrevenge in hopes of finding the victim unprepared nothing can be more sinful in alislam than such deed—it is murder “made sicker” by sacrilege yet the prevalence of the practice proves how feeble is the religion’s hold upon the race the women are as unscrupulous i remarked many of them emulating the men in reckless riding and striking with their sticks every animal in the way  travelling eastward up the arafat fiumara after about half an hour we came to a narrow pass called alakhshabaynfn11 or the “two rugged hills” here the spurs of the rock limited the road to about a hundred paces and it is generally a scene of great confusion after this we arrived at albazan the basinfn12 a widening of the plain and another halfhour brought us to the alamayn the “two signs” whitewashed pillars or rather thin narrow walls surmounted with pinnacles which denote the precincts of the arafat plain here in full sight of the holy hill standing boldly out from the deep blue sky the host of pilgrims broke into loud labbayks a little beyond and to our right was the simple enclosure called the masjid nimrahfn13 we then  p183 turned from our eastern course northwards and began threading our way down the main street of the town of tents which clustered about the southern foot of arafat at last about three pm we found a vacant space near the matbakh or kitchen formerly belonging to a sharif’s palace but now a ruin with a few shells of arches  arafat is about six hours’ very slow march or twelve milesfn14 on the taif road due east of meccah we arrived there in a shorter time but our weary camels during the last third of the way frequently threw themselves upon the ground human beings suffered more between muna and arafat i saw no fewer than five men fall down and die upon the highway exhausted and moribund they had dragged themselves out to give up the ghost where it departs to instant beatitudefn15 the spectacle showed how easy it is to die in these latitudesfn16 each man suddenly staggered fell as if shot and after a brief convulsion lay still as marble the corpses were carefully taken up and carelessly buried that same evening in a vacant space amongst the crowds encamped upon the arafat plainfn17  the boy mohammed who had long chafed at my pertinacious p184 claim to darwayshhood resolved on this occasion to be grand to swell the party he had invited omar effendi whom we accidentally met in the streets of meccah to join us but failing therein he brought with him two cousins fat youths of sixteen and seventeen and his mother’s groundfloor servants these were four indians an old man his wife a middleaged woman of the most ordinary appearance their son a sharp boy who spoke excellent arabicfn18 and a family friend a stout fellow about thirty years old they were panjabis and the bachelor’s history was instructive he was gaining an honest livelihood in his own country when suddenly one night hazrat ali dressed in green and mounted upon his charger duldulfn19—at least so said the narrator—appeared crying in a terrible voice “how long wilt thou toil for this world and be idle about the life to come” from that moment like an english murderer he knew no peace conscience and hazrat ali haunted himfn20 finding  p185 life unendurable at home he sold everything raised the sum of twenty pounds and started for the holy land he reached jeddah with a few rupees in his pocket and came to meccah where everything being exorbitantly dear and charity all but unknown he might have starved had he not been received by his old friend the married pair and their son had been taken as houseservants by the boy mohammed’s mother who generously allowed them shelter and a pound of rice per diem to each but not a farthing of pay they were even expected to provide their own turmeric and onions yet these poor people were anxiously awaiting the opportunity to visit almadinah without which their pilgrimage would not they believed be complete they would beg their way through the terrible desert and its badawin—an old man a boy and a woman what were their chances of returning to their homes such i believe is too often the history of those wretches whom a fit of religious enthusiasm likest to insanity hurries away to the holy land i strongly recommend the subject to the consideration of our indian government as one that calls loudly for their interference no eastern ruler parts as we do with his subjects all object to lose productive power to an “empire of opinion” this emigration is fraught with evils it sends forth a horde of malcontents that ripen into bigots it teaches foreign nations to despise our rule and it unveils the present nakedness of once wealthy india and we have both prevention and cure in our own hands  as no moslem except the maliki is bound to pilgrimage without a sum sufficient to support himself and his family all who embark at the different ports of india should be obliged to prove their solvency before being provided with a permit arrived at jeddah they should present the certificate at the british viceconsulate where they would become entitled to assistance in case of necessity the viceconsul at jeddah ought also to be instructed  p186 to assist our indian pilgrims mr cole when holding that appointment informed me that though men die of starvation in the streets he was unable to relieve them the highways of meccah abound in pathetic indian beggars who affect lank bodies shrinking frames whining voices and all the circumstance of misery because it supports them in idleness  there are no fewer than fifteen hundred indians at meccah and jeddah besides seven or eight hundred in alyaman such a body requires a consulfn21 by the representation of a viceconsul when other powers send an officer of superior rank to alhijaz we voluntarily place ourselves in an inferior position and although the meccan sharif might for a time object to establishing a moslem agent at the holy city with orders to report to the consul at jeddah his opposition would soon fall to the ground  with the indians’ assistance the boy mohammed removed the handsome persian rugs with which he had covered the shugduf pitched the tent carpeted the ground disposed a diwan of silk and satin cushions round the interior and strewed the centre with new chibuks and highly polished shishahs at the doorway was placed a large copper firepan with coffeepots singing a welcome to visitors in front of us were the litters and by divers similar arrangements our establishment was made to look fine the youth also insisted upon my removing the rida or upper cotton cloth which had become waysoiled and he supplied its place by a rich cashmere left with him some years before by a son of the king of delhi little thought i that this bravery of attire would lose me every word of the arafat sermon next day  arafat anciently called jabal ilal arabic “the mount  p187 of wrestling in prayer” and now jabal alrahmah the “mount of mercy” is a mass of coarse granite split into large blocks with a thin coat of withered thorns about one mile in circumference it rises abruptly to the height of a hundred and eighty or two hundred feet from the low gravelly plain—a dwarf wall at the southern base forming the line of demarcation it is separated by batn arnah arabic a sandy valefn22 from the spurs of the taif hills nothing can be more picturesque than the view it affords of the azure peaks behind and the vast encampment scattered over the barren yellow plain belowfn23 on the north lay the regularly pitched camp of the guards that defend the unarmed pilgrims to the eastward was the sharif’s encampment with the bright mahmils and  p188 the gilt knobs of the grandees’ pavilions whilst on the southern and western sides the tents of the vulgar crowded the ground disposed in dowar or circles after many calculations i estimated the number to be not fewer than 50000 of all ages and sexes a sad falling off it is true but still considerable  ali bey ad 1807 calculates 83000 pilgrims burckhardt 1814 70000 i reduce it in 1853 to 50000 and in ad 1854 owing to political causes it fell to about 25000 of these at fewest 10000 are meccans as every one who can leave the city does so at pilgrimagetime the arabs have a superstition that the numbers at arafat cannot be counted and that if fewer than 600000 mortals stand upon the hill to hear the sermon the angels descend and complete the number even this year my arab friends declared that 150000 spirits were present in human shape it may be observed that when the good old bertrand de la brocquiere esquirecarver to philip of burgundy declares that the yearly caravan from damascus to almadinah must always be composed of 700000 persons and that this number being incomplete allah sends some of his angels to make it up he probably confounds the caravan with the arafat multitude  the holy hill owes its namefn24 and honours to a wellknown legend when our first parents forfeited heaven by eating wheat which deprived them of their primeval purity they were cast down upon earth the serpent descended at ispahan the peacock at kabul satan at bilbays others say semnan and seistan eve upon arafat and adam at ceylon the latter determining to seek his wife began a journey to which earth owes its present mottled appearance wherever our first father p189 placed his foot—which was large—a town afterwards arose between the strides will always be “country” wandering for many years he came to the mountain of mercy where our common mother was continually calling upon his name and their recognition gave the place the name of arafat upon its summit adam instructed by the archangel gabriel erected a mada’a or place of prayer and between this spot and the nimrah mosque the couple abode till death others declare that after recognition the first pair returned to india whence for 44 years in succession they visited the sacred city at pilgrimagetime  from the holy hill i walked down to look at the camp arrangements the main street of tents and booths huts and shops was bright with lanterns and the bazars were crowded with people and stocked with all manner of eastern delicacies some anomalous spectacles met the eye many pilgrims especially the soldiers were in laical costume in one place a halfdrunken arnaut stalked down the road elbowing peaceful passengers and frowning fiercely in hopes of a quarrel in another part a huge dimlylit tent reeking hot and garnished with cane seats contained knots of egyptians as their red tarbushes white turbands and black za’abuts showed noisily intoxicating themselves with forbidden hemp there were frequent brawls and great confusion many men had lost their parties and mixed with loud labbayks rose the shouted names of women as well as of men i was surprised at the disproportion of female nomenclature—the missing number of fair ones seemed to double that of the other sex—and at a practice so opposed to the customs of the moslem world at length the boy mohammed enlightened me egyptian and other bold women when unable to join the pilgrimage will pay or persuade a friend to shout their names  p190 in hearing of the holy hill with a view of ensuring a real presence at the desired spot next year so the welkin rang with the indecent sounds of o fatimah o zaynab o khayz’ranfn25 plunderers too were abroad as we returned to the tent we found a crowd assembled near it a woman had seized a thief as he was beginning operations and had the courage to hold his beard till men ran to her assistance and we were obliged to defend by force our position against a knot of gravediggers who would bury a little heap of bodies within a yard or two of our tent  one point struck me at once—the difference in point of cleanliness between an encampment of citizens and of badawin poor mas’ud sat holding his nose in ineffable disgust for which he was derided by the meccans i consoled him with quoting the celebrated song of maysunah the beautiful badawi wife of the caliph mu’awiyah nothing can be more charming in its own arabic than this little song the badawin never hear it without screams of joy  “o take these purple robes away give back my cloak of camel’s hair and bear me from this tow’ring pile to where the black tents flap i’ the air the camel’s colt with falt’ring tread the dog that bays at all but me delight me more than ambling mules— than every art of minstrelsy and any cousin poor but free might take me fatted ass from theefn26”  p191 the old man delighted clapped my shoulder and exclaimed “verily o father of mustachios i will show thee the black tents of my tribe this year”  at length night came and we threw ourselves upon our rugs but not to sleep close by to our bane was a prayerful old gentleman who began his devotions at a late hour and concluded them not before dawn he reminded me of the undergraduate my neighbour at trinity college oxford who would spout aeschylus at two am sometimes the chant would grow drowsy and my ears would hear a dull retreating sound presently as if in selfreproach it would rise to a sharp treble and proceed at a rate perfectly appalling the coffeehouses too were by no means silent deep into the night i heard the clapping of hands accompanying merry arab songs and the loud shouts of laughter of the egyptian hempdrinkers and the guards

plain the calcutta review art 1 sept 1853 notably errs in making arafat eighteen miles east of meccah ibn jubayr reckons five miles from meccah to muzdalifah and five from this to arafat fn15 those who die on a pilgrimage become martyrs fn16 i cannot help believing that some unknown cause renders death easier to man in hot than in cold climates certain it is that in europe rare are the quiet and painless deathbeds so common in the east fn17 we bury our dead to preserve them as it were the moslem tries to secure rapid decomposition and makes the graveyard a dangerous as well as a disagreeable place fn18 arabs observe that indians unless brought young into the country never learn its language well they have a word to express the vicious pronunciation of a slave or an indian “barbaret alhunud” this root barbara arabic like the greek “barbaros” appears to be derived from the sanscrit varvvaraha an outcast a barbarian a man with curly hair fn19 ali’s charger was named maymun or according to others zu’l janah the winged indians generally confound it with “duldul” mohammed’s mule fn20 these visions are common in history ali appeared to the imam shafe’i saluted him—an omen of eternal felicity—placed a ring upon his finger as a sign that his fame should extend wide as the donor’s and sent him to the holy land ibrahim bin adham the saintpoet hearing when hunting a voice exclaim “man it is not for this that allah made thee” answered “it is allah who speaks his servant will obey” he changed clothes with an attendant and wandered forth upon a pilgrimage celebrated in alislam he performed it alone and making 1100 genuflexions each mile prolonged it to twelve years the history of colonel gardiner and of many others amongst ourselves prove that these visions are not confined to the arabs fn21 there is a consul for jeddah now 1879 but till lately he was an unpaid fn22 this vale is not considered “standingground” because satan once appeared to the prophet as he was traversing it fn23 according to kutb aldin the arafat plain was once highly cultivated stonelined cisterns abound and ruins of buildings are frequent at the eastern foot of the mountain was a broad canal beginning at a spur of the taif hills and conveying water to meccah it is now destroyed beyond arafat the plain is cut with torrents which at times sweep with desolating violence into the holy city and a thick desert vegetation shows that water is not deep below the surface fn24 the word is explained in many ways one derivation has already been mentioned others assert that when gabriel taught abraham the ceremonies he ended by saying “a’arafata manasik’ak”—hast thou learned thy pilgrim rites to which the friend of allah replied “araftu”—i have learned them fn25 the latter name “ratan” is servile respectable women are never publicly addressed by moslems except as “daughter” “female pilgrim” after some male relation “o mother of mohammed” “o sister of omar” or tout bonnement by a man’s name it would be illomened and dangerous were the true name known so most women when travelling adopt an alias whoever knew an afghan fair who was not “nur jan” or “sahib jan” fn26 the british reader will be shocked to hear that by the term “fatted ass” the intellectual lady alluded to her husband the story is that mu’awiyah overhearing the song sent back the singer to her cousin and beloved wilds maysunah departed with her son yazid and did not return to damascus till the “fatted ass” had joined his forefathers yazid inherited with his mother’s talents all her contempt for his father at least the following quatrain addressed to mu’awiyah and generally known in alislam would appear to argue anything but reverence—  “i drank the water of the vine that draught had power to rouse thy wrath grim father now indeed ’tis joyous to carouse i’ll drink—be wroth—i reck not—ah dear to this heart of mine it is to scoff a sire’s command to quaff forbidden wine”  p192 chapter xxix  the ceremonies of the yaum arafat or the second day  the morning of the ninth zu’l hijjah tuesday 13th sept was ushered in by military sounds a loud discharge of cannon warned us to arise and to prepare for the ceremonies of this eventful day  after ablution and prayer i proceeded with the boy mohammed to inspect the numerous consecrated sites on the “mountain of mercy” in the first place we repaired to a spot on rising ground to the southeast and within a hundred yards of the hill it is called “jami alsakhrahfn1”—the assembling place of the rock—from two granite boulders upon which the prophet stood to perform “talbiyat” there is nothing but a small enclosure of dwarf and whitewashed stone walls divided into halves for men and women by a similar partition and provided with a niche to direct prayer towards meccah entering by steps we found crowds of devotees and guardians who for a consideration offered mats and carpets after a twobow prayer and a long supplication opposite the niche we retired to the inner compartment stood upon a boulder and shouted the “labbayk”  thence threading our way through many obstacles  p193 of tent and stone we ascended the broad flight of rugged steps which winds up the southern face of the rocky hill even at this early hour it was crowded with pilgrims principally badawin and wahhabis who had secured favourable positions for hearing the sermon already their green flag was planted upon the summit close to adam’s place of prayer the wilder arabs insist that “wukuf” standing should take place upon the hill this is not done by the more civilised who hold that all the plain within the alamayn ranks as arafat according to ali bey the maliki school is not allowed to stand upon the mountain about half way up i counted sixtysix steps and remarked that they became narrower and steeper crowds of beggars instantly seized the pilgrims’ robes and strove to prevent our entering a second enclosure this place which resembles the former except that it has but one compartment and no boulders is that whence mohammed used to address his followers and here to the present day the khatib or preacher in imitation of the “last of the prophets” sitting upon a dromedary recites the arafat sermon here also we prayed a twobow prayer and gave a small sum to the guardian  thence ascending with increased difficulty to the hilltop we arrived at a large stuccoed platformfn2 with prayerniche and a kind of obelisk mean and badly built of lime and granite stone whitewashed and conspicuous from afar it is called the makam or mada’a sayyidna adamfn3  here we performed the customary ceremonies amongst a crowd of pilgrims and then we walked down the little hill  p194 close to the plain we saw the place where the egyptian and damascus mahmils stand during the sermon and descending the wall that surrounds arafat by a steep and narrow flight of coarse stone steps we found on our right the fountain which supplies the place with water it bubbles from the rock and is exceedingly pure as such water generally is in alhijaz  our excursion employed us longer than the description requires—nine o’clock had struck before we reached the plain all were in a state of excitement guns fired incessantly horsemen and camelriders galloped about without apparent object even the women and the children stood and walked too restless even to sleep arrived at the tent i was unpleasantly surprised to find a new visitor in an old acquaintance ali ibn ya sin the zemzemi he had lost his mule and wandering in search of its keepers he unfortunately fell in with our party i had solid reasons to regret the mishap—he was far too curious and too observant to suit my tastes on the present occasion he being uncomfortable made us equally so accustomed to all the terrible “neatness” of an elderly damsel in great britain a few specks of dirt upon the rugs and half a dozen bits of cinder upon the ground sufficed to give him attacks of “nerves”  that day we breakfasted late for night must come before we could eat again after midday prayer we performed ablutions some the greater others the less in preparation for the “wukuf” or standing from noon onwards the hum and murmur of the multitude increased and people were seen swarming about in all directions  a second discharge of cannon at about 315 pm announced the approach of alasr the afternoon prayer and almost immediately we heard the naubat or band preceding the sharif’s procession as he wended his way towards the mountain fortunately my tent was pitched close to the road so that without trouble i had a perfect  p195 view of the scene first swept a cloud of macebearers who as usual on such occasions cleared the path with scant ceremony they were followed by the horsemen of the desert wielding long and tufted spears immediately behind them came the sharif’s led horses upon which i fixed a curious eye all were highly bred and one a brown nijdi with black points struck me as the perfection of an arab they were small and all were apparently of the northern racefn4 of their old crimsonvelvet  p196 caparisons the less said the better no little indian nawab would show aught so shabby on state occasions  after the chargers paraded a band of black slaves on foot bearing huge matchlocks and immediately preceded by three green and two red flags came the sharif riding in front of his family and courtiers the prince habited in a simple white ihram and bareheaded mounted a mule the only sign of his rank was a large green and gold embroidered umbrella held over him by a slave the rear was brought up by another troop of badawin on horses and camels behind this procession were the tents whose doors and walls were scarcely visible for the crowd and the picturesque background was the granite hill covered wherever standingroom was to be found with whiterobed pilgrims shouting “labbayk” and waving the skirts of their glistening garments violently over their heads  slowly and solemnly the procession advanced towards the hill exactly at the hour alasr the two mahmils had taken their station side by side on a platform in the lower slope that of damascus could be distinguished as the narrower and the more ornamented of the pair the sharif placed himself with his standardbearers and his retinue a little above the mahmils within hearing of the preacher the pilgrims crowded up to the foot of the mountain the loud “labbayk” of the badawin and  p197 wahhabisfn5 fell to a solemn silence and the waving of white robes ceased—a sign that the preacher had begun the khutbat alwakfah or sermon of the standing upon arafat from my tent i could distinguish the form of the old man upon his camel but the distance was too great for ear to reach  but how came i to be at the tent  a short confession will explain they will shrive me who believe in inspired spenser’s lines—  “and every spirit as it is more pure and hath in it the more of heavenly light so it the fairer body doth procure to habit in”—  the evil came of a “fairer body” i had prepared en cachette a slip of paper and had hid in my ihram a pencil destined to put down the heads of this rarely heard discourse but unhappily that red cashmere shawl was upon my shoulders close to us sat a party of fair meccans apparently belonging to the higher classes and one of these i had already several times remarked she was a tall girl about eighteen years old with regular features a skin somewhat citrinecoloured but soft and clear symmetrical eyebrows the most beautiful eyes and a figure all grace there was no head thrown back no straightened neck no flat shoulders nor toes turned out—in fact no “elegant” barbarisms the shape was what the arabs love soft bending and relaxed as a woman’s  p198 figure ought to be unhappily she wore instead of the usual veil a “yashmak” of transparent muslin bound round the face and the chaperone mother or duenna by whose side she stood was apparently a very unsuspicious or complaisant old person flirtilla fixed a glance of admiration upon my cashmere i directed a reply with interest at her eyes she then by the usual coquettish gesture threw back an inch or two of headveil disclosing broad bands of jetty hair crowning a lovely oval my palpable admiration of the new charm was rewarded by a partial removal of the yashmak when a dimpled mouth and a rounded chin stood out from the envious muslin seeing that my companions were safely employed i entered upon the dangerous ground of raising hand to forehead she smiled almost imperceptibly and turned away the pilgrim was in ecstasy  the sermon was then half over i was resolved to stay upon the plain and see what flirtilla would do grace to the cashmere we came to a good understanding the next page will record my disappointment—that evening the pilgrim resumed his soiled cotton cloth and testily returned the red shawl to the boy mohammed  the sermon always lasts till near sunset or about three hours at first it was spoken amid profound silence then loud scattered “amins” amens and volleys of “labbayk” exploded at uncertain intervals at last the breeze brought to our ears a purgatorial chorus of cries sobs and shrieks even my party thought proper to be affected old ali rubbed his eyes which in no case unconnected with dollars could by any amount of straining be made to shed even a crocodile’s tear and the boy mohammed wisely hid his face in the skirt of his rida presently the people exhausted by emotion began to descend the hill in small parties and those below struck their tents and commenced loading their camels although at least an hour’s sermon remained on this occassion p199 however all hurry to be foremost as the “race from arafat” is enjoyed by none but the badawin  although we worked with a will our animals were not ready to move before sunset when the preacher gave the signal of “israf” or permission to depart the pilgrims  “—swaying to and fro like waves of a great sea that in mid shock confound each other white with foam and fear”  rushed down the hill with a “labbayk” sounding like a blast and took the road to muna then i saw the scene which has given to this part of the ceremonies the name of aldaf’a min arafat—the “hurry from arafat” every man urged his beast with might and main it was sunset the plain bristled with tentpegs litters were crushed pedestrians were trampled camels were overthrown single combats with sticks and other weapons took place here a woman there a child and there an animal were lost briefly it was a chaotic confusion  to my disgust old ali insisted upon bestowing his company upon me he gave over his newly found mule to the boy mohammed bidding him take care of the beast and mounted with me in the shugduf i had persuaded shaykh mas’ud with a dollar to keep close in rear of the pretty meccan and i wanted to sketch the holy hill the senior began to give orders about the camel—i counterorders the camel was halted i urged it on old ali directed it to be stopped meanwhile the charming face that smiled at me from the litter grew dimmer and dimmer the more i stormed the less i was listened to—a string of camels crossed our path—i lost sight of the beauty then we began to advance again my determination to sketch seemed likely to fail before the zemzemi’s little snake’s eye after a few minutes’ angry search for expedients one suggested itself “effendi” said old ali “sit quiet there is danger here” i tossed about like one suffering from evil conscience or from the  p200 colic “effendi” shrieked the senior “what art thou doing thou wilt be the death of us” “wallah” i replied with a violent plunge “it is all thy fault there” another plunge—“put thy beard out of the other opening and allah will make it easy to us” in the ecstasy of fear my tormentor turned his face as he was bidden towards the camel’s head a second halt ensued when i looked out of the aperture in rear and made a rough drawing of the mountain of mercy  at the akhshabayn double lines of camels bristling with litters clashed with a shock more noisy than the meeting of torrents it was already dark no man knew what he was doing the guns roared their brazen notes reechoed far and wide by the harsh voices of the stony hills a shower of rockets bursting in the air threw into still greater confusion the timorous mob of women and children at the same time martial music rose from the masses of nizam and the stouterhearted pilgrims were not sparing of their labbaykfn6 and “id kum mubarakfn7”—“may your festival be happy”  after the pass of the two rugged hills the road widened and old ali who during the bumping had been in a silent convulsion of terror recovered speech and spirits this change he evidenced by beginning to be troublesome once more again i resolved to be his equal exclaiming “my eyes are yellow with hunger” i seized a pot full of savoury meat which the old man had previously stored for supper and without further preamble began to eat it greedily at the same time ready to shout with laughter at the mumbling and grumbling sounds that proceeded from the darkness of the litter we were at least three hours on the road before reaching  p201 muzdalifah and being fatigued we resolved to pass the night therefn8 the mosque was brilliantly illuminated but my hungry companionsfn9 apparently thought more of supper and of sleep than of devotionfn10 whilst the tent was being raised the indians prepared our food boiled our coffee filled our pipes and spread our rugs before sleeping each man collected for himself seven “jamrah”—bits of granite the size of a small beanfn11 then weary with emotion and exertion all lay down except the boy mohammed who preceded us to find encamping ground at muna old ali in lending his mule made the most stringent arrangements with the youth about the exact place and the exact hour of meeting—an act of simplicity at which i could not but smile the night was by no means peaceful or silent lines of camels passed us every ten minutes and the shouting of travellers continued till near dawn pilgrims ought to have nighted at the mosque but as in burckhardt’s time so in mine baggage was considered to be in danger thereabouts and consequently most of the devotees spent the sermonhours in brooding over their boxes  fn1 ali bey calls it “jami alrahmah”—of mercy fn2 here was a small chapel which the wahhabis were demolishing when ali bey was at meccah it has not been rebuilt upon this spot the prophet according to burckhardt used to stand during the ceremonies fn3 burckhardt gives this name to a place a little way on the left and about forty steps up the mountain fn4 in solomon’s time the egyptian horse cost 150 silver shekels which if the greater shekel be meant would still be about the average price £18 abbas the late pasha did his best to buy firstrate arab stallions on one occasion he sent a mission to almadinah for the sole purpose of fetching a rare work on farriery yet it is doubted whether he ever had a firstrate nijdi a badawi sent to cairo by one of the chiefs of nijd being shown by the viceroy’s order over the stables on being asked his opinion of the blood replied bluntly to the great man’s disgust that they did not contain a single thoroughbred he added an apology on the part of his laird for the animals he had brought from arabia saying that neither sultan nor shaykh could procure colts of the best strain for none of these horses would a staunch admirer of the longlegged monster called in england a thoroughbred give twenty pounds they are mere “rats” short and stunted ragged and fleshless with rough coats and a slouching walk but the experienced glance notes at once the fine snakelike head ears like reeds wide and projecting nostrils large eyes fiery and soft alternately broad brow deep base of skull wide chest crooked tail limbs padded with muscle and long elastic pasterns and the animal put out to speed soon displays the wondrous force of blood in fact when buying arabs there are only three things to be considered—blood blood and again blood in marco polo’s time aden supplied the indian market the state of the tribes round the “eye of yaman” has effectually closed the road against horsecaravans for many years past it is said that the zu mohammed and the zu hosayn subfamilies of the benu yam a large tribe living around and north of sana’a in alyaman have a fine large breed called aljaufi and the clan alaulaki arabic rear animals celebrated for swiftness and endurance the other races are stunted and some arabs declare that the air of alyaman causes a degeneracy in the first generation the badawin on the contrary uphold their superiority and talk with the utmost contempt of the african horse in india we now depend for arab blood upon the persian gulf and the consequences of monopoly display themselves in an increased price for inferior animals our studs are generally believed to be sinks for rupees the governments of india now object it is said to rearing at a great cost animals distinguished by nothing but ferocity it is evident that alhijaz never can stock the indian market whether alnijd will supply us when the transit becomes safer is a consideration which time only can decide meanwhile it would be highly advisable to take steps for restoring the aden trade by entering into closer relations with the imam of sana’a and the badawi chiefs in the north of alyaman fn5 i obtained the following note upon the ceremonies of wahhabi pilgrimage from one of their princes khalid bey—the wahhabi who it must be borne in mind calls himself a muwahhid or unitarian in opposition to mushrik—polytheist—any other sect but his own at meccah follows out his two principal tenets public prayer for men daily for women on fridays and rejection of the prophet’s mediation imitating mohammed he spends the first night of pilgrimage at muna stands upon the hill arafat and returning to muna passes three whole days there he derides other moslems abridges and simplifies the ka’abah ceremonies and if possible is guided in his devotions by one of his own sect fn6 this cry is repeated till the pilgrim reaches muna not afterwards fn7 another phrase is “antum min alaidin”—“may you be of the keepers of festival” fn8 hanafis usually follow the prophet’s example in nighting at muzdalifah in the evening after prayers they attend at the mosque listen to the discourse and shed plentiful tears most shafe’is spend only a few hours at muzdalifah fn9 we failed to buy meat at arafat after noon although the bazar was large and well stocked it is usual to eat flesh there consequently it is greedily bought up at an exorbitant price fn10 some sects consider the prayer at muzdalifah a matter of vital importance fn11 jamrah is a “small pebble” it is also called “hasa” in the plural “hasayat”  p202 chapter xxx  the ceremonies of the yaum nahr or the third day  at dawn on the id alkurban 10th zu’l hijjah wednesday 14th september a gun warned us to lose no time we arose hurriedly and started up the batn muhassir to muna by this means we lost at muzdalifah the “salat alid” or “festival prayers” the great solemnity of the moslem year performed by all the community at daybreak my companion was so anxious to reach meccah that he would not hear of devotions about eight am we entered the village and looked for the boy mohammed in vain old ali was dreadfully perplexed a host of highborn turkish pilgrims were he said expecting him his mule was missing—could never appear—he must be late—should probably never reach meccah—what would become of him i began by administering admonition to the mind diseased but signally failing in a cure i amused myself with contemplating the world from my shugduf leaving the office of directing it to the old zemzemi now he stopped then he pressed forward here he thought he saw mohammed there he discovered our tent at one time he would “nakh” the camel to await in patience his supreme hour at another half mad with nervousness he would urge the excellent mas’ud to hopeless inquiries finally by good fortune we found one of the boy mohammed’s cousins who led us to an enclosure p203 called hosh aluzam in the southern portion of the muna basin at the base of mount sabirfn1 there we pitched the tent refreshed ourselves and awaited the truant’s return old ali failing to disturb my equanimity attempted as those who consort with philosophers often will do to quarrel with me but finding no material wherewith to build a dispute in such fragments as “ah”—“hem”—“wallah” he hinted desperate intentions against the boy mohammed when however the youth appeared with even more jauntiness of mien than usual ali bin ya sin lost heart brushed by him mounted his mule and doubtless cursing us “under the tongue” rode away frowning viciously with his heels playing upon the beast’s ribs  mohammed had been delayed he said by the difficulty of finding asses we were now to mount for “the throwingfn2” as a preliminary to which we washed “with seven waters” the seven pebbles brought from muzdalifah and bound them in our ihrams our first destination was the entrance to the western end of the long line which composes the muna village we found a swarming crowd in the narrow road opposite the “jamrat alakabahfn3” or as it is vulgarly called the shaytan alkabir—the “great devil” these names distinguish it from another pillar the “wusta” or “central place” of stoning built in the middle of muna and a third at the eastern end “alaula” or the “first placefn4”  the “shaytan alkabir” is a dwarf buttress of rude  p204 masonry about eight feet high by two and a half broad placed against a rough wall of stones at the meccan entrance to muna as the ceremony of “ramy” or lapidation must be performed on the first day by all pilgrims between sunrise and sunset and as the fiend was malicious enough to appear in a rugged passfn5 the crowd makes the place dangerous on one side of the road which is not forty feet broad stood a row of shops belonging principally to barbers on the other side is the rugged wall against which the pillar stands with a chevaux de frise of badawin and naked boys the narrow space was crowded with pilgrims all struggling like drowning men to approach as near as possible to the devil it would have been easy to run over the heads of the mass amongst them were horsemen with rearing chargers badawin on wild camels and grandees on mules and asses with outrunners were breaking a way by assault and battery i had read ali bey’s selffelicitations upon escaping this place with “only two wounds in the left leg” and i had duly provided myself with a hidden dagger the precaution was not useless scarcely had my donkey entered the crowd than he was overthrown by a dromedary and i found myself under the stamping and roaring beast’s stomach avoiding being trampled upon by a judicious use of the knife i lost no time in escaping from a place so ignobly dangerous some moslem travellers assert in proof of the sanctity of the spot that no moslem is ever killed here meccans assured me that accidents are by no means rare  presently the boy mohammed fought his way out of the crowd with a bleeding nose we both sat down upon a bench before a barber’s booth and schooled by adversity  p205 awaited with patience an opportunity finding an opening we approached within about five cubits of the place and holding each stone between the thumb and the forefingerfn6 of the right hand we cast it at the pillar exclaiming “in the name of allah and allah is almighty i do this in hatred of the fiend and to his shame” after which came the tahlil and the “sana” or praise to allah the seven stones being duly thrown we retired and entering the barber’s booth took our places upon one of the earthern benches around it this was the time to remove the ihram or pilgrim’s garb and to return to ihlal the normal state of alislam the barber shaved our headsfn7 and after trimming our beards and cutting our nails made us repeat these words “i purpose loosening my ihram according to the practice of the prophet whom may allah bless and preserve o allah make unto me in every hair a light a purity and a generous reward in the name of allah and allah is almighty” at the conclusion of his labour the barber politely addressed to us a “na’iman—pleasure to you” to which we as ceremoniously replied “allah give thee pleasure” we had no clothes with us but we could use our cloths to cover our heads and slippers to defend our feet from the fiery sun and we now could safely twirl our mustachios and stroke our beards—placid enjoyments of which we had been deprived by the  p206 laws of pilgrimage after resting about an hour in the booth which though crowded with sitting customers was delightfully cool compared with the burning glare of the road we mounted our asses and at eleven am we started meccahwards  this return from muna to meccah is called alnafr or the flightfn8 we did not fail to keep our asses at speed with a few halts to refresh ourselves with gugglets of water there was nothing remarkable in the scene our ride in was a repetition of our ride out in about half an hour we entered the city passing through that classical locality called “batn kuraysh” which was crowded with people and then we repaired to the boy mohammed’s house for the purpose of bathing and preparing to visit the ka’abah  shortly after our arrival the youth returned home in a state of excitement exclaiming “rise effendi dress and follow me” the ka’abah though open would for a time be empty so that we should escape the crowd my pilgrim’s garb which had not been removed was made to look neat and somewhat indian and we sallied forth together without loss of time  a crowd had gathered round the ka’abah and i had no wish to stand bareheaded and barefooted in the midday september sun at the cry of “open a path for the haji who would enter the house” the gazers made way two stout meccans who stood below the door raised me in their arms whilst a third drew me from above into the building at the entrance i was accosted by several officials darklooking meccans of whom the blackest and plainest was a youth of the benu shaybah familyfn9  p207 the sangreazul of alhijaz he held in his hand the huge silvergilt padlock of the ka’abahfn10 and presently taking his seat upon a kind of wooden press in the left corner of the hall he officially inquired my name nation and other particulars the replies were satisfactory and the boy mohammed was authoritatively ordered to conduct me round the building and to recite the prayers i will not deny that looking at the windowless walls the officials at the door and the crowd of excited fanatics below—  “and the place death considering who i was”fn11 my feelings were of the trappedrat description acknowledged by the immortal nephew of his uncle perez this did not however prevent my carefully observing the scene during our long prayers and making a rough plan with a pencil upon my white ihram  nothing is more simple than the interior of this celebrated building the pavement which is level with the ground is composed of slabs of fine and various coloured marbles mostly however white disposed chequerwise the walls as far as they can be seen are of the same material but the pieces are irregularly shaped and many of them are engraved with long inscriptions in the suls and other modern characters the upper part of the walls together with the ceiling at which it is considered disrespectful to lookfn12 are covered with handsome  p208 red damask flowered over with goldfn13 and tucked up about six feet high so as to be removed from pilgrims’ hands the flat roof is upheld by three crossbeams whose shapes appear under the arras they rest upon the eastern and western walls and are supported in the centre by three columnsfn14 about twenty inches in diameter covered with carved and ornamented aloes woodfn15 at the iraki corner there is a dwarf door called bab altaubah of repentancefn16 it leads into a narrow passage and to the staircase by which the servants ascend to the roof it is never opened except for working purposes the “aswad” or  p209 “as’adfn17” corner is occupied by a flattopped and quadrantshaped press or safefn18 in which at times is placed the key of the ka’abahfn19 both door and safe are of aloes wood between the columns and about nine feet from the ground ran bars of a metal which i could not distinguish and hanging to them were many lamps said to be of gold  although there were in the ka’abah but a few attendants engaged in preparing it for the entrance of pilgrimsfn20 the windowless stone walls and the chokedup door made it worse than the piombi of venice perspiration trickled in large drops and i thought with horror what it must be when filled with a mass of furiously jostling and crushing fanatics our devotions consisted of a twobow prayerfn21 followed by long supplications at the shami west corner the iraki north angle the yamani south and lastly opposite the southern third of the back wallfn22 these concluded i returned to the door where payment is made the boy mohammed told me that the total expense would be seven dollars at the same time he had been indulging aloud in his favourite rhodomontade boasting of my greatness and had declared me to be an indian pilgrim a race still supposed at  p210 meccah to be made of goldfn23 when seven dollars were tendered they were rejected with instance expecting something of the kind i had been careful to bring no more than eight being pulled and interpellated by half a dozen attendants my course was to look stupid and to pretend ignorance of the language presently the shaybah youth bethought him of a contrivance drawing forth from the press the key of the ka’abah he partly bared it of its greensilk goldlettered etuifn24 and rubbed a golden knob quartrefoilshaped upon my eyes in order to brighten them i submitted to the operation with a good grace and added a dollar—my last—to the former offering the sharif received it with a hopeless glance and to my satisfaction would not put forth his hand to be kissed then the attendants began to demand vails i replied by opening my empty pouch when let down from the door by the two brawny meccans i was expected to pay them and accordingly appointed to meet them at the boy mohammed’s house an arrangement to which they grumblingly assented when delivered from these troubles i was congratulated by my sharp companion thus “wallah effendi thou hast escaped well some men have left their skins behindfn25”  p211 all pilgrims do not enter the ka’abahfn26 and many refuse to do so for religious reasons omar effendi for instance who never missed a pilgrimage had never seen the interiorfn27 those who tread the hallowed floor are bound among many other things never again to walk barefooted to take up fire with the fingers or to tell lies most really conscientious men cannot afford the luxuries of slippers tongs and truth so thought thomas when offered the apple which would give him the tongue which cannot lie—  “‘my tongue is mine ain’ true thomas said ‘a gudely gift ye wad gie to me i neither dought to buy nor sell at fair or tryst where i may be i dought neither speak to prince or peer nor ask of grace from fair ladye’”  amongst the hindus i have met with men who have proceeded upon a pilgrimage to dwarka and yet who would not receive the brand of the god because lying would then be forbidden to them a confidential servant of a friend in bombay naïvely declared that he had not been marked as the act would have ruined him there is a sad truth in what he said lying to the oriental is meat and drink and the roof that shelters him  the ka’abah had been dressed in her new attire when we enteredfn28 the covering however instead of being  p212 secured at the bottom to the metal rings in the basement was tucked up by ropes from the roof and depended over each face in two long tongues it was of a brilliant black and the hizam—the zone or golden band running round the upper portion of the building—as well as the burka faceveil were of dazzling brightnessfn29  the origin of this custom must be sought in the ancient practice of typifying the church visible by a virgin or bride the poet abd alrahim al bura’i in one of his gnostic effusions has embodied the idea— arabic “and meccah’s bride ie the ka’abah is displayed with miraculous signs”  this idea doubtless led to the faceveil the covering and the guardianship of eunuchs  the meccan temple was first dressed as a mark of  p213 honour by tobba the himyarite when he judaizedfn30 if we accept this fact which is vouched for by oriental history we are led to the conclusion that the children of israel settled at meccah had connected the temple with their own faith and as a corollary that the prophet of alislam introduced their apocryphal traditions into his creed the pagan arabs did not remove the coverings the old and torn kiswah was covered with a new cloth and the weight threatened to crush the buildingfn31 from the time of kusay the ka’abah was veiled by subscription till abu rabi’at almughayrah bin abdullah who having acquired great wealth by commerce offered to provide the kiswah on alternate years and thereby gained the name of aladil the prophet preferred a covering of fine yaman cloth and directed the expense to be defrayed by the bayt almal or public treasury omar chose egyptian linen ordering the kiswah to be renewed every year and the old covering to be distributed among the pilgrims in the reign of osman the ka’abah was twice clothed in winter and summer for the former season it received a kamis or tobe shirt of brocade with an izar or veil for the latter a suit of fine linen mu’awiyah at first supplied linen and brocade he afterwards exchanged the former for striped yaman stuff and ordered shaybah bin osman to strip the ka’abah and to perfume the walls with khaluk shaybah divided the old kiswah among the pilgrims and abdullah bin abbas did not object to this distributionfn32 the caliph ma’amun 9th century ordered  p214 the dress to be changed three times a year in his day it was red brocade on the 10th muharram fine linen on the 1st rajab and white brocade on the 1st shawwal at last he was informed that the veil applied on the 10th of muharram was too closely followed by the red brocade in the next month and that it required renewing on the 1st of shawwal this he ordered to be done almutawakkil ninth century when informed that the dress was spoiled by pilgrims at first ordered two to be given and the brocade shirt to be let down as far as the pavement at last he sent a new veil every two months during the caliphat of the abbasides this investiture came to signify sovereignty in alhijaz which passed alternately from baghdad to egypt and alyaman in alidrisi’s time twelfth century ad the kiswah was composed of black silk and renewed every year by the caliph of baghdad ibn jubayr writes that it was green and gold the kiswah remained with egypt when sultan kalaunfn33 thirteenth century ad conveyed the rents of two villages “baysus” and “sindbusfn34” to the expense of providing an outer black and an inner red curtain for the ka’abah with hangings for the prophet’s tomb at almadinah when the holy land fell under the power of osmanli sultan salim ordered the kiswah to be black and his son sultan sulayman the magnificent sixteenth  p215 century ad devoted considerable sums to the purpose the kiswah was afterwards renewed at the accession of each sultan and the wahhabis during the first year of their conquest covered the ka’abah with a red kiswah of the same stuff as the fine arabian aba or cloak and made at alhasa  the kiswah is now worked at a cotton manufactory called alkhurunfish of the tumn bab alsha’ariyah cairo it is made by a hereditary family called the bayt alsadi and as the specimen in my possession proves it is a coarse tissue of silk and cotton mixed the kiswah is composed of eight pieces—two for each face of the ka’abah—the seams being concealed by the hizam a broad band which at a distance looks like gold it is lined with white calico and is supplied with cotton ropes anciently it is said all the koran was interwoven into it now it is inscribed “verily the first of houses founded for mankind to worship in is that at bekkahfn35 blessed and a direction to all creatures” together with seven chapters namely the cave mariam the family of amran repentance th with ys and tabarak the character is that called tumar the largest style of eastern calligraphy legible from a considerable distancefn36 the hizam is a band about two feet broad and surrounding the ka’abah at twothirds of its height it is divided into four pieces which are sewn together on the first and second is inscribed the “throne verslet” and on the third and fourth the titles of the reigning sultan these inscriptions are like the burka or door curtain gold worked into red silk by the bayt alsadi when the kiswah is ready at khurunfish it is carried in  p216 procession to the mosque alhasanayn where it is lined sewn and prepared for the journeyfn37  after quitting the ka’abah i returned home exhausted and washed with henna and warm water to mitigate the pain of the sunscalds upon my arms shoulders and breast the house was empty all the turkish pilgrims being still at muna and the kabirah—the old lady—received me with peculiar attention i was ushered into an upper room whose teak wainscotings covered with cufic and other inscriptions large carpets and ample diwans still showed a sort of ragged splendour the family had “seen better days” the sharif ghalib having confiscated three of its houses but it is still proud and cannot merge the past into the present in the “drawingroom” which the turkish colonel occupied when at meccah the kabirah supplied me with a pipe coffee cold water and breakfast i won her heart by praising the graceless boy mohammed like all mothers she dearly loved the scamp of the family when he entered and saw his maternal parent standing near me with only the end of her veil drawn over her mouth he began to scold her with divers insinuations “soon thou wilt sit amongst the men in the hall” he exclaimed “o my son” rejoined the kabirah “fear allah thy mother is in years”—and truly she was so being at least fifty “aah” sneered the youth who had formed as boys of the world must do or appear to do a very low estimate of the sex the old lady understood the drift of the exclamation and departed with a halflaughing “may allah disappoint thee” she soon however returned bringing me water for ablution and having heard that i had not yet sacrificed a sheep at muna enjoined me to return and perform without delay that important rite  p217after resuming our laical toilette and dressing gaily for the great festival we mounted our asses about the cool of the afternoon and returning to muna we found the tent full of visitors ali ibn ya sin the zemzemi had sent me an amphora of holy water and the carrier was awaiting the customary dollar with him were several meccans one of whom spoke excellent persian we sat down and chatted together for an hour and i afterwards learned from the boy mohammed that all had pronounced me to be an ’ajami  after their departure we debated about the victim which is only a sunnat or practice of the prophetfn38 it is generally sacrificed immediately after the first lapidation and we had already been guilty of delay under these circumstances and considering the meagre condition of my purse i would not buy a sheep but contented myself with watching my neighbours they gave themselves great trouble especially a large party of indians pitched near us to buy the victim cheap but the badawin were not less acute and he was happy who paid less than a dollar and a quarter some preferred contributing to buy a lean ox none but the sharif and the principal dignitaries slaughtered camels the pilgrims dragged their victims to a smooth rock near the akabah above which stands a small open pavilion whose sides red with fresh blood showed that the prince and his attendants had been busy at sacrifice fn39 others stood before their tents and directing the victim’s face towards the ka’abah cut its throat ejaculating “bismillah allaho akbarfn40”  p218 the boy mohammed sneeringly directed my attention to the indians who being a mild race had hired an arab butcher to do the deed of blood and he aroused all shaykh nur’s ire by his taunting comments upon the chickenheartedness of the men of hind it is considered a meritorious act to give away the victim without eating any portion of its flesh parties of takruri might be seen sitting vulturelike contemplating the sheep and goats and no sooner was the signal given than they fell upon the bodies and cut them up without removing them the surface of the valley soon came to resemble the dirtiest slaughterhouse and my prescient soul drew bad auguries for the future  we had spent a sultry afternoon in the basin of muna which is not unlike a volcanic crater an aden closed up at the seaside towards night the occasional puffs of samum ceased and through the air of deadly stillness a mass of purple nimbus bisected by a thin grey line of mistcloud rolled down upon us from the taif hills when darkness gave the signal most of the pilgrims pressed towards the square in front of the muna mosque to enjoy the pyrotechnics and the discharge of cannon but during the spectacle came on a windy storm whose lightnings flashing their fire from pole to pole paled the rockets and whose thunderings reechoed by the rocky hills dumbed the puny artillery of man we were disappointed in our hopes of rain a few huge drops pattered upon the plain and sank into its thirsty entrails all the rest was thunder and lightning dustclouds and whirlwind  fn1 even pitching ground here is charged to pilgrims fn2 some authorities advise that this rite of “ramy” be performed on foot fn3 the word “jamrah” is applied to the place of stoning as well as to the stones fn4 these numbers mark the successive spots where the devil in the shape of an old shaykh appeared to adam abraham and ishmael and was driven back by the simple process taught by gabriel of throwing stones about the size of a bean fn5 i borrow this phrase from ali bey who however speaks more like an ignorant catalonian than a learned abbaside when he calls the pillar “la maison du diable” and facetiously asserts that “le diable a eu la malice de placer sa maison dans un lieu fort etroit qui n’a peutetre pas 34 pieds de large” fn6 some hold the pebble as a schoolboy does a marble others between the thumb and forefinger extended others shoot them from the thumb knuckle and most men consult their own convenience fn7 the barber removed all my hair hanifis shave at least a quarter of the head shafe’is a few hairs on the right side the prayer is as usual differently worded some saying “o allah this my forelock is in thy hand then grant me for every hair a light on resurrectionday by thy mercy o most merciful of the merciful” i remarked that the hair was allowed to lie upon the ground whereas strict moslems with that reverence for man’s body—the temple of the supreme—which characterizes their creed carefully bury it in the earth fn8 this word is confounded with “dafa” by many moslem authors some speak of the nafr from arafat to muzdalifah and the dafa from muzdalifah to muna i have used the words as my mutawwif used them fn9 they keep the keys of the house in my day the head of the family was “shaykh ahmad” fn10 in ibn jubayr’s time this large padlock was of gold it is said popularly that none but the benu shaybah can open it a minor miracle doubtless proceeding from the art of some eastern hobbs or bramah fn11 however safe a christian might be at meccah nothing could preserve him from the ready knives of enraged fanatics if detected in the house the very idea is pollution to a moslem fn12 i do not known the origin of this superstition but it would be unsafe for a pilgrim to look fixedly at the ka’abah ceiling under the arras i was told is a strong planking of saj or indian teak and above it a stuccoed sath or flat roof fn13 exactly realising the description of our english bard— “goodly arras of great majesty woven with gold and silk so close and nere that the rich metal lurked privily as feigning to be hid from envious eye” fn14 ibn jubayr mentions three columns of teak burckhardt and ali bey two in alfasi’s day there were four the kuraysh erected six columns in double row generally the pillars have been three in number fn15 this wood which has been used of old to ornament sacred buildings in the east is brought to meccah in great quantities by malay and java pilgrims the best kind is known by its oily appearance and a “fizzing” sound in fire the cunning vendors easily supply it with these desiderata fn16 ibn jubayr calls it bab alrahmah fn17 the hajar alaswad is also called alas’ad or the propitious fn18 here in ibn jubayr’s time stood two boxes full of korans fn19 the key is sometimes placed in the hands of a child of the house of shaybah who sits in state with black slaves on both sides fn20 in ibn jubayr’s day the ka’abah was opened with more ceremony the ladder was rolled up to the door and the chief of the benu shaybah ascending it was covered by attendants with a black veil from head to foot whilst he opened the padlock then having kissed the threshold he entered shut the door behind him and prayed two rukats after which all the benu shaybah and lastly the vulgar were admitted in these day the veil is obsolete the shaykh enters the ka’abah alone perfumes it and prays the pilgrims are then admitted en masse and the style in which the eunuchs handle their quarterstaves forms a scene more animated than decorous fn21 some pray four instead of two bows fn22 burckhardt erroneously says “in every corner” fn23 these indians are ever in extremes paupers or millionaires and like all moslems the more they pay at meccah the higher becomes their character and religious titles a turkish pasha seldom squanders as much money as does a moslem merchant from the far east khudabakhsh the lahore shawldealer owned to having spent 800l in feastings and presents he appeared to consider that sum a trifle although had a debtor carried off one tithe of it his health would have been seriously affected fn24 the cover of the key is made like abraham’s veil of three colours red black or green it is of silk embroidered with golden letters and upon it are written the bismillah the name of the reigning sultan “bag of the key of the holy ka’abah” and a verselet from the “family of amran” koran ch 3 it is made like the kiswah at khurunfish a place that will be noticed below fn25 “ecorches”—“pelati” the idea is common to most imaginative nations fn26 the same is the case at almadinah many religious men object on conscientious grounds to enter the prophet’s mosque the poet quoted below made many visitations to almadinah but never could persuade himself to approach the tomb the esquire carver saw two young turks who had voluntarily had their eyes thrust out at meccah as soon as they had seen the glory and visible sanctity of the tomb of mohammed i “doubt the fact” which thus appears ushered in by a fiction fn27 i have not thought it necessary to go deep into the list of “muharramat” or actions forbidden to the pilgrim who has entered the ka’abah they are numerous and meaningless fn28 the use of the feminine pronoun is explained below when unclothed the ka’abah is called uryanah naked in opposition to its normal state “muhramah” or clad in ihram in burckhardt’s time the house remained naked for fifteen days now the investiture is effected in a few hours fn29 the goldembroidered curtain covering the ka’abah door is called by the learned “burka alka’abah” the ka’abah’s faceveil by the vulgar burka fatimah they connect it in idea with the prophet’s daughter fn30 the pyramids it is said were covered from base to summit with yellow silk or satin fn31 at present the kiswah it need scarcely be said does not cover the flat roof fn32 ayishah also when shaybah proposed to bury the old kiswah that it might not be worn by the impure directed him to sell it and to distribute the proceeds to the poor the meccans still follow the first half but neglect the other part of the order given by the “mother of the moslems” kazi khan advises the proceeds of the sale being devoted to the repairs of the temple the “siraj alwahhaj” positively forbids as sinful the cutting transporting selling buying and placing it between the leaves of the koran kutb aldin from whom i borrow these particulars introduces some fine and casuistic distinctions in his day however the benu shaybah claimed the old after the arrival of the new kiswah and their right to it was admitted to the present day they continue to sell it fn33 some authors also mention a green kiswah applied by this monarch embroidered on it were certain verselets of the koran the formula of the moslem faith and the names of the prophet’s companions fn34 burckhardt says “bysous” and “sandabeir” fn35 from the “family of amran” chap 3 “bekkah” is “a place of crowding” hence applied to meccah generally some writers however limit it to the part of the city round the harim fn36 it is larger than the suls admirers of eastern calligraphy may see a “bismillah” beautifully written in tumar on the wall of sultan mu’ayyad’s mosque at cairo fn37 mr lane mod egypt vol iii chap 25 has given an ample and accurate description of the kiswah i have added a few details derived from “khalil effendi” of cairo a professor of arabic and an excellent french scholar fn38 those who omit the rite fast ten days three during the pilgrimage season and the remaining seven at some other time fn39 the camel is sacrificed by thrusting a pointed instrument into the interval between the sternum and the neck this anomaly may be accounted for by the thickness and hardness of the muscles of the throat fn40 it is strange that the accurate burckhardt should make the moslem say when slaughtering or sacrificing “in the name of the most merciful god” as mr lane justly observes the attribute of mercy is omitted on these occasions  p219 chapter xxxi  the three days of drying flesh  all was dull after the excitement of the great festival the heat of the succeeding night rendered every effort to sleep abortive and as our little camp required a guard in a place so celebrated for plunderers i spent the greater part of the time sitting in the clear pure moonlightfn1  after midnight we again repaired to the devils and beginning with the ula or first pillar at the eastern extremity of muna threw at each seven stones making a total of twentyone with the ceremonies before described  on thursday sept 15th 1853 we arose before dawn and prepared with a light breakfast for the fatigues of a climbing walk after half an hour spent in hopping from boulder to boulder we arrived at a place situated on the lower declivity of the jabal sabir the northern wall of the muna basin here is the majarr alkabsh “the draggingplace of the ram” a small whitewashed square divided  p220 into two compartments the first is entered by a few ragged steps in the southeast angle which lead to an enclosure thirty feet by fifteen in the northeast corner is a block of granite a in which a huge gash several inches broad some feet deep and completely splitting the stone in knifeshape notes the spot where ibrahim’s blade fell when the archangel gabriel forbade him to slay ismail his son the second compartment contains a diminutive hypogaeum b in this cave the patriarch sacrificed the victim which gives the place a name we descended by a flight of steps and under the stifling ledge of rock found mats and prayingrugs which at this early hour were not overcrowded we followed the example of the patriarchs and prayed a twobow prayer in each of the enclosures after distributing the usual gratification we left the place and proceeded to mount the hill in hope of seeing some of the apes said still to haunt the heights these animals are supposed by the meccans to have been jews thus transformed for having broken the sabbath by huntingfn2 they abound in the elevated regions about arafat and taif where they are caught by mixing the juice of the asclepias and narcotics with dates and other sweet baitfn3 the hijazi ape is a hideous cynocephalus with small eyes placed close together and almost hidden by a disproportionate snout a greenishbrown coat long arms and a stern of lively pink like fresh meat they  p221 are docile and are said to be fond of spirituous liquors and to display an inordinate affection for women almas’udi tells about them a variety of anecdotes according to him their principal use in hind and chin was to protect kings from poison by eating suspected dishes the badawin have many tales concerning them it is universally believed that they catch and kill kites by exposing the rosy portion of their persons and concealing the rest the bird pounces upon what appears to be raw meat and presently finds himself viciously plucked alive throughout arabia an old story is told of them a merchant was once plundered during his absence by a troop of these apes they tore open his bales and charmed with the scarlet hue of the tarbushes began applying those articles of dress to uses quite opposite to their normal purpose the merchant was in despair when his slave offered for a consideration to recover the goods placing himself in the front like a fugleman to the apecompany he went through a variety of manœuvres with a tarbush and concluded with throwing it far away the recruits carefully imitated him and the drill concluded with his firing a shot the plunderers decamped and the caps were recovered  failing to see any apes we retired to the tent ere the sun waxed hot in anticipation of a terrible day nor were we far wrong in addition to the heat we had swarms of flies and the bloodstained earth began to reek with noisome vapours nought moved in the air except kites and vultures speckling the deep blue sky the denizens of earth seemed paralysed by the fire from above i spent the time between breakfast and nightfall lying halfdressed upon a mat moving round the tentpole to escape the glare and watching my numerous neighbours male and female the indians were particularly kind filling my pipe offering cooled water and performing similar little offices i repaid them with a supply of provisions  p222 which at the muna marketprices these unfortunates could ill afford  when the moon arose the boy mohammed and i walked out into the town performed our second lapidationfn4 and visited the coffeehouses the shops were closed early but business was transacted in places of public resort till midnight we entered the houses of numerous acquaintances who accosted my companion and were hospitably welcomed with pipes and coffee the first question always was “who is this pilgrim” and more than once the reply “an afghan” elicited the language of my own country which i could no longer speak of this phenomenon however nothing was thought many afghans settled in india know not a word of pushtu and even above the passes many of the townspeople are imperfectly  p223 acquainted with it the meccans in consequence of their extensive intercourse with strangers and habits of travelling are admirable conversational linguists they speak arabic remarkably well and with a volubility surpassing the most lively of our continental nations persian turkish and hindustani are generally known and the mutawwifs who devote themselves to various races of pilgrims soon become masters of many languages  returning homewards we were called to a spot by the clapping of handsfn5 and the loud sound of song we found a crowd of badawin surrounding a group engaged in their favourite occupation of dancing the performance is wild in the extreme resembling rather the hopping of bears than the inspirations of terpischore the bystanders joined in the song an interminable recitative as usual in the minor key and—orientals are admirable timists—it sounded like one voice the refrain appeared to be— “la yayha la yayha” to which no one could assign a meaning at other times they sang something intelligible for instance— arabic that is to say—  “on the great festivalday at muna i saw my lord i am a stranger amongst you therefore pity me”  this couplet may have like the puerilities of certain modern and european poets an abstruse and mystical  p224 meaning to be discovered when the arabs learn to write erudite essays upon nursery rhymes the style of saltation called rufayah rivalled the song the dancers raised both arms above their heads brandishing a dagger pistol or some other small weapon they followed each other by hops on one or both feet sometimes indulging in the most demented leaps whilst the bystanders clapped with their palms a more enlivening measure this i was told is especially their wardance they have other forms which my eyes were not fated to see amongst the badawin of alhijaz unlike the somali and other african races the sexes never mingle the girls may dance together but it would be disgraceful to perform in the company of men  after so much excitement we retired to rest and slept soundly  on friday the 12th zu’l hijjah the camels appeared according to order at early dawn and they were loaded with little delay we were anxious to enter meccah in time for the sermon and i for one was eager to escape the now pestilential air of muna  literally the land stank five or six thousand animals had been slain and cut up in this devil’s punchbowl i leave the reader to imagine the rest the evil might be avoided by building abattoirs or more easily still by digging long trenches and by ordering all pilgrims under pain of mulct to sacrifice in the same place unhappily the spirit of alislam is opposed to these precautions of common sense—“inshallah” and “kismat” must take the place of prevention and of cure and at meccah the headquarters of the faith a desolating attack of cholera is preferred to the impiety of “flying in the face of providence” and the folly of endeavouring to avert inevitable decreesfn6  p225 mounting our camels and led by mas’ud we entered muna by the eastern end and from the litter threw the remaining twentyone stones i could now see the principal lines of shops and having been led to expect a grand display of merchandise was surprised to find only matbooths and sheds stocked chiefly with provisions the exit from muna was crowded for many like ourselves were flying from the revolting scene i could not think without pity of those whom religious scruples detained another day and a half in this foul spot  after entering meccah we bathed and when the noon drew nigh we repaired to the harim for the purpose of hearing the sermon descending to the cloisters below the bab alziyadah i stood wonderstruck by the scene before me the vast quadrangle was crowded with worshippers sitting in long rows and everywhere facing the central black tower the showy colours of their dresses were not to be surpassed by a garden of the most brilliant flowers and such diversity of detail would probably not be seen massed together in any other building upon earth the women a dull and sombrelooking group sat apart in their peculiar place the pasha stood on the roof of zemzem surrounded by guards in nizam uniform where the principal olema stationed themselves the crowd was thicker and in the more auspicious spots nought was to be seen but a pavement of heads and shoulders nothing seemed to move but a few darwayshes who censer in hand sidled through the rows and received the unsolicited alms of the faithful apparently in the midst and raised above the crowd by the tall pointed pulpit whose gilt spire flamed in the sun sat the preacher an old man with snowy beard the style of headdress  p226 called taylasanfn7 covered his turband which was white as his robesfn8 and a short staff supported his left handfn9 presently he arose took the staff in his right hand pronounced a few inaudible wordsfn10 and sat down again on one of the lower steps whilst a mu’ezzin at the foot of the pulpit recited the call to sermon then the old man stood up and began to preach as the majestic figure began to exert itself there was a deep silence presently a general “amin” was intoned by the crowd at the conclusion of some long sentence and at last towards the end of the sermon every third or fourth word was followed by the simultaneous rise and fall of thousands of voices  i have seen the religious ceremonies of many lands but never—nowhere—aught so solemn so impressive as this  fn1 it is not safe to perform this ceremony at an early hour although the ritual forbids it being deferred after sunset a crowd of women however assembled at the devils in the earlier part of the 11th night our 10th and these dames despite the oriental modesty of faceveils attack a stranger with hands and stones as heartily as english hopgatherers hasten to duck the acteon who falls in their way hence popular usage allows stones to be thrown by men until the morning prayers of the 11th zu’l hijjah fn2 traditions about these animals vary in the different parts of arabia at aden for instance they are supposed to be a remnant of the rebellious tribe of ’ad it is curious that the popular arabic like the persian names sa’adan maymun shadi c c are all expressive of a probably euphuistic “propitiousness” fn3 the egyptians generally catch train and take them to the banks of the nile where the “kurayeati” apeleader is a popular character fn4 this ceremony as the reader will have perceived is performed by the shafe’is on the 10th the 11th and the 12th of zu’l hijjah the hanafis conclude their stoning on the 13th the times vary with each day and differ considerably in religious efficacy on the night of the 10th our 9th for instance lapidation according to some authorities cannot take place others permit it with a sufficient reason between the dawn and sunrise it is makruh or disapproved of between sunrise and the declination is the sunnattime and therefore the best from noon to sunset it is mubah or permissible the same is the case with the night if a cause exist on the 11th and 12th of zu’l hijjah lapidation is disapproved of from sunset to sunrise the sunnat is from noon to sunset and it is permissible at all other hours the number of stones thrown by the shafe’is is 49 viz 7 on the 10th day 7 at each pillar total 21 on the 11th day and the same on the 12th zu’l hijjah the hanafis also throw 21 stones on the 13th which raises their number to 70 the first 7 bits of granite must be collected at muzdalifah the rest may be taken from the muna valley and all must be washed 7 times before being thrown in throwing the hanafis attempt to approach the pillar if possible standing within reach of it shafe’is may stand at a greater distance which should not however pass the limits of 5 cubits fn5 here called safk it is mentioned by herodotus and known to almost every oriental people the badawin sometimes though rarely use a table or kettledrum yet amongst the “pardah” or miuscal modes of the east we find the hijazi ranking with the isfahani and the iraki southern arabia has never been celebrated for producing musicians like the banks of the tigris to which we owe besides castanets and cymbals the guitar the drum and the lute father of the modern harp the name of this instrument is a corruption of the arabic “al’ud” arabic text through liuto and luth into lute fn6 note to third edition—since this was written there have been two deadly epidemics which began it is reported at muna the victims however have never numbered 700000 nor is “each pilgrim required to sacrifice one animal at the shrine of mohammed” as we find it in “cholera prospects” by tilbury fox md hardwicke fn7 a scarf thrown over the head with one end brought round under the chin and passed over the left shoulder composes the “taylasan” fn8 as late as ibn jubayr’s time the preacher was habited from head to foot in black and two mu’ezzins held black flags fixed in rings on both sides of the pulpit with the staves propped upon the first step fn9 mr lane remarks that the wooden sword is never held by the preacher but in a country that has been won from infidels by moslems burckhardt more correctly traces the origin of the custom to the early days of alislam when the preachers found it necessary to be prepared for surprises and all authors who like ibn jubayr described the meccan ceremonies mention the sword or staff the curious reader will consult this most accurate of moslem travellers and a perusal of the pages will show that anciently the sermon differed considerably from and was far more ceremonious than the present khutbah fn10 the words were “peace be upon ye and the mercy of allah and his blessings”  p227 chapter xxxii  life at meccah and umrah or the little pilgrimage  my few remaining days at meccah sped pleasantly enough omar effendi visited me regularly and arranged to accompany me furtively to cairo i had already consulted mohammed shiklibha—who suddenly appeared at muna having dropped down from suez to jeddah and having reached meccah in time for pilgrimage—about the possibility of proceeding eastward the honest fellow’s eyebrows rose till they almost touched his turband and he exclaimed in a roaring voice “wallah effendi thou art surely mad” every day he brought me news of the different caravans the badawin of alhijaz were he said in a ferment caused by the reports of the holy war want of money and rumours of quarrels between the sharif and the pasha already they spoke of an attack upon jeddah shaykh mas’ud the camel man from whom i parted on the best of terms seriously advised my remaining at meccah for some months even before proceeding to sana’a others gave the same counsel briefly i saw that my star was not then in the ascendant and resolved to reserve myself for a more propitious conjuncture by returning to egypt  the turkish colonel and i had become as friendly as two men ignoring each other’s speech could be he had derived benefit from some prescription but like all his countrymen he was pining to leave meccahfn1 whilst the  p228 pilgrimage lasted said they no mal de pays came to trouble them but its excitement over they could think of nothing but their wives and children longdrawn faces and continual sighs evidenced nostalgia at last the house became a scene of preparation blue chinaware and basketed bottles of zemzem water appeared standing in solid columns and pilgrims occupied themselves in hunting for mementoes of meccah groundplans combs balm henna toothsticks aloeswood turquoises coral and mothero’pearl rosaries shreds of kiswahcloth and fine abas or cloaks of camels’wool it was not safe to mount the stairs without shouting “tarik” out of the way at every step on peril of meeting face to face some excited fairfn2 the lower floor was crowded with provisionvendors and the staple article of conversation seemed to be the chance of a steamer from jeddah to suez  weary of the wrangling and chaffering of the hall below i had persuaded my kind hostess in spite of the surly skeleton her brother partially to clear out a small storeroom in the first floor and to abandon it to me between the hours of ten and four during the heat of the day clothing is unendurable at meccah the city is so “compacted together” by hills that even the samum can scarcely sweep it the heat reverberated by the bare rocks is intense and the normal atmosphere of an eastern town communicates a faint lassitude to the body and irritability to the mind the houses being unusually strong and wellbuilt might by some art of thermantidote be rendered cool enough in the hottest weather  p229 they are now ovensfn3 it was my habit to retire immediately after the late breakfast to the little room upstairs to sprinkle it with water and to lie down on a mat in the few precious moments of privacy notes were committed to paper but one eye was ever fixed on the door sometimes a patient would interrupt me but a doctor is far less popular in alhijaz than in egypt the people being more healthy have less faith in physic shaykh mas’ud and his son had never tasted in their lives aught more medicinal than green dates and camel’s milk occasionally the black slavegirls came into the room asking if the pilgrim wanted a pipe or a cup of coffee they generally retired in a state of delight attempting vainly to conceal with a corner of tattered veil a grand display of ivory consequent upon some small and innocent facetiousness the most frequent of my visitors was abdullah the kabirah’s eldest son this melancholy jacques had joined our caravan at alhamra on the  p230 yambu’ road accompanied us to almadinah lived there and journeyed to meccah with the syrian pilgrimage yet he had not once come to visit me or to see his brother the boy mohammed when gently reproached for this omission he declared it to be his way—that he never called upon strangers until sent for he was a perfect saudawi melancholist in mind manners and personal appearance and this class of humanity in the east is almost as uncomfortable to the household as the idiot of europe i was frequently obliged to share my meals with him as his mother—though most filially and reverentially entreated—would not supply him with breakfast two hours after the proper time or with a dinner served up forty minutes before the rest of the household often too i had to curb by polite deprecation the impetuosity of the fiery old kabirah’s tongue thus abdullah and i became friends after a fashion he purchased several little articles required and never failed to pass hours in my closet giving me much information about the country deploring the laxity of meccan morals and lamenting that in these evil days his countrymen had forfeited their name at cairo and at constantinople his curiosity about the english in india was great and i satisfied it by praising as a moslem would their politike their evenhanded justice and their good star then he would inquire into the truth of a fable extensively known on the shores of the mediterranean and of the red sea the english it is said sent a mission to mohammed inquiring into his doctrines and begging that the heroic khalid bin walidfn4 might be sent to proselytise them unfortunately  p231 the envoys arrived too late—the prophet’s soul had winged its way to paradise an abstract of the moslem scheme was however sent to the “ingreez” who declined as the founder of the new faith was no more to abandon their own religion but the refusal was accompanied with expressions of regard for this reason many moslems in barbary and other countries hold the english to be of all “people of the books” the best inclined towards them as regards the prophet’s tradition concerning the fall of his birthplace “and the thincalved from the habash abyssinians shall destroy the ka’abah” i was informed that towards the end of time a host will pass from africa in such multitudes that a stone shall be conveyed from hand to hand between jeddah and meccah this latter condition might easily be accomplished by sixty thousand men the distance being only fortyfour miles but the citizens consider it to express a countless horde some pious moslems have hoped that in abdullah bin zubayr’s reerection of the ka’abah the prophecy was fulfilledfn5 the popular belief however remains that the fatal event is still in the womb of time in a previous part of this volume i have alluded to similar evil presentiments which haunt the mind of alislam and the christian zealous for the propagation of his faith may see in them an earnest of its still wider diffusion in future ages fn6  late in the afternoon i used to rise perform ablution and repair to the harim or wander about the bazars till sunset after this it was necessary to return home and prepare for supper—dinner it would be called in the west  p232 the meal concluded i used to sit for a time outside the streetdoor in great dignity upon a brokenbacked blackwood chair traditionally said to have been left in the house by one of the princes of delhi smoking a shishah and drinking sundry cups of strong green tea with a slice of lime a fair substitute for milk at this hour the seat was as in a theatre but the words of the actors were of a nature somewhat too fescennine for a respectable public after nightfall we either returned to the harim or retired to rest our common dormitory was the flat roof of the house under each cot stood a watergugglet and all slept as must be done in the torrid lands on and not in bed  i sojourned at meccah but a short time and as usual with travellers did not see the best specimens of the population the citizens appeared to me more civilised and more vicious than those of almadinah they often leave  “home where small experience grows”  and—qui multum peregrinatur raro sanctificatur—become a worldlywise godforgetting and mammonish sort of folk tuf w’ asaa w’ aamil alsaba—“circumambulate and run ie between safa and marwah and commit the seven deadly sins”—is a satire popularly levelled against them hence too the proverb alharam f’ il haramayn—“evil dwelleth in the two holy cities” and no wonder since plenary indulgence is so easily securedfn7 the pilgrim is forbidden or rather dissuaded from abiding at meccah after the rites and wisely great emotions must be followed by a reaction and he who stands struck by the first aspect of allah’s house after a few months the marvel waxing stale sweeps past with indifference or something worse  p233 there is however little at meccah to offend the eye as among certain nations further west a layer of ashes overspreads the fire the mine is concealed by a green turf fair to look upon it is only when wandering by starlight through the northern outskirts of the town that citizens may be seen with light complexions and delicate limbs coarse turbands and egyptian woollen robes speaking disguise and the purpose of disguise no one within the memory of man has suffered the penalty of immorality spirituous liquors are no longer sold as in burckhardt’s dayfn8 in shops and some arnaut officers assured me that they found considerable difficulty in smuggling flasks of araki from jeddah  the meccan is a darker man than the madinite the people explain this by the heat of the climate i rather believe it to be caused by the number of female slaves that find their way into the market gallas sawahilis a few somalis and abyssinians are embarked at suakin zayla tajurrah and berberah carried in thousands to jeddah and the holy city has the pick of every batch thence the stream sets northwards a small current towards almadinah and the main line to egypt and turkeyfn9  most meccans have black concubines and as has been said the appearance of the sharif is almost that of a negro i did not see one handsome man in the holy city although some of the women appeared to me beautiful the male profile is high and bony the forehead recedes and the head rises unpleasantly towards the region of firmness in most families male children when forty days old are taken to the ka’abah prayed over and carried home where the barber draws with a razor three parallel gashes  p234 down the fleshy portion of each cheek from the exterior angles of the eyes almost to the corners of the mouth these mashali as they are calledfn10 may be of modern date the citizens declare that the custom was unknown to their ancestors i am tempted to assign to it a high antiquity and cannot but attribute a pagan origin to a custom still prevailing despite all the interdictions of the olema in point of figure the meccan is somewhat coarse and lymphatic the ludicrous leanness of the outward man as described by ali bey survives only in the remnants of themselves belonging to a bygone century the young men are rather stout and athletic but in middle age—when man “swills and swells”—they are apt to degenerate into corpulence  the meccan is a covetous spendthrift his wealth lightly won is lightly prized pay pension stipends presents and the ikram here as at almadinah supply the citizen with the means of idleness with him everything is on the most expensive scale his marriage his religious ceremonies and his household expenses his  p235 house is luxuriously furnished entertainments are frequent and the junketings of his women make up a heavy bill at the end of the year it is a common practice for the citizen to anticipate the pilgrimage season by falling into the hands of the usurer if he be in luck he catches and “skins” one or more of the richest hajis on the other hand should fortune fail him he will feel for life the effect of interest running on at the rate of at least fifty per cent the simple and the compound forms of which are equally familiar to the wily sarraffn11  the most unpleasant peculiarities of the meccansfn12 are their pride and coarseness of language looking upon themselves as the cream of earth’s sons they resent with extreme asperity the least slighting word concerning the holy city and its denizens they plume themselves upon their holy descent their exclusion of infidelsfn13 their strict fastings their learned men and their purity of languagefn14 in fact their pride shows itself at every moment  p236 but it is not the pride which makes a man too proud to do “dirty work” my predecessor did not remark their scurrility he seems on the contrary rather to commend them for respectability in this point if he be correct the present generation has degenerated the meccans appeared to me distinguished even in this foulmouthed east by the superior licentiousness of their language abuse was bad enough in the streets but in the house it became intolerable the turkish pilgrims remarked but they were too proud to notice it the boy mohammed and one of his tall cousins at last transgressed the limits of my endurance they had been reviling each other vilely one day at the housedoor about dawn when i administered the most open reprimand “in my country afghanistan we hold this to be the hour of prayer the season of good thoughts when men remember allah even the kafir doth not begin the day with curses and abuse” the people around approved and the offenders could not refrain from saying “thou hast spoken truth o effendi” then the bystanders began as usual to “improve the occasion” “see” they exclaimed “this sulaymani gentleman he is not the son of a holy city and yet he teacheth you—ye the children of the prophet—repent and fear allah” they replied “verily we do repent and allah is a pardoner and the merciful”—were silent for an hour and then abused each other more foully than before yet it is a good point in the meccan character that it is open to reason it can confess itself  p237 in error and it displays none of that doggedness of vice which distinguishes the sinner of a more stolid race like the people of southern europe the semite is easily managed by a jest though grave and thoughtful he is by no means deficient in the sly wit which we call humour and the solemn gravity of his words contrasts amusingly with his ideas he particularly excels in the cervantic art the spirit of which says sterne is to clothe low subjects in sublime language in mohammed’s life we find that he by no means disdained a joke sometimes a little hasarde as in the case of the paradisecoveting old woman the redeeming qualities of the meccan are his courage his bonhommie his manly suavity of manners his fiery sense of honour his strong family affections his near approach to what we call patriotism and his general knowledge the reproach of extreme ignorance which burckhardt directs against the holy city has long ago sped to the limbo of things that were the dark half of the picture is formed by pride bigotry irreligion greed of gain immorality and prodigal ostentation of the pilgrimage ceremonies i cannot speak harshly it may be true that “the rites of the ka’abah emasculated of every idolatrous tendency still hang a strange unmeaning shroud around the living theism of islam” but what nation either in the west or in the east has been able to cast out from its ceremonies every suspicion of its old idolatry what are the english mistletoe the irish wake the pardon of brittany the carnival and the worship at iserna better far to consider the meccan pilgrimage rites in the light of evilworship turned into lessons of good than to philosophize about their strangeness and to blunder in asserting them to be insignificant even the badawi circumambulating the ka’abah fortifies his wild belief by the fond thought that he treads the path of “allah’s friend”  at arafat the good moslem worships in imitation of  p238 the “pure of allahfn15” and when hurling stones and curses at three senseless little buttresses which commemorate the appearance of the fiend the materialism of the action gives to its sentiment all the strength and endurance of reality the supernatural agencies of pilgrimage are carefully and sparingly distributed the angels who restore the stones from muna to muzdalifah the heavenly host whose pinions cause the ka’abah’s veil to rise and to wave and the mysterious complement of the pilgrim’s total at the arafat sermon all belong to the category of spiritual creatures walking earth unseen—a poetical tenet not condemned by christianity the meccans are it is true to be reproached with their open mammonworship at times and at places the most sacred and venerable but this has no other effect upon the pilgrims than to excite disgust and open reprehension here however we see no such silly frauds as heavenly fire drawn from a phosphormatch nor do two rival churches fight in the flesh with teeth and nails requiring the contemptuous interference of an infidel power to keep around order here we see no fair dames staring with their glasses braques at the head of the church or supporting exhausted nature with the furtive sandwich or carrying pampered curs who too often will not be silent or scrambling and squeezing to hear theatrical music reckless of the fate of the old lady who—on such occasions there is always one—has been “thrown down and cruelly trampled upon by the crowd” if the meccan citizens are disposed to scoff at the wild takruri they do it not so publicly or shamelessly as the roman jeering with ribald jest at the fanaticism of strangers from the bogs of ireland finally at meccah there is nothing theatrical nothing that suggests the opera but all is simple and impressive filling the mind with  “a weight of awe not easy to be borne”  and tending i believe after its fashion to good  p239 as regards the meccan and moslem belief that abraham and his son built the ka’abah it may be observed the genesitic account of the great patriarch has suggested to learned men the idea of two abrahams one the son of terah another the son of azar fire a prometheus who imported civilisation and knowledge into arabia from harran the sacred centre of sabaean learningfn16 moslem historians all agree in representing abraham as a starworshipper in youth and eusebius calls the patriarch son of athar his father’s name therefore is no arab invention whether ishmael or his sire ever visited meccah to build the ka’abah is in my humble opinion an open question the jewish scripture informs us only that the patriarch dwelt at beersheba and gerar in the southwest of palestine without any allusion to the annual visit which moslems declare he paid to their holy city at the same time arab tradition speaks clearly and consistently upon the subject and generally omits those miraculous and superstitious adjuncts which cast shadows of sore doubt upon the philosophic mind  the amount of risk which a stranger must encounter at the pilgrimage rites is still considerable a learned orientalist and divine intimated his intention in a work  p240 published but a few years ago of visiting meccah without disguise he was assured that the turkish governor would now offer no obstacle to a european traveller i would strongly dissuade a friend from making the attempt it is true that the frank is no longer as in captain head’s dayfn17 insulted when he ventures out of the meccan gate of jeddah and that our viceconsuls and travellers are allowed on condition that their glance do not pollute the shrine to visit taif and the regions lying eastward of the holy city neither the pasha nor the sharif would in these days dare to enforce in the case of an englishman the old law a choice thrice offered between circumcision and death but the first badawi who caught sight of the frank’s hat would not deem himself a man if he did not drive a bullet through the wearer’s head at the pilgrimage season disguise is easy on account of the vast and varied multitudes which visit meccah exposing the traveller only to “stand the buffet with knaves who smell of sweat” but woe to the unfortunate who happens to be recognised in public as an infidel—unless at least he could throw himself at once upon the protection of the governmentfn18 amidst however a crowd of pilgrims whose fanaticism is worked up to the highest pitch detection would probably ensure his dismissal at once al numero de’ piu those who find danger the salt of pleasure may visit meccah but if asked whether the results justify the risk i should reply in the negative and the viceconsul at jeddah would only do his duty in peremptorily forbidding european travellers to attempt meccah without disguise until the day comes when such steps can be taken in the certainty of not causing a mishap  p241 an accident would not redound to our reputation as we could not in justice revenge itfn19  on the 14th zu’l hijjah we started to perform the rite of umrah or little pilgrimage after performing ablution and resuming the ihram with the usual ceremonies i set out accompanied by the boy mohammed and his brother abdullah mounting asses which resembled mules in size and speedfn20 we rode to the harim and prayed there again remounting we issued through the bab alsafa towards the open country northeast of the city the way was crowded with pilgrims on foot as well as mounted and their loud labbayk distinguished those engaged in the umrah rite from the many whose business was with the camp of the damascus caravan at about half a mile from the city we passed on the left a huge heap of stones where my companions stood and cursed this grimlooking cairn is popularly believed to note the place of the well where abu lahab laid an ambuscade for the prophet this wicked uncle stationed there a slave with orders to throw headlong into the pit the first person who  p242 approached him and privily persuaded his nephew to visit the spot at night after a time anxiously hoping to hear that the deed had been done abu lahab incautiously drew nigh and was precipitated by his own bravo into the place of destructionfn21 hence the wellknown saying in islam “whoso diggeth a well for his brother shall fall into it himself” we added our quota of stonesfn22 and proceeding saw the jeddah road spanning the plain like a white ribbon in front of us the highway was now lined with coffeetents before which effeminate dancingboys performed to admiring syrians a small whitewashed “bungalow” the palace of the emir alhajj lay on the left and all around it clustered the motley encampment of his pilgrims after cantering about three miles from the city we reached the alamayn or two pillars that limit the sanctuary and a little beyond it is the small settlement popularly called alumrahfn23 dismounting here we  p243 sat down on rugs outside a coffeetent to enjoy the beauty of the moonlit night and an hour of kayf in the sweet air of the desert  presently the coffeetent keeper after receiving payment brought us water for ablution this preamble over we entered the principal chapel an unpretending building badly lighted spread with dirty rugs full of pilgrims and offensively close here we prayed the isha or night devotions and then a twobow prayer in honour of the ihramfn24 after which we distributed gratuities to the guardians and alms to the importunate beggars and now i perceived the object of abdullah’s companionship the melancholy man assured me that he had ridden out for love of me and in order to perform as wakil substitute a vicarious pilgrimage for my parents vainly i assured him that they had been strict in the exercises of their faith he would take no denial and i perceived that love of me meant love of my dollars with a surly assent he was at last permitted to act for the “pious pilgrim yusuf joseph bin ahmad and fatimah bint yunus”—my progenitors it was impossible to prevent smiling at contrasts as abdullah gravely raising his hands and directing his face to the ka’abah intoned “i do vow this ihram of umrah in the name of yusuf son of ahmad and fatimah daughter of yunus then render it attainable unto them and accept it of them bismillah allaho akbar”  p244 remounting we galloped towards meccah shouting labbayk and halting at every halfmile to smoke and drink coffee in a short time we entered the city and repairing to the harim by the safa gate performed the tawaf or circumambulation of umrah after this dull round and necessary repose we left the temple by the same exit and mounting once more turned towards alsafa which stands about a hundred yards southeast of the mosque and as little deserves its name of “mountain” as do those that undulate the face of modern rome the safa end is closed by a meanlooking building composed of three round arches with a dwarf flight of stairs leading up to them out of a narrow road without dismounting we wheeled our donkeysfn25 round “left shoulders forward” no easy task in the crowd and vainly striving to sight the ka’abah through the bab alsafa performed the niyat or vow of the rite alsai or the runningfn26 after tahlil takbir and talbiyat we raised our hands in the supplicatory position and twice repeatedfn27 “there is no god but allah alone without partner his is the kingdom unto him be praise he giveth life and death he is alive and perisheth not in his hand is good and he over all things is omnipotent” then with the donkeyboys leading our animals and a stout fellow preceding us with lantern and a quarterstaff to keep off the running badawin camelmen and riders of asses we descended safa and walked slowly down the street almassa towards marwahfn28  p245 during our descent we recited aloud “o allah cause me to act according to the sunnat of thy prophet and to die in his faith and defend me from errors and disobedience by thy mercy o most merciful of the merciful” arrived at what is called the batn alwady belly of the vale a place now denoted by the milayn alakhzarayn the two green pillarsfn29 one fixed in the eastern course of the harim the other in a house on the right sidefn30 we began the running by urging on our beasts here the prayer was “o lord pardon and pity and pass over what thou knowest for thou art the most dear and the most generous save us from hellfire safely and cause us safely to enter paradise o lord give us happiness here and happiness hereafter and spare us the torture of the flames” at the end of this supplication we had passed the batn or lowest ground whose farthest limits were marked by two other pillarsfn31 again we began to ascend repeating as we went “verily safa and marwah are two of the monuments of allah whoso therefore pilgrimeth to the temple of meccah or performeth umrah it shall be no crime in him to run between them both and as for him who voluntarily doeth a good deed verily allah is grateful and omniscientfn32” at length we reached marwah a little rise like safa in the lower slope of abu kubays the houses cluster in amphitheatre shape above it and from the masa’a or street below a short flight of steps to a platform bounded on three sides like a tenniscourt by tall walls without arches the  p246 street seen from above has a bowstring curve it is between eight and nine hundred feet longfn33 with high houses on both sides and small lanes branching off from it at the foot of the platform we brought “right shoulders forward” so as to face the ka’abah and raising hands to ears thrice exclaimed “allaho akbar” this concluded the first course and of these seven compose the ceremony alsai or the running there was a startling contrast with the origin of this ceremony—  “when the poor outcast on the cheerless wild arabia’s parent clasped her fainting child”—  as the turkish infantry marched in european dress with sloped arms down the masa’a to relieve guard by the side of the halfnaked running badawin they look as if epochs disconnected by long centuries had met a laxity too there was in the frequent appearance of dogs upon this holy and most memorial ground which said little in favour of the religious strictness of the administrationfn34  our sai ended at mount marwah there we dismounted and sat outside a barber’s shop on the righthand of the street he operated upon our heads causing us to repeat “o allah this my forelock is in thy hand then grant me for every hair a light on the resurrectionday o most merciful of the merciful” this and the paying for it constituted the fourth portion of the umrah or little pilgrimage  throwing the skirts of our garments over our heads to show that our “ihram” was now exchanged for the normal state “ihlal” we cantered to the harim prayed there a twobow prayer and returned home not a little fatigued  fn1 not more than onequarter of the pilgrims who appear at arafat go on to almadinah the expense the hardships and the dangers of the journey account for the smallness of the number in theology it is “jaiz” or admissible to begin with the prophet’s place of burial but those performing the “hajjat alislam” are enjoined to commence at meccah fn2 when respectable married men live together in the same house a rare occurrence except on journeys this most ungallant practice of clearing the way is and must be kept up in the east fn3 i offer no lengthened description of the town of meccah ali bey and burckhardt have already said all that requires saying although the origin of the bayt ullah be lost in the glooms of past time the city is a comparatively modern place built about ad 450 by kusay and the kuraysh it contains about 30000 to 45000 inhabitants with lodging room for at least treble that number and the material of the houses is brick granite and sandstone from the neighbouring hills the site is a winding valley on a small plateau halfway “below the ghauts” its utmost length is two miles and a half from the mab’dah north to the southern mount jiyad and threequarters of a mile would be the extreme breadth between abu kubays eastward—upon whose western slope the most solid mass of the town clusters—and jabal hindi westward of the city in the centre of this line stands the ka’abah i regret being unable to offer the reader a sketch of meccah or of the great temple the stranger who would do this should visit the city out of the pilgrimage season and hire a room looking into the quadrangle of the harim this addition to our knowledge is the more required as our popular sketches generally taken from d’ohsson are utterly incorrect the ka’abah is always a recognisable building but the “view of meccah” known to europe is not more like meccah than like cairo or bombay fn4 it is curious that the afghans should claim this kuraysh noble as their compatriot “on one occasion when khalid bin walid was saying something in his native tongue the pushtu or afghani mohammed remarked that assuredly that language was the peculiar dialect of the damned as khalid appeared to suffer from the observation and to betray certain symptoms of insubordination the prophet condescended to comfort him by graciously pronouncing the words “ghashe linda raora” ie bring me my bow and arrows remarks on dr dorn’s chrestomathy of the pushtu or afghan language trans bombay as society 1848 fn5 see the ninth building of the ka’abah described in chap iv fn6 it requires not the ken of a prophet to foresee the day when political necessity—sternest of greek—will compel us to occupy in force the fountainhead of alislam fn7 good acts done at meccah are rewarded a hundredthousandfold in heaven yet it is not auspicious to dwell there omar informs us that an evil deed receives the punishment of seventy fn8 it must be remembered that my predecessor visited meccah when the egyptian army commanded by mohammed ali held the town fn9 in another place i have ventured a few observations concerning the easy suppression of this traffic fn10 the act is called “tashrit” or gashing the body is also marked but with smaller cuts so that the child is covered with blood ali bey was told by some meccans that the facegashes served for the purpose of phlebotomy by others that they were signs that the scarred was the servant of allah’s house he attributes this malegashing like femaletattooing to coquetry the citizens told me that the custom arose from the necessity of preserving children from the kidnapping persians and that it is preserved as a mark of the holy city but its wide diffusion denotes an earlier origin mohammed expressly forbad his followers to mark the skin with scars these “beauty marks” are common to the nations in the regions to the west of the red sea the barabarah of upper egypt adorn their faces with scars exactly like the meccans the abyssinians moxa themselves in hetacombs for fashion’s sake i have seen cheeks gashed as in the holy city among the gallas certain races of the sawahil trace around the head a corona of little cuts like those of a cupping instrument and to quote no other instances some somalis raise ghastly seams upon their chocolatecoloured skins fn11 sayrafi moneychanger sarraf banker the indian “shroff” banker moneychanger and usurer fn12 when speaking of the meccans i allude only to the section of society which fell under my observation and that more extensive division concerning which i obtained notices that could be depended upon fn13 the editor of burckhardt’s “travels in arabia” supposes that his author’s “sect of light extinguishers” were probably parsees from surat or bombay the mistake is truly ludicrous for no pious parsee will extinguish a light moreover infidels are not allowed by law to pass the frontiers of the sanctuary the sect alluded to is an obscure heresy in central asia and concerning it the most improbable scandals have been propagated by the orthodox fn14 it is strange how travellers and linguists differ upon the subject of arabic and its dialects niebuhr compares their relation to that of provençal spanish and italian whereas lane declares the dialects to resemble each other more than those of some different counties in england herbin grammar draws a broad line between ancient and modern arabic but hochst nachrichten von marokos und fez asserts that the difference is not so great as is imagined perhaps the soundest opinion is that proposed by clodius in his “arabic grammar” “dialectus arabum vulgaris tantum differt ab erudita quantum isocrates dictio ab hodierna lingua græca” but it must be remembered that the arabs divide their spoken and even written language into two orders the “kalam wati” or vulgar tongue sometimes employed in epistolary correspondence and the “nahwi” or grammatical and classical language every man of education uses the former and can use the latter and the koran is no more a model of arabic as it is often assumed to be than “paradise lost” is of english inimitable no man imitates them fn15 safi ullah—adam fn16 the legend that abraham was the “son of fire” might have arisen from his birthplace ur of the chaldees this ur whence the latin uro becomes in persian hir in arabic irr or arr it explains the origin of “orotalt” better than by means of “allahu ta’ala” this word variously spelt ourotalt orotalt and

way would be to rush if possible into a house and the owner would then for his own interest as well as honour defend a stranger till assistance could be procured fn19 future pilgrims must also remember that the season is gradually receding towards the heart of the hot weather for the next fifteen years therefore an additional risk will attend the traveller fn20 pliny is certainly right about this useful quadruped and its congeners the zebra and the wild ass in describing it as “animal frigoris maxime impatiens” it degenerates in cold regions unless as in afghanistan and barbary there be a long hot and dry summer aden cutch and baghdad have fine breeds whereas those of india and southeastern africa are poor and weak the best and the highestpriced come from the maghrib and

surefooted they are equal to great fatigue and the stallions have been known in their ferocity to kill the groom the price varies from 25 to 150 dollars fn21 such is the popular version of the tale which differs in some points from that recorded in books others declare that here in days gone by stood the house of another notorious malignant abu jahl some again suppose that in this place a tyrannical governor of meccah was summarily “lynched” by the indignant populace the first two traditions however are the favourites the vulgar—citizens as well as pilgrims—loving to connect such places with the events of their early sacred history even in the twelfth century we read that pilgrims used to cast stones at two cairns covering the remains of abu lahab and the beautiful termagant his wife fn22 certain credulous authors have contrasted these heaps with the clear ground at muna for the purpose of a minor miracle according to them this cairn steadily grows as we may believe it would and that were it not for the guardian angels the millions of little stones annually thrown at the devils would soon form a mass of equal magnitude this custom of lapidation in token of hate is an ancient practice still common in the east yet in some parts of arabia stones are thrown at tombs as a compliment to the tenant and in the somali country the places where it is said holy men sat receive the same doubtful homage fn23 it is called in books altanim bestowing plenty a word which readers must not confound with the district of the same name in the province khaulan made by niebuhr the “thumna” “thomna” or “tamna” capital of the catabanites other authors apply altanim to the spot where abu lahab is supposed to lie there are two places called alumrah near meccah the kabir or greater is i am told in the wady fatimah and the prophet ordered ayishah and her sister to begin the ceremonies at that place it is now visited by picnic parties and those who would pray at the tomb of maimunah one of the prophet’s wives modern pilgrims commence always i am told at the umrah saghir the lesser which is about halfway nearer the city fn24 some assume the ihram garb at this place

perform this rite on the morning of visiting the ka’aba  p247 chapter xxxiii  places of pious visitation at meccah   the traveller has little work at the holy city with exceptions of jabal nur and jabal saurfn1 all the places of pious visitation lie inside or close outside the city it is well worth the while to ascend abu kubays not so much to inspect the makan alhajar and the shakk alkamarfn2 as to obtain an excellent bird’seye view of the harim and the parts adjacentfn3  the boy mohammed had applied himself sedulously to commerce after his return home and had actually been seen by shaykh nur sitting in a shop and selling small curiosities with my plenary consent i was made p248 over to abdullah his brother on the morning of the 15th zu’l hijjah 19th sept he hired two asses and accompanied me as guide to the holy places  mounting our animals we followed the road before described to the jannat alma’ala the sacred cemetery of meccah a rough wall with a poor gateway encloses a patch of barren and grimlooking ground at the foot of the chain which bounds the city’s western suburb and below alakabah the gap through which khalid bin walid entered meccah with the triumphant prophetfn4 inside are a few ignoble whitewashed domes all are of modern construction for here as at albakia further north the wahhabis indulged their levelling propensitiesfn5 the rest of the ground shows some small enclosures belonging to particular houses—equivalent to our family vaults—and the ruins of humble tombs lying in confusion whilst a few parched aloes spring from between the bricks and stonesfn6  p249 the cemetery is celebrated in local history here the body of abdullah bin zubayr was exposed by order of hajjaj bin yusuf and the number of saints buried in it has been so numerous that even in the twelfth century many had fallen into oblivion it is visited by the citizens on fridays and by women on thursdays to prevent that meeting of sexes which in the east is so detrimental to public decorum i shall be sparing in my description of the ma’ala ceremonies as the prayers prostrations and supplications are almost identical with those performed at albakia  after a long supplication pronounced standing at the doorway we entered and sauntered about the burialground on the left of the road stood an enclosure which according to abdullah belonged to his family the door and stone slabs being valuable to the poor had been removed and the graves of his forefathers appeared to have been invaded by the jackal he sighed recited a fatihah with tears in his eyes and hurried me away from the spot  the first dome which we visited covered the remains of abd alrahman the son of abu bakr one of the worthies of alislam equally respected by sunni and by shi’ah the tomb was a simple catafalque spread with the usual cloth after performing our devotions at this grave and distributing a few piastres to guardians and beggars we crossed the main path and found ourselves at the door of the cupola beneath which sleeps the venerable khadijah mohammed’s first wife the tomb was covered with a green cloth and the walls of the little building were decorated with written specimens of religious poetry a little beyond it we were shown into another dome the restingplace of sitt aminah the prophet’s motherfn7 burckhardt chronicles its illusage by p250 the fanatic wahhabis it has now been rebuilt in that frugal style that characterizes the architecture of alhijaz an exceedingly garrulous old woman came to the door invited us in and superintended our devotions at the end of which she sprinkled rosewater upon my face when asked for a cool draught she handed me a metal saucer whose contents smelt strongly of mastic earnestly directing me to drink it in a sitting posture this tomb she informed us is the property of a single woman who visits it every evening receives the contributions of the faithful prays sweeps the pavement and dusts the furniture we left five piastres for this respectable maiden and gratified the officious crone with another shilling she repaid us by signalling to some score of beggars that a rich pilgrim had entered the ma’ala and their importunities fairly drove me out of the hallowed walls  leaving the jannat alma’ala we returned towards the town and halted on the left side of the road at a mean building called the masjid aljinn of the genii here was revealed the seventysecond chapter of the koran called after the name of the mysterious firedrakes who paid fealty to the prophet descending a flight of steps—for this mosque like all ancient localities at meccah is as much below as above ground—we entered a small apartment containing waterpots for drinking and all the appurtenances of ablution in it is shown the mauza alkhatt place of the writing where mohammed wrote a letter to abu mas’ud after the homage of the jinnis a second and interior flight of stone steps led to another diminutive oratory where the prophet used to pray and receive the archangel gabriel having performed a pair of bows which caused the perspiration  p251 to burst forth as if in a russian bath i paid a few piastres and issued from the building with much satisfaction  we had some difficulty in urging our donkeys through the crowded street called the zukak alhajar presently we arrived at the bayt alnabi the prophet’s old house in which he lived with the sitt khadijah here says burckhardt the lady fatimah first saw the lightfn8 and here according to ibn jubayr hasan and hosayn were born dismounting at the entrance we descended a deep flight of steps and found ourselves in a spacious hall vaulted and of better appearance than most of the sacred edifices at meccah in the centre and well railed round stood a closet of rich green and gold stuffs in shape not unlike an umbrellatent a surly porter guarded the closed door which some respectable people vainly attempted to open by honeyed words a whisper from abdullah solved the difficulty i was directed to lie at full length upon my stomach and to kiss a blacklooking stone—said to be the lower half of the lady fatimah’s quernfn9—fixed at the bottom of a basin of the same material thence we repaired to a corner and recited a twobow at the place where the prophet used to pray the sunnat and the nafilah or supererogatory devotionsfn10  again remounting we proceeded at a leisurely pace homewards and on the way passed through the principal  p252 slavemarket it is a large street roofed with matting and full of coffeehouses the merchandise sat in rows parallel with the walls the prettiest girls occupied the highest benches below were the plainer sort and lowest of all the boys they were all gaily dressed in pink and other lightcoloured muslins with transparent veils over their heads and whether from the effect of such unusual splendour or from the reaction succeeding to their terrible landjourney and seavoyage they appeared perfectly happy laughing loudly talking unknown tongues and quizzing purchasers even during the delicate operation of purchasing there were some pretty gallas doucelooking abyssinians and africans of various degrees of hideousness from the halfarab somal to the baboonlike sawahili the highest price of which i could hear was £60 and here i matured a resolve to strike if favoured by fortune a deathblow at a trade which is eating into the vitals of industry in eastern africa the reflection was pleasant—the idea that the humble haji contemplating the scene from his donkey might become the instrument of the total abolition of this pernicious trafficfn11 what would have become of that pilgrim had the crowd in the slavemarket guessed his intentions  passing through the large bazar called the suk allayl i saw the palace of mohammed bin aun quondam prince of meccah it has a certain look of rude magnificence  p253 the effect of huge hanging balconies scattered in profusion over lofty walls clairevoies of brickwork and courses of variouscoloured stone the owner is highly popular among the badawin and feared by the citizens on account of his fierce looks courage and treachery they described him to me as vir bonus bene strangulando peritus but mr cole who knew him personally gave him a high character for generosity and freedom from fanaticism he seems to have some idea of the state which should “hedge in” a ruler his palaces at meccah and that now turned into a wakalah at jeddah are the only places in the country that can be called princely he is now a state prisoner at constantinople and the badawin pray in vain for his returnfn12  the other places of pious visitation at meccah are briefly these—  1 natak alnabi a small oratory in the zukak alhajar it derives its name from the following circumstance  p254 as the prophet was knocking at the door of abu bakr’s shop a stone gave him godspeed and told him that the master was not at home the wonderful mineral is of a reddishblack colour about a foot in dimension and fixed in the wall somewhat higher than a man’s head there are servants attached to it and the street sides are spread as usual with the napkins of importunate beggars  2 maulid alnabi or the prophet’s birthplacefn13 it is a little chapel in the suk allayl not far from mohammed bin aun’s palace it is below the present level of the ground and in the centre is a kind of tent concealing it is said a hole in the floor upon which aminah sat to be delivered  3 in the quarter “sha’ab ali” near the maulid alnabi is the birthplace of ali another oratory below the ground here as in the former place a maulid and a ziyarah are held on the anniversary of the lion’s birth  4 near khadijah’s house and the natak alnabi is a place called almuttaka from a stone against which the prophet leaned when worn out with fatigue it is much visited by devotees and some declare that on one occasion when the father of lies appeared to the prophet in the form of an elderly man and tempted him to sin by asserting that the mosqueprayers were over this stone disclosing the fraud caused the fiend to flee  5 maulid hamzah a little building at the old bab umrah near the shabayki cemetery here was the bazan or channel down which the ayn hunayn ran into the birkat majid many authorities doubt that hamzah was born at this placefn14  p255 the reader must now be as tired of “pious visitations” as i was  before leaving meccah i was urgently invited to dine by old ali bin ya sin the zemzemi a proof that he entertained inordinate expectations excited it appeared by the boy mohammed for the simple purpose of exalting his own dignity one day we were hurriedly summoned about three pm to the senior’s house a large building in the zukak alhajar we found it full of pilgrims amongst whom we had no trouble to recognise our fellowtravellers the quarrelsome old arnaut and his impudent slaveboy ali met us upon the staircase and conducted us into an upper room where we sat upon diwans and with pipes and coffee prepared for dinner presently the semicircle arose to receive a eunuch who lodged somewhere in the house he was a person of importance being the guardian of some dames of high degree at cairo and constantinople the highest place and  p256 the best pipe were unhesitatingly offered to and accepted by him he sat down with dignity answered diplomatically certain mysterious questions about the dames and applied his blubber lips to a handsome mouthpiece of lemoncoloured amber it was a fair lesson of humility for a man to find himself ranked beneath this highshouldered spindleshanked beardless bit of neutrality and as such i took it duly to heart  the dinner was served up in a sini a plated copper tray about six feet in circumference and handsomely ornamented with arabesques and inscriptions under this was the usual kursi or stool composed of mothero’pearl facets set in sandalwood and upon it a welltinned and cleanlooking service of the same material as the sini we began with a variety of stews—stews with spinach stews with bamiyah hibiscus and rich vegetable stews these being removed we dipped hands in biryani a meat pillaw abounding in clarified butter kimah finely chopped meat warak mahshi vine leaves filled with chopped and spiced mutton and folded into small triangles kabab or bits of roti spitted in mouthfuls upon a splinter of wood together with a salatah of the crispest cucumber and various dishes of watermelon cut up into squares  bread was represented by the eastern scone but it was of superior flavour and far better than the illfamed chapati of india our drink was water perfumed with mastic after the meat came a kunafah fine vermicelli sweetened with honey and sprinkled with powdered white sugar several stews of apples and quinces muhallibah a thin jelly made of rice flour milk starch and a little perfume together with squares of rahahfn15 a confiture  p257 highly prized in these regions because it comes from constantinople fruits were then placed upon the table plates full of pomegranate grains and dates of the finest flavourfn16 the dinner concluded with a pillaw of rice and butter for the easier discussion of which we were provided with carved wooden spoons  arabs ignore the delightful french art of prolonging a dinner after washing your hands you sit down throw an embroidered napkin over your knees and with a “bismillah” by way of grace plunge your hand into the attractive dish changing ad libitum occasionally sucking your fingertips as boys do lollipops and varying that diversion by cramming a chosen morsel into a friend’s mouth when your hunger is satisfied you do not sit for your companions you exclaim “al hamd” edge away from the tray wash your hands and mouth with soap display signs of repletion otherwise you will be pressed to eat more seize your pipe sip your coffee and take your “kayf” nor is it customary in these lands to sit together after dinner—the evening prayer cuts short the seance before we rose to take leave of ali bin ya sin a boy ran into the room and displayed those infantine civilities which in the east are equivalent to begging a present i slipped a dollar into his hand at the sight of which he veritable little meccan could not contain his joy “the riyal” he exclaimed “the riyal look grandpa’ the good effendi has given me a riyal” the old gentleman’s eyes twinkled with emotion he saw how easily the coin had slipped from my fingers and he fondly hoped that he had not seen the last piece “verily thou art a good  p258 young man” he ejaculated adding fervently as prayers cost nothing “may allah further all thy desires” a gentle patting of the back evidenced his high approval  i never saw old ali after that evening but entrusted to the boy mohammed what was considered a just equivalent for his services  fn1 jabal nur or hira has been mentioned before jabal saur rises at some distance to the south of meccah and contains the celebrated cave in which mohammed and abu bakr took refuge during the flight fn2 the tradition of these places is related by every historian the former is the repository of the black stone during the deluge the latter “splitting of the moon” is the spot where the prophet stood when to convert the idolatrous kuraysh he caused half the orb of night to rise from behind abu kubays and the other from jabal kayka’an on the western horizon this silly legend appears unknown to mohammed’s day fn3 the pilgrimage season strictly speaking concluded this year on the 17th september 13th zu’l hijjah at which time travellers began to move towards jeddah those who purposed visiting almadinah would start about three weeks afterwards and many who had leisure intended witnessing the muharram ceremonies at meccah fn4 this is the local tradition it does not agree with authentic history muir life of mahomet vol iv p 126 reminds me that khalid and his badawin attacked the citizens of meccah without the prophet’s leave but after the attack he may have followed in his leader’s train fn5 the reason of their vandalism has been noticed in a previous volume fn6 the aloe here as in egypt is hung like the dried crocodile over houses as a talisman against evil spirits burckhardt assigns as a motive for it being planted in graveyards that its name saber denotes the patience with which the believer awaits the last day and lane remarks “the aloe thus hung over the door without earth and water will live for several years and even blossom hence it is called saber which signifies patience” in india it is hung up to prevent mosquitoes entering a room i believe the superstition to be a fragment of african fetichism the gallas to the present day plant aloes on graves and suppose that when the plant sprouts the deceased has been admitted into the gardens of “wak”—the creator ideas breed vocables but seldom except among rhymesters does a vocable give birth to a popular idea and in arabic “sibr” as well as “sabr” is the name of the aloe fn7 burckhardt mentions the “tomb of umna the mother of mohammed” in the ma’ala at meccah and all the ciceroni agree about the locality yet historians place it at abwa where she gave up the ghost after visiting almadinah to introduce her son to his relations and the learned believe that the prophet refused to pray over or to intercede for his mother she having died before alislam was revealed fn8 burckhardt calls it “maulid sittna fatimah” but the name “kubbat el wahy” applied by my predecessor to this locality is generally made synonymous with almukhtaba the “hidingplace” where the prophet and his followers used in dangerous times to meet for prayer fn9 so loose is local tradition that some have confounded this quern with the natak alnabi the stone which gave godspeed to the prophet fn10 he would of course pray the farz or obligatory devotions at the shrine fn11 about a year since writing the above a firman was issued by the porte suppressing the traffic from central africa hitherto we have respected slavery in the red sea because the turk thence drew his supplies we are now destitute of an excuse a single steamer would destroy the trade and if we delay to take active measures the people of england who have spent millions in keeping up a west african squadron will not hold us guiltless of negligence note to second edition—the slave trade has since these remarks were penned been suppressed with a high hand the arabs of alhijaz resented the measure by disowning the supremacy of the porte but they were soon reduced to submission fn12 the prince was first invested with the sharifat by mohammed ali of egypt in ad 1827 when yahya fled after stabbing his nephew in the ka’abah to the benu harb badawin he was supported by ahmad pasha of meccah with a large army but after the battle of tarabah in which ibrahim pasha was worsted by the badawin mohammed bin aun accused of acting as sylla was sent in honourable bondage to cairo he again returned to meccah where the rapacity of his eldest son abdullah who would rob pilgrims caused fresh misfortunes in ad 1851 when abd almuttalib was appointed sharif the pasha was ordered to send bin aun to stambul—no easy task the turk succeeded by a manœuvre mohammed’s two sons happening to be at jeddah were invited to inspect a manofwar and were there made prisoners upon this the father yielded himself up although it is said the flashing of the badawi’s sabre during his embarkation made the turks rejoice that they had won the day by statecraft the wild men of alhijaz still sing songs in honour of this sharif note to second edition—early in 1856 when the sharif abd almuttalib was deposed mohammed bin aun was sent from constantinople to quiet the insurrection caused by the new slave laws in alhijaz in a short space of time he completely succeeded fn13 the 12th of rabia alawwal mohammed’s birthday is here celebrated with great festivities feasts prayers and perusals of the koran these “maulid” ceremonies of nativity are by no means limited to a single day in the year fn14 the reader is warned that i did not see the five places above enumerated the ciceroni and books mention twelve other visitations several of which are known only by name 1 almukhtaba the “hidingplace” alluded to in the preceding pages its locality is the subject of debate 2 dar alkhayzaran where the prophet prayed secretly till the conversion of omar enabled him to dispense with concealment 3 maulid omar or omar’s birthplace mentioned in books as being visited by devotees in the 14th rabia alawwal of every year 4 abu bakr’s house near the natak alnabi it is supposed to have been destroyed in the twelfth century 5 maulid ja’afar altayyar near the shabayki cemetery 6 almada’a an oratory also called naf alarz because creation here began 7 dar alhijrah where mohammed and abu bakr mounted for the flight 8 masjid alrayah where the prophet planted his flag when meccah surrendered 9 masjid alshajarah a spot at which mohammed caused a tree to advance and to retire 10 masjid alja’aranah where mohammed clad himself in the pilgrim garb it is still visited by some persians 11 masjid ibrahim or abu kubays 12 masjid zu tawa fn15 familiar for “rahat alhulkum”—the pleasure of the throat—a name which has sorely puzzled our tourists this sweetmeat would be pleasant did it not smell so strongly of the perruquier’s shop rosewater tempts to many culinary sins in the east and europeans cannot dissociate it from the idea of a lotion however if a guest is to be honoured rosewater must often take the place of the pure element even in tea fn16 meccah is amply supplied with watermelons dates limes grapes cucumbers and other vegetables from taif and wady fatimah during the pilgrimage season the former place sends at least 100 camels every day to the capital  p259 chapter xxxiv  to jeddah  a general plunge into worldly pursuits and pleasures announced the end of the pilgrimage ceremonies all the devotees were now “whitewashed”—the book of their sins was a tabula rasa too many of them lost no time in making a new departure “down south” and in opening a fresh account the faith must not bear the blame of the irregularities they may be equally observed in the calvinist after a sunday of prayer sinning through monday with a zest and the romanist falling back with new fervour upon the causes of his confession and penance as in the moslem who washes his soul clean by running and circumambulation and in fairness it must be observed that as amongst christians so in the moslem persuasion there are many notable exceptions to this rule of extremes several of my friends and acquaintances date their reformation from their first sight of the ka’abah  the moslem’s “holy week” over nothing detained me at meccah for reasons before stated i resolved upon returning to cairo resting there for awhile and starting a second time for the interior via muwaylahfn1  the meccans are as fond of little presents as are nuns the kabirah took an affectionate leave of me begged me to be careful of her boy who was to accompany  p260 me to jeddah and laid friendly but firm hands upon a brass pestle and mortar upon which she had long cast the eye of concupiscence  having hired two camels for thirtyfive piastres and paid half the sum in advance i sent on my heavy boxes with shaykh now haji nur to jeddahfn2 omar effendi was to wait at meccah till his father had started in command of the dromedary caravan when he would privily take ass join me at the port and return to his beloved cairo i bade a long farewell to all my friends embraced the turkish pilgrims and mounting our donkeys the boy mohammed and i left the house abdullah the melancholy followed us on foot through the city and took leave of me though without embracing at the shabayki quarter  issuing into the open plain i felt a thrill of pleasure—such joy as only the captive delivered from his dungeon can experience the sunbeams warmed me into renewed life and vigour the air of the desert was a perfume and the homely face of nature was as the smile of a dear old friend i contemplated the syrian caravan lying on the right of our road without any of the sadness usually suggested by a parting look  it is not my intention minutely to describe the line down which we travelled that night the pages of burckhardt give full information about the country leaving meccah we fell into the direct road running south of wady fatimah and traversed for about an hour a flat surrounded by hills then we entered a valley by a flight of rough stone steps dangerously slippery and zigzag intended to facilitate the descent for camels and for laden beasts about midnight we passed into a hillgirt wady here covered with deep sands there hard with p261 gravelly clay and finally about dawn we sighted the maritime plain of jeddah  shortly after leaving the city our party was joined by other travellers and towards evening we found ourselves in force the effect of an order that pilgrims must not proceed singly upon this road coffeehouses and places of refreshment abounding we halted every five miles to refresh ourselves and the donkeysfn3 at sunset we prayed near a turkish guardhouse where one of the soldiers kindly supplied me with water for ablution  before nightfall i was accosted in turkish by a oneeyed old fellow who  “with faded brow entrenched with many a frown and conic beard”  and habited in unclean garments was bestriding a donkey as faded as himself when i shook my head he addressed me in persian the same manœuvre made him try arabic still he obtained no answer then he grumbled out good hindustani that also failing he tried successively pushtu armenian english french and italian at last i could “keep a stiff lip” no longer at every change of dialect his emphasis beginning with “then who the d— are you” became more emphatic i turned upon him in persian and found that he had been a pilot a courier and a servant to eastern tourists and that he had visited england france and italy the cape india central asia and china we then chatted in english which haji akif spoke well but with all manner of courier’s phrases haji abdullah so badly that he was counselled a course of study it was not a little strange to hear such phrases as “come ’p neddy” and “cre nom d’un baudet” almost within earshot of the tomb of ishmael the birthplace of mohammed and the sanctuary of alislam  p262 about eight pm we passed the alamayn which define the sanctuary in this direction they stand about nine miles from meccah and near them are a coffeehouse and a little oratory popularly known as the sabil agha almas on the road as night advanced we met long strings of camels some carrying litters others huge beams and others bales of coffee grain and merchandise sleep began to weigh heavily upon my companions’ eyelids and the boy mohammed hung over the flank of his donkey in a most ludicrous position  about midnight we reached a mass of huts called alhaddah ali bey places it eight leagues from jeddah at “the boundary” which is considered to be the halfway haltingplace pilgrims must assume the religious garbfn4 and infidels travelling to taif are taken off the meccan road into one leading northward to arafat the settlement is a collection of huts and hovels built with sticks and reeds supporting brushwood and burned and blackened palm leaves it is maintained for supplying pilgrims with coffee and water travellers speak with horror of its heat during the day ali bey who visited it twice compares it to a furnace here the country slopes gradually towards the sea the hills draw off and every object denotes departure from the meccan plateau at alhaddah we dismounted for an hour’s halt a coffeehouse supplied us with mats waterpipes and other necessaries we then produced a basket of provisions the parting gift of the kind kabirah and this late supper concluded we lay down to doze  after half an hour’s halt had expired and the donkeys were saddled i shook up with difficulty the boy mohammed and induced him to mount he was to use his own expression “dead from sleep” and we had  p263 scarcely advanced an hour when arriving at another little coffeehouse he threw himself upon the ground and declared it impossible to proceed this act caused some confusion the donkeyboy was a pert little badawi offensively republican in manner he had several times addressed me impudently ordering me not to flog his animal or to hammer its sides with my heels on these occasions he received a contemptuous snub which had the effect of silencing him but now thinking we were in his power he swore that he would lead away the beasts and leave us behind to be robbed and murdered a pinch of the windpipe and a spin over the ground altered his plans at the outset of execution he gnawed his hand with impotent rage and went away threatening us with the governor of jeddah next morning then an egyptian of the party took up the thread of remonstrance and aided by the old linguist who said in english “by g— you must budge you’ll catch it here” he assumed a brisk and energetic style exclaiming “yallah rise and mount thou art only losing our time thou dost not intend to sleep in the desert” i replied “o my uncle do not exceed in talk”—fuzul excess in arabic is equivalent to telling a man in english not to be impertinent—rolled over on the other side heavily as doth encelades and pretended to snore whilst the cowed egyptian urged the others to make us move the question was thus settled by the boy mohammed who had been aroused by the dispute “do you know” he whispered in awful accents “what that person is” and he pointed to me “why no” replied the others “well” said the youth “the other day the utaybah showed us death in the zaribah pass and what do you think he did” “wallah what do we know” exclaimed the egyptian “what did he do” “he called for—his dinner” replied the youth with a slow and  p264 sarcastic emphasis that trait was enough the others mounted and left us quietly to sleep  i have been diffuse in relating this little adventure which is characteristic showing what bravado can do in arabia it also suggests a lesson which every traveller in these regions should take well to heart the people are always ready to terrify him with frightful stories which are the merest phantoms of cowardice the reason why the egyptian displayed so much philanthropy was that had one of the party been lost the survivors might have fallen into trouble but in this place we were i believe—despite the declarations of our companions that it was infested with turpins and fra diavolos—as safe as in meccah every night during the pilgrimage season a troop of about fifty horsemen patrol the roads we were all armed to the teeth and our party looked too formidable to be “cruelly beaten by a single footpad” our nap concluded we remounted and resumed the weary way down a sandy valley in which the poor donkeys sank fetlockdeep at dawn we found our companions halted and praying at the kahwat turki another little coffeehouse here an exchange of what is popularly called “chaff” took place “well” cried the egyptian “what have ye gained by halting we have been quiet here praying and smoking for the last hour” “go eat thy buried beansfn5” we replied “what does an egyptian boor know of manliness” the surly donkeyboy was worked up into a paroxysm of passion by such small jokes as telling him to convey our salams to the governor of jeddah and by calling the asses after the name of his tribe he replied by “foul unmannered scurril taunts” which only drew forth fresh derision and the coffeehouse keeper laughed consumedly  p265 having probably seldom entertained such “funny gentlemen”  shortly after leaving the kahwat turki we found the last spur of the highlands that sink into the jeddah plain this view would for some time be my last of  “infamous hills and sandy perilous wilds”  and i contemplated it with the pleasure of one escaping from it before us lay the usual iron flat of these regions whitish with salt and tawny with stones and gravel but relieved and beautified by the distant white walls whose canopy was the lovely blue sea not a tree not a patch of verdure was in sight  nothing distracted our attention from the sheet of turquoises in the distance merrily the little donkeys hobbled on in spite of their fatigue soon we distinguished the features of the town the minarets the fortifications—so celebrated since their honeycombed guns beat off in 1817 the thousands of abdullah bin sa’ud the wahhabifn6 and a small dome outside the walls  the sun began to glow fiercely and we were not sorry when at about eight am after passing through the mass of hovels and coffeehouses cemeteries and sandhills which forms the eastern approach to jeddah we entered the fortified bab makkah allowing eleven hours for our actual march—we halted about three—those wonderful donkeys had accomplished between fortyfour  p266 and fortysix milesfn7 generally in deep sand in one night and they passed the archway of jeddah cantering almost as nimbly as when they left meccah  shaykh nur had been ordered to take rooms for me in a vast pile of madrepore—unfossilized coral a recent formation—once the palace of mohammed bin aun and now converted into a wakalah instead of so doing indianlike he had made a gipsy encampment in the square opening upon the harbour after administering the requisite correction i found a room that would suit me in less than an hour it was swept sprinkled with water spread with mats and made as comfortable as its capability admitted at jeddah i felt once more at home the sight of the sea acted as a tonic the maharattas were not far wrong when they kept their english captives out of reach of the ocean declaring that we were an amphibious race to whom the wave is a home  after a day’s repose at the caravanserai the camelman and donkeyboy clamouring for money and i not having more than tenpence of borrowed coin it was necessary to cash at the british viceconsulate a draft given to me by the royal geographical society with some trouble i saw mr cole who suffering from fever was declared to be “not at home” his dragoman did by no means admire my looks in fact the general voice of the household was against me after some fruitless messages i sent up a scrawl to mr cole who decided upon admitting the importunate afghan an exclamation of astonishment and a hospitable welcome followed my selfintroduction as an officer of the indian army amongst other things the viceconsul informed me that in divers discussions with the turks about the possibility of an englishman finding his way en cachette to meccah  p267 he had asserted that his compatriots could do everything even pilgrim to the holy city the moslems politely assented to the first but denied the second part of the proposition mr cole promised himself a laugh at the turks’ beards but since my departure he wrote to me that the subject made the owners look so serious that he did not like recurring to it  truly gratifying to the pride of an englishman was our high official position assumed and maintained at jeddah mr cole had never like his colleague at cairo lowered himself in the estimation of the proud race with which he has to deal by private or mercantile transactions with the authorities he has steadily withstood the wrath of the meccan sharif and taught him to respect the british name the abbe hamilton ascribed the attentions of the prince to “the infinite respect which the arabs entertain for mr cole’s straightforward way of doing business—it was a delicate flattery addressed to him” and the writer was right honesty of purpose is never thrown away amongst these people the general contrast between our consular proceedings at cairo and jeddah is another proof of the advisability of selecting indian officials to fill offices of trust at oriental courts they have lived amongst easterns and they know one asiatic language with many asiatic customs and chief merit of all they have learned to assume a tone of command without which whatever may be thought of it in england it is impossible to take the lead in the east the “homebred” diplomate is not only unconscious of the thousand traps everywhere laid for him he even plays into the hands of his crafty antagonists by a ceremonious politeness which they interpret—taking ample care that the interpretation should spread—to be the effect of fear or of fraud  jeddahfn8 has been often described by modern pens  p268 burckhardt in ad 1814 devoted a hundred pages of his two volumes to the unhappy capital of the tihamat alhijaz the lowlands of the mountain region later still mm mari and chedufau wrote upon the subject and two other french travellers mm galinier and ferret published tables of the commerce in its present state quoting as authority the celebrated arabicist m fresnelfn9 these  p269 have been translated by the author of “life in abyssinia” abd alkarim writing in 1742 informs us that the french had a factory at jeddah and in 1760 when bruce revisited the port he found the east india company in possession of a post whence they dispersed their merchandise over the adjoining regions but though the english were at an early epoch of their appearance in the east received here with especial favour i failed to procure a single ancient document  jeddah when i visited it was in a state of commotion owing to the perpetual passage of pilgrims and provisions were for the same reason scarce and dear the two large wakalahs of which the place boasts were crowded with travellers and many were reduced to encamping upon the squares another subject of confusion was the state of the soldiery the nizam or regulars had not been paid for seven months and the arnauts could scarcely sum up what was owing to them easterns are wonderfully amenable to discipline a european army under the circumstances would probably have helped itself but the pasha knew that there is a limit to a man’s endurance and he was anxiously casting about for some contrivance that would replenish the empty pouches of his troops the worried dignitary must have sighed for those beaux jours when privily firing the town and allowing the soldiers to plunder was the oriental style of settling arrears of payfn10  p270 jeddah displays all the license of a seaport and garrison town fair corinthians establish themselves even within earshot of the karakun or guardpost a symptom of excessive laxity in the authorities for it is the duty of the watch to visit all such irregularities with a bastinado preparatory to confinement my guardians and attendants at the wakalah used to fetch araki in a clear glass bottle without even the decency of a cloth and the messenger twice returned from these errands decidedly drunk more extraordinary still the people seemed to take no notice of the scandal  the little “dwarka” had been sent by the bombay steam navigation company to convey pilgrims from alhijaz to india i was still hesitating about my next voyage not wishing to coast the red sea in this season without a companion when one morning omar effendi appeared at the door weary and dragging after him an ass more weary than himself we supplied him with a pipe and a cup of hot tea and as he was fearful of pursuit we showed him a dark hole full of grass under which he might sleep concealed  the student’s fears were realised his father appeared early the next morning and having ascertained from the porter that the fugitive was in the house politely called upon me whilst he plied all manner of questions his black slave furtively stared at everything in and about the room but we had found time to cover the runaway with grass and the old gentleman departed after a fruitless search there was however a grim smile about his mouth which boded no good  that evening returning home from the hammam i found the house in an uproar the boy mohammed who had been miserably mauled was furious with rage and shaykh nur was equally unmanageable by reason of his fear in my absence the father had returned with a posse comitatus of friends and relatives they questioned the  p271 youth who delivered himself of many circumstantial and emphatic misstatements then they proceeded to open the boxes upon which the boy mohammed cast himself sprawling with a vow to die rather than to endure such a disgrace this procured for him some scattered slaps which presently became a storm of blows when a prying little boy discovered omar effendi’s leg in the hidingplace the student was led away unresisting but mildly swearing that he would allow no opportunity of escape to pass i examined the boy mohammed and was pleased to find that he was not seriously hurt to pacify his mind i offered to sally out with him and to rescue omar effendi by main force this which would only have brought us all into a brunt with quarterstaves and similar servile weapons was declined as had been foreseen but the youth recovered complacency and a few wellmerited encomiums upon his “pluck” restored him to high spirits   the reader must not fancy such escapade to be a serious thing in arabia the father did not punish his son he merely bargained with him to return home for a few days before starting to egypt this the young man did and shortly afterwards i met him unexpectedly in the streets of cairo  deprived of my companion i resolved to waste no time in the red sea but to return to egypt with the utmost expedition the boy mohammed having laid in a large store of grain purchased with my money having secured all my disposable articles and having hinted that after my return to india a present of twenty dollars would find him at meccah asked leave and departed with a coolness for which i could not account some days afterwards shaykh nur explained the cause i had taken the youth with me on board the steamer where a bad suspicion crossed his mind “now i understand” said the boy mohammed to his fellowservant “your master is a sahib from india he hath laughed at our beards”  p272 he parted as coolly from shaykh nur these worthy youths had been drinking together when mohammed having learned at stambul the fashionable practice of badmasti or “liquorvice” dug his “fives” into nur’s eye nur erroneously considering such exercise likely to induce blindness complained to me but my sympathy was all with the other side i asked the hindi why he had not returned the compliment and the meccan once more overwhelmed the miyan with taunt and jibe  it is not easy to pass the time at jeddah in the square opposite to us was an unhappy idiot who afforded us a melancholy spectacle he delighted to wander about in a primitive state of toilette as all such wretches do but the people of jeddah far too civilised to retain moslem respect for madness forced him despite shrieks and struggles into a shirt and when he tore it off they beat him at other times the open space before us was diversified by the arrival and the departure of pilgrims but it was a mere rechauffe of the feast and had lost all power to please whilst the boy mohammed remained he used to pass the time in wrangling with some indians who were living next door to us men women and children in a promiscuous way after his departure i used to spend my days at the viceconsulate the proceeding was not perhaps of the safest but the temptation of meeting a fellowcountryman and of chatting “shop” about the service was too great to be resisted i met there the principal merchants of jeddah khwajah sower a greek m anton a christian from baghdad and othersfn11and i was introduced to khalid bey brother of abdullah bin sa’ud the wahhabi this noble arab once held the  p273 official position of mukayyid aljawabat or secretary at cairo where he was brought up by mohammed ali he is brave frank and unprejudiced fond of europeans and a lover of pleasure should it be his fate to become chief of the tribe a journey to riyaz and a visit to central arabia will offer no difficulties to our travellers  i now proceed to the last of my visitations outside the town of jeddah lies no less a personage than sittna hawwa the mother of mankind the boy mohammed and i mounting asses one evening issued through the meccan gate and turned towards the northeast over a sandy plain after half an hour’s ride amongst dirty huts and tattered coffeehovels we reached the enceinte and found the door closed presently a man came running with might from the town he was followed by two others and it struck me at the time they applied the key with peculiar empressement and made inordinately low conges as we entered the enclosure of whitewashed walls  “the mother” is supposed to lie like a moslemah fronting the ka’abah with her feet northwards her head southwards and her right cheek propped by her right hand whitewashed and conspicuous to the voyager and traveller from afar is a diminutive dome with an opening to the west it is furnished as such places usually are in alhijaz under it and in the centre is a square stone planted upright and fancifully carved to represent the omphalic region of the human frame this as well as the dome is called alsurrah or the navel the cicerone directed me to kiss this manner of hieroglyph which i did thinking the while that under the circumstances the salutation was quite uncalledfor having prayed here and at the head where a few young trees grow we walked along the side of the two parallel dwarf walls which define the outlines of the body they are about six paces apart and between them upon eve’s  p274 neck are two tombs occupied i was told by osman pasha and his son who repaired the mother’s sepulchre i could not help remarking to the boy mohammed that if our first parent measured a hundred and twenty paces from head to waist and eighty from waist to heel she must have presented much the appearance of a duck to this the youth replied flippantly that he thanked his stars the mother was underground otherwise that men would lose their senses with fright  ibn jubayr twelfth century mentions only an old dome “built upon the place where eve stopped on the way to meccah” yet alidrisi ad 1154 declares eve’s grave to be at jeddah abd alkarim 1742 compares it to a parterre with a little dome in the centre and the extremities ending in barriers of palisades the circumference was a hundred and ninety of his steps in rooke’s travels we are told that the tomb is twenty feet long ali bey who twice visited jeddah makes no allusion to it we may therefore conclude that it had been destroyed by the wahhabis burckhardt who i need  p275 scarcely say has been carefully copied by our popular authors was informed that it was a “rude structure of stone about four feet in length two or three feet in height and as many in breadth” thus resembling the tomb of noah seen in the valley of albuka’a in syria bruce writes “two days’ journey from this place  meccah or jeddah eve’s grave of green sods about fifty yards in length is shown to this day” but the great traveller probably never issued from the towngates and sir w harris who could not have visited the holy place repeats in 1840 that eve’s grave of green sod is still shown on the barren shore of the red sea” the present structure is clearly modern anciently i was told at jeddah the sepulchre consisted of a stone at the head a second at the feet and the naveldome  the idol of jeddah in the days of arab litholatry was called sakhrah tawilah the long stone may not this stone of eve be the moslemized revival of the old idolatry it is to be observed that the arabs if the tombs be admitted as evidence are inconsistent in their dimensions of the patriarchal stature the sepulchre of adam at the masjid alkhayf is like that of eve gigantic that of noah at albuka’a is a bit of aqueduct thirtyeight paces long by one and a half wide job’s tomb near hulah seven parasangs from kerbela is small i have not seen the grave of moses southeast of the red sea which is becoming known by the bitumen cups there sold to pilgrims but aaron’s sepulchre in the sinaitic peninsula is of moderate dimensions  on leaving the graveyard i offered the guardian a dollar which he received with a remonstrance that a man of my dignity should give so paltry a fee nor was he at all contented with the assurance that nothing more could be expected from an afghan darwaysh however pious next day the boy mohammed explained the  p276 man’s empressement and disappointment—i had been mistaken for the pasha of almadinah  for a time my peregrinations ended worn out with fatigue and the fatal fiery heat i embarked sept 26 on board the “dwarka” experienced the greatest kindness from the commander and chief officer messrs wolley and taylor and wondering the while how the turkish pilgrims who crowded the vessel did not take the trouble to throw me overboard in due time i arrived at suez  and here reader we part bear with me while i conclude in the words of a brother traveller long gone but not forgotten—fahian—this personal narrative of my journey to alhijaz “i have been exposed to perils and i have escaped from them i have traversed the sea and have not succumbed under the severest fatigues and my heart is moved with emotions of gratitude that i have been permitted to effect the objects i had in view”fn12  fn1 this second plan was defeated by bad health which detained me in egypt till a return to india became imperative fn2 the usual hire is thirty piastres but in the pilgrimage season a dollar is often paid the hire of an ass varies from one to three riyals fn3 besides the remains of those in ruins there are on this road eight coffeehouses and stations for travellers private buildings belonging to men who supply water and other necessaries fn4 in ibn jubayr’s time the ihram was assumed at alfurayn now a decayed station about two hours’ journey from alhaddah towards jeddah fn5 the favourite egyptian “kitchen” held to be contemptible food by the arabs fn6 in 1817 abdullah bin sa’ud attacked jeddah with 50000 men determining to overthrow its “kafirworks” namely its walls and towers the assault is described as ludicrous all the inhabitants aided to garrison they waited till the wild men flocked about the place crying “come and let us look at the labours of the infidel” they then let fly and raked them with matchlock balls and old nails acting grape the wahhabi host at last departed unable to take a place which a single battery of our smallest siegeguns would breach in an hour and since that day the meccans have never ceased to boast of their gibraltar and to taunt the madinites with their wallless port yambu’ fn7 alidrisi places meccah forty arab miles from jeddah burckhardt gives fiftyfive miles and ali bey has not computed the total distance fn8 abulfeda writes the word “juddah” and mr lane as well as mm mari and chedufau adopt this form which signifies a “plain wanting water” the water of jeddah is still very scarce and bad all who can afford it drink the produce of hill springs brought in skins by the badawin ibn jubayr mentions that outside the town were 360 old wells dug it is supposed by the persians “jeddah” or “jiddah” is the vulgar pronounciation and not a few of the learned call it “jaddah” the grandmother in allusion to the legend of eve’s tomb fn9 in chapters iii and vi of this work i have ventured some remarks upon the advisability of our being represented in alhijaz by a consul and at meccah by a native agent till the day shall come when the tide of events forces us to occupy the mothercity of alislam my apology for reverting to these points must be the nature of an englishman who would everywhere see his nation “second to none” even at jeddah yet when we consider that from twentyfive to thirty vessels here arrive annually from india and that the value of the trade is about twentyfive lacs of rupees the matter may be thought worth attending to the following extracts from a letter written to me by mr cole shall conclude this part of my task— “you must know that in 1838 a commercial treaty was concluded between great britain and the porte specifying amongst many other clauses here omitted— “1 that all merchandise imported from english ports to alhijaz should pay 4 per cent duty “2 that all merchandise imported by british subjects from countries not under the dominion of the porte should likewise pay but 5 per cent “3 that all goods exported from countries under the dominion of the porte should pay 12 per cent after a deduction of 16 per cent from the marketvalue of the articles “4 that all monopolies be abolished” “now when i arrived at jeddah the state of affairs was this a monopoly had been established upon salt and this weighed only upon our angloindian subjects they being the sole purchasers five per cent was levied upon full value of goods no deduction of the 20 per cent being allowed the same was the case with exports and most vexatious of all various charges had been established by the local authorities under the names of boathire weighing brokerage c c the duties had thus been raised from 4 to at least 8 per cent            this being represented at constantinople brought a peremptory firman ordering the governor to act up to the treaty letter by letter        i have had the satisfaction to rectify the abuses of sixteen years’ standing during my first few months of office but i expect all manner of difficulties in claiming reimbursement for the overexactions” fn10 m rochet soidisant d’hericourt amusingly describes this manœuvre of the governor of alhodaydah fn11 many of them were afterwards victims to the “jeddah massacre” on june 30 1858 i must refer the reader to my “lake regions of central africa” appendix vol ii for an account of this event for the proposals which i made to ward it off and for the miserable folly of the “bombay government” who rewarded me by an official reprimand fn12 the curious reader will find details concerning patriarchal and prophetical tombs in “unexplored syria” i 33—35  p277 appendices  p279 appendix i  of hajj or pilgrimage  the word hajj is explained by moslem divines to mean “kasd” or aspiration and to express man’s sentiment that he is but a wayfarer on earth wending towards another and a nobler world this explains the origin and the belief that the greater the hardships the higher will be the reward of the pious wanderer he is urged by the voice of his soul “o thou who toilest so hard for worldly pleasures and perishable profit wilt thou endure nothing to win a more lasting reward” hence it is that pilgrimage is common to all old faiths the hindus still wander to egypt to tibet and to the inhospitable caucasus the classic philosophers visited egypt the jews annually flocked to jerusalem and the tartars and mongols—buddhists—journey to distant lamaserais the spirit of pilgrimage was predominant in mediæval europe and the processions of the roman catholic church are according to her votariesfn1 modern memorials of the effete rite every moslem is bound under certain conditionsfn2  p280 to pay at least one visit to the holy city this constitutes the hajjat alfarz the one obligatory pilgrimage or hajjat alislam of the mohammedan faith repetitions become mere sunnats or practices of the prophet and are therefore supererogatory some european writers have of late years laboured to represent the meccan pilgrimage as a fair a pretext to collect merchants and to afford arabia the benefits of purchase and barter it would be vain to speculate whether the secular or the spiritual element originally prevailed but most probably each had its portion but those who peruse this volume will see that despite the comparatively lukewarm piety of the age the meccan pilgrimage is religious essentially accidentally an affair of commerce  moslem pilgrimage is of three kinds  1 almukarinah the uniting is when the votary performs the hajj and the umrahfn3 together as was done by the prophet in his last visit to meccah 2 alifrad singulation is when either the hajj or the umrah is performed singularly the former preceding the latter the pilgrim may be either almufrid b’il hajj  p281 one who is performing only the hajj or vice versa almufrid b’il umrah according to abu hanifah this form is more efficacious than the following 3 altamattu “possession” is when the pilgrim assumes the ihram and preserves it throughout the months of shawwal zu’l ka’adah and nine days ten nights in zu’l hijjahfn4 performing hajj and umrah the while  there is another threefold division of pilgrimage—  1 umrah the little pilgrimage performed at any time except the pilgrimage season it differs in some of its forms from hajj as will afterwards appear 2 hajj or simple pilgrimage performed at the proper season 3 hajj alakbar the great pilgrimage is when the “day of arafat” happens to fall upon a friday this is a most auspicious occasion m caussin de perceval and other writers departing from the practice of modern islam make “hajj alakbar” to mean the simple pilgrimage in opposition to the umrah which they call “hajj alasghar”  the following compendium of the shafe’i pilgrimrites is translated from a little treatise by mohammed of shirbin surnamed alkhatib a learned doctor whose work is generally read in egypt and in the countries adjoining  chapter i—of pilgrimagefn5  “know” says the theologist with scant preamble “that the acts of alhajj or pilgrimage are of three kinds—  p282 “1 alarkan or farayz those made obligatory by koranic precepts and therefore essentially necessary and not admitting expiatory or vicarious atonement either in hajj or umrah “2 alwajibat requisites the omission of which may according to some schoolsfn6 be compensated for by the fidyat or atoning sacrifice and— “3 alsunan pl of sunnat the practice of the prophet which may be departed from without positive sin  “now the arkan the ‘pillars’ upon which the rite stands are six in numberfn7 viz—  “1 alihram ‘rendering unlawful’ or the wearing pilgrim garb and avoiding certain actions “2 alwukuf the ‘standing’ upon mount arafat “3 the tawaf alifazah or circumambulation of impetuosityfn8  p283 “4 the sai or course between mounts safa and marwah “5 alhalk tonsure of the whole or part of the head for men or taksir cutting the hair for men or womenfn9 “6 altartib or the due order of the ceremonies as above enumerated “but alsai 4 may either precede or follow alwukuf 2 provided that the tawaf alkudum or the circumambulation of arrival has previously been performed and halk 5 may be done before as well as after the tawaf alifazah 3  “now the wajibat requisites of pilgrimage also called ‘nusuk’ are five in number viz—  “1 alihram or assuming pilgrim garb from the mikat or fixed limitfn10 “2 the mabit or nighting at muzdalifah for this a short portion generally in the latter watch preceding the yaum alnahr or victimday suffices “3 the spending at muna the three nights of the ‘ayyam altashrik’ or days of drying flesh of these the first is the most important “4 the rami aljimar or casting stones at the devil and— “5 the avoiding of all things forbidden to the pilgrim when in a state of ihram  “some writers reduce these requisites by omitting the second and third the tawaf alwida’a or the circumambulation of farewell is a ‘wajib mustakill’ or particular requisite which may however be omitted without prejudice to pilgrimage  “finally the sunnat of pilgrimage are many in number of these i enumerate but a few ‘hajj’ should precede ‘umrah’ the ‘talbiyat’ should be frequently ejaculated the ‘tawaf alkudum’ must be performed on arrival at meccah before proceeding to mount arafatfn11 the twobow prayer should follow  p284 tawaf a whole night should be passed at muzdalifah and munafn12 the circumambulation of farewell must not be forgottenfn13 and the pilgrim should avoid all sewn clothes even slippers”  section i—of ihram  “before doffing his laical garment the pilgrim performs a total ablution shaves and perfumes himself he then puts on a ‘rida’ and an ‘izarfn14’ both new clean and of a white colour after which he performs a twobow prayer the ‘sunnat’ of alihram with a sottovoce niyat specifying which rite he intendsfn15  “when muhrim ie in ihram the moslem is forbidden unless in case of sickness necessity overheat or unendurable cold when a victim must expiate the transgression—  “1 to cover his head with aught which may be deemed a covering as a cap or turband but he may carry an umbrella dive under water stand in the shade and even place his hands upon his head a woman may wear sewn clothes white or light blue not black but her faceveil should be kept at a distance from her face “2 to wear anything sewn or with seams as shirt trowsers or slippers anything knotted or woven as chainarmour but the pilgrim may use for instance a tornup shirt or trowsers bound round his loins or thrown over his shoulders he may knot his ‘izar’ and tie it with a cord and he may gird his waist “3 to knot the rida or shoulderclothfn16  p285 “4 to deviate from absolute chastity even kissing being forbidden to the muhrim marriage cannot be contracted during the pilgrimage season “5 to use perfumes oil curling the locks or removing the nails and hair by paring cutting plucking or burning the nails may be employed to remove pediculi from the hair and clothes but with care that no pile fall off “6 to hunt wild animals or to kill those which were such originally but he may destroy the ‘five noxious’—a kite a crow a rat a scorpion and a dog given to biting he must not cut down a treefn17 or pluck up a selfgrowing plant but he is permitted to reap and to cut grass  “it is meritorious for the pilgrim often to raise the ‘talbiyat’ cry for which see p 140 ante  “‘labbayk’ allahumma labbayk’ la sharika laka labbayk’ inna ’l hamda wa ’l ni’amata laka w’al mulk la sharika laka labbayk’fn18  “when assuming the pilgrimgarb and before entering meccah ‘ghusl’ or total ablution should be performed but if water be not procurable the tayammum or sand ablution suffices the pilgrim should enter the holy city by day and on foot when his glance falls upon the ka’abah he should say ‘o allah increase this thy house in degree and greatness and honour and awfulness and increase all those who have honoured it and glorified it the hajis and the mutamirs umrahperformers with degree and greatness and honour and dignity’ entering the outer bab alsalam he must exclaim “o allah thou art the safety and from thee is the safety” and then passing into the mosque he should repair to the ‘black stone’ touch it with his right hand kiss it and commence his circumambulationfn19  p286“now the victims of alihram are five in number viz—  “1 the ‘victim of requisites’ when a pilgrim accidentally or willingly omits to perform a requisite such as the assumption of the pilgrim garb at the proper place this victim is a sheep sacrificed at the id alkurban in addition to the usual offeringfn20 or in lieu of it ten days’ fast—three of them in the hajj season viz on the 6th 7th and 8th days of zu’l hijjah and seven after returning home “2 the ‘victim of luxuries’ turfah such as shaving the head or using perfumes this is a sheep or a three days’ fast or alms consisting of three sa’a measures of grain distributed among six paupers “3 the ‘victim of suddenly returning to laical life’ that is to say before the proper time it is also a sheep after the sacrifice of which the pilgrim shaves his head “4 the ‘victim of killing game’ if the animal slain be one for which the tame equivalents be procurable a camel for an ostrich a cow for a wild ass or cow and a goat for a gazelle the pilgrim should sacrifice it or distribute its value or purchase with it grain for the poor or fast one day for each ‘mudd’ measure if the equivalent be not procurable the offender must buy its value of grain for almsdeeds or fast a day for every measure “5 the ‘victim of incontinence’ this offering is either a male or a female camelfn21 these failing a cow or seven sheep or the value of a camel in grain distributed to the poor or a day’s fast for each measure”  section ii—of tawaf or circumambulation  “of this ceremony there are five wajibat or requisites viz—concealing ‘the shamefn22’ as in prayer ceremonial purity of body garments and place circumambulation inside the mosque seven circuits of the house commencement of circuit from the black stone circumambulating the house with the left shoulder presented to it circuiting the house outside its shazarwan or marble basementfn23 and lastly the  p287 niyat or intention of tawaf specifying whether it be for hajj or for umrah  “of the same ceremony the principal sunnat or practices are to walk on foot to touch kiss and place his forehead upon the black stone if possible after each circuit to place the hand upon the rukn alyamani south corner but not to kiss it to pray during each circuit for what is best for man pardon of sins to quote lengthily from the koranfn24 and to often say ‘subhan allah’ and to mention none but allah to walk slowly during the first three circuits and trotting the last fourfn25 all the while maintaining a humble and contrite demeanour with downcast eyes  “the following are the prayers which have descended to us by tradition— “when touching the black stone the pilgrim saysfn26 after niyat ‘in the name of allah and allah is omnipotent o allah i do this in thy belief and in verification of thy book and in faithfulness to thy covenant and in pursuance of the example of thy prophet mohammed—may allah bless him and preserve’  “opposite the door of the house ‘o allah verily the house is thy house and the sanctuary thy sanctuary and the safeguard thy safeguard and this is the place of the fugitive to flee from hellfire’  “arrived at the rukn aliraki north corner ‘o allah verily i take refuge with thee from polytheism shirk and disobedience and hypocrisy and evil conversation and evil thoughts concerning family ahl ‘a wife’ and property and progeny’  “parallel with the mizab or rainspout ‘o allah shadow me in thy shadow that day when there is no shade but thy shadow and cause me to drink from the cup of thy prophet mohammed—may allah bless him and preserve—that pleasant draught after which is no thirst to all eternity o lord of honour and glory’ resume  p288“at the corners alshami and alyamani west and south angles ‘o allah make it an acceptable pilgrimage and the forgiveness of sins and a laudable endeavour and a pleasant action in thy sight and a store that perisheth not o thou glorious o thou pardoner’fn27  “and between the southern and eastern corners ‘o lord grant to us in this world prosperity and in the next world prosperity and save us from the punishment of fire’  “after the sevenfold circumambulation the pilgrim should recite a twobow prayer the ‘sunnat of tawaf’ behind the makam ibrahim if unable to pray there he may take any other part of the mosque these devotions are performed silently by day and aloud by night and after prayer the pilgrim should return to the black stone and kiss it”    section iii—of sai or course between mounts safa and marwah  “after performing tawaf the pilgrim should issue from the gate ‘alsafa’ or another if necessary and ascend the steps of mount safa about a man’s height from the streetfn28 there he raises the cry takbir and implores pardon for his sins he then descends and turns towards mount marwah at a slow pace arrived within six cubits of the mil alakhzar the ‘green pillar’ planted in the corner of the temple on the left hand he runs swiftly till he reaches the ‘two green pillars’ the left one of which is fixed in the corner of the temple and the other close to the dar alabbasfn29 thence he again walks slowly up to marwah and ascends it as he did safa this concludes a single course the pilgrim then starts from marwah and walks runs and walks again through the same limits till the seventh course is concluded  “there are four requisites of sai the pilgrim must pass over all the space between safa and marwah he must begin with safa and end with marwah he must traverse the distance seven times and he must perform the rite after some important tawaf as that of arrival or that of return from arafat  “the practices of sai are briefly to walk if possible to  p289 be in a state of ceremonial purity to quote lengthily from the koran and to be abundant in praise of allah  “the prayer of sai is ‘o my lord pardon and pity and pass over that sin which thou knowest verily thou knowest what is not known and verily thou art the most glorious the most generous o our lord grant us in this world prosperity and in the future prosperity and save us from the punishment of fire  “when sai is concluded the pilgrim if performing only umrah shaves his head or clips his hair and becomes ‘muhill’ returning to the moslem’s normal state if he purpose hajj or pilgrimage after umrah he reassumes the ihram and if he be engaged in pilgrimage he continues ‘muhrim’ ie in ihram as before”  section iv—of wukuf or standing upon mount arafat  “the days of pilgrimage are three in number namely the 8th the 9th and the 10th of the month zu’l hijjahfn30  “on the first day 8th called yaum altarwiyah the pilgrim should start from meccah after the dawnprayer and sunrise perform his noontide afternoon and evening devotions at muna where it is a sunnat that he should sleepfn31  p290“on the second day 9th the ‘yaum arafat’ after performing the early prayer at ‘ghalas’ ie when a man cannot see his neighbour’s face on mount sabir near muna the pilgrim should start when the sun is risen proceed to the ‘mountain of mercy’ encamp there and after performing the noontide and afternoon devotions at masjid ibrahimfn32 joining and shortening themfn33 he should take his station upon the mountain which is all standing ground but the best position is that preferred by the prophet near the great rocks lying at the lower slope of arafat he must be present at the sermonfn34 and be abundant in talbiyat supplication tahlil recitations of the chapter ‘say he is the one god’fn35 and weeping for that is the place for the outpouring of tears there he should stay till sunset and then decamp and return hastily to muzdalifah where he should pass a portion of the nightfn36 after a visit to the mosque ‘mashr alharim’ he should collect seven pebbles and proceed to munafn37  “yaum alnahr the third day of the pilgrimage 10th zu’l hijjah is the great festival of the moslem year amongst  p291 its many namesfn38 ‘id alkurban’ is the best known as expressive of ibrahim’s sacrifice in lieu of ismail most pilgrims after casting stones at the akabah or ‘great devil’ hurry to meccah some enter the ka’abah whilst others content themselves with performing the tawaf alifazah or circumambulation of impetuosity round the housefn39 the pilgrim should then return to muna sacrifice a sheep and sleep there strictly speaking this day concludes the pilgrimage  ‘the second set of ‘trois jours’ namely the 11thfn40 the 12th and the 13th of zu’l hijjah are called ayyam altashrik or the ‘days of drying flesh in the sun’ the pilgrim should spend that time at munafn41 and each day throw seven pebbles at each of the three pillarsfn42  “when throwing the stones it is desirable that the pilgrim should cast them far from himself although he is allowed to place them upon the pillar the act also should be performed after the zawal or declension of the sun the pilgrim should begin with the pillar near the masjid alkhayf proceed to the wusta or central column and end with the akabah if unable to cast the stones during the daytime he is allowed to do it at night  “the ‘throwing’ over—the pilgrim returns to meccah and when his journey is fixed performs the tawaf alwida’a ‘of farewell’ on this occasion it is a sunnat to drink the waters of zemzem to enter the temple with more than usual  p292 respect and reverence and bidding it adieu to depart from the holy city  “the moslem is especially forbidden to take with him cakes made of the earth or dust of the harim and similar mementoes as they savour of idolatry”  chapter ii—of umrah or the little pilgrimage  “the word ‘umrah’ denotes a pilgrimage performed at any time except the pilgrim season the 8th 9th and 10th of zu’l hijjah  “the arkan or pillars upon which the umrah rite rests are five in number viz—  “1 alihram “2 altawaf “3 alsai between safa and marwah “4 alhalk tonsure or altaksir cutting the hair “5 altartib or the due order of ceremonies as above enumeratedfn43 “the wajibat or requisites of umrah are but two in number—  “1 alihram or assuming the pilgrim garb from the mikat or fixed limit and “2 the avoiding of all things forbidden to the pilgrim when in state of ihram  “in the sunnat and mustahabb portions of the ceremony there is no difference between umrah and hajj”  chapter iii—of ziyarat or the visit to the prophet’s tomb  “alziyarat is a practice of the faith and the most effectual way of drawing near to allah through his prophet mohammed  “as the zair arrives at almadinah when his eyes fall upon the trees of the city he must bless the prophet with a loud voice then he should enter the mosque and sit in the holy garden which is between the pulpit and the tomb and pray a twobow prayer in honour of the masjid after this he should supplicate pardon for his sins then approaching  p293 the sepulchre and standing four cubits away from it recite this prayer—  “‘peace be with thee o thou th and ysfn44 peace be with thee and upon thy descendants and thy companions one and all and upon all the prophets and those inspired to instruct mankind and i bear witness that thou hast delivered thy message and performed thy trust and advised thy followers and swept away darkness and fought in allah’s path the good fight may allah requite thee from us the best with which he ever requited prophet from his followers’  “let the visitor stand the while before the tomb with respect and reverence and singleness of mind and fear and awe after which let him retreat one cubit and salute abu bakr the truthful in these words—  “‘peace be with thee o caliph of allah’s prophet over his people and aider in the defence of his faith’  “after this again retreating another cubit let him bless in the same way omar the just after which returning to his former station opposite the prophet’s tomb he should implore intercession for himself and for all dearest to him he should not neglect to visit the bakia cemetery and the kuba mosque where he should pray for himself and for his brethren of the muslimin and the muslimat the muminin and the muminatfn45 the quick of them and the dead when ready to depart let the zair take leave of the mosque with a twobow prayer and visit the tomb and salute it and again beg intercession for himself and for those he loves and the zair is forbidden to circumambulate the tomb or to carry away the cakes of clay made by the ignorant with the earth and dust of the harim”  fn1 m huc’s “travels in tartary” fn2 the two extremes between which lie many gradations are these abu hanifah directs every moslem and moslemah to perform the pilgrimage if they have health and money for the road and for the support of their families moreover he allows a deputypilgrim whose expenses must be paid by the principal ibn malik on the contrary enjoins every follower to visit meccah if able to walk and to earn his bread on the way as a general rule in alislam there are four shurut alwujub or necessary conditions viz— 1 islam the being a moslem 2 bulugh adolescence 3 hurriyat the being a free man 4 akl or mental sanity other authorities increase the conditions to eight viz— 5 wujud alzad sufficiency of provision 6 alrahlah having a beast of burthen if living two days’ journey from meccah 7 takhliyat altarik the road being open and 8 imkan almasir the being able to walk two stages if the pilgrim hath no beast others again include all conditions under two heads— 1 sihhat health 2 istita’at ability these subjects have exercised not a little the casuistic talents of the arab doctors a folio volume might be filled with differences of opinion on the subject “is a blind man sound” fn3 the technical meaning of these words will be explained below fn4 at any other time of the year ihram is considered makruh or objectionable without being absolutely sinful fn5 in other books the following directions are given to the intended pilgrim—before leaving home he must pray two prostrations concluding the orisons with a long supplication and blessings upon relatives friends and neighbours and he must distribute not fewer than seven silver pieces to the poor the day should be either a thursday or a saturday some however say  “allah hath honoured the monday and the thursday”  if possible the first of the month should be chosen and the hour early dawn moreover the pilgrim should not start without a rafik or companion who should be a pious as well as a travelled man the other mukaddamat alsafar or preambles to journeying are the following istikharah consulting the rosary and friends khulus alniyat vowing pilgrimage to the lord not for lucre or revenge settling worldly affairs paying debts drawing up a will and making arrangements for the support of one’s family hiring animals from a pious person the best monture is a camel because preferred by the prophet an ass is not commendable a man should not walk if he can afford to ride and the palanquin or litter is according to some doctors limited to invalids reciting long prayers when mounting halting dismounting and at nightfall on hills the takbir should be used the tasbih is properest for vales and plains and meccah should be blessed when first sighted avoiding abuse curses or quarrels sleeping like the prophet namely in early night when prayerhour is distant with “iftirash” or lying at length with the right cheek on the palm of the dexter hand and near dawn with “ittaka” ie propping the head upon the hand with the arm resting upon the elbow and lastly travelling with collyriumpot lookingglass and comb needle and thread for sewing scissors and toothstick staff and razor fn6 in the shafe’i school there is little difference between alfarz and alwajib in the hanafi the former is a superior obligation to the latter fn7 the hanafi maliki and even some shafe’i doctors reduce the number from six to four viz— 1 ihram with “niyat”    2 tawaf 3 wukuf 4 sai fn8 the ifazah is the impetuous descent from mount arafat its tawaf generally called tawaf alziyarat less commonly tawaf alsadr or tawaf alnuzul is that performed immediately after throwing the stones and resuming the laical dress on the victimday at mount muna fn9 shaving is better for men cutting for women a razor must be passed over the bald head but it is sufficient to burn pluck shave or clip three hairs when the chevelure is long fn10 the known mikat are north zu’l halifah northeast karn almanazil northwest aljuhfah arabic south yalamlam east zat irk fn11 this tawaf is described in chapter v fn12 generally speaking as will afterwards be shown the pilgrims pass straight through muzdalifah and spend the night at muna fn13 the “tawaf alwida’a” is considered a solemn occasion the pilgrim first performs circumambulation he drinks the waters of zemzem kisses the ka’abah threshold and stands for some time with his face and body pressed against the multazem there on clinging to the curtain of the ka’abah he performs takbir tahlil tahmid and blesses the prophet weeping if possible but certainly groaning he then leaves the mosque backing out of it with tears and lamentations till he reaches the “bab alwida’a” whence with a parting glance at the bayt ullah he wends his way home fn14 see chapter v fn15 many pronounce this niyat if intending to perform pilgrimage the devotee standing before prayer says “i vow this intention of hajj to allah the most high” fn16 in spite of this interdiction pilgrims generally for convenience knot their shoulderclothes under the right arm fn17 hunting killing or maiming beasts in sanctuary land and cutting down trees are acts equally forbidden to the muhrim and the muhill the moslem in his normal state for a large tree a camel for a small one a sheep must be sacrificed fn18 see chapter v after the “talbiyat” the pilgrim should bless the prophet and beg from allah paradise and protection from hell saying “o allah by thy mercy spare us from the pains of hellfire” fn19 most of these injunctions are “meritorious” and may therefore be omitted without prejudice to the ceremony fn20 namely the victim sacrificed on the great festival day at muna fn21 so the commentators explain “badanah” fn22 a man’s “aurat” is from the navel to the knee in the case of a free woman the whole of her face and person are “shame” fn23 if the pilgrim place but his hand upon the shazarwan or on the hijr the tawaf is nullified fn24 this is a purely shafe’i practice the hanafi school rejects it on the grounds that the word of god should not be repeated when walking or running fn25 the reader will observe chapter v that the mutawwif made me reverse this order of things fn26 it is better to recite these prayers mentally but as few pilgrims know them by heart they are obliged to repeat the words of the cicerone fn27 this portion is to be recited twice fn28 a woman or a hermaphrodite is enjoined to stand below the steps and in the street fn29 women and hermaphrodites should not run here but walk the whole way i have frequently however seen the former imitating the men fn30 the arab legend is that the angels asking the almighty why ibrahim was called alkhalil or god’s friend they were told that all his thoughts were fixed on heaven and when they called to mind that he had a wife and child allah convinced them of the patriarch’s sanctity by a trial one night ibrahim saw in a vision a speaker who said to him “allah orders thee to draw near him with a victim” he awoke and not comprehending the scope of the dream took especial notice of it arabic hence the first day of pilgrimage is called yaum altarwiyah the same speaker visited him on the next night saying “sacrifice what is dearest to thee” from the patriarch’s knowing arabic what the first vision meant the second day is called yaum arafat on the third night he was ordered to sacrifice ismail hence that day is called yaum nahr of “throatcutting” the english reader will bear in mind that the moslem day begins at sunset i believe that the origin of “tarwiyat” which may mean “carrying water” dates from the time of pagan arabs who spent that day in providing themselves with the necessary yaum arafat derives its name from the hill and yaum alnahr from the victims offered to the idols in the muna valley fn31 the present generation of pilgrims finding the delay inconvenient always pass on to arafat without halting and generally arrive at the mountain late in the afternoon of the 8th that is to say the first day of pilgrimage consequently they pray the morning prayer of the 9th at arafat fn32 this place will be described afterwards fn33 the shafe’i when engaged on a journey which takes up a night and day is allowed to shorten his prayers and to “join” the noon with the afternoon and the evening with the night devotions thus reducing the number of times from five to three per diem the hanafi school allows this on one day and on one occasion only namely on the ninth of zu’l hijjah arriving at muzdalifah when at the “isha” hour it prays the maghrib and the isha prayers together fn34 if the pilgrim be too late for the sermon his labour is irretrievably lost—m caussin de perceval vol iii pp 301305 makes the prophet to have preached from his camel alkaswa on a platform at mount arafat before noon and to have again addressed the people after the postmeridian prayers at the station alsakharat mohammed’s last pilgrimage called by moslems hajjat albilagh “of perfection” as completing the faith hajjat alislam or hajjat alwida’a “of farewell” is minutely described by historians as the type and pattern of pilgrimage to all generations fn35 ibn abbas relates a tradition that whoever recites this short chapter 11000 times on the arafat day shall obtain from allah all he desires fn36 most schools prefer to sleep as the prophet did at muzdalifah pray the night devotions there and when the yellowness of the next dawn appears collect the seven pebbles and proceed to muna the shafe’i however generally leave muzdalifah about midnight fn37 these places will be minutely described in a future chapter fn38 id alkurban or the festival of victims known to the turks as kurban bayram to the indians as bakarid the kine fete id alzuha “of forenoon” or id alazha “of serene night” the day is called yaum alnahr “of throatcutting” fn39 if the ceremony of “sai” has not been performed by the pilgrim after the circuit of arrival he generally proceeds to it on this occasion fn40 this day is known in books as “yaum alkarr” because the pilgrims pass it in repose at muna fn41 “the days of drying flesh” because at this period pilgrims prepare provisions for their return by cutting up their victims and exposing to the sun large slices slung upon long lines of cord the schools have introduced many modifications into the ceremonies of these three days some spend the whole time at muna and return to meccah on the morning of the 13th others return on the 12th especially when that day happens to fall upon a friday fn42 as will afterwards appear the number of stones and the way of throwing them vary greatly in the various schools fn43 the difference in the pillars of umrah and hajj is that in the former the standing on arafat and the tawaf alifazah are necessarily omitted fn44 the 20th and 36th chapters of the koran fn45 these second words are the feminines of the first they prove that the moslem is not above praying for what europe supposed he did not believe in namely the souls of women  p294 appendix ii  the bayt ullah  the house of allahfn1 has been so fully described by my predecessors that there is little inducement to attempt a new portrait readers however may desire a view of the great sanctuary and indeed without a plan and its explanation the ceremonies of the harim would be scarcely intelligible i will do homage to the memory of the accurate burckhardt and extract from his pages a description which shall be illustrated by a few notes  “the kaabah stands in an oblong square enclosed by a great wall 250 paces long and 200 broadfn2 none of the sides of which runs quite in a straight line though at first sight the whole appears to be of a regular shape this open square is enclosed on the eastern side by a colonnade the pillars stand in a quadruple row they are three deep on the other sides and are united by pointed arches every four of which support a small dome plastered and whitened on the outside these domes according to kotobeddyn are 152 in numberfn3 the  p295 pillars are above twenty feet in height and generally from one foot and a half to one foot and three quarters in diameter but little regularity has been observed in regard to them some are of white marble granite or porphyry but the greater number are of common stone of the meccah mountainsfn4 el fasy states the whole at 589 and says they are all of marble excepting 126 which are of common stone and three of composition kotobeddyn reckons 555 of which according to him 311 are of marble and the rest of the stone taken from the neighbouring mountains but neither of these authors lived to see the latest repairs of the mosque after the destruction occasioned by a torrent in ad 1626fn5 between every three or four column stands an octagonal one about four feet in thickness on the east side are two shafts of reddish grey granite in one piece and one fine grey porphyry with slabs of white feldspath on the north side is one red granite column and one of finegrained red porphyry these are probably the columns which kotobeddyn states to have been brought from egypt and  p296 principally from akhmim panopolis when the chief caliph el mohdy enlarged the mosque in ah 163 among the 450 or 500 columns which form the enclosure i found not any two capitals or bases exactly alike the capitals are of coarse saracen workmanship some of them which had served for former buildings by the ignorance of the workmen have been placed upside down upon the shafts i observed about half a dozen marble bases of good grecian workmanship a few of the marble columns bear arabic or cufic inscriptions in which i read the dates 863 and 762 ahfn6 a column on the east side exhibits a very ancient cufic inscription somewhat defaced which i could neither read nor copy some of the columns are strengthened with broad iron rings or bandsfn7 as in many other saracen buildings of the east they were first employed by ibn dhaher berkouk king of egypt in rebuilding the mosque which had been destroyed by fire in ah 802fn8”  “some parts of the walls and arches are gaudily painted in stripes of yellow red and blue as are also the minarets paintings of flowers in the usual muselman  p297 style are nowhere seen the floors of the colonnades are paved with large stones badly cemented together”  “some paved causeways lead from the colonnades towards the kaabah or holy house in the centrefn9 they are of sufficient breadth to admit four or five persons to walk abreast and they are elevated about nine inches above the ground between these causeways which are covered with fine gravel or sand grass appears growing in several places produced by the zem zem water oozing out of the jars which are placed in the ground in long rows during the dayfn10 there is a descent of eight or ten steps from the gates on the north side into the platform of the colonnade and of three or four steps from the gates on the south side”  “towards the middle of this area stands the kaabah it is 115 paces from the north colonnade and 88 from the south for this want of symmetry we may readily account the kaabah having existed prior to the mosque which was built around it and enlarged at different periods the kaabah is an oblong massive structure 18 paces in length 14 in breadth and from 35 to 40 feet in heightfn11 it is constructed of the grey mekka stone in large blocks of different sizes joined together in a very  p298 rough manner with bad cementfn12 it was entirely rebuilt as it now stands in ad 1627 the torrent in the preceding year had thrown down three of its sides and preparatory to its reerection the fourth side was according to asamy pulled down after the olemas or learned divines had been consulted on the question whether mortals might be permitted to destroy any part of the holy edifice without incurring the charge of sacrilege and infidelity”  “the kaabah stands upon a base two feet in height which presents a sharp inclined planefn13 its roof being flat it has at a distance the appearance of a perfect cubefn14 the only door which affords entrance and which is opened but two or three times in the yearfn15 is on the  p299 north side and about seven feet above the groundfn16 in the first periods of islam however when it was rebuilt in ah 64 by ibn zebeyr zubayr chief of mecca it had two doors even with the ground floor of the mosquefn17  p300 the present door which according to azraky was brought hither from constantinople in ad 1633 is wholly coated with silver and has several gilt ornaments upon its threshold are placed every night various small lighted wax candles and perfuming pans filled with musk aloewood cfn18”  “at the northeastfn19 corner of the kaabah near the door is the famous ‘black stone’fn20 it forms a part of the for p301 see footnote 20  p302 sharp angle of the buildingfn21 at four or five feet above the groundfn22 it is an irregular oval about seven inches in diameter with an undulating surface composed of about a dozen smaller stones of different sizes and shapes well joined together with a small quantity of cement and perfectly well smoothed it looks as if the whole had been broken into many pieces by a violent blow and then united again it is very difficult to determine accurately the quality of this stone which has been worn to its present surface by the million touches and kisses it has received it appeared to me like a lava containing several small extraneous particles of a whitish and of a yellowish substance its colour is now a deep reddish brown approaching to black it is surrounded on all sides by a border composed of a substance which i took to be a close cement  p303 of pitch and gravel of a similar but not quite the same brownish colourfn23 this border serves to support its detached pieces it is two or three inches in breadth and rises a little above the surface of the stone both the border and the stone itself are encircled by a silver bandfn24 broader below than above and on the two sides with a considerable swelling below as if a part of the stone were hidden under it the lower part of the border is studded with silver nails”  “in the southeast corner of the kaabahfn25 or as the arab call it rokn alyemany there is another stone about five feet from the ground it is one foot and a half in length and two inches in breadth placed upright and of the common meccah stone this the people walking round the kaabah touch only with the right hand they do not kiss itfn26”  p304 “on the north side of the kaabah just by its doorfn27 and close to the wall is a slight hollow in the ground lined with marble and sufficiently large to admit of three persons sitting here it is thought meritorious to pray the spot is called el maajan and supposed to be where abraham and his son ismail kneaded the chalk and mud which they used in building the kaabah and near this maajan the former is said to have placed the large stone upon which he stood while working at the masonry on the basis of the kaabah just over the maajan is an ancient cufic inscription but this i was unable to decipher and had no opportunity of copying it”  “on the west northwest side of the kaabah about two feet below its summit is the famous myzab or waterspoutfn28 through which the rainwater collected on the roof of the building is discharged so as to fall upon the ground it is about four feet in length and six inches in breadth as well as i could judge from below with borders equal in height to its breadth at the  p305 mouth hangs what is called the beard of the myzab a gilt board over which the water flows this spout was sent hither from constantinople in ah 981 and is reported to be of pure gold the pavement round the kaabah below the myzab was laid down in ah 826 and consists of various coloured stones forming a very handsome specimen of mosaic there are two large slabs of fine verdi anticofn29 in the centre which according to makrizi were sent thither as presents from cairo in ah 241 this is the spot where according to mohammedan tradition ismayl the son of ibrahim and his mother hajirah are buried and here it is meritorious for the pilgrim to recite a prayer of two rikats on this side is a semicircular wall the two extremities of which are in a line with the sides of the kaabah and distant from it three or four feetfn30 leaving an opening which leads to the burialplace of ismayl the wall bears the name of el hatymfn31 and the area  p306 which it encloses is called hedjer or hedjer ismaylfn32 on account of its being separated from the kaabah the wall itself also is sometimes so called”  “tradition says that the kaabah once extended as far as the hatym and that this side having fallen down just at the time of the hadj the expenses of repairing it were demanded from the pilgrims under a pretence that the revenues of government were not acquired in a manner sufficiently pure to admit of their application towards a purpose so sacred the sum however obtained proved very inadequate all that could be done therefore was to raise a wall which marked the space formerly occupied by the kaabah this tradition although current among the metowefs cicerones is at variance with history which declares that the hedjer was built by the beni koreish who contracted the dimensions of the kaabah that it was united to the building by hadjadjfn33 and again separated from it by ibn zebeyr it is asserted by fasy that a part of the hedjer as it now stands was never comprehended within the kaabah the law regards it as a portion of the kaabah inasmuch as it is esteemed equally meritorious to pray in the hedjer as in the kaabah itself and the pilgrims who have not an opportunity of entering the latter are permitted to affirm upon oath that they have prayed in the kaabah although they have only prostrated themselves within the enclosure of the hatym the wall is built of solid stone about five feet in height and four in thickness cased all over with white marble and inscribed with prayers and invocations p307 neatly sculptured upon the stone in modern charactersfn34 these and the casing are the work of el ghoury the egyptian sultan in ah 917 the walk round the kaabah is performed on the outside of the wall—the nearer to it the better”  “round the kaabah is a good pavement of marblefn35 about eight inches below the level of the great square it was laid in ah 981 by order of the sultan and describes an irregular oval it is surrounded by thirtytwo slender gilt pillars or rather poles between every two of which are suspended seven glass lamps always lighted after sunsetfn36 beyond the poles is a second pavement about eight paces broad somewhat elevated above the first but of coarser work then another six inches higher and eighteen paces broad upon which stand several small buildings beyond this is the gravelled ground so that two broad steps may be said to lead from the square down to the kaabah the small buildings just mentioned which surround the kaabah are the five makamsfn37 with the well  p308 of zem zem the arch called bab es salam and the mambar”  “opposite the four sides of the kaabah stand four other small buildings where the imaums of the orthodox mohammedan sects the hanefy shafey hanbaly and maleky take their station and guide the congregation in their prayers the makam el maleky on the south and that of hanbaly opposite the black stone are small pavilions open on all sides and supported by four slender pillars with a light sloping roof terminating in a point exactly in the style of indian pagodasfn38 the makam el hanafy which is the largest being fifteen paces by eight is open on all sides and supported by twelve small pillars it has an upper story also open where the mueddin who calls to prayers takes his stand this was built in ah 923 by sultan selim i it was afterwards rebuilt by khoshgeldy governor of djidda in 947 but all the four makams as they now stand were built in ah 1074 the makames’shafey is over the well zem zem to which it serves as an upper chamberfn39”  “near their respective makams the adherents of the four different sects seat themselves for prayers during my stay at meccah the hanefys always began their prayer first but according to muselman custom the shafeys should pray first in the mosque then the hanefys malekys and hanbalys the prayer of the maghreb is an exception which they are all enjoined to utter togetherfn40  p309 the makam el hanbaly is the place where the officers of government and other great people are seated during prayers here the pasha and the sheriff are placed and in their absence the eunuchs of the temple these fill the space under this makam in front and behind it the female hadjys who visit the temple have their places assigned to which they repair principally for the two evening prayers few of them being seen in the mosque at the three other daily prayers they also perform the towaf or walk round the kaabah but generally at night though it is not uncommon to see them walking in the daytime among the men”  “the present building which encloses zem zem stands close by the makam hanbaly and was erected in ah 1072 it is of a square shape and of massive construction with an entrance to the northfn41 opening into the room which contains the well this room is beautifully ornamented with marbles of various colours and adjoining to it but having a separate door is a small room with a stone reservoir which is always full of zem zem water this the hadjys get to drink by passing their hand with a cup through an iron grated opening which serves as a window into the reservoir without entering the room the mouth of the well is surrounded by a wall five feet in height and about ten feet in diameter upon this the people stand who draw up the water in leathern buckets an iron railing being so placed as to p310 prevent their falling in in el fasy’s time there were eight marble basins in this room for the purpose of ablution”  “on the northeast southeast side of zem zem stand two small buildings one behind the otherfn42 called el kobbateyn they are covered by domes painted in the same manner as the mosque and in them are kept waterjars lamps carpets mats brooms and other articles used in the very mosquefn43 these two ugly buildings are injurious to the interior appearance of the building their heavy forms and structure being very disadvantageously contrasted with the light and airy shape of the makams i heard some hadjys from greece men of better taste than the arabs express their regret that the kobbateyn should be allowed to disfigure the mosque they were built by khoshgeldy governor of djidda ah 947 one is called kobbet el abbas from having been placed on the site of a small tank said to have been formed by abbas the uncle of mohammed”  p311 “a few paces west northwest of zem zem and directly opposite to the door of the kaabah stands a ladder or staircasefn44 which is moved up to the wall of the kaabah on days when that building is opened and by which the visitors ascend to the door it is of wood with some carved ornaments moves on low wheels and is sufficiently broad to admit of four persons ascending abreast the first ladder was sent hither from cairo in ah 818 by moyaed abou el naser king of egypt”  “in the same line with the ladder and close by it stands a lightly built insulated and circular arch about fifteen feet wide and eighteen feet high called bab es’ salam which must not be confounded with the great gate of the mosque bearing the same name those who enter the bait ullah for the first time are enjoined to do so by the outer and inner babessalam in passing under the latter they are to exclaim ‘o god may it be a happy entrance’ i do not know by whom this arch was built but it appears to be modernfn45”  “nearly in front of the babessalam and nearer the kaabah than any of the other surrounding buildings stands the makam ibrahimfn46 this is a small building supported by six pillars about eight feet high four of which are surrounded from top to bottom by a fine iron railing while they leave the space beyond the two hind pillars open within the railing is a frame about five feet square terminating in a pyramidal top and said to contain the sacred stone upon which ibrahim stood when he built the kaabah and which with the help of his son ismayl he had removed from hence to the place  p312 called maajen already mentioned the stone is said to have yielded under the weight of the patriarch and to preserve the impression of his foot still visible upon it but no hadjy has ever seen itfn47 as the frame is always entirely covered with a brocade of red silk richly embroidered persons are constantly seen before the railing invoking the good offices of ibrahim and a short prayer must be uttered by the side of the makam after the walk round the kaabah is completed it is said that many of the sahaba or first adherents of mohammed were interred in the open space between this makam and zem zemfn48 from which circumstance it is one of the most  p313 favourite places of prayers in the mosque in this part of the area the khalif soleyman ibn abd el melek brother of wolyd alwalid built a fine reservoir in ah 97 which was filled from a spring east of arafatfn49 but the mekkawys destroyed it after his death on the pretence that the water of zem zem was preferable”  “on the side of makam ibrahim facing the middle part of the front of the kaabah stands the mambar or pulpit of the mosque it is elegantly formed of fine white marble with many sculptured ornaments and was sent as a present to the mosque in ah 969 by sultan soleyman ibn selymfn50 a straight narrow staircase leads up to the post of the khatyb or preacher which is surmounted by a gilt polygonal pointed steeple resembling an obelisk here a sermon is preached on fridays and on certain festivals these like the friday sermons of all mosques in the mohammedan countries are usually of the same turn with some slight alterations upon extraordinary occasionsfn51”  “i have now described all the buildings within the inclosure of the temple”  “the gates of the mosque are nineteen in number and are distributed about it without any order or symmetryfn52”  burckhardt’s description of the gates is short and  p314 imperfect on the eastern side of the mosque there are  p315 four principal entrances seven on the southern side three in the western and five in the northern wall  the eastern gates are the greater bab alsalam through which the pilgrim enters the mosque it is close to the northeast angle next to it the lesser bab alsalam with two small arches thirdly the bab alnabi where the prophet used to pass through from khadijah’s house and lastly near the southeast corner the bab ali or of the benu hashim opening upon the street between safa and marwah  beyond the northeastern corner in the northern wall is the bab duraybah a small entrance with one arch next to it almost fronting the ka’abah is the grand adit “bab alziyadah” also known as bab alnadwah here the colonnade projecting far beyond the normal line forms a small square or hall supported by pillars and a false colonnade of sixtyone columns leads to the true cloister of the mosque this portion of the building being cool and shady is crowded by the poor the diseased and the dying during divine worship and at other times by idlers schoolboys and merchants passing through three external arches pilgrims descend by a flight of steps into the hall where they deposit their slippers it not being considered decorous to hold them when circumambulating the ka’abahfn53 a broad pavement in the shape of an irregular triangle whose base is the cloister leads to the circuit of the house next to the ziyadah gate is a small singlearched entrance “bab kutubi” and beyond it one similar the bab alajlah arabic also named albasitiyah from its proximity to the college of abd al basitah close to the northwest angle of the cloister is the bab alnadwah anciently called bab alumrah and now bab  p316 alatik the old gate near this place and opening into the ka’abah stood the “town hall” dar alnadwah built by kusay for containing the oriflamme “alliwa” and as a councilchamber for the ancients of the cityfn54  in the western wall are three entrances the singlearched gate nearest to the north angle is called bab benu saham or bab alumrah because pilgrims pass through it to the tanim and to the ceremony alumrah little pilgrimage in the centre of the wall is the bab ibrahim or bab alkhayyatin the tailors’ gate a single arch leading into a large projecting square like that of the ziyadah entrance but somewhat smaller near the southwest corner is a double arched adit the bab alwida’a “of farewell” hence departing pilgrims issue forth from the temple  at the western end of the southern wall is the twoarched bab umm hani so called after the lady’s residence when included in the mosque next to it is a similar building “bab ujlan” arabic which derives its name from the large college “madrasat ujlan” some call it bab alsharif because it is opposite one of the palaces after which and also pierced with two arches is the bab aljiyad some erroneously spell it aljihad “of war” the gate leading to jabal jiyad the next is double arched and called the bab almujahid or alrahmah “of mercy” nearly opposite the ka’abah and connected with the pavement by a raised line of stone is the bab alsafa through which pilgrims now issue to perform the ceremony “alsai” it is a small and unconspicuous erection next to it is the bab albaghlah with two arches and close to the southeast angle of the mosque the bab yunus alias bab bazan alias bab alzayt alias bab alasharah “of the ten” because a favourite with the first ten sahabah or companions p317 of the prophet “most of these gates” says burckhardt “have high pointed arches but a few round arches are seen among them which like all arches of this kind in the hejaz are nearly semicircular they are without ornament except the inscription on the exterior which commemorates the name of the builder and they are all posterior in date to the fourteenth century as each gate consists of two or three arches or divisions separated by narrow walls these divisions are counted in the enumeration of the gates leading into the kaabah and they make up the number thirtynine there being no doors to the gates the mosque is consequently open at all times i have crossed at every hour of the night and always found people there either at prayers or walking aboutfn55”  “the outside walls of the mosques are those of the houses which surround it on all sides these houses belonged originally to the mosque the greater part are now the property of individuals they are let out to the richest hadjys at very high prices as much as 500 piastres being given during the pilgrimage for a good apartment with windows opening into the mosquefn56 windows have in consequence been opened in many parts of the walls on a level with the street and above that of the floor of the colonnades hadjys living in these apartments are allowed to perform the friday’s prayers at home because having the kaabah in view from the windows they are supposed to be in the mosque itself and to join in prayer those assembled within the  p318 temple upon a level with the ground floor of the colonnades and opening into them are small apartments formed in the walls having the appearance of dungeons these have remained the property of the mosque while the houses above them belong to private individuals they are let out to watermen who deposit in them the zem zem jars or to less opulent hadjys who wish to live in the mosquefn57 some of the surrounding houses still belong to the mosque and were originally intended for public schools as their names of medresa implies they are now all let out to hadjys”  “the exterior of the mosque is adorned with seven minarets irregularly distributed—1 minaret of bab el omra umrah 2 of bab el salam 3 of bab aly 4 of bab el wodaa wida’a 5 of medesa kail kait bey 6 of bab el zyadi 7 of medreset sultan soleymanfn58 they are quadrangular or round

about the meccan temple the naib alharim or viceintendant is one sayyid ali said to be of indian extraction he is superior to all the attendants there are about eighty eunuchs whose chief sarur agha was a slave of mohammed ali pasha their pay varies from 100 to 1000 piastres per mensem it is however inferior to the madinah salaries the imams mu’ezzins khatibs zemzemis c c are under their respective shaykhs who are of the olemafn61  briefly to relate the history of the ka’abah  the “house of allah” is supposed to have been built and rebuilt ten times  1 the first origin of the idea is manifestly a symbolical allusion to the angels standing before the almighty and praising his name when allah it is said informed the celestial throng that he was about to send a viceregent on earth they deprecated the design being reproved with these words “god knoweth what ye know not” and dreading the eternal anger they compassed the arsh or throne in adoration upon this allah created the bayt alma’amur four jasper pillars with a ruby roof  p320 and the angels circumambulated it crying “praise to allah and exalted be allah and there is no ilah but allah and allah is omnipotent” the creator then ordered them to build a similar house for man on earth this according to ali took place 40 according to abu hurayrah 2000 years before the creation both authorities however are agreed that the firmaments were spread above and the seven earths beneath this bayt alma’amur  2 there is considerable contradiction concerning the second house ka’ab related that allah sent down with adamfn62 a khaymah or tabernacle of hollow ruby which the angels raised on stone pillars this was also called bayt alma’amur adam received an order to compass it about after which he begged a reward for obedience and was promised a pardon to himself and to all his progeny who repent  others declare that adam expelled from paradise and lamenting that he no longer heard the prayers of the angels was ordered by allah to take the stones of five hills lebanon sinai tur zayt olivet ararat and hira which afforded the first stone gabriel smiting his wing upon earth opened a foundation to the seventh layer and the position of the building is exactly below the heavenly bayt alma’amur—a moslem corruption of the legends concerning the heavenly and the earthly jerusalem our first father circumambulated it as he had seen the angels do and was by them taught the formula of prayer and the number of circuits  according to others again this second house was not erected till after the “angelic foundation” was destroyed by time  3 the history of the third house is also somewhat  p321 confused when the bayt alma’amur or as others say the tabernacle was removed to heaven after adam’s death a stoneandmud building was placed in its stead by his son shays seth for this reason it is respected by the sabaeans or christians of st john as well as by the moslems this ka’abah according to some was destroyed by the deluge which materially altered its site others believe that it was raised to heaven others again declare that only the pillars supporting the heavenly tabernacle were allowed to remain most authorities agree in asserting that the black stone was stored up in abu kubays whence that “first created of mountains” is called alamin “the honest”  4 abraham and his son were ordered to build the fourth house upon the old foundations its materials according to some were taken from the five hills which supplied the second others give the names ohod kuds warka sinai hira and a sixth abu kubays it was of irregular shape 32 cubits from the eastern to the northern corner 32 from north to west 31 from west to south 20 from south to east and only 9 cubits high there was no roof two doors level with the ground were pierced in the eastern and western walls and inside on the right hand near the present entrance a hole for treasure was dug gabriel restored the black stone which abraham by his direction placed in its present corner as a sign where circumambulation is to begin and the patriarch then learned all the complicated rites of pilgrimage when this house was completed abraham by allah’s order ascended jabal sabir and called the world to visit the sanctified spot and all earth’s sons heard him even those “in their father’s loins or in their mother’s womb from that day unto the day of resurrection”  5 the amalikah descended from imlik great grandson of sam son of noah who first settled near meccah founded the fifth house altabari and the moslem  p322 historians generally made the erection of the amalikah to precede that of the jurham these according to others repaired the house which abraham built  6 the sixth ka’abah was built about the beginning of the christian era by the benu jurham the children of kahtan fifth descendant from noah ismail married according to the moslems a daughter of this tribe da’alah bint muzaz arabic bin omar and abandoning hebrew he began to speak arabic ta arraba hence his descendants are called arabicized arabs after ismail’s death which happened when he was 130 years old sabit the eldest of his twelve sons became “lord of the house” he was succeeded by his maternal grandfather muzaz and afterwards by his children the jurham inhabited the higher parts of meccah especially jabal ka’aka’an so called from their clashing arms whereas the amalikah dwelt in the lower grounds which obtained the name of jiyad from their generous horses  7 kusay bin kilab governor of meccah and fifth forefather of the prophet built the seventh house according to abraham’s plan he roofed it over with palm leaves stocked it with idols and persuaded his tribe to settle near the harim  8 kusay’s house was burnt down by a woman’s censer which accidentally set fire to the kiswah or covering and the walls were destroyed by a torrent a merchantship belonging to a greek trader called “bakum” arabic being wrecked at jeddah afforded material for the roof and the crew were employed as masons the kuraysh tribe who rebuilt the house failing in funds of pure money curtailed its proportions by nearly seven cubits and called the omitted portion alhatim in digging the foundation they came to a green stone like a camel’s hunch which struck with a pickaxe sent forth blinding lightning and prevented further excavation the kuraysh amongst other alterations raised the walls  p323 from nine to eighteen cubits built a staircase in the northern breadth closed the western door and placed the eastern entrance above the ground to prevent men entering without their leave  when the eighth house was being built mohammed was in his twentyfifth year his surname of alamin the honest probably induced the tribes to make him their umpire for the decision of a dispute about the position of the black stone and who should have the honour of raising it to its placefn63 he decided for the corner chosen by abraham and distributed the privilege amongst the clans the benu zahrah and benu abd manaf took the front wall and the door to the benu jama and the benu sahm was allotted the back wall the benu makhzum and their kuraysh relations stood at the southern wall and at the “stone” corner were posted the benu abd aldar the benu as’ad and the benu ada  9 abdullah bin zubayr nephew of ayishah rebuilt the ka’abah in ah 64 it had been weakened by fire which burnt the covering besides splitting the black stone into three pieces and by the manjanik catapults of hosayn arabic bin numayr general of yazid who obstinately besieged meccah till he heard of his sovereign’s death abdullah hoping to fulfil a prophecyfn64 and seeing that the people of meccah fled in alarm pulled down the building by means of “thincalved abyssinian slaves” when they came to abraham’s foundation he saw that it included alhijr which part the kuraysh had been unable to build the building was made of cut stone and fine lime brought from alyaman abdullah taking in the hatim lengthened the building by seven cubits and added to its former height nine cubits  p324 thus making a total of twentyseven he roofed over the whole or a part reopened the western door to serve as an exit and following the advice of his aunt who quoted the prophet’s words he supported the interior with a single row of three columns instead of the double row of six placed there by the kuraysh finally he paved the mataf or circuit ten cubits round with the remaining slabs and increased the harim by taking in the nearer houses during the building a curtain was stretched round the walls and pilgrims compassed them externally when finished it was perfumed inside and outside and invested with brocade then abdullah and all the citizens went forth in a procession to the tanim a reverend place near meccah returned to perform umrah the lesser pilgrimage slew 100 victims and rejoiced with great festivities  the caliph abd almalik bin marwan besieged abdullah bin zubayr who after a brave defence was slain in ah 74 hajjaj bin yusuf general of abd almalik’s troops wrote to the prince informing him that abdullah had made unauthorised additions to and changes in the harim the reply brought an order to rebuild the house hajjaj again excluded the hatim and retired the northern wall six cubits and a span making it twentyfive cubits long by twentyfour broad the other three sides were allowed to remain as built by the son of zubayr he gave the house a double roof closed the western door and raised the eastern four cubits and a span above the mataf or circuit which he paved over the harim was enlarged and beautified by the abbasides especially by almahdi almutamid and almutazid some authors reckon as an eleventh house the repairs made by sultan murad khan on the night of tuesday 20th sha’aban ah 1030 a violent torrent swept the harim it rose one cubit above the threshold of the ka’abah carried away the lampposts and the  p325 makam ibrahim all the northern wall of the house half of the eastern and onethird of the western side it subsided on wednesday night the repairs were not finished till ah 1040 the greater part however of the building dates from the time of al hajjaj and moslems who never mention his name without a curse knowingly circumambulate his work the olema indeed have insisted upon its remaining untouched lest kings in wantonness should change its form harun alrashid desired to rebuild it but was forbidden by the imam malik  the present proofs of the ka’abah’s sanctity as adduced by the learned are puerile enough but curious the olema have made much of the verselet “verily the first house built for mankind to worship in is that in bakkahfn65 meccah blessed and a salvation to the three worlds therein fihi are manifest signs the standingplace of abraham which whoso entereth shall be safe” kor ch 3 the word “therein” is interpreted to mean meccah and the “manifest signs” the ka’abah which contains such marvels as the footprints on abraham’s platform and the spiritual safeguard of all who enter the sanctuaryfn66 the other “signs” historical psychical and physical are briefly these the preservation of the hajar alaswad and the makam ibrahim from many foes and the miracles put forth as in the war of the elephant to defend the house the violent and terrible deaths of the sacrilegious and the fact that in the deluge the large fish did not eat the little fish in the harim a wonderful desire and love impel men from distant regions to visit the holy spot and the first sight of the ka’abah causes awe and fear horripilation and tears furthermore ravenous beasts will not destroy their prey in the sanctuary land and the pigeons and other birds never perch upon the house except to be p326 cured of sickness for fear of defiling the roof the ka’abah though small can contain any number of devotees no one is ever hurt in itfn67 and invalids recover their health by rubbing themselves against the kiswah and the black stone finally it is observed that every day 100000 mercies descend upon the house and especially that if rain come up from the northern corner there is plenty in irak if from the south there is plenty in yaman if from the east plenty in india if from the western there is plenty in syria and if from all four angles general plenty is presignified  fn1 “bayt ullah” house of allah and “ka’abah” ie cube house “la maison carree” are synonymous fn2 ali bey gives 536 feet 9 inches by 356 feet my measurement is 257 paces by 210 most moslem authors reckoning by cubits make the parallelogram 404 by 310 fn3 on each short side i counted 24 domes on the long 35 this would give a total of 118 along the cloisters the arabs reckon in all 152 viz 24 on the east side on the north 36 on the south 36 one on the mosque corner near the zarurah minaret 16 at the porch of the bab alziyadah and 15 at the bab ibrahim the shape of these domes is the usual “medianaranja” and the superstition of the meccans informs the pilgrim that they cannot be counted books reckon 1352 pinnacles or battlements on the temple wall fn4 the “common stone of the meccah mountains” is a fine grey granite quarried principally from a hill near the bab alshabayki which furnished material for the ka’abah eastern authors describe the pillars as consisting of three different substances viz rukham white marble not “alabaster” its general sense suwan or granite syenite and hajar shumaysi” a kind of yellow sandstone so called from “bir shumays” a place on the jeddah road near haddah the halfway station fn5 i counted in the temple 554 pillars it is however difficult to be accurate as the four colonnades and the porticos about the two great gates are irregular topographical observations moreover must here be made under difficulties ali bey numbers them roughly at “plus de 500 colonnes et pilastres” fn6 the author afterwards informs us that “the temple has been so often ruined and repaired that no traces of remote antiquity are to be found about it” he mentions some modern and unimportant inscriptions upon the walls and over the gates knowing that many of the pillars were sent in ships from syria and egypt by the caliph almahdi a traveller would have expected better things fn7 the reason being that “those shafts formed of the meccan stone are mostly in three pieces but the marble shafts are in one piece” fn8 to this may be added that the façades of the cloisters are twentyfour along the short walls and thirtysix along the others they have stone ornaments not inaptly compared to the french “fleur de lis” the capital and bases of the outer pillars are grander and more regular than the inner they support pointed arches and the arab secures his beloved variety by placing at every fourth arch a square pilaster of these there are on the long sides ten on the short seven fn9 i counted eight not including the broad pavement which leads from the bab alziyadah to the ka’abah or the four cross branches which connect the main lines these “firash alhajar” as they are called also serve to partition off the area one space for instance is called “haswat alharim” or the “women’s sanded place” because appropriated to female devotees fn10 the jars are little amphoræ each inscribed with the name of the donor and a peculiar cypher fn11 my measurements give 22 paces or 55 feet in length by 18 45 of breadth and the height appeared greater than the length ali bey makes the eastern side 37 french feet 2 inches and 6 lines the western 38° 4 6 the northern 29 feet the southern 31° 6 and the height 34° 4 he therefore calls it a “veritable trapezium” in alidrisi’s time it was 25 cubits by 24 and 27 cubits high fn12 i would alter this sentence thus—“it is built of fine grey granite in horizontal courses of masonry of irregular depth the stones are tolerably fitted together and are held by excellent mortar like roman cement” the lines are also straight fn13 this base is called alshazarwan from the persian shadarwan a cornice eaves or canopy it is in penthouse shape projecting about a foot beyond the wall and composed of fine white marble slabs polished like glass there are two breaks in it one opposite and under the doorway and another in front of ishmael’s tomb pilgrims are directed during circumambulation to keep their bodies outside of the shazarwan  this would imply it to be part of the building but its only use appears in the large brass rings welded into it for the purpose of holding down the ka’abah covering fn14 ali bey also errs in describing the roof as “plat endessus” were such the case rain would not pour off with violence through the spout most oriental authors allow a cubit of depression from southwest to northwest in alidrisi’s day the ka’abah had a double roof some say this is the case in the present building which has not been materially altered in shape since its restoration by alhajjaj ah 83 the roof was then eighteen cubits long by fifteen broad fn15 in ibn jubayr’s time the ka’abah was opened every day in rajah and in other months on every monday and friday the house may now be entered ten or twelve times a year gratis and by pilgrims as often as they can collect amongst parties a sum sufficient to tempt the guardians’ cupidity fn16 this mistake in which burckhardt is followed by all our popular authors is the more extraordinary as all arabic authors call the doorwall janib almashrik—the eastern side—or wajh albayt the front of the house opposed to zahr albayt the back niebuhr is equally in error when he asserts that the door fronts to the south arabs always hold the “rukn aliraki” or irak angle to face the polar star and so it appears in ali bey’s plan the ka’abah therefore has no northern side and it must be observed that moslem writers dispose the length of the ka’abah from east to west whereas our travellers make it from north to south ali bey places the door only six feet from the pavement but he calculates distances by the old french measure it is about seven feet from the ground and six from the corner of the black stone between the two the space of wall is called almultazem in burckhardt by a clerical error “almetzem” vol i p 173 it derives its name the “attachedto” because here the circumambulator should apply his bosom and beg pardon for his sins almultazem according to m de perceval following d’ohsson was formerly “le lieu des engagements” whence according to him its name “le moltezem” says m galland rits et ceremonies du pelerinage de la mecque “qui est entre la pierre noire et la porte est l’endroit ou mahomet se reconcilia avec ses dix compagnons qui disaient qu’il n’etait pas veritablement prophete” fn17 from the bab alziyadah or gate in the northern colonnade you descend by two flights of steps in all about twentyfive this depression manifestly arises from the level of the town having been raised like rome by successive layers of ruins the most populous and substantial quarters as the shamiyah to the north would we might expect be the highest and this is actually the case but i am unable to account satisfactorily for the second hollow within the temple and immediately around the house of allah where the door according to all historians formerly on a level with the pavement and now about seven feet above it shows the exact amount of depression which cannot be accounted for simply by calcation some chroniclers assert that when the kuraysh rebuilt the house they raised the door to prevent devotees entering without their permission but seven feet would scarcely oppose an entrance and how will this account for the floor of the building being also raised to that height above the pavement it is curious to observe the similarity between this inner hollow of the meccan fane and the artificial depression of the hindu pagoda where it is intended to be flooded the hindus would also revere the form of the meccan fane exactly resembling their square temples at whose corners are placed brahma vishnu shiwa and ganesha who adore the great universal generator in the centre the second door anciently stood on the side of the temple opposite the present entrance inside its place can still be traced ali bey suspects its having existed in the modern building and declares that the exterior surface of the wall shows the tracery of a blockedup door similar to that still open some historians declare that it was closed by the kuraysh when they rebuilt the house in mohammed’s day and that subsequent erections have had only one the general opinion is that alhajjaj finally closed up the western entrance doctors also differ as to its size the popular measurement is three cubits broad and a little more than five in length fn18 pilgrims and ignorant devotees collect the drippings of wax the ashes of the aloewood and the dust from the “atabah” or threshold of the ka’abah either to rub upon their foreheads or to preserve as relics these superstitious practices are sternly rebuked by the olema fn19 for northeast read southeast fn20 i will not enter into the fabulous origin of the hajar alaswad some of the traditions connected with it are truly absurd “when allah” says ali “made covenant with the sons of adam on the day of fealty he placed the paper inside the stone” it will therefore appear at the judgment and bear witness to all who have touched it moslems agree that it was originally white and became black by reason of men’s sins it appeared to me a common aerolite covered with a thick slaggy coating glossy and pitchlike worn and polished dr wilson of bombay showed me a specimen in his possession which externally appeared to be a black slag with the inside of a bright and sparkling greyishwhite the result of admixture of nickel p301 with the iron this might possibly as the learned orientalist then suggested account for the mythic change of colour its appearance on earth after a thunderstorm and its being originally a material part of the heavens kutb aldin expressly declares that when the karamitah restored it after twentytwo years to the meccans men kissed it and rubbed it upon their brows and remarked that the blackness was only superficial the inside being white some greek philosophers it will be remembered believed the heavens to be composed of stones cosmos “shooting stars” and sanconiathon ascribing the aeroliteworship to the god cœlus declares them to be living or animated stones “the arabians” says maximus of tyre dissert 38 p 455 “pay homage to i know not what god which they represent by a quadrangular stone” the gross fetichism of the hindus it is well known introduced them to litholatry at jagannath they worship a pyramidal black stone fabled to have fallen from heaven or miraculously to have presented itself on the place where the temple now stands moreover they revere the salagram as the emblem of vishnu the second person in their triad the rudest emblem of the “bonus deus” was a round stone it was succeeded in india by the cone and triangle in egypt by the pyramid in greece it was represented by cones of terracotta about three inches and a half long without going deep into theory it may be said that the ka’abah and the hajar are the only two idols which have survived the 360 composing the heavenly host of the arab pantheon thus the hindu poet exclaims—  “behold the marvels of my idoltemple o moslem that when its idols are destroy’d it becomes allah’s house”  wilford as soc vols iii and iv makes the hindus declare that the black stone at mokshesha or mokshasthana meccah was an incarnation of moksheshwara an incarnation of shiwa who with his consort visited alhijaz when the ka’abah was rebuilt this emblem was placed in the outer wall for contempt but the people still respected it in the dabistan the black stone is said to be an image of kaywan or saturn and alshahristani also declares the temple to have been dedicated to the same planet zuhal whose genius is represented in the puranas as fierce hideous fourarmed and habited in a black cloak with a dark turband moslem historians are unanimous in asserting that sasan son of babegan and other persian monarchs gave rich presents to the ka’abah they especially mention two golden crescent moons a significant offering the guebers assert that among the images and relics left by mahabad and his successors in the ka’abah was the black stone an emblem of saturn they also call the city mahgah— moon’s place—from an exceedingly beautiful image of the moon whence they say the arabs derived “meccah” and the sabaeans equally respect the ka’abah and the pyramids which they assert to be the tombs of seth enoch or hermes and sabi the son of enoch meccah then is claimed as a sacred place and the hajar alaswad as well as the ka’abah are revered as holy emblems by four different faiths—the hindu sabæan gueber and moslem i have little doubt and hope to prove at another time that the jews connected it with traditions about abraham this would be the fifth religion that looked towards the ka’abah—a rare meetingplace of devotion fn21 presenting this appearance in profile the hajar has suffered from the iconoclastic principle of islam having once narrowly escaped destruction by order of alhakim of egypt in these days the metal rim serves as a protection as well as an ornament fn22 the height of the hajar from the ground according to my measurement is four feet nine inches ali bey places it fortytwo inches above the pavement fn23 the colour was black and metallic and the centre of the stone was sunk about two inches below the metal circle round the sides was a reddishbrown cement almost level with the metal and sloping down to the middle of the stone ibn jubayr declares the depth of the stone unknown but that most people believe it to extend two cubits into the wall in his day it was three “shibr” the large span from the thumb to the little fingertip broad and one span long with knobs and a joining of four pieces which the karamitah had broken the stone was set in a silver band “its softness and moisture were such” says ibn jubayr “that the sinner would never remove his mouth from it which phenomenon made the prophet declare it to be the covenant of allah on earth” fn24 the band is now a massive circle of gold or silver gilt i found the aperture in which the stone is one span and three fingers broad fn25 the “rukn alyamani” is the corner facing the south the part alluded to in the text is the wall of the ka’abah between the shami and yamani angles distant about three feet from the latter and near the site of the old western door long since closed the stone is darker and redder than the rest of the wall it is called almustajab or mustajab min alzunub or mustajab aldua “where prayer is granted” pilgrims here extend their arms press their bodies against the building and beg pardon for their sins fn26 i have frequently seen it kissed by men and women fn27 alma’ajan the place of mixing or kneading because the patriarchs here kneaded the mud used as cement in the holy building some call it alhufrah the digging and it is generally known as makam jibrail the place of gabriel because here descended the inspired order for the five daily prayers and at this spot the archangel and the prophet performed their devotions making it a most auspicious spot it is on the north of the door from which it is distant about two feet its length is seven spans and seven fingers breadth five spans three fingers and depth one span four fingers the following sentence from herklet’s “qanoon e islam” ch xii sec 5 may serve to show the extent of error still popular the author after separating the bayt ullah from the ka’abah erroneously making the former the name of the whole temple proceeds to say “the rainwater which falls on its the ka’abah’s terrace runs off through a golden spout on a stone near it called rookneyemeni or alabasterstone and stands over the grave of ismaeel”— fn28 generally called mizab alrahmah of mercy it carries rain from the roof and discharges it upon ishmael’s grave where pilgrims stand fighting to catch it in alidrisi’s time it was of wood now it is said to be gold but it looks very dingy fn29 usually called the hajar alakhzar or green stone alidrisi speaks of a white stone covering ishmael’s remains ibn jubayr of “green marble longish in form of a mihrab arch and near it a white round slab in both of which are spots that make them appear yellow” near them we are told and towards the iraki corner is the tomb of hagar under a green slab one span and a half broad and pilgrims used to pray at both places ali bey erroneously applies the words alhajar ismail to the parapet about the slab fn30 my measurements give five feet six inches in alidrisi’s day the wall was fifty cubits long fn31 alhatim arabic lit the “broken” burckhardt asserts that the mekkawi no longer apply the word as some historians do to the space bounded by the ka’abah the partition the zemzem and the makam of ibrahim i heard it however so used by learned meccans and they gave as the meaning of the name the break in this part of the oval pavement which surrounds the ka’abah historians relate that all who rebuilt the “house of allah” followed abraham’s plan till the kuraysh and after them alhajjaj curtailed it in the direction of alhatim which part was then first broken off and ever since remained so fn32 alhijr arabic is the space separated as the name denotes from the ka’abah some suppose that abraham here penned his sheep possibly ali bey means this part of the temple when he speaks of alhajar arabic ismail—les pierres d’ismail fn33 “alhajjaj” this as will afterwards be seen is a mistake he excluded the hatim fn34 as well as memory serves me for i have preserved no note the inscriptions are in the marble casing and indeed no other stone meets the eye fn35 it is a fine close grey polished granite the walk is called almataf or the place of circumambulation fn36 these are now iron posts very numerous supporting cross rods and of tolerably elegant shape in ali bey’s time there were “trenteune colonnes minces en piliers en bronze” some native works say thirtythree including two marble columns between each two hang several white or green glass globelamps with wicks and oil floating on water their light is faint and dismal the whole of the lamps in the harim is said to be more than 1000 yet they serve but to “make darkness visible” fn37 there are only four “makams” the hanafi maliki hanbali and the makam ibrahim and there is some error of diction below for in these it is that the imams stand before their congregations and nearest the ka’abah in ibn jubayr’s time the zaydi sect was allowed an imam though known to be schismatics and abusers of the caliphs now not being permitted to have a separate station for prayer they suppose theirs to be suspended from heaven above the ka’abah roof fn38 the makam almaliki is on the west of and thirtyseven cubits from the ka’abah that of the hanbali fortyseven paces distant fn39 only the mu’ezzin takes his stand here and the shafe’is pray behind their imam on the pavement round the ka’abah between the corner of the well zemzem and the makam ibrahim this place is forty cubits from the ka’abah that is say eight cubits nearer than the northern and southern “makams” thus the pavement forms an irregular oval ring round the house fn40 in burckhardt’s time the schools prayed according to the seniority of their founders and they uttered the azan of almaghrib together because that is a peculiarly delicate hour which easily passes by unnoticed in the twelfth century at all times but the evening the shafe’i began then came the maliki and hanbali simultaneously and lastly the hanafi now the shaykh almu’ezzin begins the call which is taken up by the others he is a hanafi as indeed are all the principal people at meccah only a few wild sharifs of the hills being shafe’i fn41 the door of the zemzem building fronts to the southeast fn42 this is not exactly correct as the plan will show the angle of one building touches the angle of its neighbour fn43 their names and offices are now changed one is called the kubbat alsa’at and contains the clocks and chronometers two of them english sent as presents to the mosque by the sultan the other known as the kubbat alkutub is used as a storeroom for manuscripts bequeathed to the mosque they still are open to burckhardt’s just criticism being nothing but the common dome springing from four walls and vulgarly painted with bands of red yellow and green in ibn jubayr’s time the two domes contained bequests of books and candles the kubbat abbas or that further from the ka’abah than its neighbour was also called kubbat alsharab the dome of drink because zemzem water was here kept cooling for the use of pilgrims in daurak or earthen jars the nearer was termed kubbat alyahudi and the tradition they told me was that a jew having refused to sell his house upon the spot it was allowed to remain in loco by the prophet as a lasting testimony to his regard for justice a similar tale is told of an old woman’s hut which was allowed to stand in the corner of the great nushirawan’s royal halls fn44 called “aldaraj” a correct drawing of it may be found in ali bey’s work fn45 the bab alsalam or bab alnabi or bab benu shaybah resembles in its isolation a triumphal arch and is built of cut stone fn46 “the praying place of abraham” readers will remember that the meccan mosque is peculiarly connected with ibrahim whom moslems prefer to all prophets except mohammed fn47 this i believe to be incorrect i was asked five dollars for permission to enter but the sum was too high for my finances learned men told me that the stone shows the impress of two feet especially the big toes and devout pilgrims fill the cavities with water which they rub over their eyes and faces when the caliph almahdi visited meccah one abdullah bin osman presented himself at the unusual hour of noon and informing the prince that he had brought him a relic which no man but himself had yet seen produced this celebrated stone almahdi rejoicing greatly kissed it rubbed his face against it and pouring water upon it drank the draught kutb aldin one of the meccan historians says that it was visited in his day in ali bey’s time it was covered with “un magnifique drap noir brode en or et en argent avec de gros glands en or” he does not say however that he saw the stone its veils called sitr ibrahim alkhalil are a green “ibrisham” or silk mixed with cotton and embroidered with gold they are made at cairo of three different colours black red and green and one is devoted to each year the gold embroidery is in the sulsi character and expresses the throneverse the chapter of the cave and the name of the reigning sultan on the top is “allah” below it “mohammed” beneath this is “ibrahim alkhalil” and at each corner is the name of one of the four caliphs in a note to the “dabistan” vol ii p 410 we find two learned orientalists confounding the black stone with abraham’s station or platform “the prophet honoured the black stone upon which abraham conversed with hagar to which he tied his camels and upon which the traces of his feet are still seen” fn48 not only here i was told by learned meccans but under all the oval pavements surrounding the ka’abah fn49 the spring gushes from the southern base of mount arafat as will afterwards be noticed it is exceedingly pure fn50 the author informs us that “the first pulpit was sent from cairo in ah 818 together with the staircase both being the gifts of moayed caliph of egypt” ali bey accurately describes the present mambar fn51 the curious will find a specimen of a moslem sermon in lane’s mod egypt vol i ch iii fn52 burckhardt “subjoins their names as they are usually written upon small cards by the metowefs in another column are the names by which they were known in more ancient times principally taken from azraky and kotoby” i have added a few remarks in brackets  mention is made of modern names arches and ancient names  1 bab el salam composed of gates or arches 3 bab beni shaybah this is properly applied to the inner not the outer salam gate 2 bab el neby  2 bab el jenaiz gate of biers the dead being carried through it to the mosque 3 bab el abbas opposite to this the house of abbas once stood 3 bab sertakat some moslem authors confound this bab alabbas with the gate of biers  4 bab aly 3 bab beni hashem  5 bab el zayt bab el ashra 2 bab bazan so called from a neighbouring hill  6 bab el baghlah 2  7 bab

total number of arches 39fn53 an old pair of slippers is here what the “shocking bad hat” is at a crowded house in europe a selfpreserver burckhardt lost three pairs i more fortunately only one fn54 many authorities place this building upon the site of the modern makam hanafi fn55 the meccans love to boast that at no hour of the day or night is the ka’abah ever seen without a devotee to perform “tawaf” fn56 this would be about 50 dollars whereas 25 is a fair sum for a single apartment like english lodginghousekeepers the meccans make the season pay for the year in burckhardt’s time the colonnato was worth from 9 to 12 piastres the value of the latter coin is now greatly decreased for 28 go to the spanish dollar all over alhijaz fn57 i entered one of these caves and never experienced such a sense of suffocation even in that favourite spot for britons to asphixiate themselves—the baths of nero fn58 the magnificent son of salim i who built at almadinah the minaret bearing his name the minarets at meccah are far inferior to those of her rival and their bands of gaudy colours give them an appearance of tawdry vulgarity fn59 two minarets namely those of the bab alsalam and the bab alsafa are separated from the mosque by private dwellinghouses a plan neither common nor regular fn60 a stranger must be careful how he appears at a minaret window unless he would have a bullet whizzing past his head arabs are especially jealous of being overlooked and have no fellowfeeling for votaries of “beautiful views” for this reason here as in egypt a blind mu’ezzin is preferred and many ridiculous stories are told about men who for years have counterfeited cecity to live in idleness fn61 i have illustrated this chapter which otherwise might be unintelligible to many by a plan of the ka’abah taken from ali bey alabbasi which burckhardt pronounced to be “perfectly correct” this author has not been duly appreciated in the first place his disguise was against him and secondly he was a spy of the french government according to mr bankes who had access to the original papers at constantinople ali bey was a catalonian named badia and was suspected to have been of jewish extraction he claimed from napoleon a reward for his services returned to the east and died it is supposed of poison in the hauran near damascus in the edition which i have consulted paris 1814 the author labours to persuade the world by marking the days with their planetary signs c c that he is a real oriental but he perpetually betrays himself some years ago accurate plans of the two harims were made by order of the present sultan they are doubtless to be found amongst the archives at constantinople fn62 it must be remembered that the moslems like many of the jews hold that paradise was not on earth but in the lowest firmament which is as it were a reflection of earth fn63 others derive the surname from this decision fn64 as will afterwards be mentioned almost every meccan knows the prophecy of mohammed that the birthplace of his faith will be destroyed by an army from abyssinia such things bring their own fulfilment fn65 abu hanifah made it a temporal sanctuary and would not allow even a murderer to be dragged from the walls fn66 makkah our meccah is the common word bakkah is a synonym never used but in books the former means “a concourse of people” but why derive it from the hebrew and translate it “a slaughter” is this a likely name for a holy place dr colenso actually turns the makaraba of ptolemy into “makkahrabbah” plentiful slaughter but if makaraba be meccah it is evidently a corruption of “makkah” and “arabah” the arab race again supposing the meccan temple to be originally dedicated to the sun why should the pure arab word “ba’al” become the hebræized hobal and the deity be only one in the three hundred and sixty that formed the pantheon fn67 this is an audacious falsehood the ka’abah is scarcely ever opened without some accident happening  p327

cities is “lewes wertomannus lodovico bartema gentelman of the citie of romefn1” if any man” says this aucthor “shall demand of me the cause of this my voyage certeynely i can shewe no better reason than is the ardent desire of knowledge which hath moved many other to see the world and the miracles of god therein” in the year of our lord 1503 he departed from venice “with prosperous wynds” arrived at alexandria and visited babylon of egypt berynto tripoli antioch and damascus he started from the latter place on the 8th of april 1503 “in familiaritie and friendshyppe with a certayne captayne mameluke” which term he applies to “al such christians as have forsaken theyr fayth to serve the mahumetans and turks” and in the garb of a  p334 “mamaluchi renegado” he estimates the damascus caravan to consist of 40000 men and 35000 camels nearly six times its present numberfn2 on the way they were “enforced to conflict with a great multitude of the arabians” but the three score mamluks composing their escort were more than a match for 50000 badawin on one occasion the caravan attacked by 24000 arabians slew 1500 of the enemies losing in the conflict only a man and a womanfn3 this “marveyle”—which is probably not without some exaggeration—he explains by the “strength and valiantness of the mamalukes” by the practice still popular of using the “camells in the steede of a bulwarke and placing the merchaunts in the myddest of the army that is in the myddest of the camelles whyle the pilgrims fought manfully on every side” and finally by the circumstance that the arabs were unarmed and “weare only a thynne loose vesture and are besyde almost naked theyr horses also beyng euyll furnished and without saddles or other furniture” the hijazi badawi of this day is a much more dangerous enemy the matchlock and musket have made him so and the only means of crippling him is to prevent the importation of firearms and lead and by slow degrees to disarm the population after performing the ceremonies of pilgrimage at almadinah and meccah he escaped to zida or gida jeddah “despite the trumpetter of the caravana giving warning to all the mamalukes to make readie their horses to direct their journey toward syria with proclamation of death to all that should refuse so to  p335 doe” and embarked for persia upon the red sea he touched at certain ports of alyaman and got into trouble at aden “where the mahumetans took him” and “put shackles on his legges which came by occasion of a certayne idolatour who cryed after him saying o christian dogge borne of doggesfn4” the lieutenant of the sultan “assembled his council” consulted them about putting the traveller to death as a “spye of portugales” and threw him ironed into a dungeon on being carried shackled into the presence of the sultan bartema said that he was a “roman professed a mamaluke in babylon of alcayr” but when told to utter the formula of the moslem faith he held his tongue “eyther that it pleased not god or that for feare and scruple of conscience he durst not” for which offence he was again “deprived of ye fruition of heaven”  but happily for bartema in those days the women of arabia were “greatly in love with whyte men” before escaping from meccah he lay hid in the house of a mohammedan and could not express his gratitude for the good wife’s care “also” he says “this furthered my good enterteynement that there was in the house a fayre young mayde the niese of the mahumetan who was greatly in loue with me” at aden he was equally fortunate one of the sultan’s three wives on the departure of her lord and master bestowed her heart upon the traveller she was “very faire and comely after theyr maner and of colour inclynyng to blacke” she  p336 would spend the whole day in beholding bartema who wandered about simulating madnessfn5 and “in the meane season divers tymes sent him secretly muche good meate by her maydens” he seems to have played his part to some purpose under the colour of madness converting a “great fatt shepe” to mohammedanism killing an ass because he refused to be a proselyte and finally he “handeled a jewe so euyll that he had almost killed hym” after sundry adventures and a trip to sanaa he started for persia with the indian fleet in which by means of fair promises he had made friendship with a certain captain he visited zayla and berberah in the somali country and at last reached hormuz the 3rd book “entreateth of persia” the 4th of “india and of the cities and other notable thynges seene there” the 8th book contains the “voyage of india” in which he includes pegu sumatra borneo and java where “abhorryng the beastly maners” of a cannibal population he made but a short stay returning to calicut he used “great subtiltie” escaped to the “portugales” and was well received by the viceroy after describing in his 7th book the “viage or navigation of ethiopia melinda mombaza mozambrich mozambique and zaphala sofala” he passed the cape called “caput bonæ spei and repaired to the goodly citie of luxburne lisbon” where he had the honour of kissing hands the king confirmed with his great seal the “letters patentes” whereby his lieutenant the viceroy of india had given the pilgrim the order of knighthood “and thus” says bartema by way of conclusion “departing from thence with the kyngs pasporte and safe conducte at the length after these my long and great trauayles and  p337 dangers i came to my long desyred native countrey the citie of rome by the grace of god to whom be all honour and glory”  this old traveller’s pages abound with the information to be collected in a fresh field by an unscrupulous and hardheaded observer they are of course disfigured with a little romancing his jews at khaybor near almadinah were five or six spans long at meccah he saw two unicorns the younger “at the age of one yeare and lyke a young coolte the horne of this is of the length of four handfulsfn6” and so credulous is he about anthropophagi that he relates of mahumet son to the sultan of sanaa how he “by a certayne naturall tyrannye and madnesse delyteth to eate man’s fleeshe and therefore secretly kylleth many to eate themfn7” but all things well considered lodovico bartema for correctness of observation and readiness of wit stands in the foremost rank of the old oriental travellers  i proceed to quote and to illustrate with notes the few chapters devoted in the 1st volume of this littleknown work to meccah and almadinah  chapter xi—of a mountayne inhabited with jewes and of the citie of medinathalnabi where mahumet was buried  in the space of eyght dayes we came to a mountayne which conteyneth in circuite ten or twelve myles this is inhabited with jewes to the number of fyue thousande  p338 or thereabout they are very little stature as of the heyght of fyue or sixe spannes and some muche lesse they have small voyces lyke women and of blacke colour yet some blacker then other they feede of

founde a certayne hole out of whiche flowed aboundance of water by fyndyng this opportunitie we laded sixtiene thousand camels which thyng greatly offended the jewes they wandred in that mountayne scattered lyke wylde goates or prickettes yet durst they not come downe partly for feare and partly for hatred agaynst the mahumetans beneath the mountaine are seene seuen or eyght thorne trees very fayre and in them we found a payre of turtle doues which seemed to vs in maner a miracle hauying before made so long journeyes and sawe neyther beast nor foule then proceedyng two dayes journey we

lykenesse of trueth as i presently behelde these thynges and sawe the place where mahumet is buried in the said citie of medinathalnabi for we taryed there three dayes to come to the true knowledge of all these thynges when wee were desirous to enter into theyr temple which they call meschitafn11 and all other churches by the same name we coulde not be suffered to enter without a companion little

for he tooke to wyfe his daughter fatoma bubacar is he who they say was exalted to the dignitie of a chiefe counseller and great gouernour although he came not to the high degree of an apostle or prophet as dyd mahumet othomar and aumar were chief captaynes of the army of mahumet euery of these haue their proper bookes of factes and traditions and hereof proceedeth the great dissention and discorde of religion and maners among this kynde of filthie men whyle some confirm one doctrine and some another by reason of theyr dyuers sectes of patrons doctours and saintes as they call them by this meanes are they marueylously diuided among themselues and lyke beastes kyll themselues for such quarelles of dyuers opinions and all false this also is the chiefe cause of warre between the sophie of persia and the great turke being neuerthelesse both mahumetans and lyue in mortall hatred one agaynst the other for the mayntenaunce of theyr sectes saintes and apostles whyle euery of them thynketh theyr owne to bee best  chapter xiii—of the secte of mahumet  now will we speake of the maners and sect of mahumet vnderstande therefore that in the highest part of the tower aforesayde is an open round place now shall you vnderstande what crafte they vsed to deceyue our carauans the first euening that we came thyther to see the sepulchre of mahumet our captayne  p341 sent for the chiefe priest of the temple to come to him and when he came declared vnto him that the only cause of his commyng thyther was to visite the sepulchre and bodie of nabi by which woord is signified the prophet mahumet and that he vnderstoode that the price to be admitted to the syght of these mysteries should be foure thousande seraphes of golde also that he had no parents neyther brothers sisters kinsefolkes chyldren or wyues neyther that he came thyther to buy merchaundies as spices or bacca or nardus or any maner of precious jewelles but only for very zeale of religion and saluation of his soule and was therefore greatly desirous to see the bodie of the prophet to whom the priest of the temple they call them side with countenance lyke one that were distraughtfn14 made aunswere in this maner “darest thou with those eyes with the which thou hast committed so many horrible sinnes desyre to see him by whose sight god hath created heauen and earth” to whom agayne our captayne aunswered thus “my lord you have sayde truly neuertheless i pray you that i may fynd so much fauour with you that i may see the prophet whom when i haue seene i will immediately thrust out myne eyes” the side aunswered “o prince i will open all thynges unto thee so it is that no man can denye but that our prophet dyed heere who if he woulde might haue died at mecha but to shewe in himself a token of humilitie and thereby to giue vs example to folowe him was wyllyng rather heere than elsewhere to departe out of this worlde and was incontinent of angelles borne into heauen and there receyued as equall with them” then our captayne sayde to him “where is jesus christus the sonne of marie” to whom the side answered “at  p342 the feete of mahumetfn15” then sayde our captayne agayne “it suffyceth it suffyceth i will knowe no more” after this our captayne commyng out of the temple and turnyng to vs sayd “see i pray you for what goodly stuffe i would haue paide three thousande seraphes of golde” the same daye at euenyng at almost three a clock of the nyght ten or twelue of the elders of the secte of mahumet entered into our carauana which remayned not paste a stone caste from the gate of the citiefn16 these ranne hyther and thyther crying lyke madde men with these wordes “mahumet the messenger and apostle of god shall ryse agayne o prophet o god mahumet shall ryse agayne have mercy on vs god” our captayne and we all raysed with this crye tooke weapon with all expedition suspectyng that the arabians were come to rob our carauana we asked what was the cause of that exclamation and what they cryed for they cryed as doe the christians when sodeynly any marueylous thyng chaunceth the elders answered “sawe you not the lyghtning whiche shone out of the sepulchre of the prophet mahumetfn17” our captayne answered that he sawe nothing and we also beyng demaunded answered in lyke maner then sayde one of the old men “are you slaues” that is to say bought men meanyng thereby mamalukes then sayde our captayne “we are in deede mamalukes” then agayne the old man sayde “you my lordes cannot see heauenly thinges as being neophiti that is newly come to the fayth and not yet confirmed in our religion” to this our captayne answered p343 agayne “o you madde and insensate beastes i had thought to haue giuen you three thousande peeces of gold but now o you dogges and progenie of dogges i will gyue you nothing” it is therefore to bee vnderstoode that none other shynyng came out of the sepulchre then a certayne flame which the priests caused to come out of the open place of the towrefn18 spoken of here before whereby they would have deceyved vs and therefore our captayne commaunded that thereafter none of vs should enter into the temple of this also we haue most true experience and most certaynely assure you that there is neyther iron or steele or the magnes stone that should so make the toombe of mahumet to hange in the ayre as some haue falsely imagined neyther is there any mountayne nearer than foure myles we remayned here three dayes to refreshe our company to this citie victualles and all kynde of corne is brought from arabia fælix and babylon or alcayr and also from ethiope by the redde sea which is from this citie but four dayes journeyfn19  chapter xiv—the journey to mechafn20  after we were satisfied or rather wearyed with the filthinesse and lothesomenesse of the trumperyes deceites trifles and hypocrisis of the religion of mahumet we determined to goe forward on our journey and that by guyding of a pylot who might directe our course with the mariners boxe or compasse with also the carde of the sea euen as is vsed in sayling on the sea and thus bendyng our journey to the west we founde a very fayre  p344 well or fountayne from the which flowed great aboundance of water the inhabitantes affyrme that sainct marke the euangelist was the aucthour of this fountayne by a miracle of god when that region was in maner burned with incredible drynessefn21 here we and our beastes were satisfied with drynke i may not here omit to speake of the sea of sande and of the daungers thereof this was founde of vs before we came to the mountayne of the jewes in this sea of sande we traueiled the journey of three days and nightes this is a great brode plaine all couered with white sande in maner as small as floure if by euil fortune it so chaunce that any trauaile that way southward if in the mean time the wind come to the north they are ouerwhelmed with sande that they scatter out of the way and can scarsely see the one the other ten pases of and therefore the inhabitants trauayling this way are inclosed in cages of woodde borne with camels and lyue in themfn22 so passing the jorney guided by pilots with maryner’s compasse and card euen as on the sea as we haue sayde in this jorney also many peryshe for thirst and many for drynkyng to muche when they finde suche good waters in these sandes is founde momia which is the fleshe of such men as are drowned in these sandes and there dryed by the heate of the sunne so that those bodyes are preserued from putrifaction by the drynesse of the sand and therefore that drye fleshe is esteemed medicinablefn23 albeit there is p345 another kynde of more pretious momia which is the dryed and embalmed bodies of kynges and princes whiche of long tyme haue been preserued drye without corruption when the wynde bloweth from the northeast then the sand riseth and is driuen against a certayne mountayne which is an arme of the mount sinaifn24 there we found certayne pyllers artificially wrought whiche they call ianuan on the lefte hande of the sayde mountayne in the toppe or rydge thereof is a denne and the entrie into it is by an iron gate some fayne that in that place mahumet lyued in contemplation here we heard a certayne horrible noyse and crye for passyng the sayde mountayne we were in so great daunger that we thought neuer to have escaped departyng therefore from the fountayne we continued our journey for the space of ten dayes and twyse in the way fought with fyftie thousande arabians and so at the length came to the citie of mecha where al things were troubled by reason of the warres betweene two brethren contendyng whiche of them shoulde possesse the kyngedome of mecha  chapter xv—of the fourme and situation of the citie of mecha and why the mohumetans resort thyther  nowe the tyme requireth to speake somewhat of the famous citie of mecha or mecca what it is howe it is situate and by whom it is gouerned the citie is very fayre and well inhabited and conteyneth in rounde fourme syxe thousande houses as well buylded as ours and some that cost three or foure thousande peeces of golde it hath no walles about two furlongs from the citie is a mount where the way is cutte outfn25 whiche leadeth to a playne  p346 beneath it is on euery syde fortified with mountains in the stead of walles or bulwarkes and hath foure entries the gouernour is a soltan and one of the foure brethern of the progenie of mahumet and is subject to the soltan of babylon of whom we haue spoken before his other three brethren be at continuall warre with hym the eighteen daye of maye we entered into the citie by the north syde then by a declynyng way we came into a playne on the south syde are two mountaynes the one very neere the other distant onely by a little valley which is the way that leadeth to the gate of mecha on the east syde is an open place betweene two mountaynes lyke vnto a valleyfn26 and is the waye to the mountayne where they sacrifice to the patriarkes abraham and isaacfn27 this mountayne is from the citie about ten or twelve myles and of the heyght of three stones cast it is of stone as harde as marble yet no marblefn28 in the toppe of the mountaine is a temple or meschita made after their fashion and hath three wayes to enter into itfn29 at the foote of the mountayne are two cesterns which conserue waters without corruption of these the one is reserued to minister water to the camels of the carauana of babylon or alcayr and the other for them of damasco it is rayne water and is deriued far offn30  but to returne to speake of the citie for as touchyng the maner of sacrifice which they vse at the foote of the mountayne wee wyll speake hereafter entryng therefore into the citie wee founde there the carauana of memphis or babylon which prevented vs eyght dayes and came not the waye that wee came this carauana  p347 conteyned threescore and foure thousande camelles and a hundred mamalukes to guyde them and here ought you to consyder that by the opinion of all men this citie is greatly cursed of god as appereth by the great barrennesse thereof for it is destitute of all maner of fruites and cornefn31 it is scorched with drynesse for lacke of water and therefore the water is there growen to suche pryce that you cannot for twelve pence buye as much water as wyll satysfie your thyrst for one day nowe therefore i wyll declare what prouision they have for victuales the most part is brought them from the citie of babylon otherwyse named memphis cayrus or alcayr a citie of the ryuer of nilus in egypt as we have sayde before and is brought by the red sea called mare erythreum from a certayne port named gida distaunt from mecha fourtie mylesfn32 the rest of theyr prouisions is brought from arabia faelix that is the happye or blessed arabia so named for the fruitfulnesse thereof in respect of the other two arabiaes called petrea and diserta that is stonye and desart they haue also muche corne from ethyopia here we found a marueylous number of straungers and peregrynes or pylgryms of the whiche some came from syria some from persia and other from both the east indiaes that is to say both india within the ryuer of ganges and also the other india without the same ryuer i neuer sawe in anye place greater abundaunce and frequentation of people forasmuche as i could perceyue by tarrying there the space of 20 dayes these people resort thyther for diuers causes as some for merchandies some to obserue theyr vowe of pylgrymage and other to haue pardon for theyr sinnes as touchyng the whiche we wyll speake more hereafter  p348chapter xvii—of the pardons or indulgences of mecha  let vs now returne to speake of the pardons of pilgryms for the which so many strange nations resort thither in the myddest of the citie is a temple in fashyon lyke vnto the colossus of rome the amphitheatrum i meane lyke vnto a stage yet not of marbled or hewed stones but of burnt bryckes for this temple like vnto an amphitheatre hath fourscore and ten or an hundred gatesfn33 and is vaulted the entrance is by a discent of twelve stayers or degrees on euery partfn34 in the church porche are sold only jewels and precious stones in the entry the gylted walles shyne on euery syde with incomparable splendour in the lower part of the temple that is vnder the vaulted places is seene a maruelous multitude of men for there are fyue or sixe thousande men that sell none other thyng then sweete oyntmentes and especially a certayne odoriferous and most sweete pouder wherewith dead bodyes are embalmedfn35 and hence all maner of sweete sauours are carried in maner into the countreys of all the mahumetans it passeth all beleefe to thynke of the exceedyng sweetnesse of these sauours farre surmounting the shoppes of the apothecaries the 23 daye of maye the pardones began to be graunted in the temple and in what maner we wyll nowe declare the temple in the myddest is open without any inclosyng and in the myddest also thereof is a turrett of the largnesse of sixe passes in cercuitiefn36 and inuolued or hanged with cloth or  p349 tapestry of sylkefn37and passeth not the heyght of a man they enter into the turret by a gate of syluer and is on euery syde besette with vesselles full of balme on the day of pentecost licence is graunted to al men to se these thynges the inhabitantes affyrm that balme or balsame to be part of the treasure of the soltan that is lorde of mecha at euery vaulte of the turret is fastened a rounde circle of iron lyke to the ryng of a doorefn38 the 22 day of maye a great multitude of people beganne early in the mornyng before day seuen tymes to walke about the turret kyssing euery corner thereof often tymes feelyng and handelyng them from this turret about tenne or twelue pases is an other turret like a chappell buylded after our maner this hath three or foure entryes in the myddest thereof is a well of threescore and tenne cubites deepe the water of this well is infected with salt peter or saltniterfn39 egypt men are therevnto appoynted to drawe water for all the people and when a multitude of people haue seuen tymes gone rounde about the first turret they come to this well and touchyng the mouth or brym thereof they saye thus “be it in the honour of god god pardon me and forgeue me my synnes” when these woordes are sayde they that drawe the water powre three buckettes of water on the headdes of euery one of them and stand neere about the well and washe them all wette from the headde to the foote although they be apparelled with sylk then the dotyng fooles dreame that they are cleane from all theyr synnes and that theyr synnes are forgeuen them they saye furthermore that  p350 the fyrst turret whereof we haue spoken was the fyrst house that euer abraham buylded and therefore whyle they are yet all wette of the sayd washyng they go to the mountayne where as we have sayde before they are accustomed to sacrifice to abrahamfn40 and remayning there two daies they make the said sacrifice to abraham at the foote of the mountayne       chapter xviii—the maner of sacrificing at mecha  forasmuche as for the most parte noble spirites are delyted with nouelties of great and straunge thyngs therefore to satisfie their expectation i wyll describe theyr maner of sacrifycyng therefore when they intend to sacrifice some of them kyll three sheepe some foure and tenne so that the butcherie sometyme so floweth with blood that in one sacrifice are slayne above three thousande sheepe they are slayne at the rysyng of the sunne and shortly after are distributed to the poore for god’s sake for i sawe there a great and confounded multitude of poor people as to the number of 20 thousande these make many and long dyches in the feeldes where they keepe fyre with camels doong and rost or seeth the fleshe that is geuen them and eate it euen there i beleue that these poore people came thither rather for hunger than for deuotion which i thinke by this coniectur—that great abundance of cucumbers are brought thyther from arabia fælix whiche they eate castyng away the parynges without their houses or tabernacles where a multitude of the sayde poore people geather them euen out of the myre and sande and eate them and are so greedie of these parynges that they fyght who may geather mostfn41 the  p351 daye folowingfn42 their cadi which are in place with them as with vs the preachers of god’s worde ascended into a hygh mountayne to preach to the people that remaineth beneath and preached to them in theyr language the space of an houre the summe of the sermon was that with teares they should bewayle theyr sinnes and beate their brestes with sighes and lamentation and the preacher hymselfe with loude voyce spake these wordes “o abraham beloued of god o isaac chosen of god and his friend praye to god for the people of nabi” when these woordes were sayde sodenly were heard lamenting voyces when the sermon was done a rumor was spredde that a great armye of arabians to the number of twentie thousande were commyng with which newes they that kept the caraunas beyng greatly feared with all speede lyke madde men fledde into the citie of mecha and we agayne bearyng newes of the arabians approche fledde also into the citie but whyle wee were in the mydwaye between the mountayne and mecha we came by a despicable wall of the breadthe of foure cubites the people passyng this wall had couered the waye with stones the cause whereof they saye to be this when abraham was commaunded to sacrifice his sonne he wylled his sonne isaac to folowe hym to the place where he should execute the commaundement of god as isaac went to follow his father there appeared to him in the way a deuyl in lykenesse of a fayre and freendly person not farre from the sayde wall and asked hym freendlye whyther he went isaac answered that he went to his  p352 father who tarryed for him to this the enemie of mankynde answered that it was best for hym to tarrye and yf that he went anye further his father would sacrifice him but isaac nothyng feareyng this aduertisement of the deuyl went forward that his father on hym myght execute the commaundement of god and with this answere as they saye they deuyell departed yet as isaac went forwarde the diuell appeared to hym agayne in the lykenesse of an other frendlye person and forbade hym as before then isaac taking vp a stone in that place hurlde it at the deuyl and wounded him in the forehead in witnesse and remembraunce whereof the people passyng that waye when they come neare the wall are accustomed to cast stones agaynst it and from thence go into the citiefn43 as we went this way the ayre was in maner darkened with a multitude of stock doues they saye that these doues are of the progenie of the doue that spake in the eare of mahumet in lykenesse of the holye ghostfn44 these are seene euery where as in the villages houses tauernes and graniers of corne and ryse and are so tame that one can scharsely dryue them away to take them or kyll them is esteemed a thyng worthy deathfn45  p353 and therefore a certayne pensyon is geuen to nourysshe them in the temple  chapter xx—of diuers thynges which chaunced to me in mecha and of zida a port of mecha  it may seeme good here to make mention of certayne thynges in the which is seene sharpenesse of witte in case of vrgent necessitie which hath no lawe as sayeth the prouerbe for i was dryuen to the point howe i myght prieuly escape from mecha therefore whereas my captayne gaue me charge to buy certayne thynges as i was in the market place a certayne mamaluke knewe me to be a christian and therefore in his owne language spake vnto me these woordes “inte mename” that is whence art thoufn46 to whom i answered that i was a mahumetan but he sayde thou sayest not truely i sayde agayne by the head of mahumet i am a mahumetan then he sayde agayne come home to my house i folowed hym willingly when we were there he began to speake to me in the italian tongue and asked me agayne from whence i was affyrming that he knewe me and that i was no mahumetan also that he had been sometyme in genua and venice and that his woordes myght be better beleeued he rehearsed many thinges which testified that he sayed trueth when i vnderstoode this i confessed freely that i was a romane but professed to the fayth of mahumet in the citie of babylon and there made one of the mamalukes whereof he seemed greatly to reioyce and therefore vsed me honourably but because my desyre was yet to goe further i asked the mahumetan whether that citie of mecha was so famous as all the world spake of it and inquired of him where was the great aboundaunce of pearles precious stones spices and other rich merchandies that the bruite went of to be in that citie and all my talke was to the ende  p354 to grope the mynde of the mahumetan that i might know the cause why such thinges were not brought thyther as in tyme paste but to auoyde all suspition i durst here make no mention of the dominion which the kyng of portugale had in the most parte of that ocean and of the gulfes of the redde sea and persia then he began with more attentyue mynde in order to declare vnto me the cause why that marte was not so greatly frequented as it had been before and layde the only faulte thereof in the kyng of portugale but when he had made mention of the kyng i began of purpose to detracte his fame lest the mahumetan might thinke that i reioyced that the christians came thyther for merchandies when he perceyued that i was of profession an enemy to the christians he had me yet in greater estimation and proceeded to tell me many thynges more when i was well instructed in all thynges i spake vnto him friendly these woordes in the mahumet’s language menaba menalhabi that is to say “i pray you assist meefn47” he asked mee wherein “to help me sayed i howe i may secretly departe hence” confyrmyng by great othes that i would goe to those kinges that were most enemies to the christians affyrmyng furthermore that i knewe certain secretes greatly to be esteemed which if they were knowen to the sayde kynges i doubted not but that in shorte tyme i should bee sent for from mecha astonyshed at these woordes he sayde vnto mee i pray you what arte or secrete doe you know i answered that i would giue place to no man in makyng of all manner of gunnes and artillerie then sayde hee “praysed be mahumet who sent thee hyther to do hym and his saintes good seruice” and willed me to remayne secretly in his p355 house with his wyfe and requyred me earnestly to obtayne leaue of our captayne that under his name he myght leade from mecha fifteine camelles laden with spices without paying any custome for they ordinarily paye to the soltan thirtie seraphesfn48 of golde for transportyng of such merchandies for the charge of so many camelles i put him in good hope of his request he greatly reioyced although he would ask for a hundred affyrmyng that might easily be obteyned by the priuileges of the mamalukes and therefore desyred hym that i might safely remayne in his house then nothyng doubtyng to obtayn his request he greatly reioyced and talkyng with me yet more freely gaue me further instructions and counsayled me to repayre to a certayne kyng of the greater india in the kyngdome and realme of dechamfn49 whereof we will speake hereafter therefore the day before the carauana departed from mecha he willed me to lye hydde in the most secrete parte of his house the day folowyng early in the mornyng the trumpetter of the carauana gaue warning to all the mamalukes to make ready their horses to directe their journey toward syria with proclamation of death to all that should refuse so to doe when i hearde the sounde of the trumpet and was aduertised of the streight commaundement i was marueylously troubled in minde and with heauy countenaunce desired the mahumetan’s wife not to bewraye me and with earnest prayer committed myselfe to the mercie of god on the tuesday folowyng our carauana departed from mecha and i remayned in the mahumetans house with his wyfe but he folowed the carauana yet before he departed he gaue commaundement to his wyfe to bryng me to the carauana which shoulde departe from zidafn50 the porte of mecha to goe into india this porte is distant from mecha 40 miles whilest i laye  p356 thus hyd in the mahumetans house i can not expresse how friendly his wyfe vsed me this also furthered my good enterteynement that there was in the house a fayre young mayde the niese of the mahumetan who was greatly in loue with me but at that tyme in the myddest of those troubles and feare the fyre of venus was almost extincte in mee and therefore with daliaunce of fayre woordes and promises i styll kepte my selfe in her fauour therefore the friday folowyng about noone tyde i departed folowyng the carauana of india and about myd nyght we came to a certayne village of the arabians and there remayned the rest of that nyght and the next day tyll noone  from hence we went forwarde on our journey toward zida and came thyther in the silence of the nyght this citie hath no walles yet fayre houses somewhat after the buyldyng of italie here is great aboundaunce of all kynd of merchandies by reason of resorte in manner of all nations thyther except jewes and christians to whom it is not lawfull to come thyther as soone as i entered into the citie i went to their temple or meschita where i sawe a great multitude of poore people as about the number of 25 thousande attendyng a certayne pilot who should bryng them into their countrey heere i suffered muche trouble and affliction beyng enforced to hyde myselfe among these poore folkes

from other places as from babylon of nilus arabia fælix and dyuers other places the heate is here so great that men are in maner dryed up therewith  p357 and therefore there is euer a great number of

makes a light to proceed from the prophet’s tomb fn18 it is unnecessary to suppose any deception of the kind if only the “illuminati” could see this light the sight would necessarily be confined to a very small number fn19 this account is correct kusayr cosseir suez and jeddah still supply almadinah fn20 it is impossible to distinguish from this description the route taken by the damascus caravan in ad 1503 of one thing only we may be certain namely that between almadinah and meccah there are no “seas of sand” fn21 the name of st mark is utterly unknown in alhijaz probably the origin of the fountain described in the text was a theory that sprang from the brains of the christian mamluks fn22 a fair description of the still favourite vehicles the shugduf takhtrawan and the shibriyah it is almost needless to say that the use of the mariner’s compass is unknown to the guides in alhijaz fn23 wonderful tales are still told about this same momiya mummy i was assured by an arab physician that he had broken a fowl’s leg and bound it tightly with a cloth containing man’s dried flesh which caused the bird to walk about with a sound shank on the second day fn24 this is probably jabal warkan on the darb alsultani or sea road to meccah for the moslem tradition about its sinaitic origin see chapter xx fn25 the saniyah kuda a pass opening upon the meccah plain here two towers are now erected fn26 this is the open ground leading to the muna pass fn27 an error the sacrifice is performed at muna not on arafat the mountain here alluded to fn28 the material is a close grey granite fn29 the form of the building has now been changed fn30 the meccans have a tradition concerning it that it is derived from baghdad fn31 moslems who are disposed to be facetious on serious subjects often remark that it is a mystery why allah should have built his house in a spot so barren and desolate fn32 this is still correct suez supplies jeddah with corn and other provisions fn33 a prodigious exaggeration burckhardt enumerates twenty the principal gates are seventeen in number in the old building they were more numerous jos pitt says “it hath about fortytwo doors to enter into it—not so much i think for necessity as figure for in some places they are close by one another” fn34 bartema alludes probably to the bab alziyadah in the northern enceinte fn35 i saw nothing of the kind though constantly in the harim at meccah fn36 “the ka’abah is an oblong massive structure 18 paces in length 14 in breadth and from 35 to 40 feet in height” burckhardt vol i p 248 my measurements concerning which more hereafter gave 18 paces in breadth and 22 in length fn37 in ancient times possibly it was silk now it is of silk and cotton mixed fn38 these are the brazen rings which serve to fasten the lower edge of the kiswah or covering fn39 a true description of the water of the well zemzem fn40 there is great confusion in this part of bartema’s narrative on the 9th of zu’l hijjah the pilgrims leave mount arafat on the 10th many hasten into meccah and enter the ka’abah they then return to the valley of muna where their tents are pitched and they sacrifice the victims on the 12th the tents are struck and the pilgrims reenter meccah fn41 this well describes the wretched state of the poor “takruri” and other africans but it attributes to them an unworthy motive i once asked a learned arab what induced the wretches to rush upon destruction as they do when the faith renders pilgrimage obligatory only upon those who can afford necessaries for the way “by allah” he replied “there is fire within their hearts which can be quenched only at god’s house and at his prophet’s tomb” fn42 bartema alludes to the “day of arafat” 9th of zu’l hijjah which precedes not follows the “day of sacrifice” fn43 bartema alludes to the “shaytan alkabir” the “great devil” as the buttress at almuna is called his account of satan’s appearance is not strictly correct most moslems believe that abraham threw the stone at the “rajim”—the lapidated one but there are various traditions upon the subject fn44 a christian version of an obscure moslem legend about a white dove alighting on the prophet’s shoulder and appearing to whisper in his ear whilst he was addressing a congregation butler alludes to it — “th’ apostles of this fierce religion like mahomet’s were ass and widgeon” the latter word being probably a clerical error for pigeon when describing the ka’abah i shall have occasion to allude to the “bluerocks” of meccah fn45 no one would eat the pigeons of the ka’abah but in other places almadinah for instance they are sometimes used as articles of food fn46 in the vulgar dialect “ant min ayn” fn47 i confess inability to explain these words the printer has probably done more than the author to make them unintelligible “atamannik minalnabi” in vulgar and rather corrupt arabic would mean “i beg you to aid me for the sake of the prophet” fn48 ashrafi ducats fn49 the

of exonfn1 a youth fifteen or sixteen years old when in ad 1678 his genius “leading him to be a sailor and to see foreign countries” caused him to be captured by an algerine pirate after living in slavery for some years he was taken by his “patroon” to meccah and almadinah via alexandria rosetta cairo and suez his description of these places is accurate in the main points and though tainted with prejudice and bigotry he is free from superstition and credulity conversant with turkish and arabic he has acquired more knowledge of the tenets and practice of alislam than his predecessor and the term of his residence at algier fifteen years sufficed despite the defects of his education to give fulness and finish to his observations his chief patroon captain of a troop of  p359 horse was a profligate and debauched man in his time and a murderer “who determined to proselyte a christian slave as an atonement for past impieties” he began by large offers and failed he succeeded by dint of a great cudgel repeatedly applied to joseph pitts’ bare feet “i roared out” says the relator “to feel the pain of his cruel strokes but the more i cried the more furiously he laid on and to stop the noise of my crying would stamp with his feet on my mouth” “at last” through terror he “turned and spake the words la ilaha c as usual holding up the forefinger of the right hand” he was then circumcised in due form of course such conversion was not a sincere one—“there was yet swinesflesh in his teeth” he boasts of saying his prayers in a state of impurity hates his fellow religionists was truly pleased to hear mahomet called sabbatero ie shoemaker reads his bible talks of the horrid evil of apostacy calls the prophet a “bloody imposter” eats heartily in private of hog and is very much concerned for one of his countrymen who went home to his own country but came again to algier and voluntarily without the least force used towards him became a mahometan his first letter from his father reached him some days after he had been compelled by his patroon’s barbarity to abjure his faith one sentence appears particularly to have afflicted him it was this “to have a care and keep close to god and to be sure never by any methods of cruelty that could be used towards me be prevailed to deny my blessed saviour and that he the father would rather hear of my death than of my being a mahometan” indeed throughout the work it appears that his repentance was sincere  “god be merciful to me a sinner”  is the deprecation that precedes the account of his “turning turk” and the book concludes with  “to him therefore father son and holy spirit three  p360 persons and one god be all honour glory and praise world without end amen”  having received from his patroon whom he acknowledges to have been a second parent to him a letter of freedom at meccah and having entered into pay still living with his master pitts began to think of escape the grand turk had sent to algier for ships and the renegade was allowed to embark on board one of them provided with a diplomatic letterfn2 from mr baker consul of algier to mr raye consul at smyrna the devil we are told was very busy with him in the levant tempting him to lay aside all thoughts of escaping to return to algier and to continue a mussulman and the loss of eight months’ pay and certain other monies seems to have weighed heavily upon his soul still he prepared for the desperate enterprise in which failure would have exposed him to be dragged about the streets on the stones till half dead and then be burned to ashes in the jews’ burialplace a generous friend mr eliot a cornish merchant who had served some part of his apprenticeship in exon and had settled at smyrna paid £4 for his passage in a french ship to leghorn therefrom in the evening before sailing he went on board “apparel’d as an englishman with his beard shaven a campaign periwig and a cane in his hand accompanied with three or four of his friends at leghorn he prostrated himself and kissed the earth blessing almighty god for his mercy and goodness to him that he once more set footing on the  p361 european christianfn3 part of the world” he travelled through italy germany and holland where he received many and great kindnesses but his patriotism was damped as he entered “england his own native country and the civilised land must have made him for a time regret having left algier the very first night he lay ashore he was “imprest into the kings service” we having at that time war with france despite arguments and tears he spent some days in colchester jail and finally he was put on board a smack to be carried to the dreadnought manofwar but happily for himself he had written to sir william falkener one of the smyrna or turkey company in london that gentleman used his interest to procure a protection from the admiralty office upon the receipt of which good news joseph pitts did “rejoice exceedingly and could not forbear leaping upon the deck” he went to london thanked sir william and hurried down to exeter where he ends his fifteen years’ tale with a homely heartful and affecting description of his first meeting with his father his mother died about a year before his return  the following passages are parts of the 7th and 8th chapters of pitts’ littleknown work  “next we came to gidda the nearest seaport town to mecca not quite one day’s journey from itfn4 where the ships are unloaded here we are met by dilleelsfn5 ie certain persons who came from mecca on purpose to instruct the hagges or pilgrims in the ceremonies most p362 of them being ignorant of them which are to be used in their worship at the temple there in the middle of which is a place which they call beat allah ie the house of god they say that abraham built it to which i give no credit  “as soon as we come to the town of mecca the dilleel or guide carries us into the great street which is in the midst of the town and to which the temple joinsfn6 after the camels are laid down he first directs us to the fountains there to take abdesfn7 which being done he brings us to the temple into which having left our shoes with one who constantly attends to receive them we enter at the door called babalsalem ie the welcome gate or gate of peace after a few paces entrance the dilleel makes a stand and holds up his hands towards the beatallah it being in the middle of the mosque the hagges imitating him and saying after him the same words which he speaks at the very first sight of the beatallah the hagges melt into tears then we are led up to it still speaking after the dilleel then we are led round it seven times and then make two erkaetsfn8 this being done we are led into the street again where we are sometimes to run and sometimes to walk very quick with the dilleel from one place of the street to the other about a bowshotfn9 and i profess i could not chuse but admire to see those poor creatures so extraordinary devout and affectionate when they were about these superstitions and with what awe and trembling they  p363 were possessed in so much that i could scarce forbear shedding of tears to see their zeal though blind and idolatrous after all this is done we returned to the place in the street where we left our camels with our provisions and necessaries and then look out for lodgings where when we come we disrobe and take of our hirrawemsfn10 and put on our ordinary clothes again  “all the pilgrims hold it to be their great duty well to improve their time whilst they are at mecca not to do their accustomed duty and devotion in the temple but to spend all their leisure time there and as far as strength will permit to continue at towoaf ie to walk round the beatallah which is about four and twenty paces square at one corner of the beat there is a black stone fastened and framed in with silver platefn11 and every time they come to that corner they kiss the stone and having gone round seven times they perform two erkaetsnomas or prayers this stone they say was formerly white and then it was called haggar essaed ie the white stonefn12 but by reason of the sins of the multitudes of people who kiss it it is become black and is now called haggar esswaed or the black stone  “this place is so much frequented by people going round it that the place of the towoaf ie the circuit which they take in going round it is seldom void of people at any time of the day or nightfn13 many have waited several weeks nay months for the opportunity of finding it so for they say that if any person is blessed with such an opportunity that for his or her zeal in keeping up the honour of towoaf let they petition what they will at the beatallah they shall be answered many will walk round  p364 till they are quite weary then rest and at it again carefully remembering at the end of every seventh time to perform two erkaets this beat is in effect the object of their devotion the idol which they adore for let them be never so far distant from it east west north or south of it they will be sure to bow down towards it but when they are at the beat they may go on which side they please and pay their sallah towards itfn14 sometimes there are several hundreds at towoaf at once especially after acshamnomas or fourth time of service which is after candlelighting as you heard before and these both men and women but the women walk on the outside the men and the men nearest to the beat in so great a resort as this it is not to be supposed that every individual person can come to kiss the stone aforementioned therefore in such a case the lifting up the hands towards it smoothing down their faces and using a short expression of devotion as allahwaick barick ie blessed god or allah cabor ie great god some such like and so passing by it till opportunity of kissing it offers is thought sufficientfn15 but when there are but few men at towoaf then the women get opportunity to kiss the said stone and when they have gotten it they close in with it as they come round and walk round as quick as they can to come to it again and keep possession of it for a considerable time the men when they see that the women have got the place will be so civil as to pass by and give them leave to take their fill as i may say in their towoaf or walking round during which they are using some formal expressions when the women are at the stone then it is esteemed a very rude and abominable thing to go near them respecting the time and place  p365“i shall now give you a more particular description of mecca and the temple there  “first as to mecca it is a town situated in a barren place about one day’s journey from the red sea in a valley or rather in the midst of many little hills it is a place of no force wanting both walls and gates its buildings are as i said before very ordinary insomuch that it would be a place of no tolerable entertainment were it not for the anniversary resort of so many thousand hagges or pilgrims on whose coming the whole dependance of the town in a manner is for many shops are scarcely open all the year besides  the people here i observed are a poor sort of people very thin lean and swarthy the town is surrounded for several miles with many thousands of little hills which are very near one to the other i have been on the top of some of them near mecca where i could see some miles about yet was not able to see the farthest of the hills they are all stonyrock and blackish and pretty near of a bigness appearing at a distance like cocks of hay but all pointing towards mecca some of them are half a mile in circumference but all near of one height the people here have an odd and foolish sort of tradition concerning them viz that when abraham went about building the beatallah god by his wonderful providence did so order it that every mountain in the world should contribute something to the building thereof and accordingly every one did send its proportion though there is a mountain near algier which is called corradog ie black mountain and the reason of its blackness they say is because it did not send any part of itself towards building the temple at meccafn16 between  p366 these hills is good and plain travelling though they stand one to another  “there is upon the top of one of them a cave which they term hirafn17 ie blessing into which they say mahomet did usually retire for his solitary devotions meditations and fastings and here they believe he had a great part of the alcoran brought him by the angel gabriel i have been in this cave and observed that it is not at all beautified at which i admired  “about half a mile out of mecca is a very steep hill and there are stairs made to go to the top of it where is a cupola under which is a cloven rock into this they say mahomet when very young viz about four years of age was carried by the angel gabriel who opened his breast and took out his heart from which he picked some black bloodspecks which was his original corruption then put it into its place again and afterwards closed up the part and that during this operation mahomet felt no pain  “into this very place i myself went because the rest of my company did so and performed some erkaets as they did  “the town hath plenty of water and yet but few herbs unless in some particular places here are several sorts of good fruits to be had viz grapes melons watermelons cucumbers pumkins and the like but these are brought two or three days’ journey off where there is a place of very great plenty called if i mistake not habbashfn18 p367 likewise sheep are brought hither and sold so that as to mecca itself it affords little or nothing of comfortable provisions it lieth in a very hot country insomuch that people run from one side of the streets to the other to get into the shadow as the motion of the sun causes it the inhabitants especially men do usually sleep on the tops of the houses for the air or in the streets before their doors some lay the small bedding they have on a thin mat on the ground others have a slight frame made much like drinkstalls on which we place barrels standing on four legs corded with palm cordage on which they put their bedding before they bring out their bedding they sweep the streets and water them as for my own part i usually lay open without any bedcovering on the top of the house only i took a linen cloth dipt in water and after i had wrung it covered myself with it in the night and when i awoke i should find it dry then i would wet it again and thus i did two or three times in a night  “secondly i shall next give you some account of the temple of mecca  “it hath about fortytwo doors to enter into it not so much i think for necessity as figure for in some places they are close by one another the form of it is much resembling that of the royal exchange in london but i believe it is near ten times bigger it is all open and gravelled in the midst except some paths that come from certain doors which lead to the beatallah and are paved with broad stones the walks or cloisters all round are arched overhead and paved beneath with fine broad stone and all round are little rooms or cells where such dwell and give themselves up to reading studying and a devout life who are much akin to their dervises or hermits  “the beatallah which stands in the middle of the temple is foursquare about twentyfour paces each  p368 square and near twentyfour footfn19 in height it is built with great stone all smooth and plain without the least bit of carved work on it it is covered all over from top to bottom with a thick sort of silk above the middle part of the covering are embroidered all round letters of gold the meaning of which i cannot well call to mind but i think they were some devout expressions each letter is near two foot in length and two inches broad near the lower end of this beat are large brass rings fastened into it through which passeth a great cotton rope and to this the lower end of the covering is tacked the threshold of the door that belongs to the beat is as high as a man can reach and therefore when any person enter into it a sort of ladderstairs are brought for that purpose the door is plated all over with silverfn20 and there is a covering hangs over it and reaches to the ground which is kept turned up all the week except thursday night and friday which is their sabbath the said covering of the door is very thick imbroidered with gold insomuch that it weighs several score pounds the top of the beat is flat beaten with lime and sand and there is a long gutter or spout to carry off the water when it rains at which time the people will run throng and struggle to get under the said gutter that so the water that comes off the beat may fall upon them accounting it as the dew of heaven and looking on it as a great happiness to have it drop upon them but if they can recover some of this water to drink they esteem it to be yet a much greater happiness  p369 many poor people make it their endeavour to get some of it and present it to the hagges for which they are well rewarded my patroon had a present made him of this water with which he was not a little pleased and gave him that brought it a good reward  “this beatallah is opened but two days in the space of six weeks viz one day for the men and the next day for the womenfn21 as i was at mecca about four months i had the opportunity of entering into it twice a reputed advantage which many thousands of the hagges have not met with for those that come by land make no longer stay at mecca than sixteen or seventeen days  “when any enter into the beat all that they have to do is to perform two erkaets on each sidefn22 with the holding up their two hands and petitioning at the conclusion of each two erkaets and they are so very reverent and devout in doing this that they will not suffer their eyes to wander and gaze about for they account it very sinful so to do nay they say that one was smitten blind for gazing about when in the beat as the reward of his vain and unlawful curiosityfn23 i could not for my part give any credit to this story but looked on it as a legendary relation and therefore was resolved if i could to take my view of it i mean not to continue gazing about it but now and then to cast an observing eye and i profess i found nothing worth seeing in it only two wooden pillars in the midst to keep up the rooffn24 and a bar of iron fastened to them on which hanged three or four silver lamps which are i suppose but seldom  p370 if ever lighted in one corner of the beat is an iron or brass chain i cannot tell which for i made no use of it the pilgrims just clap it about their necks in token of repentance the floor of the beat is marble and so is the inside of the walls on which there is written something in arabick which i had no time to read the walls though of marble on the inside are hung over with silk which is pulled offfn25 before the hagges enter those that go into the beat tarry there but a very little while viz scarce so much as half a quarter of an hour because others wait for the same privilege and while some go in others are going out after all is over and all that will have done this the sultan of mecca who is shirreef ie one of the race of mahomet accounts himself not too good to cleanse the beat and therefore with some of his favourites doth wash and cleanse it and first of all they wash it with the holy water zem zem and after that with sweet water the stairs which were brought to enter in at the door of the beat being removed the people crowd under the door to receive on them the sweepings of the said water and the besoms wherewith the beat is cleansed are broken in pieces and thrown out amongst the mob and he that gets a small stick or twig of it keeps it as a sacred relique  “but to speak something further of the temple of mecca for i am willing to be very particular in matters about it though in so being i should it may be speak of things which by some people may be thought trivial the compass of ground round the beat where the people exercise themselves in the duty of towoaf is paved with marblefn26 about 50 foot in breadth and round this marble pavement stand pillars of brass about 15 foot highfn27 and  p371 20 foot distant from each other above the middle part of which iron bars are fastened reaching from one to the other and several lamps made of glass are hanged to each of the said bars with brasswires in the form of a triangle to give light in the night season for they pay their devotions at the beatallah as much by night as by day during the hagges’ stay at mecca these glasses are halffilled with water and a third part with oil on which a round wire of brass buoyed up with three little corks in the midst of this wire is made a place to put in the wick or cotton which burns till the oil is spent every day they are washed clean and replenished with fresh water oil and cotton  “on each of the four squares of the beat is a little room built and over every one of them is a little chamber with windows all round it in which chambers the emaums together with the mezzins perform sallah in the audience of all the people which are below these four chambers are built one at each square of the beat by reason that there are four sorts of mahometans the first are called hanifee most of them are turks the second schafeefn28 whose manners and ways the arabians follow the third hanbelee of which there are but few the fourth malakee of which there are those that live westward of egypt even to the emperor of morocco’s country these all agree in fundamentals only there is some small difference between them in the ceremonial part  “about twelve paces from the beat is as they say the sepulchre of abrahamfn29 who by god’s immediate command they tell you built this beatallah which  p372 sepulchre is enclosed within iron gates it is made somewhat like the tombstones which people of fashion have among us but with a very handsome imbroidered covering into this persons are apt to gaze a small distance from it on the lefthand is a well which they call beer el zem zem the water whereof they call holy water  and as superstitiously esteem it as the papists do theirs in the month of ramadan they will be sure to break their fast with it they report that it is as sweet as milk but for my part i could perceive no other taste in it than in common water except that it was somewhat brackish the hagges when they come first to mecca drink of it unreasonably by which means they are not only much purged but their flesh breaks out all in pimples and this they call the purging of their spiritual corruptions there are hundreds of pitchers belonging to the temple which in the month of ramadan are filled with the said water and placed all along before the people with cups to drink as they are kneeling and waiting for acshamnomas or evening service and as soon as the mezzins or clerks on the tops of the minarets began their bawling to call them to nomas they fall a drinking thereof before they begin their devotions this beer or well of zem zem is in the midst of one of the little rooms before mentioned at each square of the beat distant about twelve or fourteen paces from it out of which four men are employed to draw water without any pay or reward for any that shall desire it each of these men have two leather buckets tied to a rope on a small wheel one of which comes up full while the other goes down empty they do not only drink this water but oftentimes bathe themselves with it at which time they take off their clothes only covering their lower parts with thin wrapper and one of the drawers pours on each person’s head five or six buckets of waterfn30 the p373 person bathing may lawfully wash himself therewith above the middle but not his lower parts because they account they are not worthy only letting the water take its way downwards in short they make use of this water only to drink take abdes and for bathing neither may they take abdes with it unless they first cleanse their secret parts with other common water yea such an high esteem they have for it that many hagges carry it home to their respective countries in little latten or tin pots and present it to their friends half a spoonful may be to each who receive it in the hollow of their hand with great care and abundance of thanks sipping a little of it and bestowing the rest on their faces and naked heads at the same time holding up their hands and desiring of god that they also may be so happy and prosperous as to go on pilgrimage to mecca the reason of their putting such an high value upon the water of this well is because as they say it is the place where ishmael was laid by his mother hagar i have heard them tell the story exactly as it is recorded in the 21st chapter of genesis and they say that in the very place where the child paddled with his feet the water flowed out  “i shall now inform you how when and where they receive the honourable title of hagges for which they are at all this pains and expence  “the curbaen byram or the feast of sacrifice follows two months and ten days after the ramadan fast the eighth day after the said two months they all enter into hirrawem ie put on their mortifying habit again and in that manner go to a certain hill called gibbel el orphat el arafat ie the mountain of knowledge for p374 there they say adam first found and knew his wife eve and they likewise say that she was buried at gidda near the red sea at whose sepulchre all the hagges who come to mecca by way of the red sea perform two erkaetsnomas and i think no more i could not but smile to hear this their ridiculous tradition for so i must pronounce it when observing the marks which were set the one at the head and the other at the foot of the grave i guessed them to be a bowshot distant from each other on the middle of her supposed grave is a little mosque built where the hagges pay their religious respect  “this gibbel or hill is not so big as to contain the vast multitudes which resort thither for it is said by them that there meet no less than 70000 souls every year in the ninth day after the two months after ramadan and if it happen that in any year there be wanting some of that number god they say will supply the deficiency by so many angelsfn31  “i do confess the number of hagges i saw at this mountain was very great nevertheless i cannot think they could amount to so many as 70000 there are certain boundstones placed round the gibbel in the plain to shew how far the sacred ground as they esteem it extends and many are so zealous as to come and pitch their tents within these bounds some time before the hour of paying their devotion here comes waiting for it but why they so solemnly approach this mountain beyond any other place and receive from hence the title of hagges i confess i do not more fully understand than what i have already said giving but little heed to these delusions i observed nothing worth seeing on this hill for there was only a small cupola on the top of itfn32 p375 neither are there any inhabitants nearer to it than mecca about one or two of the clock which is the time of euleanomas having washed and made themselves ready for it they perform that and at the same time perform ekindenomas which they never do at one time but upon this occasion because at the time when ekindenomas should be performed in the accustomed order viz about four of the clock in the afternoon they are imploring pardon for their sins and receiving the emaum’s benedictionfn33  “it was a sight indeed able to pierce one’s heart to behold so many thousands in their garments of humility and mortification with their naked heads and cheeks watered with tears and to hear their grievous sighs and sobs begging earnestly for the remission of their sins promising newness of life using a form of penitential expressions and thus continuing for the space of four or five hours viz until the time of acshamnomas which is to be performed about half an hour after sunset it is matter of sorrowful reflection to compare the indifference of many christians with this zeal of these poor blind mahometans who will it is to be feared rise up in judgment against them and condemn them after their solemn performance of their devotions thus at the gibbel they all at once receive that honourable title of hagge from the emaum and are so stiled to their dying day immediately upon their receiving this name the trumpet is sounded and they all leave the hill and return for mecca and being gone two or three miles on their way they then rest for that nightfn34 but after nomas before  p376 they go to rest each person gathers nineandforty small stones about the bigness of an hazle nut the meaning of which i shall acquaint you with presently  “the next morning they move to a place called mina or muna the place as they say where abraham went to offer up his son isaacfn35 and therefore in this place they sacrifice their sheep it is about two or three miles from mecca i was here shown a stone or little rock which was parted in the middle they told me that when abraham was going to sacrifice his son instead of striking him providence directed his hand to this stone which he clave in two it must be a good stroke indeed  “here they all pitch their tents it being in a spacious plain and spend the time of curbaen byram viz three days as soon as their tents are pitched and all things orderly disposed every individual hagge the first day goes and throws seven of the small stones which they had gathered against a small pillar or little square stone buildingfn36 which action of theirs is intended to testify their defiance of the devil and his deeds for they at the same time pronounce the following words viz erzum le shetane wazbehefn37 ie stone the devil and them that please himfn38 and there are two other of the like pillars which are situated near one another at each of which  p377 i mean all three the second day they throw seven stones and the same they do the third day as i was going to perform this ceremony of throwing the stones a facetious hagge met me saith he ‘you may save your labour at present if you please for i have hit out the devil’s eyes already’ you must observe that after they have thrown the seven stones on the first day the country people having brought great flocks of sheep to be sold every one buys a sheep and sacrifices it some of which they give to their friends some to the poor which come out of mecca and the country adjacent very ragged poor and the rest they eat themselves after which they shave their heads throw off hirrawem and put on other clothes and then salute one another with a kiss saying ‘byram mabarick ela’ ie the feast be a blessing to you  “these three days of byram they spend festivally rejoicing with abundance of illuminations all night shooting of guns and fireworks flying in the air for they reckon that all their sins are now done away and they shall when they die go directly to heaven if they don’t apostatize and that for the future if they keep their vow and do well god will set down for every good action ten but if they do ill god will likewise reckon every evil action ten and any person who after having received the title of hagge shall fall back to a vicious course of life is esteemed to be very vile and infamous by themfn39  “some have written that many of the hagges after they have returned home have been so austere to themselves as to pore a long time over redhot bricks or ingots of iron and by that means willingly lose their sight desiring to see nothing evil or profane after so sacred a sight as the temple at mecca but i never knew any such thing done  p378 “during their three days’ stay at mina scarce any hagge unless impotent but thinks it his duty to pay his visit once at least to the temple at mecca they scarce cease running all the way thitherward shewing their vehement desire to have a fresh sight of the beatallah which as soon as ever they come in sight of they burst into tears for joy and after having performed towoaf for a while and a few erkaets they return again to mina and when the three days of byram are expired they all with their tents c come back again to mecca  “they say that after the hagges are gone from mina to mecca god doth usually send a good shower of rain to wash away the filth and dung of the sacrifices there slain and also that those vast numbers of little stones which i told you the hagges throw in defiance of the devil are all carried away by the angels before the year comes about again but i am sure i saw vast numbers of them that were thrown the year before lie upon the ground after they are returned to mecca they can tarry there no longer than the stated time which is about ten or twelve days during which time there is a great fair held where are sold all manner of east india goods and abundance of fine stones for rings and bracelets c brought from yeamanefn40 also of chinaware and musk and variety of other curiosities now is the time in which the hagges are busily employed in buying for they do not think it lawful to buy any thing till they have received the title of hagge every one almost now buys a caffin or shroud of fine linen to be buried in for they never use coffins for that purpose which might have been procured at algier or their other respective homes at a much cheaper rate but they choose to buy it here because they have the advantage of dipping it in the holy water zem zem they are very careful to carry the said  p379 caffin with them wherever they travel whether by sea or land that they may be sure to be buried therein  “the evening before they leave mecca every one must go to take their solemn leave of the beat entering at the gate called babe el salem ie welcome gate and having continued at towoaf as long as they please which many do till they are quite tired and it being the last time of their paying their devotions to it they do it with floods of tears as being extremely unwilling to part and bid farewell and having drank their fill of the water zem zem they go to one side of the beat their backs being towards the door called by the name of babe el weedoh ie the farewell door which is opposite to the welcome door where having performed two or three erkaets they get upon their legs and hold up their hands towards the beat making earnest petitions and then keep going backward till they come to the above said farewell gate being guided by some other for they account it a very irreverent thing to turn their backs towards the beat when they take leave of it all the way as they retreat they continue petitioning holding up their hands with their eyes fixed upon the beat till they are out of sight of it and so go to their lodgings weeping  “ere i leave mecca i shall acquaint you with a passage of a turk to me in the temple cloyster in the night time between acshamnomas and geganomas ie between the evening and the night services the hagges do usually spend that time or good part of it which is about an hour and half at towoaf and then sit down on the mats and rest themselves this i did and after i had sat a while and for my more ease at last was lying on my back with my feet towards the beat but at a distance as many others did a turk which sat by me asked me what countryman i was ‘a mogrebee’ said i ie one of the west ‘pray’ quoth he ‘how far west did you come’ i told him from gazair ie algier ‘ah’ replied he ‘have you taken so much  p380 pains and been at so much cost and now be guilty of this irreverent posture before the beat allah’  “here are many moors who get a beggarly livelihood by selling models of the temple unto strangers and in being serviceable to the pilgrims here are also several effendies or masters of learning who daily expound out of the alcoran sitting in high chairs and some of the learned pilgrims whilst they are here do undertake the same  “under the room of the hanifees which i mentioned before people do usually gather together between the hours of devotion and sitting round crosslegged it may be twenty or thirty of them they have a very large pair of tessbeehs or beads each bead near as big as a man’s fist which they keep passing round bead after bead one to the other all the time using some devout expressions i myself was once got in amongst them and methought it was a pretty play enough for children—however i was to appearance very devout  “there are likewise some dervises that get money here as well as at other places by burning of incense swinging their censers as they go along before the people that are sitting as this they do commonly on friday their sabbath in all other gamiler or mosques when the hattib is preaching and the people all sitting still at their devotion they are all in ranks so that the dervise without the least disturbance to any walks between every rank with his censer in one hand and with the other takes his powdered incense out of a little pouch that hangs by his sidefn41  “but though this place mecca is esteemed so very holy yet it comes short of none for lewdness and debauchery as for uncleanness it is equal to grand cairo and they will steal even in the temple itself  p381 “chapter viii— of the pilgrims’ return from mecca their visit made at medina to mahomet’s tomb there  “having thus given you an account of the turks’ pilgrimage to mecca and of their worship there the manner and circumstances of which i have faithfully and punctually related and may challenge the world to convict me of a known falsehood i now come to take leave of the temple and town of mecca  “having hired camels of the carriers we set out but we give as much for the hire of one from mecca to egypt which is about forty days’ journey as the real worth of it is viz about five or six pounds sterling if it happen that the camel dies by the way the carrier is to supply us with another and therefore those carriersfn42 who come from egypt to mecca with the caravan bring with them several spare camels for there is hardly a night passeth but many die upon the road for if a camel should chance to fall it is seldom known that it is able to rise again and if it should they despair of its being capable of performing the journey or ever being useful more it is a common thing therefore when a camel once falls to take off its burden and put it on another and then kill it which the poorer sort of the company eat i myself have eaten of camel’s flesh and it is very sweet and nourishing if a camel tires they even leave him upon the place “the first day we set out from mecca it was without any order at all all hurly burly but the next day every one laboured to get forward and in order to it there was many time much quarrelling and fighting but after every one had taken his place in the caravan they orderly and peaceably kept the same place till they came to grand cairo they travel four camels in a breast  p382 which are all tied one after the other like as in teamsfn43 the whole body is called a caravan which is divided into several cottors or companies each of which hath its name and consists it may be of several thousand camels and they move one cottor after another like distinct troops in the head of each cottor is some great gentleman or officer who is carried in a thing like a horselitter borne by two camels one before and the other behind which is covered all over with searcloth and over that again with green broad cloth and set forth very handsomely if the said great person hath a wife with him she is carried in another of the samefn44 in the head of every cottor there goes likewise a sumpter camel which carries his treasures c this camel hath two bells about the bigness of our marketbells having one on each side the sound of which may be heard a great way off some other of the camels have round bells about their necks some about their legs like those which our carriers put about their forehorses’ necks which together with the servants who belong to the camels and travel on foot singing all night make a pleasant noise and the journey passes away delightfully they say this musick make the camels brisk and lively thus they travel in good order every day till they come to grand cairo and were it not for this order you may guess what confusion would be amongst such a vast multitude  “they have lights by night which is the chief time of travelling because of the exceeding heat of the sun by day which are carried on the tops of high poles to direct the hagges on their marchfn45 they are somewhat like  p382 iron stoves into which they put short dry wood which some of the camels are loaded with it is carried in great sacks which have an hole near the bottom where the servants take it out as they see the fires need a recruit every cottor hath one of these poles belonging to it some of which have ten some twelve of these lights on their tops or more or less and they are likewise of different figures as well as numbers one perhaps oval way like a gate another triangular or like an n or m c so that every one knows by them his respective cottor they are carried in the front and set up in the place where the caravan is to pitch before that comes up at some distance from one another they are also carried by day not lighted but yet by the figure and number of them the hagges are directed to what cottor they belong as soldiers are by their colours where to rendezvous and without such directions it would be impossible to avoid confusion in such a vast number of people  “every day viz in the morning they pitch their tents and rest several hours when the camels are unloaded the owners drive them to water and give them their provender c so that we had nothing to do with them besides helping to load them  “as soon as our tents were pitched my business was to make a little fire and get a pot of coffee when we had ate some small matter and drank the coffee we lay down to sleep between eleven and twelve we boiled something for dinner and having dined lay down again till about four in the afternoon when the trumpet was sounded which gave notice to every one to take down their tents pack up their things and load their camels in order to proceed on their journey it takes up about two hours time ere they are in all their places again at the time of acshamnomas and also geganomas they make a halt and perform their sallah so punctual  p384 are they in their worship and then they travel till next morning if water be scarce what i call an imaginary abdesfn46 will do as for ancient men it being very troublesome for such to alight off the camels and get up again it is lawful for them to defer these two times of nomas till the next day but they will be sure to perform it then  “as for provisions we bring enough out of egypt to suffice us till we return thither again at mecca we compute how much will serve us for one day and consequently for the forty days’ journey to egypt and if we find we have more than we may well guess will suffice us for a long time we sell the overplus at mecca there is a charity maintained by the grand seignior for water to refresh the poor who travel on foot all the way for there are many such undertake this journey or pilgrimage without any money relying on the charity of the hagges for subsistence knowing that they largely extend it at such a time  “every hagge carries his provisions water bedding c with him and usually three or four diet together and sometimes discharge a poor man’s expenses the whole journey for his attendance on them there was an irish renegade who was taken very young insomuch that he had not only lost his christian religion but his native language also this man had endured thirty years slavery in spain and in the french gallies but was afterwards redeemed and came home to algier he was looked upon as a very pious man and a great zealot by the turks for his not turning from the mahommedan faith notwithstanding the great temptations he had so to do some of my neighbours who intended for mecca the same year i went with my patroon thither offered  p385 this renegado that if he would serve them on this journey they would defray his charges throughout he gladly embraced the offer and i remember when we arrived at mecca he passionately told me that god had delivered him out of hell upon earth meaning his former slavery in france and spain and had brought him into a heaven upon earth viz mecca i admired much his zeal but pitied his condition  “their water they carry in goats’ skins which they fasten to one side of their camels it sometimes happens that no water is to be met with for two three or more days but yet it is well known that a camel is a creature that can live long without drinking god in his wise providence so ordering it for otherwise it would be very difficult if not impossible to travel through the parched deserts of arabia  “in this journey many times the skulking thievish arabs do much mischief to some of the hagges for in the night time they will steal upon them especially such as are on the outside of the caravan and being taken to be some of the servants that belong to the carriers or owners of the camels they are not suspected when they see an hagge fast asleep for it is usual for them to sleep on the road they loose a camel before and behind and one of the thieves leads it away with the hagge upon its back asleep another of them in the meanwhile pulls on the next camel to tie it to the camel from whence the halter of the other was cut for if that camel be not fastened again to the leading camel it will stop and all that are behind will then stop of course which might be the means of discovering the robbers when they have gotten the stolen camel with his rider at a convenient distance from the caravan and think themselves out of danger they awake the hagge and sometimes destroy him immediately but at other times being a little more  p386 inclined to mercy they strip him naked and let him return to the caravanfn47  “about the tenth easy day’s journey after we come out of mecca we enter into medina the place where mahomet lies entombed although it be as i take it two or three days’ journey out of the direct way from mecca to egypt yet the hagges pay their visit there for the space of two days and come away the third  “those mahometans which live to the southward of mecca at the east indies and thereaway are not bound to make a visit to medina but to mecca only because it would be so much out of their way but such as come from turkey tartary egypt and africa think themselves obliged to do so  “medina is but a little town and poor yet it is walled roundfn48 and hath in it a great mosque but nothing near so big as the temple at mecca in one corner of the mosque is a place built about fourteen or fifteen paces square about this place are great windowsfn49 fenced with brass grates in the inside it is decked with some lamps and ornaments it is arched all over head i find some relate that there are no less than 3000 lamps about mahomet’s tomb but it is a mistake for there are not as i verily believe an hundred and i speak what i know and have been an eyewitness of in the middle of this place is the tomb of mahomet where the corpse of that bloody impostor is laid which hath silk curtains all around it like a bed which curtains are not costly nor beautiful there is nothing of his tomb to be seen by any by reason  p387 of the curtains round it nor are any of the hagges permitted to enter therefn50 none go in but the eunuchs who keep watch over it and they only light the lamps which burn there by night and to sweep and cleanse the place all the privilege the hagges have is only to thrust in their hands at the windowsfn51 between the brass grates and to petition the dead juggler which they do with a wonderful deal of reverence affection and zeal my patroon had his silk handkerchief stole out of his bosom while he stood at his devotion here  “it is storied by some that the coffin of mahomet hangs up by the attractive virtue of a loadstone to the roof of the mosque but believe me it is a false story when i looked through the brass gate i saw as much as any of the hagges and the top of the curtains which covered the tomb were not half so high as the roof or arch so that it is impossible his coffin should be hanging there i never heard the mahometans say anything like it on the outside of this place where mahomet’s tomb is are some sepulchres of their reputed saints among which is one prepared for jesus christ when he shall come again personally into the world for they hold that christ will come again in the flesh forty years before the end of the world to confirm the mahometan faith and say likewise that our saviour was not crucified in person but in effigy or one like him  “medina is much supplied by the opposite abyssine country which is on the other side of the red sea from thence they have corn and necessaries brought in ships an odd sort of vessels as ever i saw their sails being made of matting such as they use in the houses and mosques to tread upon  p388 “when we had taken our leave of medina the third day and travelled about ten days more we were met by a great many arabians who brought abundance of fruit to us particularly raisins but from whence i cannot tellfn52 when we came within fifteen days’ journey of grand cairo we were met by many people who came from thence with their camels laden with presents for the hagges sent from their friends and relations as sweetmeats c but some of them came rather for profit to sell fresh provisions to the hagges and trade with them  “about ten days before we got to cairo we came to a very long steep hill called ackaba which the hagges are usually much afraid how they shall be able to get up those who can will walk it the poor camels having no hoofs find it very hard work and many drop here they were all untied and we dealt gently with them moving very slowly and often halting before we came to this hill i observed no descent and when we were at the top there was none but all plain as before  “we past by mount sinai by night and perhaps when i was asleep so that i had no prospect of it  “when we came within seven days’ journey of cairo we were met by abundance of people more some hundreds who came to welcome their friends and relations but it being night it was difficult to find those they wanted and therefore as the caravans past along they kept calling them aloud by their names and by this means found them out and when we were in three days’ journey of it we had many camelloads of the water of the nile brought us to drink but the day and night before we came to cairo thousands came out to meet us with extraordinary rejoicing it is thirtyseven days’ journey from mecca to cairo and three days we tarry by p389 the way which together make us as i said forty days’ journey and in all this way there is scarce any green thing to be met with nor beast nor fowl to be seen or heard nothing but sand and stones excepting one place which we passed through by night i suppose it was a village where were some trees and we thought gardens”  fn1 it is curious as crichton arabia vol ii p 208 observes that gibbon seems not to have seen or known anything of the little work published by pitts on his return home it is entitled “a faithful account of the religion and the manners of the mahometans in which is a particular relation of their pilgrimage to mecca the place of mahomet’s birth and description of medina and of his tomb there” c c my copy is the 4th edition printed for t longman and r hett london ad 1708 the only remarkable feature in the “getting up” of the little octavo is that the engraving headed “the most sacred and antient temple of the mahometans at mecca” is the reverse of the impression fn2 some years afterwards mr consul baker when waited upon by pitts in london gave him a copy of the letter with the following memorandum upon the back of it—“copy of my letter to consul raye at smyrna to favour the escape of joseph pitts an english renegade from a squadron of algier menofwar had my kindness to him been discovered by the government of algiers my legs and arms had first been broken and my carcass burnt—a danger hitherto not courted by any” fn3 the italics in the text are the author’s this is admirably characteristic of the man asiatic christendom would not satisfy him he seems to hate the “damnable doctrines” of the “papists” almost as much as those of the moslems fn4 he must have been accustomed to long days’ journeys

make this a boast fn14 nothing more blindly prejudiced than this statement moslems turn towards meccah as christians towards jerusalem fn15 as will afterwards be explained all the four orthodox schools do not think it necessary to kiss the stone after each circumambulation fn16 these are mere local traditions the original ka’abah was composed of materials gathered from the six mountains of paradise chap xx the present building is of grey granite quarried in a hill near meccah fn17 now jabal nur fn18 they come from the wellknown taif which the country people call hijaz but never habbash the word taif literally means the “circumambulator” it is said that when adam settled at meccah finding the country barren he prayed to allah to supply him with a bit of fertile land immediately appeared a mountain which having performed tawaf round the ka’abah settled itself down eastward of meccah hence to the present day taif is called kita min alsham a piece of syria its fatherland fn19 this is an error of printing for “paces” fn20 pitts’ note not of massy gold as a late french author who i am sure was never there says the door is of wood only plated over with silver much less is the inside of the beat ceiled with massy gold as the same frenchman asserts i can assure the world it is no such thing the door is of wood thickly plated over with silver in many parts gilt and whatever hereabouts is gilt the meccans always call gold rfb fn21 this is no longer the case few women ever enter the ka’abah on account of the personal danger they run there fn22 more correctly at three of the corners and the fourth opposite the southern third of the western wall fn23 it is deemed disrespectful to look at the ceiling but pilgrims may turn their eyes in any other direction they please

sweet and as good as any others for aught as i could perceive pitts has just remarked that he found the waters of zemzem brackish to my taste it was a saltbitter which was exceedingly disagreeable rfb fn31 they are not so modest 600000 is the mystical number others declare it to be incalculable oftentimes 70000 have met at arafat fn32 the cupola has now disappeared there is a tall pillar of

muzdalifah fn35 this i need scarcely say is speaking as a christian all moslems believe that ishmael and not isaac was ordered to be sacrificed the place to which pitts alludes is still shown to pilgrims fn36 pitts’ note monsieur de thevenot saith that they throw these stones at the gibbel or mount but indeed it is otherwise though i must needs say he is very exact in almost every thing of turkish matters and i pay much deference to that great author fn37 the rami or jaculator now usually says as he casts each stone “in the name of allah and allah is omnipotent raghman li’sh’ shaytani

only light the lamps in and sweep the passage round the sepulchre fn51 these are the small apertures in the southern grating see chap xvi fn52 the caravan must have been near the harbour of muwaylah where supplies are abundant  p390appendix vi  giovanni finati  the third pilgrim on our list is giovanni finati who under the moslem name of “haji mohammed” made the campaign against the wahhabis for the recovery of meccah and almadinah a native of ferrara the eldest of the four scions of a small landed proprietor “tenderly attached to his mother” and brought up most unwillingly for a holy vocation—to use his own words “instructed in all that course of frivolous and empty ceremonials and mysteries which form a principal feature in the training of a priest for the romish church” in ad 1805 giovanni finati’s name appeared in the list of italian conscripts after a few vain struggles with fate he was marched to milan drilled and trained the next year his division was ordered to the tyrol where the young man “brought up for the church” instantly deserted discovered in his native town he was sent under circumstances of suitable indignity to join his regiment at venice where a general act of grace promulgated on occasion of napoleon’s short visit preserved him from a platoon of infantry his next move was to spalato in dalmatia where he marched under general marmont to cattaro the last retreat of the hardy and warlike montenegrins at budoa a seaport se of ragusa having consulted an albanian “captainmerchant” giovanni finati and fifteen other italians—  p391 “including the sergeant’s wife” swore fidelity to one another and deserted with all their arms and accoutrements they passed into the albanese territory and were hospitably treated as “soldiers who had deserted from the infidel army in dalmatia” by the pasha posted at antivari to keep check upon the french operations at first they were lodged in the mosque and the sergeant’s wife had been set apart from the rest but as they refused to apostatize they were made common slaves and worked at the quarries till their “backs were sore” under these circumstances the sergeant discovering and promulgating his discovery that “the mahometans believe as we do in a god and upon examination that we might find the differences from our mother church to be less than we had imagined”—all at once came the determination of professing to be mohammedans our italian candide took the name of mahomet and became pipebearer to a turkish general officer in the garrison this young man trusted the deserter to such an extent that the doors of the harim were open to himfn1 and giovanni finati repaid his kindness by seducing fatimah a georgian girl his master’s favourite wife the garrison then removed to scutari being of course hated by his fellow servants the renegade at last fell into disgrace and exchanging the pipestick for the hatchet he became a hewer of wood this degradation did not diminish poor fatimah’s affection she continued to visit him and to leave little presents and tokens for him in his room but presently the girl proved likely to become a mother—their intercourse was more than suspected—giovanni finati had a dread of circumcisionfn2  p392 so he came to the felon resolution of flying alone from scutari he happened to meet his “original friend the captainmerchant” and in march 1809 obtained from him a passage to egypt the aldorado to which all povertystruck albanian adventurers were then flocking at alexandria the new mahomet after twice deserting from a christian service at the risk of life and honour voluntarily enlisted as an albanian private soldier in a moslem land the naïvete with which he admires and comments upon his conduct is a curious moral phenomenon thence he proceeded to cairo and became a “balik bash” corporal in charge of six albanian privates of mohammed ali’s bodyguard ensued a campaign against the mamluks in upper egypt and his being present at the massacre of those miscreants in the citadel of cairo—he confined his part in the affair to plundering from the beys a “saddle richly mounted in silver gilt” and a slave girl with trinkets and money he married the captive and was stationed for six months at matariyah heliopolis with the force preparing to march upon meccah under tussun pasha here he suffered from thieves and shot by mistake his bim bashi or sergeant who was engaged in the unwonted and dangerous exercise of prayer in the dark the affair was compromised by the amiable young commanderinchief who paid the blood money amounting to some thousand piastres on the 6th october 1811 the army started for suez where eighteen vessels waited to convey them to yambu’ mahomet assisted at the capture of that port and was fortunate enough to escape alive from the desperate action of jadaydahfn3 rheumatism obliged him  p393 to return to cairo where he began by divorcing his wife for great levity of conduct in the early part of 1814 mahomet inspired by the news of mohammed ali pasha’s success in alhijaz joined a reinforcement of albanians travelled to suez touched at yambu’ and at jeddah assisted at the siege and capture of kunfudah and was present at its recapture by the wahhabis wounded sick harassed by the badawin and disgusted by his commanding officer he determined to desert again adding as an excuse “not that the step on my part at least had the character of a complete desertion since i intended to join the main body of the army” and to his mania for desertion we owe the following particulars concerning the city of meccah  “exulting in my escape my mind was in a state to receive very strong impressions and i was much struck with all i saw upon entering the city for though it is neither large nor beautiful in itself there is something in it that is calculated to impress a sort of awe and it was the hour of noon when everything is very silent except the muezzins calling from the minarets  “the principal feature of the city is that celebrated sacred enclosure which is placed about the centre of it it is a vast paved court with doorways opening into it from every side and with a covered colonnade carried all round like a cloister while in the midst of the open space stands the edifice called the caaba whose walls are entirely covered over on the outside with hangings of rich velvetfn4 on which there are arabic inscriptions embroidered in gold  “facing one of its angles for this little edifice is of  p394 a square formfn5 there is a well which is called the well zemzem of which the water is considered so peculiarly holy that some of it is even sent annually to the sultan at constantinople and no person who comes to meccah whether on pilgrimage or for mere worldly considerations ever fails both to drink of it and to use it in his ablutions since it is supposed to wipe out the stain of all past transgressions  “there is a stone also near the bottom of the building itself which all the visitants kiss as they pass round it and the multitude of them has been so prodigious as to have worn the surface quite away  “quite detached but fronting to the caaba stand four pavilions corresponding to the four sects of the mahometan religion adapted for the pilgrims and though the concourse had of late years been from time to time much interrupted there arrived just when i came to meccah two caravans of them one asiatic and one from the african side amounting to not less than about 40000 persons who all seemed to be full of reverence towards the holy placefn6”  after commenting on the crowded state of the city the lodging of pilgrims in tents and huts or on the bare ground outside the wallsfn7 and the extravagant prices of provisions haji mahomet proceeds with his description  “over and above the general ceremonies of the purification at the well and of the kissing of the cornerstonefn8  p395and of the walking round the caaba a certain number of times in a devout manner every one has also his own separate prayers to put up and so to fulfil the conditions of his vow and the objects of his particular pilgrimage”  we have then an account of the mosquepigeons for whom it is said “some pilgrims bring with them even from the most remote countries a small quantity of grain with which they may take the opportunity of feeding these birds” this may have occurred in times of scarcity the grain is now sold in the mosque  “the superstitions and ceremonies of the place” we are told “are by no means completed within the city for the pilgrims after having performed their devotions for a certain time at the caaba at last in a sort of procession go to a place called arafat an eminence which stands detached in the centre of a valley and in the way thither there is a part of the road for about the space of a mile where it is customary to runfn9 the road also passes near a spot where was formerly a well which is superstitiously supposed to be something unholy and cursed by the prophet himself and for this reason every pilgrim as he goes by it throws a stone and the custom is so universal and has prevailed so long that none can be picked up in the neighbourhood and it is necessary therefore to provide them from a distance and some persons even bring them out of their own remote countries thinking thereby to gain the greater favour in the sight of heavenfn10  p396“beyond this point stands a columnfn11 which is set up as the extreme limit of the pilgrimage and this every pilgrim must have passed before sunrise while all such as have not gone beyond it by that time must wait till the next year if they wish to be entitled to the consideration and privileges of complete hajis since without this circumstance all the rest remains imperfect  “the hill of arafat lying at a distance of seven hours from meccah it is necessary to set out very early in order to be there in time many of the pilgrims and especially the more devout amongst them performing all the way on foot  “when they have reached the placefn12 all who have any money according to their means sacrifice a sheep and the rich often furnish those who are poor and destitute with the means of buying one  “such a quantity of sacrifices quite fills the whole open space with victims and the poor flock from all the country round to have meat distributed to them  “after which at the conclusion of the whole ceremony all the names are registered by a scribe appointed for the purposefn13 and when this is finished the african  p397 and asiatic caravans part company and return to their own several countries many detachments of the pilgrims visiting medinah in the way”  being desirous of enrolment in some new division of mohammed ali’s army finati overcame the difficulty of personal access to him by getting a memorial written in turkish and standing at the window of a house joined on to the enclosure of the great temple after the sixth day the pasha observed him and in the “greatest rage imaginable” desired a detailed account of the defeat at kunfudah finati then received five hundred piastres and an order to join a corps at taif together with a strict charge of secrecy “since it was of importance that no reverse or check should be generally talked of” before starting our author adds some “singular particulars” which escaped him in his account of meccah  “many of the pilgrims go through the ceremony of walking the entire circuit of the city upon the outside and the order in which this is performed is as follows the devoted first goes without the gates and after presenting himself there to the religious officer who presides throws off all his clothes and takes a sort of large wrapping garment in lieu of them to cover himself upon which he sets off walking at a very quick pace or rather running to reach the nearest of the four corners of the city a sort of guide going with him at the same rate all the way who prompts certain ejaculations or prayers which he ought to mention at particular spots as he passes at every angle he finds a barber who with wonderful quickness wets and shaves one quarter of his head and so on till he has reached the barber at the fourth angle who completes the work after which the  p398 pilgrim takes his clothes again and has finished that act of devotionfn14  “there is also near the holy city an eminence called the hill of lightfn15 as i imagine from its remarkable whiteness upon this the pilgrims have a custom of leaping while they repeat at the same time prayers and verses of the koran many also resort to a lesser hill about a mile distant from the city on which there is a small mosque which is reputed as a place of great sanctity  “an annual ceremony takes place in the great temple itself which is worth mentioning before i quit the subject altogether  “i have already spoken of the little square building whose walls are covered with hangings of black and gold and which is called the caaba once in the yearfn16 and once only this holy of holies is opened and as there is nothing to prevent admission it appears surprising at first to see so few who are willing to go into the interior and especially since this act is supposed to have great efficacy in the remission of all past sins but the reason must be sought for in the conditions which are annexed since he who enters is in the first place bound to exercise no gainful pursuit or trade or to work for his livelihood  p399 in any way whatever and next he must submit patiently to all offences and injuries and must never again touch anything that is impure or unholyfn17”  “one more remark with reference to the great scene of sacrifice at arafat though the pasha’s power in arabia had been now for some time established yet it was not complete or universal by any means—the wahhabees still retaining upon many sides a very considerable footing so that open and unprotected places even within half a day’s journey of meccah might be liable to surprise and violence”  for these reasons our author informs us a sufficient force was disposed round arafat and the prodigious multitude went and returned without molestation or insultfn18       p400 after the pilgrimage haji mahomet repaired to taif on the road he remarked a phenomenon observable in alhijaz—the lightness of the nights there finati attributes it to the southern position of the place but observing a perceptible twilight there i was forced to seek further cause may not the absence of vegetation and the heatabsorbing nature of the soil—granite quartz and basalt—account for the phenomenonfn19 the natives as usual observing it have invested its origin with the garb of fable  it is not my intention to accompany mahomet to the shameful defeat of taraba where tussun pasha lost three quarters of his army or to the glorious victory of bissel where mohammed ali on the 10th january 1815 broke 24000 wahhabis commanded by faysal bin sa’ud his account of this interesting campaign is not full or accurate like mengin’s still being the tale of an eyewitness it attracts attention nothing can be more graphic than his picture of the old conqueror sitting with exulting countenance upon the carpet where he had vowed to await death or victory and surrounded by heaps of enemies’ headsfn20  still less would it be to the purpose to describe the latter details of haji mahomet’s career his return to cairo his accompanying mr bankes to upper egypt and syria and his various trips to aleppo kurdistan the  p401 sa’id the great oasis nabathaea senna’ar and dongola we concede to him the praise claimed by his translator that he was a traveller to no ordinary extent but beyond this we cannot go he was so ignorant that he had forgotten to writefn21 his curiosity and his powers of observation keep pace with his knowledgefn22 his moral character as it appears in print is of that description which knows no sense of shame it is not candour but sheer insensibility which makes him relate circumstantially his repeated desertions his betrayal of fatimah and his various plunderings  fn1 he describes the harim as containing “the females of different countries all of them young and all more or less attractive and the merriest creatures i ever saw” his narration proves that affection and fidelity were not wanting there fn2 mr bankes finati’s employer and translator here comments upon ali bey’s assertion “even to travellers in mahometan countries i look upon the safety of their journey as almost impossible unless they have previously submitted to the rite” ali bey is correct the danger is doubled by noncompliance with the custom mr bankes apprehends that “very few renegadoes do submit to it” in bigoted moslem countries it is considered a sine qua non fn3 see chap xiii of this work fn4 “black cloth according to ali bey and i believe he is correct” so mr bankes if ali bey meant broadcloth both are in error as the specimen in my possession—a mixture of silk and cotton—proves fn5 ali bey showed by his measurements that no two sides correspond exactly to all appearance the sides are equal though it is certain they are not the height exceeds the length and the breadth fn6 ali bey ad 1807 computes 80000 men 2000 women and 1000 children at arafat burckhardt ad 1814 calculated it at 70000 i do not think that in all there were more than 50000 souls assembled together in 1853 fn7 rich pilgrims always secure lodgings the poorer class cannot afford them therefore the great caravans from egypt damascus baghdad and other places pitch on certain spots outside the city fn8 an incorrect expression the stone is fixed in a massive gold or silver gilt circle to the se angle but it is not part of the building fn9 ali bey is correct in stating that the running is on the return from arafat directly after sunset fn10 this sentence abounds in blunders sale ali bey and burckhardt all give correct accounts of the little pillar of masonry—it has nothing to do with the well—which denotes the place where satan appeared to abraham the pilgrims do not throw one stone but many the pebbles are partly brought from muzdalifah partly from the valley of muna in which stands the pillar fn11 mr bankes confounds this column with the devil’s pillar at muna finati alludes to the landmarks of the arafat plain now called alalamayn the two marks the pilgrims must stand within these boundaries on a certain day the 9th of zu’l hijjah otherwise he has failed to observe a rital ordinance fn12 he appears to confound the proper place with arafat the sacrifice is performed in the valley of muna after leaving the mountain but finati we are told by his translator wrote from memory—a pernicious practice for a traveller fn13 this custom is now obsolete as regards the grand body of pilgrims anciently a certificate from the sharif was given to all who could afford money for a proof of having performed the pilgrimage but no such practice at present exists my friends have frequently asked me what proof there is of a moslem’s having become a haji none whatever consequently impostors abound sa’adi in the gulistan notices a case but the ceremonies of the hajj are so complicated and unintelligible by mere description that a little crossquestioning applied to the false haji would easily detect him fn14 no wonder mr bankes is somewhat puzzled by this passage certainly none but a pilgrim could guess that the author refers to the rites called alumrah and alsai or the running between mounts safa and marwah the curious reader may compare the above with burckhardt’s correct description of the ceremonies as regards the shaving finati possibly was right in his day in ali bey’s as in my time the head was only shaved once and a few strokes of the razor sufficed for the purpose of religious tonsure fn15 jabal nur anciently hira is a dull grey as of granite it derives its modern name from the spiritual light of religion circumstances prevented my ascending it so i cannot comment upon finati’s “custom of leaping” fn16 open three days in the year according to ali bey the same in burckhardt’s and in my time besides these public occasions private largesses can always turn the key fn17 i heard from good authority that the ka’abah is never opened without several pilgrims being crushed to death ali bey remarks mr bankes says nothing of the supposed conditions annexed in my next volume part iii “meccah” of this work i shall give them as i received them from the lips of learned and respectable moslems they differ considerably from finati’s and no wonder his account is completely opposed to the strong good sense which pervades the customs of alislam as regards his sneer at the monastic orders in italy—that the conditions of entering are stricter and more binding than those of the ka’abah yet that numbers are ready to profess in them—it must not be imagined that arab human nature differs very materially from italian many unworthy feet pass the threshold of the ka’abah but there are many moslems my friend omar effendi for instance who have performed the pilgrimage a dozen times and would never from conscientious motives enter the holy edifice fn18 in 1807 according to ali bey the wahhabis took the same precaution says mr bankes the fact is some such precautions must always be taken the pilgrims are forbidden to quarrel to fight or to destroy life except under circumstances duly provided for moreover as i shall explain in another part of this work it was of old and still is the custom of the fiercer kind of badawin to flock to arafat—where the victim is sure to be found—for the purpose of revenging their bloodlosses as our authorities at aden well know there cannot be a congregation of different arab tribes without a little murder after fighting with the common foe or if unable to fight with him the wild men invariably turn their swords against their private enemies fn19 so on the wild and treeclad heights of the neilgherry hills despite the brilliance of the stars every traveller remarks the darkness of the atmosphere at night fn20 mohammed ali gave six dollars for every arab head which fact accounts for the heaps that surrounded him one would suppose that when acting against an enemy so quick and agile as the arabs such an order would be an unwise one experience however proves the contrary fn21 “finati’s long disuse of european writing” says mr bankes “made him very slow with his pen” fortunately he found in london some person who took down the story in easy unaffected and not inelegant italian in 1828 mr bankes translated it into english securing accuracy by consulting the author when necessary fn22 his translator and editor is obliged to explain that he means cufic by “characters that are not now in use” and the statue of memnon by “one of two enormous sitting figures in the plain from which according to an old story or superstition a sound proceeds when the sun rises” when the crew of his nileboat “form in circle upon the bank and perform a sort of religious mummery shaking their heads and shoulders violently and uttering a hoarse sobbing or barking noise till some of them would drop or fall into convulsions”—a sight likely to excite the curiosity of most men—he “takes his gun in pursuit of wild geese” he allowed mr bankes’ mare to eat oleander leaves and thus to die of the commonest poison briefly he seems to have been a man who under favourable circumstances learned as little as possible  p402appendix vii  notes on my journey  by a sprenger  in the map to a former edition of the pilgrimage captain burton’s route from madina to meccah is wrongly laid down owing to a typographical error of the text “from wady laymun to meccah se 45°” see vol ii p 155 ante whereas the road runs sw 45° or as hamdany expresses himself in the commentary on the qacyda rod “between west and south and therefore the setting sun shines at the evening prayer your face being turned towards meccah on your right temple” the account of the eastern route from madina to meccah by so experienced a traveller as captain burton is an important contribution to our geographical knowledge of arabia it leads over the lower terrace of nejd the country which muslim writers consider as the home of the genuine arabs and the scene of arabic chivalry as by this mistake the results of my friend’s pilgrimage which though pious as he unquestionably is he did not undertake from purely religious motives have been in a great measure marred i called in 1871 his attention to it at the same time i submitted to him a sketch of a map in which his own and burckhardt’s routes are protracted and a few notes culled from arabic geographers with the intention of showing how much light his investigations throw on early  p403 geography if illustrated by a corrected map and how they fail to fulfil this object if the mistake is not cleared up the enterprising traveller approved of both the notes and the map and expressed it as his opinion that it might be useful to append them to the new edition i therefore thought proper to recast them and to present them herewith to the reader  at sufayna burton found the baghdad caravan the regular baghdadmeccah road of which we have two itineraries the one reproduced by hamdany and the other by ibn khordadbeh qodama and others keeps to the left of sufayna and runs parallel with the eastern madinameccah road to within one stage of meccah we find only one passage in arabic geographers from which we learn that the baghdadlies as long as a thousand years ago used under certain circumstances to take the way of sufayna yacut vol iii p 403 says “sufayna arabic cufayna a place in the caliya highland within the territory of the solaymites lies on the road of zobayda the pilgrims make a roundabout and take this road if they suffer from want of water the pass of sufayna by which they have to descend is very difficult” the ridges over which the road leads are called alsitar and are described by yacut vol iii p 38 as a range of red hills flanking sufayna with defiles which serve as passes burton vol ii p 128 describes them as low hills of red sandstone and bright porphyry zobayda whose name the partly improved partly newly opened hajjroad from baghdad to meccah bore was the wife of caliph harun and it appears from burton pp 134 and 136 that the improvements made by this spirited woman—as the wells near ghadir and the birkat tank—are now ascribed to her weak fantastical and contemptible husband  burton’s description of the plain covered with huge boulders and detached rocks p 131 puts us in mind of  p404 the felsenmeer in the odenwald yacut vol iii p 370 describes the two most gigantic of these rockpillars which are too far to the left of burton’s road than that he could have seen them “below sufayna in a desert plain there rise two pillars so high that nobody unless he be a bird can mount them the one is called camud column of alban after the place alban and the other camud of alsafh they are both on the righthand side of the regular road from baghdad to meccah one mile from ofayciya a station on the regular road which answers to sufayna” such desolate fantastic scenery is not rare in arabia nor close to the western coast of the red sea the fiumara from which burton p 138 emerged at six am sept 9 was crossed by burckhardt at kholayc and is a more important feature of the country than the two travellers were aware of there are only five or six wadies which break through the chain of mountains that runs parallel with the red sea and of these proceeding from south to north wady nakhla wady laymun is the first and this fiumara the second early geographers call it wady amaj or after a place of some importance situated in its lower course wady saya hamdany p 294 says “amaj and ghoran are two wadies which commence in the harra volcanic region of the beni solaym and reach the sea” the descriptions of this wady compiled by yacut vol iii pp 26 and 839 are more ample according to one it contains seventy springs according to another it is a wady which you overlook if you stand on the sharat the mountain now called jebel cobh in its upper course it runs between the two hamiya which is the name of two black volcanic regions it contains several villages of note and there lead roads to it from various parts of the country in its uppermost part lies the village of faric with dategroves cultivated fields and gardens producing plantains pomegranates and grapes and in its lower  p405 course close to saya the rich and populous village mahaya the whole wady is one of the acradh oasislike districts of madina and is administered by a lieutenant of the governor of that city yacut makes the remark to this description “i do not know whether this valley is still in the same condition or whether it has altered” though we know much less of it than yacut we may safely assert that the cultivation has vanished and the condition has altered  at zariba arabic dhariba burton and his party put on the ihram pilgrimgarb if the baghdadlies follow the regular road they perform this ceremony at dzatirq which lies somewhat lower down than dhariba to the southeast of it and therefore the rainwater which falls in dhariba flows in the shape of a torrent to dzatirq and is thence carried off by the northern nakhla above the station of dzatirq there rise ridges called irq up these ridges the regular baghdad road ascends to the highplateau and they are therefore considered by early geographers as the western limit of nejd omara apud yacut vol iv p 746 says “all the country in which the water flows in an easterly northeasterly direction beginning from dzatirq as far as babylonia is called nejd and the country which slopes westwards from dzatirq to tihama the coast is called hijaz” the remarks of arabic geographers on the western watershed and those of burton vol ii pp 142 and 154 illustrate and complete each other most satisfactorily it appears from yacut that the fiumara in which burton’s party was attacked by robbers takes its rise at ghomayr close to dzatirq that there were numerous dategroves in it and that it falls at bostan ibn camir into the nakhla wherefore it is called the northern nakhla the southern nakhla also called simply nakhla a term which is sometimes reserved for the trunk formed by the junction of the southern and northern  p406 nakhla from bostan ibn camir downwards is on account of its history one of the most interesting spots in all arabia i therefore make no apology for entering on its geography in our days it is called wady laymun and burckhardt vol i p 158 says of it “zeyme is a halfruined castle at the eastern extremity of wady lymoun with copious springs of running water wady lymoun is a fertile valley which extends for several hours towards west in the direction of wady fatme anciently called batn marr or marrtzahran which is in fact a continuation of wady nakhla it has many dateplantations and formerly the ground was cultivated but this i believe has ceased since the wahabi invasion its fruitgardens too have been ruined this he means the village laymun compare burton vol ii p 147 is the last stage of the easternsyrian hadj route to the southeast or eastsoutheast of wady lymoun is another fertile valley called wady medyk where some sherifs are settled and where sherif ghaleb possessed landed propertyfn1” in the commentary on the qacyda rod  p407 wady nakhla as far as the road to meccah runs through it is described as follows from the ridges with whose declivity the western watershed begins you descend into wady baubat it is flanked on the left side by the sarat mountains on which tayif stands and contains qarnalmanazil once the capital of the minaeans the great trading nation of antiquity three or four miles below qarn is masjid ibrahym and here the valley assumes the name of wady nakhla at no great distance from the masjid there rise on the lefthand side of the wady two high peaks called jebel yasum and jebel kafw both were the refuge of numerous monkeys who used to invade the neighbouring vineyards as you go down wady nakhla the first place of importance you meet is alzayma close to it was a garden which during the reign of moqtadir belonged to the hashimite prince abd allah and was in a most flourishing condition it produced an abundance of henna plantains and vegetables of every description and yielded a revenue of five thousand dinarmithqals about £2860 annually a canal from wady the river nakhla feeds a fountain which jets forth in the midst of the garden and lower down a tank in the garden stood a fort which in a dilapidated condition is extant to this day and spoken of by burckhardt it was built of huge stones guarded for the defence of the property by the banu sa’d and tenanted by the servants and followers of the proprietor below alzayma is sabuha a poststation where a relay of horses was kept for the transport of government despatches to give an idea of the distances i may mention that the poststages were twelve arabic miles asunder which on this road are rather larger than an english geographical mile the first station from meccah was moshash the second sabuha and the third was at the foot of the hill yasum the author of the commentary from which i derive this information leaves wady nakhla soon after sabuha and  p408 turns his steps towards the holy city he mentions “the steep rocky pass” up which burton toiled with difficulty and calls it orayk though he enters into many details he takes no notice of the hillgirt plain called sola this name occurs however in an arabic verse apud yacut vol ii p 968 “in summer our pasturegrounds are in the country of nakhla within the districts of alzayma and sola”  in wady fatima burckhardt found a perennial rivulet coming from the eastward about three feet broad and two feet deep it is certain that wady fatima formerly called wady marr is a continuation of wady nakhla and yacut considers in one passage nakhla as a subdivision of marr and in another marr as part of wady nakhla but we do not know whether the rivulet which at alzayma seems to be of considerable size disappears under the sand in order to come forth again in wady marr or whether it forms an uninterrupted stream in ancient times the regular baghdadmeccah road did not run down from dzatirq by the northern nakhla which burton followed but it crossed this wady near its northern end and struck over to the southern nakhla as far as qarn almarazil which for a long time was the second station from meccah instead of dzatcirq  fn1 medyq is burton’s elmazik the spelling in arabic being arabic madhyq burckhardt’s account leads us to think that the village now called madhyq or wady laymun lies on the left bank of the fiumara and is identical with bostan ibn ’amir which is described by yacut as situated in the fork between the northern and southern nakhlas and which in ancient times had like the village wady laymun the name of the valley of which it was the chief place viz batn nakhla burton gives no information of the position of the village but he says “on the right bank of the fiumara stood the meccan sharif’s state pavilion” unless the pavilion is separated from the village by the fiumara there is a discrepancy between the two accounts which leads me to suspect that “right” is an oversight for “left” anciently arabic was pronounced nakhlat and if we suppress the guttural as the greeks and romans sometimes did nalat strabo p 782 in his narrative of the retreat of aelius gallus mentions a place which he calls maltha and of which he says it stood on the bank of a river—a position which few towns in arabia have the context leaves no doubt that he means batn nakhla and that maltha is a mistake for naltha  p409appendix viii  the meccah pilgrimage  having resolved to perform the meccah pilgrimage i spent a few months at cairo and on the 22nd of may embarked in a small steamer at suez with the “mahmil” or litter and its military escort conveying the “kiswah” or covering for the “kabah” on the 25th the man at the wheel informed us that we were about to pass the village of rabikh on the arabian coast and that the time had consequently arrived for changing our usual habiliments for the “ihram” or pilgrimcostume of two towels and for taking the various interdictory vows involved in its assumption such as not to tie knots in any portion of our dress not to oil the body and not to cut our nails or hair nor to improve the tints of the latter with the coppery red of henna transgression of these and other ceremonial enactments is expiated either by animal sacrifice or gifts of fruit or cereals to the poor  after a complete ablution and assuming the ihram we performed two prayerflections and recited the meritorious sentences beginning with the words “labbaik allah huma labbaik” “here i am o god here i am here i am o unassociated one here i am for unto thee belong praise grace and empire o unassociated one”  this prayer was repeated so often people not unfrequently rushing up to their friends and shrieking the sacred sentence into their ears that at last it became a signal for merriment rather than an indication of piety  p410on the 26th we reached jeddah where the utter sterility of arabia with its dunes and rocky hills becomes apparent the town however viewed from the sea is not unpicturesque many european vessels were at anchor off the coast and as we entered the port innumerable small fishingboats darting in all directions their sails no longer white but emerald green from the intense lustre of the water crowded around us on all sides and reminded one by their dazzling colours and rapidity of motion of the shoals of porpoises so often seen on a voyage round the cape  on disembarking we were accosted by several “mutawwafs” or circuitmen so termed in arabic because besides serving as religious guides in general their special duty is to lead the pilgrim in his seven obligatory circuits around the kabah we encamped outside the town and having visited the tomb of “our mother eve” mounted our camels for meccah   after a journey of twenty hours across the desert we passed the barriers which mark the outermost limits of the sacred city and ascending some giant steps pitched our tents on a plain or rather plateau surrounded by barren rock some of which distant but a few yards mask from view the birthplace of the prophet it was midnight a few drops of rain were falling and lightning played around us day after day we had watched its brightness from the sea and many a faithful haji had pointed out to his companions those fires which were heaven’s witness to the sanctity of the spot “al hamdu lillah” thanks be to god we were now at length to gaze upon the “kiblah” to which every mussulman has turned in prayer since the days of muhammad and which for long ages before the birth of christianity was reverenced by the patriarchs of the east soon after dawn arose from our midst the shout of “labbaik labbaik” and passing  p411 between the rocks we found ourselves in the main street of meccah and approached the “gateway of salvation” one of the thirtynine portals of the temple of alharam  on crossing the threshold we entered a vast unroofed quadrangle a mighty amplification of the palais royal having on each of its four sides a broad colonnade divided into three aisles by a multitude of slender columns and rising to the height of about thirty feet surmounting each arch of the colonnade is a small dome in all there are a hundred and twenty and at different points arise seven minarets dating from various epochs and of somewhat varying altitudes and architecture the numerous pigeons which have their home within the temple have been believed never to alight upon any portion of its roof thus miraculously testifying to the holiness of the building this marvel having however of late years been suspended many discern another omen of the approach of the longpredicted period when unbelievers shall desecrate the hallowed soil  in the centre of the square area rises the farfamed kabah the funereal shade of which contrasts vividly with the sunlit walls and precipices of the town it is a cubical structure of massive stone the upper twothirds of which are mantled by a black cloth embroidered with silver and the lower portion hung with white linen at a distance of several yards it is surrounded by a balustrade provided with lamps which are lighted in the evening and the space thus enclosed is the circuitground along which day and night crowds of pilgrims performing the circular ceremony of tawaf realize the idea of perpetual motion we at once advanced to the black stone imbedded in an angle of the kabah kissed it and exclaimed “bismillah wa allahu akbar”—“in god’s name and god is greatest” then we commenced the usual seven rounds three at a walking pace and four at a brisk trot next  p412 followed two prayerflections at the tomb of abraham after which we drank of the water of zamzam said to be the same which quenched the thirst of hagar’s exhausted son  besides the kabah eight minor structures adorn the quadrangle the well of zamzam the library the clockroom the triangular staircase and four ornamental restingplaces for the orthodox sects of hanafi shafi maliki and hanbali  we terminated our morning duties by walking and running seven times along the streets of safa and marwa so named from the flight of seven steps at each of its extremities  after a few days spent in visiting various places of interest such as the slavemarket and forts and the houses of the prophet and the caliphs ’ali and abubakr we started on our six hours’ journey to the mountain of ’arifat an hour’s sojourn at which even in a state of insensibility confers the rank of haji it is a mountain spur of about a hundred and fifty feet in height presenting an artificial appearance from the wall encircling it and the terrace on its slope from which the iman delivers a sermon before the departure of his congregation for meccah his auditors were indeed numerous their tents being scattered over two or three miles of the country a great number of their inmates were fellowsubjects of ours from india i surprised some of my meccah friends by informing them that queen victoria numbers nearly twenty millions of mohammedans among her subjects  on the 5th of june at sunset commencing our return we slept at the village of muzdalifah and there gathered and washed seven pebbles of the size of peas to be flung at three piles of whitewashed masonry known as the shaitans satans of mun we acquitted ourselves satisfactorily of this duty on the festival of the 6th of p413 june the 10th day of the arabian month zu’lhijah each of us then sacrificed a sheep had his hair and nails cut exchanged the ihram for his best apparel and embracing his friends paid them the compliments of the season the two following days the great the middle and the little satan were again pelted and bequeathing to the unfortunate inhabitants of muna the unburied and odorous remains of nearly a hundred thousand animals we returned eighty thousand strong to meccah a week later having helped to insult the tumulus of stones which marks according to popular belief the burialplace of abulahab the unbeliever who we learn from the koran has descended into hell with his wife gatherer of sticks i was not sorry to relinquish a shade temperature of 120° and wend my way to jeddah en route for england after delegating to my brethren the recital of a prayer in my behalf at the tomb of the prophet at medina  in penning these lines i am anxious to encourage other englishmen especially those from india to perform the pilgrimage without being deterred by exaggerated reports concerning the perils of the enterprise it must however be understood that it is absolutely indispensable to be a mussulman at least externally and to have an arabic name neither the koran nor the sultan enjoins the killing of intrusive jews or christians nevertheless two years ago an incognito jew who refused to repeat the creed was crucified by the meccah populace and in the event of a pilgrim again declaring himself to be an unbeliever the authorities would be almost powerless to protect his life  an englishman who is sufficiently conversant with the prayers formulas and customs of the mussulmans and possess a sufficient guarantee of orthodoxy need however apprehend no danger if he applies through the british consulate at cairo for an introduction to the amirul haj the prince of the caravan  p414finally i am most anxious to recommend as mutawwaf at meccah shaikh muhammed ’umr fanairjizadah he is extremely courteous and obliging and has promised me to show to other englishmen the same politeness which i experienced from him myself 1862 ad 1278 ah arabic el haj abd el wahid  end of volume ii  p415index  aakal or fillet of the arabs i 235 aaron
