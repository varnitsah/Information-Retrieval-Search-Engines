37023580	augustus does his bit  a truetolife farce   by george bernard shaw   i wish to express my gratitude for certain good offices which augustus secured for me in january 1917 i had been invited to visit the theatre of war in flanders by the commanderinchief an invitation which was under the circumstances a summons to duty thus i had occasion to spend some days in procuring the necessary passport and other official facilities for my journey it happened just then that the stage society gave a performance of this little play it opened the heart of every official to me i have always been treated with distinguished consideration in my contracts with bureaucracy during the war but on this occasion i found myself persona grata in the highest degree there was only one word when the formalities were disposed of and that was we are up against augustus all day the showingup of augustus scandalized one or two innocent and patriotic critics who regarded the prowess of the british army as inextricably bound up with highcastle prestige but our government departments knew better their problem was how to win the war with augustus on their backs wellmeaning brave patriotic but obstructively fussy selfimportant imbecile and disastrous  save for the satisfaction of being able to laugh at augustus in the theatre nothing as far as i know came of my dramatic reduction of him to absurdity generals admirals prime ministers and controllers not to mention emperors kaisers and tsars were scrapped remorselessly at home and abroad for their sins or services as the case might be but augustus stood like the eddystone in a storm and stands so to this day he gave us his word that he was indispensable and we took it  augustus does his bit was performed for the first time at the court theatre in london by the stage society on the 21st january 1917 with lalla vandervelde as the lady f bj sharp as lord augustus highcastle and charles rock as horatio floyd beamish     augustus does his bit  the mayors parlor in the town hall of little pifflington lord augustus highcastle a distinguished member of the governing class in the uniform of a colonel and very well preserved at fortyfive is comfortably seated at a writingtable with his heels on it reading the morning post the door faces him a little to his left at the other side of the room the window is behind him in the fireplace a gas stove on the table a bell button and a telephone portraits of past mayors in robes and gold chains adorn the walls an elderly clerk with a short white beard and whiskers and a very red nose shuffles in   augustus hastily putting aside his paper and replacing his feet on the floor hullo who are you  the clerk the staff a slight impediment in his speech adds to the impression of incompetence produced by his age and appearance  augustus you the staff what do you mean man  the clerk what i say there aint anybody else  augustus tush where are the others  the clerk at the front  augustus quite right most proper why arent you at the front  the clerk over age fiftyseven  augustus but you can still do your bit many an older man is in the grs or volunteering for home defence  the clerk i have volunteered  augustus then why are you not in uniform  the clerk they said they wouldnt have me if i was given away with a pound of tea told me to go home and not be an old silly a sense of unbearable wrong till now only smouldering in him bursts into flame young bill knight that i took with me got two and sevenpence i got nothing is it justice this country is going to the dogs if you ask me  augustus rising indignantly i do not ask you sir and i will not allow you to say such things in my presence our statesmen are the greatest known to history our generals are invincible our army is the admiration of the world furiously how dare you tell me that the country is going to the dogs  the clerk why did they give young bill knight two and sevenpence and not give me even my tram fare

their places you says that aint the way to recruit  augustus but i expressly told them their widows would have pensions  the clerk i heard you would have been all right if it had been the widows you wanted to get round  augustus rising angrily this town is inhabited by dastards i say it with a full sense of responsibility dastards they call themselves englishmen and they are afraid to fight  the clerk afraid to fight you should see them on a saturday night  augustus yes they fight one another but they wont fight the germans  the clerk they got grudges again one another how can they have grudges again the huns that they never saw theyve no imagination thats what it is bring the huns here and theyll quarrel with them fast enough  augustus returning to his seat with a grunt of disgust

they take the train  the clerk there aint no trains now theyve tore up the rails and sent them to the front  augustus psha  the clerk well we have to get about somehow  augustus this is perfectly monstrous not in the least what i intended  the clerk hell  augustus sir  the clerk explaining hell they says is paved with good intentions  augustus springing to his feet do you mean to insinuate that hell is paved with my good intentionswith the good intentions of his majestys government  the clerk i dont mean to insinuate anything until the defence of the realm act is repealed it aint safe  augustus they told me that this town had set an example to all england in the matter of economy i came down here to promise the mayor a knighthood for his exertions  the clerk the mayor where do i come in  augustus you dont come in you go out this is a fool of a place im greatly disappointed deeply disappointed flinging himself back into his chair disgusted  the clerk what more can we do weve shut up everything the picture gallery is shut the museum is shut the theatres and picture shows is shut i havent seen a movie picture for six months  augustus man man do you want to see picture shows when the hun is at the gate  the clerk mournfully i dont now though it drove me melancholy mad at first i was on the point of taking a pennorth of rat poison  augustus why didnt you  the clerk because a friend advised me to take to drink instead that saved my life though it makes me very poor company in the mornings as hiccuping perhaps youve noticed  augustus well upon my soul you are not ashamed to stand there and confess yourself a disgusting drunkard  the clerk well what of it were at war now and everythings changed besides i should lose my job here if i stood drinking at the bar im a respectable man and must buy my drink and take it home with me and they wont serve me with less than a quart if youd told me before the war that i could get through a quart of whisky in a day i shouldnt have believed you thats the good of war it brings out powers in a man that he never suspected himself capable of you said so yourself in your speech last night  augustus i did not know that i was talking to an imbecile you ought to be ashamed of yourself there must be an end of this drunken slacking im going to establish a new order of things here i shall come down every morning before breakfast until things are properly in train have a cup of coffee and two rolls for me here every morning at halfpast ten  the clerk you cant have no rolls the only baker that baked rolls was a hun and hes been interned  augustus quite right too and was there no englishman to take his place  the clerk there was but he was caught spying and they took him up to london and shot him  augustus shot an englishman  the clerk well it stands to reason if the germans wanted to spy they wouldnt employ a german that everybody would suspect dont it  augustus rising again do you mean to say you scoundrel that an englishman is capable of selling his country to the enemy for gold  the clerk not as a general thing i wouldnt say it but theres men here would sell their own mothers for two coppers if they got the chance  augustus beamish its an ill bird that fouls its own nest  the clerk it wasnt me that let little pifflington get foul i dont belong to the governing classes i only tell you why you cant have no rolls  augustus intensely irritated can you tell me where i can find an intelligent being to take my orders  the clerk one of the street sweepers used to teach in the school until it was shut up for the sake of economy will he do  augustus what you mean to tell me that when the lives of the gallant fellows in our trenches and the fate of the british empire depend on our keeping up the supply of shells you are wasting money on sweeping the streets  the clerk we have to we dropped it for a while but the infant death rate went up something frightful  augustus what matters the death rate of little pifflington in a moment like this think of our gallant soldiers not of your squalling infants  the clerk if you want soldiers you must have children you cant buy em in boxes like toy soldiers  augustus beamish the long and the short of it is you are no patriot go downstairs to your office and have that gas stove taken away and replaced by an ordinary grate the board of trade has urged on me the necessity for economizing gas  the clerk our orders from the minister of munitions is to use gas instead of coal because it saves material which is it to be  augustus bawling furiously at him both dont criticize your orders obey them yours not to reason why yours but to do and die thats war cooling down have you anything else to say  the clerk yes i want a rise  augustus reeling against the table in his horror a rise horatio floyd beamish do you know that we are at war  the clerk feebly ironical i have noticed something about it in the papers heard you mention it once or twice now i come to think of it  augustus our gallant fellows are dying in the trenches and you want a rise  the clerk what are they dying for to keep me alive aint it well whats the good of that if im dead of hunger by the time they come back  augustus everybody else is making sacrifices without a thought of self and you  the clerk not half they aint wheres the bakers sacrifice wheres the coal merchants wheres the butchers charging me double thats how they sacrifice themselves well i want to sacrifice myself that way too just double next saturday double and not a penny less or no secretary for you he stiffens himself shakily and makes resolutely for the door  augustus looking after him contemptuously go miserable progerman  the clerk rushing back and facing him who are you calling a progerman  augustus another word and i charge you under the act with discouraging me go  the clerk blenches and goes out cowed  the telephone rings  augustus taking up the telephone receiver hallo yes who are you oh blueloo is it yes theres nobody in the room fire away what a spy a woman yes brought it down with me do you suppose im such a fool as to let it out of my hands why it gives a list of all our antiaircraft emplacements from ramsgate to skegness the germans would give a million for itwhat  but how could she possibly know about it i havent mentioned it to a soul except of course dear lucy oh toto and lady popham and that lot they dont count theyre all right i mean that i havent mentioned it to any germans pooh dont you be nervous old chap i know you think me a fool but im not such a fool as all that if she tries to get it out of me ill have her in the tower before you ring up again the clerk returns shsh somebodys just come in ring off goodbye he hangs up the receiver  the clerk are you engaged his manner is strangely softened  augustus what business is that of yours however if you will take the trouble to read the society papers for this week you will see that i am engaged to the honorable lucy popham youngest daughter of  the clerk that aint what i mean can you see a female  augustus of course i can see a female as easily as a male do you suppose im blind  the clerk you dont seem to follow me somehow theres a female downstairs what you might call a lady she wants to know can you see her if i let her up  augustus oh you mean am i disengaged tell the lady i have just received news of the greatest importance which will occupy my entire attention for the rest of the day and that she must write for an appointment  the clerk ill ask her to explain her business to me i aint above talking to a handsome young female when i get the chance going  augustus stop does she seem to be a person of consequence  the clerk a regular marchioness if you ask me  augustus hm beautiful did you say  the clerk a human chrysanthemum sir believe me  augustus it will be extremely inconvenient for me to see her but the country is in danger and we must not consider our own comfort think how our gallant fellows are suffering in the trenches show her up the clerk makes for the door whistling the latest popular ballad stop whistling instantly sir this is not a casino  clerk aint it you just wait till you see her he goes out  augustus produces a mirror a comb and a pot of moustache pomade from the drawer of the writingtable and sits down before the mirror to put some touches to his toilet  the clerk returns devotedly ushering a very attractive lady brilliantly dressed she has a dainty wallet hanging from her wrist augustus hastily covers up his toilet apparatus with the morning post and rises in an attitude of pompous condescension  the clerk to augustus here she is to the lady may i offer you a chair lady he places a chair at the writingtable opposite augustus and steals out on tiptoe  augustus be seated madam  the lady sitting down are you lord augustus highcastle  augustus sitting also madam i am  tae lady with awe the great lord augustus  augustus i should not dream of describing myself so madam but no doubt i have impressed my countrymenand bowing gallantly may i say my countrywomenas having some exceptional claims to their consideration  the lady emotionally what a beautiful voice you have  augustus what you hear madam is the voice of my country which now takes a sweet and noble tone even in the harsh mouth of high officialism  the lady please go on you express yourself so wonderfully  augustus it would be strange indeed if after sitting on thirtyseven royal commissions mostly as chairman i had not mastered the art of public expression even the radical papers have paid me the high compliment of declaring that i am never more impressive than when i have nothing to say  the lady i never read the radical papers all i can tell you is that what we women admire in you is not the politician but the man of action the heroic warrior the beau sabreur  augustus gloomily madam i beg please my military exploits are not a pleasant subject unhappily  the lady oh i know i know how shamefully you have been treated what ingratitude but the country is with you the women are with you oh do you think all our hearts did not throb and all our nerves thrill when we heard how when you were ordered to occupy that terrible quarry in hulluch and you swept into it at the head of your men like a seagod riding on a tidal wave you suddenly sprang over the top shouting to berlin forward dashed at the german army singlehanded and were cut off and made prisoner by the huns  augustus yes madam and what was my reward they said i had disobeyed orders and sent me home have they forgotten nelson in the baltic has any british battle ever been won except by a bold initiative i say nothing of professional jealousy it exists in the army as elsewhere but it is a bitter thought to me that the recognition denied me by my countryor rather by the radical cabal in the cabinet which pursues my family with rancorous class hatredthat this recognition i say came to me at the hands of an enemyof a rank prussian  the lady you dont say so  augustus how else should i be here instead of starving to death in ruhleben yes madam the colonel of the pomeranian regiment which captured me after learning what i had done and conversing for an hour with me on european politics and military strategy declared that nothing would induce him to deprive my country of my services and set me free i offered of course to procure the release in exchange of a german officer of equal quality but he would not hear of it he was kind enough to say he could not believe that a german officer answering to that description existed with emotion i had my first taste of the ingratitude of my own country as i made my way back to our lines a shot from our front trench struck me in the head i still carry the flattened projectile as a trophy he throws it on the table the noise it makes testifies to its weight had it penetrated to the brain i might never have sat on another royal commission fortunately we have strong heads we highcastles nothing has ever penetrated to our brains  the lady how thrilling how simple and how tragic but you will forgive england remember england forgive her  augustus with gloomy magnanimity it will make no difference whatever to my services to my country though she slay me yet will i if not exactly trust in her at least take my part in her government i am ever at my countrys call whether it be the embassy in a leading european capital a governorgeneralship in the tropics or my humble mission here to make little pifflington do its bit i am always ready for the sacrifice whilst england remains england wherever there is a public job to be done you will find a highcastle sticking to it and now madam enough of my tragic personal history you have called on business what can i do for you  the lady you have relatives at the foreign office have you not  augustus haughtily madam the foreign office is staffed by my relatives exclusively  the lady has the foreign office warned you that you are being pursued by a female spy who is determined to obtain possession of a certain list of gun emplacements  augustus interrupting her somewhat loftily all that is perfectly well known to this department madam  the lady surprised and rather indignant is it who told you was it one of your german brothersinlaw  augustus injured remonstrating i have only three german brothersinlaw madam really from your tone one would suppose that i had several pardon my sensitiveness on that subject but reports are continually being circulated that i have been shot as a traitor in the courtyard of the ritz hotel simply because i have german brothersinlaw with feeling if you had a german brotherinlaw madam you would know that nothing else in the world produces so strong an antigerman feeling life affords no keener pleasure than finding a brotherinlaws name in the german casualty list  the lady nobody knows that better than i wait until you hear what i have come to tell you you will understand me as no one else could listen this spy this woman  augustus all attention yes  the lady she is a german a hun  augustus yes yes she would be continue  the lady she is my sisterinlaw  augustus deferentially i see you are well connected madam proceed  the lady need i add that she is my bitterest enemy  augustus may ihe proffers his hand they shake fervently from this moment onward augustus becomes more and more confidential gallant and charming  the lady quite so well she is an intimate friend of your brother at the war office hungerford highcastle blueloo as you call him i dont know why  augustus explaining he was originally called the singing oyster because he sang drawingroom ballads with such an extraordinary absence of expression he was then called the blue point for a season or two finally he became blueloo  the lady oh indeed i didnt know well blueloo is simply infatuated with my sisterinlaw and he has rashly let out to her that this list is in your possession he forgot himself because he was in a towering rage at its being entrusted to you his language was terrible he ordered all the guns to be shifted at once  augustus what on earth did he do that for  the lady i cant imagine but this i know she made a bet with him that she would come down here and obtain possession of that list and get clean away into the street with it he took the bet on condition that she brought it straight back to him at the war office  augustus good heavens and you mean to tell me that blueloo was such a dolt as to believe that she could succeed does he take me for a fool  the lady oh impossible he is jealous of your intellect the bet is an insult to you dont you feel that after what you have done for our country  augustus oh never mind that it is the idiocy of the thing i look at hell lose his bet and serve him right  the lady you feel sure you will be able to resist the siren i warn you she is very fascinating  augustus you need have no fear madam i hope she will come and try it on fascination is a game that two can play at for centuries the younger sons of the highcastles have had nothing to do but fascinate attractive females when they were not sitting on royal commissions or on duty at knightsbridge barracks by gad madam if the siren comes here she will meet her match  the lady i feel that but if she fails to seduce you  augustus blushing madam  the lady continuingfrom your allegiance  augustus oh that  the ladyshe will resort to fraud to force to anything she will burgle your office she will have you attacked and garotted at night in the street  augustus pooh im not afraid  the lady oh your courage will only tempt you into danger she may get the list after all it is true that the guns are moved but she would win her bet  augustus cautiously you did not say that the guns were moved you said that blueloo had ordered them to be moved  the lady well that is the same thing isnt it  augustus not quiteat the war office no doubt those guns will be moved possibly even before the end of the war  the lady then you think they are there still but if the german war office gets the listand she will copy it before she gives it back to blueloo you may depend on itall is lost  augustus lazily well i should not go as far as that lowering his voice will you swear to me not to repeat what i am going to say to you for if the british public knew that i had said it i should be at once hounded down as a progerman  the lady i will be silent as the grave i swear it  augustus again taking it easily well our people have for some reason made up their minds that the german war office is everything that our war office is notthat it carries promptitude efficiency and organization to a pitch of completeness and perfection that must be in my opinion destructive to the happiness of the staff my own viewwhich you are pledged remember not to betrayis that the german war office is no better than any other war office i found that opinion on my observation of the characters of my brothersinlaw one of whom by the way is on the german general staff i am not at all sure that this list of gun emplacements would receive the smallest attention you see there are always so many more important things to be attended to family matters and so on you understand  the lady still if a question were asked in the house of commons  augustus the great advantage of being at war madam is that nobody takes the slightest notice of the house of commons no doubt it is sometimes necessary for a minister to soothe the more seditious members of that assembly by giving a pledge or two but the war office takes no notice of such things  the lady staring at him then you think this list of gun emplacements doesnt matter  augustus by no means madam it matters very much indeed if this spy were to obtain possession of the list blueloo would tell the story at every dinnertable in london and  the lady and you might lose your post of course  augustus amazed and indignant i lose my post what are you dreaming about madam how could i possibly be spared there are hardly highcastles enough at present to fill half the posts created by this war no blueloo would not go that far he is at least a gentleman but i should be chaffed and frankly i dont like being chaffed  the lady of course not who does it would never do oh never never  augustus im glad you see it in that light and now as a measure of security i shall put that list in my pocket he begins searching vainly from drawer to drawer in the writingtable where on earth what the dickens did i thats very odd iwhere the deuce i thought i had put it in theoh here it is no this is lucys last letter  the lady elegiacally lucys last letter what a title for a picture play  augustus delighted yes it is isnt it lucy appeals to the imagination like no other woman by the way handing over the letter i wonder could you read it for me lucy is a darling girl but i really cant read her writing in london i get the office typist to decipher it and make me a typed copy but here there is nobody  the lady puzzling over it it is really almost illegible i think the beginning is meant for dearest gus  augustus eagerly yes that is what she usually calls me please go on  the lady trying to decipher it what awhat aoh yes what a forgetful oldsomethingyou are i cant make out the word  augustus greatly interested is it blighter that is a favorite expression of hers  the lady i think so at all events it begins with a b reading what a forgetful oldshe is interrupted by a knock at the door  augustus impatiently come in the clerk enters clean shaven and in khaki with an official paper and an envelope in his hand what is this ridiculous mummery sir  the clerk coming to the table and exhibiting his uniform to both theyve passed me the recruiting officer come for me ive had my two and seven  augustus rising wrathfully i shall not permit it what do they mean by taking my office staff good god they will be taking our hunt servants next confronting the clerk what did the man mean what did he say  the clerk he said that now you was on the job wed want another million men and he was going to take the oldage pensioners or anyone he could get  augustus and did you dare to knock at my door and interrupt my business with this lady to repeat this mans ineptitudes  the clerk no i come because the waiter from the hotel brought this paper you left it on the coffeeroom breakfasttable this morning  the lady intercepting it it is the list good heavens  the clerk proffering the envelope he says he thinks this is the envelope belonging to it  the lady snatching the envelope also yes addressed to you lord augustus augustus comes back to the table to look at it oh how imprudent everybody would guess its importance with your name on it fortunately i have some letters of my own here opening her wallet why not hide it in one of my envelopes then no one will dream that the enclosure is of any political value taking out a letter she crosses the room towards the window whispering to augustus as she passes him get rid of that man  augustus haughtily approaching the clerk who humorously makes a paralytic attempt to stand at attention have you any further business here pray  the clerk am i to give the waiter anything or will you do it yourself  augustus which waiter is it the english one  the clerk no the one that calls hisself a swiss shouldnt wonder if hed made a copy of that paper  augustus keep your impertinent surmises to yourself sir remember that you are in the army now and let me have no more of your civilian insubordination attention left turn quick march  the clerk stolidly i dunno what you mean  augustus go to the guardroom and report yourself for disobeying orders now do you know what i mean  the clerk now look here i aint going to argue with you  augustus nor i with you out with you  he seizes the clerk and rushes him through the door the moment the lady is left alone she snatches a sheet of official paper from the stationery rack folds it so that it resembles the list compares the two to see that they look exactly alike whips the list into her wallet and substitutes the facsimile for it then she listens for the return of augustus a crash is heard as of the clerk falling downstairs  augustus returns and is about to close the door when the voice of the clerk is heard from below  the clerk ill have the law of you for this i will  augustus shouting down to him theres no more law for you you scoundrel youre a soldier now he shuts the door and comes to the lady thank heaven the war has given us the upper hand of these fellows at last excuse my violence but discipline is absolutely necessary in dealing with the lower middle classes  the lady serve the insolent creature right look i have found you a beautiful envelope for the list an unmistakable ladys envelope she puts the sham list into her envelope and hands it to him  augustus excellent really very clever of you slyly come would you like to have a peep at the list beginning to take the blank paper from the envelope  the lady on the brink of detection no no oh please no  augustus why it wont bite you drawing it out further  the lady snatching at his hand stop remember if there should be an inquiry you must be able to swear that you never showed that list to a mortal soul  augustus oh that is a mere form if you are really curious  the lady i am not i couldnt bear to look at it one of my dearest friends was blown to pieces by an aircraft gun and since then i have never been able to think of one without horror  augustus you mean it was a real gun and actually went off how sad how sad he pushes the sham list back into the envelope and pockets it  the lady ah great sigh of relief and now lord augustus i have taken up too much of your valuable time goodbye  augustus what must you go  the lady you are so busy  augustus yes but not before lunch you know i never can do much before lunch and im no good at all in the afternoon from five to six is my real working time must you really go  the lady i must really i have done my business very satisfactorily thank you ever so much she proffers her hand  augustus shaking it affectionately as he leads her to the door but fast pressing the bell button with his left hand goodbye goodbye so sorry to lose you kind of you to come but there was no real danger you see my dear little lady all this talk about war saving and secrecy and keeping the blinds down at night and so forth is all very well but unless its carried out with intelligence believe me you may waste a pound to save a penny you may let out all sorts of secrets to the enemy you may guide the zeppelins right on to your own chimneys thats where the ability of the governing class comes in shall the fellow call a taxi for you  the lady no thanks i prefer walking goodbye again many many thanks  she goes out augustus returns to the writingtable smiling and takes another look at himself in the mirror the clerk returns with his head bandaged carrying a poker  the clerk what did you ring for augustus hastily drops the mirror dont you come nigh me or ill split your head with this poker thick as it is  augustus it does not seem to me an exceptionally thick poker i rang for you to show the lady out  the clerk shes gone she run out like a rabbit i ask myself why was she in such a hurry  the ladys voice from the street lord augustus lord augustus  the clerk shes calling you  augustus running to the window and throwing it up what is it wont you come up  the lady is the clerk there  augustus yes do you want him  the lady yes  augustus the lady wants you at the window

of his stationery rack it was quite easy she laughs and it is clear that blueloo is laughing too  augustus what  the clerk laughing slowly and laboriously with intense enjoyment ha ha ha ha ha ha augustus rushes at him he snatches up the poker and stands on guard no you dont  the lady still at the telephone waving her disengaged hand behind her impatiently at them to stop making a noise shshshshsh augustus with a shrug goes up the middle of the room the lady resumes her conversation with the telephone what oh yes im coming up by the 135 why not have tea with me at rumpelmeisters rumpelmeisters you know they call it robinsons now right ta ta she hangs up the receiver and is passing round the table on her way towards the door when she is confronted by augustus  augustus madam i consider your conduct most unpatriotic you make bets and abuse the confidence of the hardworked officials who are doing their bit for their country whilst our gallant fellows are perishing in the trenches  the lady oh the gallant fellows are not all in the trenches augustus some of them have come home for a few days hardearned leave and i am sure you wont grudge them a little fun at your expense  the clerk hear hear  augustus amiably ah well for my countrys sake
