93570872	the portrait of a lady  volume i   by henry james     preface  the portrait of a lady was like roderick hudson begun in florence during three months spent there in the spring of 1879 like roderick and like the american it had been designed for publication in the atlantic monthly where it began to appear in 1880 it differed from its two predecessors however in finding a course also open to it from month to month in macmillans magazine which was to be for me one of the last occasions of simultaneous serialisation in the two countries that the changing conditions of literary intercourse between england and the united states had up to then left unaltered it is a long novel and i was long in writing it i remember being again much occupied with it the following year during a stay of several weeks made in venice i had rooms on riva schiavoni at the top of a house near the passage leading off to san zaccaria the waterside life the wondrous lagoon spread before me and the ceaseless human chatter of venice came in at my windows to which i seem to myself to have been constantly driven in the fruitless fidget of composition as if to see whether out in the blue channel the ship of some right suggestion of some better phrase of the next happy twist of my subject the next true touch for my canvas mightnt come into sight but i recall vividly enough that the response most elicited in general to these restless appeals was the rather grim admonition that romantic and historic sites such as the land of italy abounds in offer the artist a questionable aid to concentration when they themselves are not to be the subject of it they are too rich in their own life and too charged with their own meanings merely to help him out with a lame phrase they draw him away from his small question to their own greater ones so that after a little he feels while thus yearning toward them in his difficulty as if he were asking an army of glorious veterans to help him to arrest a peddler who has given him the wrong change  there are pages of the book which in the reading over have seemed to make me see again the bristling curve of the wide riva the large colourspots of the balconied houses and the repeated undulation of the little hunchbacked bridges marked by the rise and drop again with the wave of foreshortened clicking pedestrians the venetian footfall and the venetian cryall talk there wherever uttered having the pitch of a call across the watercome in once more at the window renewing ones old impression of the delighted senses and the divided frustrated mind how can places that speak in general so to the imagination not give it at the moment the particular thing it wants i recollect again and again in beautiful places dropping into that wonderment the real truth is i think that they express under this appeal only too muchmore than in the given case one has use for so that one finds ones self working less congruously after all so far as the surrounding picture is concerned than in presence of the moderate and the neutral to which we may lend something of the light of our vision such a place as venice is too proud for such charities venice doesnt borrow she but all magnificently gives we profit by that enormously but to do so we must either be quite off duty or be on it in her service alone such and so rueful are these reminiscences though on the whole no doubt ones book and ones literary effort at large were to be the better for them strangely fertilising in the long run does a wasted effort of attention often prove it all depends on how the attention has been cheated has been squandered there are highhanded insolent frauds and there are insidious sneaking ones and there is i fear even on the most designing artists part always witless enough good faith always anxious enough desire to fail to guard him against their deceits  trying to recover here for recognition the germ of my idea i see that it must have consisted not at all in any conceit of a plot nefarious name in any flash upon the fancy of a set of relations or in any one of those situations that by a logic of their own immediately fall for the fabulist into movement into a march or a rush a patter of quick steps but altogether in the sense of a single character the character and aspect of a particular engaging young woman to which all the usual elements of a subject certainly of a setting were to need to be super added quite as interesting as the young woman herself at her best do i find i must again repeat this projection of memory upon the whole matter of the growth in ones imagination of some such apology for a motive these are the fascinations of the fabulists art these lurking forces of expansion these necessities of upspringing in the seed these beautiful determinations on the part of the idea entertained to grow as tall as possible to push into the light and the air and thickly flower there and quite as much these fine possibilities of recovering from some good standpoint on the ground gained the intimate history of the businessof retracing and reconstructing its steps and stages i have always fondly remembered a remark that i heard fall years ago from the lips of ivan turgenieff in regard to his own experience of the usual origin of the fictive picture it began for him almost always with the vision of some person or persons who hovered before him soliciting him as the active or passive figure interesting him and appealing to him just as they were and by what they were he saw them in that fashion as disponibles saw them subject to the chances the complications of existence and saw them vividly but then had to find for them the right relations those that would most bring them out to imagine to invent and select and piece together the situations most useful and favourable to the sense of the creatures themselves the complications they would be most likely to produce and to feel  to arrive at these things is to arrive at my story he said and thats the way i look for it the result is that im often accused of not having story enough i seem to myself to have as much as i needto show my people to exhibit their relations with each other for that is all my measure if i watch them long enough i see them come together i see them placed i see them engaged in this or that act and in this or that difficulty how they look and move and speak and behave always in the setting i have found for them is my account of themof which i dare say alas que cela manque souvent darchitecture but i would rather i think have too little architecture than too muchwhen theres danger of its interfering with my measure of the truth the french of course like more of it than i givehaving by their own genius such a hand for it and indeed one must give all one can as for the origin of ones windblown germs themselves who shall say as you ask where they come from we have to go too far back too far behind to say isnt it all we can say that they come from every quarter of heaven that they are there at almost any turn of the road they accumulate and we are always picking them over selecting among them they are the breath of lifeby which i mean that life in its own way breathes them upon us they are so in a manner prescribed and imposedfloated into our minds by the current of life that reduces to imbecility the vain critics quarrel so often with ones subject when he hasnt the wit to accept it will he point out then which other it should properly have beenhis office being essentially to point out il en serait bien embarrasse ah when he points out what ive done or failed to do with it thats another matter there hes on his ground i give him up my sarchitecture my distinguished friend concluded as much as he will  so this beautiful genius and i recall with comfort the gratitude i drew from his reference to the intensity of suggestion that may reside in the stray figure the unattached character the image en disponibilite it gave me higher warrant than i seemed then to have met for just that blest habit of ones own imagination the trick of investing some conceived or encountered individual some brace or group of individuals with the germinal property and authority i was myself so much more antecedently conscious of my figures than of their settinga too preliminary a preferential interest in which struck me as in general such a putting of the cart before the horse i might envy though i couldnt emulate the imaginative writer so constituted as to see his fable first and to make out its agents afterwards i could think so little of any fable that didnt need its agents positively to launch it i could think so little of any situation that didnt depend for its interest on the nature of the persons situated and thereby on their way of taking it there are methods of socalled presentation i believe among novelists who have appeared to flourishthat offer the situation as indifferent to that support but i have not lost the sense of the value for me at the time of the admirable russians testimony to my not needing all superstitiously to try and perform any such gymnastic other echoes from the same source linger with me i confess as unfadinglyif it be not all indeed one muchembracing echo it was impossible after that not to read for ones uses high lucidity into the tormented and disfigured and bemuddled question of the objective value and even quite into that of the critical appreciation of subject in the novel  one had had from an early time for that matter the instinct of the right estimate of such values and of its reducing to the inane the dull dispute over the immoral subject and the moral recognising so promptly the one measure of the worth of a given subject the question about it that rightly answered disposes of all othersis it valid in a word is it genuine is it sincere the result of some direct impression or perception of lifei had found small edification mostly in a critical pretension that had neglected from the first all delimitation of ground and all definition of terms the air of my earlier time shows to memory as darkened all round with that vanityunless the difference today be just in ones own final impatience the lapse of ones attention there is i think no more nutritive or suggestive truth in this connexion than that of the perfect dependence of the moral sense of a work of art on the amount of felt life concerned in producing it the question comes back thus obviously to the kind and the degree of the artists prime sensibility which is the soil out of which his subject springs the quality and capacity of that soil its ability to grow with due freshness and straightness any vision of life represents strongly or weakly the projected morality that element is but another name for the more or less close connexion of the subject with some mark made on the intelligence with some sincere experience by which at the same time of course one is far from contending that this enveloping air of the artists humanitywhich gives the last touch to the worth of the workis not a widely and wondrously varying element being on one occasion a rich and magnificent medium and on another a comparatively poor and ungenerous one here we get exactly the high price of the novel as a literary formits power not only while preserving that form with closeness to range through all the differences of the individual relation to its general subjectmatter all the varieties of outlook on life of disposition to reflect and project created by conditions that are never the same from man to man or so far as that goes from man to woman but positively to appear more true to its character in proportion as it strains or tends to burst with a latent extravagance its mould  the house of fiction has in short not one window but a milliona number of possible windows not to be reckoned rather every one of which has been pierced or is still pierceable in its vast front by the need of the individual vision and by the pressure of the individual will these apertures of dissimilar shape and size hang so all together over the human scene that we might have expected of them a greater sameness of report than we find they are but windows at the best mere holes in a dead wall disconnected perched aloft they are not hinged doors opening straight upon life but they have this mark of their own that at each of them stands a figure with a pair of eyes or at least with a fieldglass which forms again and again for observation a unique instrument insuring to the person making use of it an impression distinct from every other he and his neighbours are watching the same show but one seeing more where the other sees less one seeing black where the other sees white one seeing big where the other sees small one seeing coarse where the other sees fine and so on and so on there is fortunately no saying on what for the particular pair of eyes the window may not open fortunately by reason precisely of this incalculability of range the spreading field the human scene is the choice of subject the pierced aperture either broad or balconied or slitlike and lowbrowed is the literary form but they are singly or together as nothing without the posted presence of the watcherwithout in other words the consciousness of the artist tell me what the artist is and i will tell you of what he has been conscious thereby i shall express to you at once his boundless freedom and his moral reference  all this is a long way round however for my word about my dim first move toward the portrait which was exactly my grasp of a single characteran acquisition i had made moreover after a fashion not here to be retraced enough that i was as seemed to me in complete possession of it that i had been so for a long time that this had made it familiar and yet had not blurred its charm and that all urgently all tormentingly i saw it in motion and so to speak in transit this amounts to saying that i saw it as bent upon its fatesome fate or other which among the possibilities being precisely the question thus i had my vivid individualvivid so strangely in spite of being still at large not confined by the conditions not engaged in the tangle to which we look for much of the impress that constitutes an identity if the apparition was still all to be placed how came it to be vividsince we puzzle such quantities out mostly just by the business of placing them one could answer such a question beautifully doubtless if one could do so subtle if not so monstrous a thing as to write the history of the growth of ones imagination one would describe then what at a given time had extraordinarily happened to it and one would so for instance be in a position to tell with an approach to clearness how under favour of occasion it had been able to take over take over straight from life such and such a constituted animated figure or form the figure has to that extent as you see been placedplaced in the imagination that detains it preserves protects enjoys it conscious of its presence in the dusky crowded heterogeneous backshop of the mind very much as a wary dealer in precious odds and ends competent to make an advance on rare objects confided to him is conscious of the rare little piece left in deposit by the reduced mysterious lady of title or the speculative amateur and which is already there to disclose its merit afresh as soon as a key shall have clicked in a cupboarddoor  that may he i recognise a somewhat superfine analogy for the particular value i here speak of the image of the young feminine nature that i had had for so considerable a time all curiously at my disposal but it appears to fond memory quite to fit the factwith the recall in addition of my pious desire but to place my treasure right i quite remind myself thus of the dealer resigned not to realise resigned to keeping the precious object locked up indefinitely rather than commit it at no matter what price to vulgar hands for there are dealers in these forms and figures and treasures capable of that refinement the point is however that this single small cornerstone the conception of a certain young woman affronting her destiny had begun with being all my outfit for the large building of the portrait of a lady it came to be a square and spacious houseor has at least seemed so to me in this going over it again but such as it is it had to be put up round my young woman while she stood there in perfect isolation that is to me artistically speaking the circumstance of interest for i have lost myself once more i confess in the curiosity of analysing the structure by what process of logical accretion was this slight personality the mere slim shade of an intelligent but presumptuous girl to find itself endowed with the high attributes of a subjectand indeed by what thinness at the best would such a subject not be vitiated millions of presumptuous girls intelligent or not intelligent daily affront their destiny and what is it open to their destiny to be at the most that we should make an ado about it the novel is of its very nature an ado an ado about something and the larger the form it takes the greater of course the ado therefore consciously that was what one was in forfor positively organising an ado about isabel archer  one looked it well in the face i seem to remember this extravagance and with the effect precisely of recognising the charm of the problem challenge any such problem with any intelligence and you immediately see how full it is of substance the wonder being all the while as we look at the world how absolutely how inordinately the isabel archers and even much smaller female fry insist on mattering george eliot has admirably noted itin these frail vessels is borne onward through the ages the treasure of human affection in romeo and juliet juliet has to be important just as in adam bede and the mill on the floss and middlemarch and daniel deronda hetty sorrel and maggie tulliver and rosamond vincy and gwendolen harleth have to be with that much of firm ground that much of bracing air at the disposal all the while of their feet and their lungs they are typical none the less of a class difficult in the individual case to make a centre of interest so difficult in fact that many an expert painter as for instance dickens and walter scott as for instance even in the main so subtle a hand as that of r l stevenson has preferred to leave the task unattempted there are in fact writers as to whom we make out that their refuge from this is to assume it to be not worth their attempting by which pusillanimity in truth their honour is scantly saved it is never an attestation of a value or even of our imperfect sense of one it is never a tribute to any truth at all that we shall represent that value badly it never makes up artistically for an artists dim feeling about a thing that he shall do the thing as ill as possible there are better ways than that the best of all of which is to begin with less stupidity  it may be answered meanwhile in regard to shakespeares and to george eliots testimony that their concession to the importance of their juliets and cleopatras and portias even with portia as the very type and model of the young person intelligent and presumptuous and to that of their hettys and maggies and rosamonds and gwendolens suffers the abatement that these slimnesses are when figuring as the main props of the theme never suffered to be sole ministers of its appeal but have their inadequacy eked out with comic relief and underplots as the playwrights say when not with murders and battles and the great mutations of the world if they are shown as mattering as much as they could possibly pretend to the proof of it is in a hundred other persons made of much stouter stuff and each involved moreover in a hundred relations which matter to them concomitantly with that one cleopatra matters beyond bounds to antony but his colleagues his antagonists the state of rome and the impending battle also prodigiously matter portia matters to antonio and to shylock and to the prince of morocco to the fifty aspiring princes but for these gentry there are other lively concerns for antonio notably there are shylock and bassanio and his lost ventures and the extremity of his predicament this extremity indeed by the same token matters to portiathough its doing so becomes of interest all by the fact that portia matters to us that she does so at any rate and that almost everything comes round to it again supports my contention as to this fine example of the value recognised in the mere young thing i say mere young thing because i guess that even shakespeare preoccupied mainly though he may have been with the passions of princes would scarce have pretended to found the best of his appeal for her on her high social position it is an example exactly of the deep difficulty bravedthe difficulty of making george eliots frail vessel if not the allinall for our attention at least the clearest of the call  now to see deep difficulty braved is at any time for the really addicted artist to feel almost even as a pang the beautiful incentive and to feel it verily in such sort as to wish the danger intensified the difficulty most worth tackling can only be for him in these conditions the greatest the case permits of so i remember feeling here in presence always that is of the particular uncertainty of my ground that there would be one way better than anotheroh ever so much better than any otherof making it fight out its battle the frail vessel that charged with george eliots treasure and thereby of such importance to those who curiously approach it has likewise possibilities of importance to itself possibilities which permit of treatment and in fact peculiarly require it from the moment they are considered at all there is always the escape from any close account of the weak agent of such spells by using as a bridge for evasion for retreat and flight the view of her relation to those surrounding her make it predominantly a view of their relation and the trick is played you give the general sense of her effect and you give it so far as the raising on it of a superstructure goes with the maximum of ease well i recall perfectly how little in my now quite established connexion the maximum of ease appealed to me and how i seemed to get rid of it by an honest transposition of the weights in the two scales place the centre of the subject in the young womans own consciousness i said to myself and you get as interesting and as beautiful a difficulty as you could wish stick to thatfor the centre put the heaviest weight into that scale which will be so largely the scale of her relation to herself make her only interested enough at the same time in the things that are not herself and this relation neednt fear to be too limited place meanwhile in the other scale the lighter weight which is usually the one that tips the balance of interest press least hard in short on the consciousness of your heroines satellites especially the male make it an interest contributive only to the greater one see at all events what can be done in this way what better field could there be for a due ingenuity the girl hovers inextinguishable as a charming creature and the job will be to translate her into the highest terms of that formula and as nearly as possible moreover into all of them to depend upon her and her little concerns wholly to see you through will necessitate remember your really doing her  so far i reasoned and it took nothing less than that technical rigour i now easily see to inspire me with the right confidence for erecting on such a plot of ground the neat and careful and proportioned pile of bricks that arches over it and that was thus to form constructionally speaking a literary monument such is the aspect that today the portrait wears for me a structure reared with an architectural competence as turgenieff would have said that makes it to the authors own sense the most proportioned of his productions after the ambassadors which was to follow it so many years later and which has no doubt a superior roundness on one thing i was determined that though i should clearly have to pile brick upon brick for the creation of an interest i would leave no pretext for saying that anything is out of line scale or perspective i would build largein fine embossed vaults and painted arches as who should say and yet never let it appear that the chequered pavement the ground under the readers feet fails to stretch at every point to the base of the walls that precautionary spirit on reperusal of the book is the old note that most touches me it testifies so for my own ear to the anxiety of my provision for the readers amusement i felt in view of the possible limitations of my subject that no such provision could be excessive and the development of the latter was simply the general form of that earnest quest and i find indeed that this is the only account i can give myself of the evolution of the fable it is all under the head thus named that i conceive the needful accretion as having taken place the right complications as having started it was naturally of the essence that the young woman should be herself complex that was rudimentaryor was at any rate the light in which isabel archer had originally dawned it went however but a certain way and other lights contending conflicting lights and of as many different colours if possible as the rockets the roman candles and catherinewheels of a pyrotechnic display would be employable to attest that she was i had no doubt a groping instinct for the right complications since i am quite unable to track the footsteps of those that constitute as the case stands the general situation exhibited they are there for what they are worth and as numerous as might be but my memory i confess is a blank as to how and whence they came  i seem to myself to have waked up one morning in possession of themof ralph touchett and his parents of madame merle of gilbert osmond and his daughter and his sister of lord warburton caspar goodwood and miss stackpole the definite array of contributions to isabel archers history i recognised them i knew them they were the numbered pieces of my puzzle the concrete terms of my plot it was as if they had simply by an impulse of their own floated into my ken and all in response to my primary question well what will she do their answer seemed to be that if i would trust them they would show me on which with an urgent appeal to them to make it at least as interesting as they could i trusted them they were like the group of attendants and entertainers who come down by train when people in the country give a party they represented the contract for carrying the party on that was an excellent relation with thema possible one even with so broken a reed from her slightness of cohesion as henrietta stackpole it is a familiar truth to the novelist at the strenuous hour that as certain elements in any work are of the essence so others are only of the form that as this or that character this or that disposition of the material belongs to the subject directly so to speak so this or that other belongs to it but indirectlybelongs intimately to the treatment this is a truth however of which he rarely gets the benefitsince it could be assured to him really but by criticism based upon perception criticism which is too little of this world he must not think of benefits moreover i freely recognise for that way dishonour lies he has that is but one to think ofthe benefit whatever it may be involved in his having cast a spell upon the simpler the very simplest forms of attention this is all he is entitled to he is entitled to nothing he is bound to admit that can come to him from the reader as a result on the latters part of any act of reflexion or discrimination he may enjoy this finer tributethat is another affair but on condition only of taking it as a gratuity thrown in a mere miraculous windfall the fruit of a tree he may not pretend to have shaken against reflexion against discrimination in his interest all earth and air conspire wherefore it is that as i say he must in many a case have schooled himself from the first to work but for a living wage the living wage is the readers grant of the least possible quantity of attention required for consciousness of a spell the occasional charming tip is an act of his intelligence over and beyond this a golden apple for the writers lap straight from the windstirred tree the artist may of course in wanton moods dream of some paradise for art where the direct appeal to the intelligence might be legalised for to such extravagances as these his yearning mind can scarce hope ever completely to close itself the most he can do is to remember they are extravagances  all of which is perhaps but a gracefully devious way of saying that henrietta stackpole was a good example in the portrait of the truth to which i just advertedas good an example as i could name were it not that maria gostrey in the ambassadors then in the bosom of time may be mentioned as a better each of these persons is but wheels to the coach neither belongs to the body of that vehicle or is for a moment accommodated with a seat inside there the subject alone is ensconced in the form of its hero and heroine and of the privileged high officials say who ride with the king and queen there are reasons why one would have liked this to be felt as in general one would like almost anything to be felt in ones work that one has ones self contributively felt we have seen however how idle is that pretension which i should be sorry to make too much of maria gostrey and miss stackpole then are cases each of the light ficelle not of the true agent they may run beside the coach for all they are worth they may cling to it till they are out of breath as poor miss stackpole all so visibly does but neither all the while so much as gets her foot on the step neither ceases for a moment to tread the dusty road put it even that they are like the fishwives who helped to bring back to paris from versailles on that most ominous day of the first half of the french revolution the carriage of the royal family the only thing is that i may well be asked i acknowledge why then in the present fiction i have suffered henrietta of whom we have indubitably too much so officiously so strangely so almost inexplicably to pervade i will presently say what i can for that anomalyand in the most conciliatory fashion  a point i wish still more to make is that if my relation of confidence with the actors in my drama who were unlike miss stackpole true agents was an excellent one to have arrived at there still remained my relation with the reader which was another affair altogether and as to which i felt no one to be trusted but myself that solicitude was to be accordingly expressed in the artful patience with which as i have said i piled brick upon brick the bricks for the whole countingoverputting for bricks little touches and inventions and enhancements by the wayaffect me in truth as wellnigh innumerable and as ever so scrupulously fitted together and packedin it is an effect of detail of the minutest though if one were in this connexion to say all one would express the hope that the general the ampler air of the modest monument still survives i do at least seem to catch the key to a part of this abundance of small anxious ingenious illustration as i recollect putting my finger in my young womans interest on the most obvious of her predicates what will she do why the first thing shell do will be to come to europe which in fact will form and all inevitably no small part of her principal adventure coming to europe is even for the frail vessels in this wonderful age a mild adventure but what is truer than that on one sidethe side of their independence of flood and field of the moving accident of battle and murder and sudden deathher adventures are to be mild without her sense of them her sense for them as one may say they are next to nothing at all but isnt the beauty and the difficulty just in showing their mystic conversion by that sense conversion into the stuff of drama or even more delightful word still of story it was all as clear my contention as a silver bell two very good instances i think of this effect of conversion two cases of the rare chemistry are the pages in which isabel coming into the drawingroom at gardencourt coming in from a wet walk or whatever that rainy afternoon finds madame merle in possession of the place madame merle seated all absorbed but all serene at the piano and deeply recognises in the striking of such an hour in the presence there among the gathering shades of this personage of whom a moment before she had never so much as heard a turningpoint in her life it is dreadful to have too much for any artistic demonstration to dot ones is and insist on ones intentions and i am not eager to do it now but the question here was that of producing the maximum of intensity with the minimum of strain  the interest was to be raised to its pitch and yet the elements to be kept in their key so that should the whole thing duly impress i might show what an exciting inward life may do for the person leading it even while it remains perfectly normal and i cannot think of a more consistent application of that ideal unless it be in the long statement just beyond the middle of the book of my young womans extraordinary meditative vigil on the occasion that was to become for her such a landmark reduced to its essence it is but the vigil of searching criticism but it throws the action further forward that twenty incidents might have done it was designed to have all the vivacity of incidents and all the economy of picture she sits up by her dying fire far into the night under the spell of recognitions on which she finds the last sharpness suddenly wait it is a representation simply of her motionlessly seeing and an attempt withal to make the mere still lucidity of her act as interesting as the surprise of a caravan or the identification of a pirate it represents for that matter one of the identifications dear to the novelist and even indispensable to him but it all goes on without her being approached by another person and without her leaving her chair it is obviously the best thing in the book but it is only a supreme illustration of the general plan as to henrietta my apology for whom i just left incomplete she exemplifies i fear in her superabundance not an element of my plan but only an excess of my zeal so early was to begin my tendency to overtreat rather than undertreat when there was choice or danger my subject many members of my craft i gather are far from agreeing with me but i have always held overtreating the minor disservice treating that of the portrait amounted to never forgetting by any lapse that the thing was under a special obligation to be amusing there was the danger of the noted thinnesswhich was to be averted tooth and nail by cultivation of the lively that is at least how i see it today henrietta must have been at that time a part of my wonderful notion of the lively and then there was another matter i had within the few preceding years come to live in london and the international light lay in those days to my sense thick and rich upon the scene it was the light in which so much of the picture hung but that is another matter there is really too much to say  henry james     the portrait of a lady    chapter i  under certain circumstances there are few hours in life more agreeable than the hour dedicated to the ceremony known as afternoon tea there are circumstances in which whether you partake of the tea or notsome people of course never dothe situation is in itself delightful those that i have in mind in beginning to unfold this simple history offered an admirable setting to an innocent pastime the implements of the little feast had been disposed upon the lawn of an old english countryhouse in what i should call the perfect middle of a splendid summer afternoon part of the afternoon had waned but much of it was left and what was left was of the finest and rarest quality real dusk would not arrive for many hours but the flood of summer light had begun to ebb the air had grown mellow the shadows were long upon the smooth dense turf they lengthened slowly however and the scene expressed that sense of leisure still to come which is perhaps the chief source of ones enjoyment of such a scene at such an hour from five oclock to eight is on certain occasions a little eternity but on such an occasion as this the interval could be only an eternity of pleasure the persons concerned in it were taking their pleasure quietly and they were not of the sex which is supposed to furnish the regular votaries of the ceremony i have mentioned the shadows on the perfect lawn were straight and angular they were the shadows of an old man sitting in a deep wickerchair near the low table on which the tea had been served and of two younger men strolling to and fro in desultory talk in front of him the old man had his cup in his hand it was an unusually large cup of a different pattern from the rest of the set and painted in brilliant colours he disposed of its contents with much circumspection holding it for a long time close to his chin with his face turned to the house his companions had either finished their tea or were indifferent to their privilege they smoked cigarettes as they continued to stroll one of them from time to time as he passed looked with a certain attention at the elder man who unconscious of observation rested his eyes upon the rich red front of his dwelling the house that rose beyond the lawn was a structure to repay such consideration and was the most characteristic object in the peculiarly english picture i have attempted to sketch  it stood upon a low hill above the riverthe river being the thames at some forty miles from london a long gabled front of red brick with the complexion of which time and the weather had played all sorts of pictorial tricks only however to improve and refine it presented to the lawn its patches of ivy its clustered chimneys its windows smothered in creepers the house had a name and a history the old gentleman taking his tea would have been delighted to tell you these things how it had been built under edward the sixth had offered a nights hospitality to the great elizabeth whose august person had extended itself upon a huge magnificent and terribly angular bed which still formed the principal honour of the sleeping apartments had been a good deal bruised and defaced in cromwells wars and then under the restoration repaired and much enlarged and how finally after having been remodelled and disfigured in the eighteenth century it had passed into the careful keeping of a shrewd american banker who had bought it originally because owing to circumstances too complicated to set forth it was offered at a great bargain bought it with much grumbling at its ugliness its antiquity its incommodity and who now at the end of twenty years had become conscious of a real aesthetic passion for it so that he knew all its points and would tell you just where to stand to see them in combination and just the hour when the shadows of its various protuberances which fell so softly upon the warm weary brickworkwere of the right measure besides this as i have said he could have counted off most of the successive owners and occupants several of whom were known to general fame doing so however with an undemonstrative conviction that the latest phase of its destiny was not the least honourable the front of the house overlooking that portion of the lawn with which we are concerned was not the entrancefront this was in quite another quarter privacy here reigned supreme and the wide carpet of turf that covered the level hilltop seemed but the extension of a luxurious interior the great still oaks and beeches flung down a shade as dense as that of velvet curtains and the place was furnished like a room with cushioned seats with richcoloured rugs with the books and papers that lay upon the grass the river was at some distance where the ground began to slope the lawn properly speaking ceased but it was none the less a charming walk down to the water  the old gentleman at the teatable who had come from america thirty years before had brought with him at the top of his baggage his american physiognomy and he had not only brought it with him but he had kept it in the best order so that if necessary he might have taken it back to his own country with perfect confidence at present obviously nevertheless he was not likely to displace himself his journeys were over and he was taking the rest that precedes the great rest he had a narrow cleanshaven face with features evenly distributed and an expression of placid acuteness it was evidently a face in which the range of representation was not large so that the air of contented shrewdness was all the more of a merit it seemed to tell that he had been successful in life yet it seemed to tell also that his success had not been exclusive and invidious but had had much of the inoffensiveness of failure he had certainly had a great experience of men but there was an almost rustic simplicity in the faint smile that played upon his lean spacious cheek and lighted up his humorous eye as he at last slowly and carefully deposited his big teacup upon the table he was neatly dressed in wellbrushed black but a shawl was folded upon his knees and his feet were encased in thick embroidered slippers a beautiful collie dog lay upon the grass near his chair watching the masters face almost as tenderly as the master took in the still more magisterial physiognomy of the house and a little bristling bustling terrier bestowed a desultory attendance upon the other gentlemen  one of these was a remarkably wellmade man of fiveandthirty with a face as english as that of the old gentleman i have just sketched was something else a noticeably handsome face freshcoloured fair and frank with firm straight features a lively grey eye and the rich adornment of a chestnut beard this person had a certain fortunate brilliant exceptional lookthe air of a happy temperament fertilised by a high civilisationwhich would have made almost any observer envy him at a venture he was booted and spurred as if he had dismounted from a long ride he wore a white hat which looked too large for him he held his two hands behind him and in one of thema large white wellshaped fistwas crumpled a pair of soiled dogskin gloves  his companion measuring the length of the lawn beside him was a person of quite a different pattern who although he might have excited grave curiosity would not like the other have provoked you to wish yourself almost blindly in his place tall lean loosely and feebly put together he had an ugly sickly witty charming face furnished but by no means decorated with a straggling moustache and whisker he looked clever and illa combination by no means felicitous and he wore a brown velvet jacket he carried his hands in his pockets and there was something in the way he did it that showed the habit was inveterate his gait had a shambling wandering quality he was not very firm on his legs as i have said whenever he passed the old man in the chair he rested his eyes upon him and at this moment with their faces brought into relation you would easily have seen they were father and son the father caught his sons eye at last and gave him a mild responsive smile  im getting on very well he said  have you drunk your tea asked the son  yes and enjoyed it  shall i give you some more  the old man considered placidly well i guess ill wait and see he had in speaking the american tone  are you cold the son enquired  the father slowly rubbed his legs well i dont know i cant tell till i feel  perhaps some one might feel for you said the younger man laughing  oh i hope some one will always feel for me dont you feel for me lord warburton  oh yes immensely said the gentleman addressed as lord warburton promptly im bound to say you look wonderfully comfortable  well i suppose i am in most respects and the old man looked down at his green shawl and smoothed it over his knees the fact is ive been comfortable so many years that i suppose ive got so used to it i dont know it  yes thats the bore of comfort said lord warburton we only know when were uncomfortable  it strikes me were rather particular his companion remarked  oh yes theres no doubt were particular lord warburton murmured and then the three men remained silent a while the two younger ones standing looking down at the other who presently asked for more tea i should think you would be very unhappy with that shawl lord warburton resumed while his companion filled the old mans cup again  oh no he must have the shawl cried the gentleman in the velvet coat dont put such ideas as that into his head  it belongs to my wife said the old man simply  oh if its for sentimental reasons and lord warburton made a gesture of apology  i suppose i must give it to her when she comes the old man went on  youll please to do nothing of the kind youll keep it to cover your poor old legs  well you mustnt abuse my legs said the old man i guess they are as good as yours  oh youre perfectly free to abuse mine his son replied giving him his tea  well were two lame ducks i dont think theres much difference  im much obliged to you for calling me a duck hows your tea  well its rather hot  thats intended to be a merit  ah theres a great deal of merit murmured the old man kindly hes a very good nurse lord warburton  isnt he a bit clumsy asked his lordship  oh no hes not clumsyconsidering that hes an invalid himself hes a very good nursefor a sicknurse i call him my sicknurse because hes sick himself  oh come daddy the ugly young man exclaimed  well you are i wish you werent but i suppose you cant help it  i might try thats an idea said the young man  were you ever sick lord warburton his father asked  lord warburton considered a moment yes sir once in the persian gulf  hes making light of you daddy said the other young man thats a sort of joke  well there seem to be so many sorts now daddy replied serenely you dont look as if you had been sick any way lord warburton  hes sick of life he was just telling me so going on fearfully about it said lord warburtons friend  is that true sir asked the old man gravely  if it is your son gave me no consolation hes a wretched fellow to talk toa regular cynic he doesnt seem to believe in anything  thats another sort of joke said the person accused of cynicism  its because his health is so poor his father explained to lord warburton it affects his mind and colours his way of looking at things he seems to feel as if he had never had a chance but its almost entirely theoretical you know it doesnt seem to affect his spirits ive hardly ever seen him when he wasnt cheerfulabout as he is at present he often cheers me up  the young man so described looked at lord warburton and laughed is it a glowing eulogy or an accusation of levity should you like me to carry out my theories daddy  by jove we should see some queer things cried lord warburton  i hope you havent taken up that sort of tone said the old man  warburtons tone is worse than mine he pretends to be bored im not in the least bored i find life only too interesting  ah too interesting you shouldnt allow it to be that you know  im never bored when i come here said lord warburton one gets such uncommonly good talk  is that another sort of joke asked the old man youve no excuse for being bored anywhere when i was your age i had never heard of such a thing  you must have developed very late  no i developed very quick that was just the reason when i was twenty years old i was very highly developed indeed i was working tooth and nail you wouldnt be bored if you had something to do but all you young men are too idle you think too much of your pleasure youre too fastidious and too indolent and too rich  oh i say cried lord warburton youre hardly the person to accuse a fellowcreature of being too rich  do you mean because im a banker asked the old man  because of that if you like and because you havehavent yousuch unlimited means  he isnt very rich the other young man mercifully pleaded he has given away an immense deal of money  well i suppose it was his own said lord warburton and in that case could there be a better proof of wealth let not a public benefactor talk of ones being too fond of pleasure  daddys very fond of pleasureof other peoples  the old man shook his head i dont pretend to have contributed anything to the amusement of my contemporaries  my dear father youre too modest  thats a kind of joke sir said lord warburton  you young men have too many jokes when there are no jokes youve nothing left  fortunately there are always more jokes the ugly young man remarked  i dont believe iti believe things are getting more serious you young men will find that out  the increasing seriousness of things then thats the great opportunity of jokes  theyll have to be grim jokes said the old man im convinced there will be great changes and not all for the better  i quite agree with you sir lord warburton declared im very sure there will be great changes and that all sorts of queer things will happen thats why i find so much difficulty in applying your advice you know you told me the other day that i ought to take hold of something one hesitates to take hold of a thing that may the next moment be knocked skyhigh  you ought to take hold of a pretty woman said his companion hes trying hard to fall in love he added by way of explanation to his father  the pretty women themselves may be sent flying lord warburton exclaimed  no no theyll be firm the old man rejoined theyll not be affected by the social and political changes i just referred to  you mean they wont be abolished very well then ill lay hands on one as soon as possible and tie her round my neck as a lifepreserver  the ladies will save us said the old man that is the best of them willfor i make a difference between them make up to a good one and marry her and your life will become much more interesting  a momentary silence marked perhaps on the part of his auditors a sense of the magnanimity of this speech for it was a secret neither for his son nor for his visitor that his own experiment in matrimony had not been a happy one as he said however he made a difference and these words may have been intended as a confession of personal error though of course it was not in place for either of his companions to remark that apparently the lady of his choice had not been one of the best  if i marry an interesting woman i shall be interested is that what you say lord warburton asked im not at all keen about marryingyour son misrepresented me but theres no knowing what an interesting woman might do with me  i should like to see your idea of an interesting woman said his friend  my dear fellow you cant see ideasespecially such highly ethereal ones as mine if i could only see it myselfthat would be a great step in advance  well you may fall in love with whomsoever you please but you mustnt fall in love with my niece said the old man  his son broke into a laugh hell think you mean that as a provocation my dear father youve lived with the english for thirty years and youve picked up a good many of the things they say but youve never learned the things they dont say  i say what i please the old man returned with all his serenity  i havent the honour of knowing your niece lord warburton said i think its the first time ive heard of her  shes a niece of my wifes mrs touchett brings her to england  then young mr touchett explained my mother you know has been spending the winter in america and were expecting her back she writes that she has discovered a niece and that she has invited her to come out with her  i seevery kind of her said lord warburton is the young lady interesting  we hardly know more about her than you my mother has not gone into details she chiefly communicates with us by means of telegrams and her telegrams are rather inscrutable they say women dont know how to write them but my mother has thoroughly mastered the art of condensation tired america hot weather awful return england with niece first steamer decent cabin thats the sort of message we get from herthat was the last that came but there had been another before which i think contained the first mention of the niece changed hotel very bad impudent clerk address here taken sisters girl died last year go to europe two sisters quite independent over that my father and i have scarcely stopped puzzling it seems to admit of so many interpretations  theres one thing very clear in it said the old man she has given the hotelclerk a dressing  im not sure even of that since he has driven her from the field we thought at first that the sister mentioned might be the sister of the clerk but the subsequent mention of a niece seems to prove that the allusion is to one of my aunts then there was a question as to whose the two other sisters were they are probably two of my late aunts daughters but whos quite independent and in what sense is the term usedthat points not yet settled does the expression apply more particularly to the young lady my mother has adopted or does it characterise her sisters equallyand is it used in a moral or in a financial sense does it mean that theyve been left well off or that they wish to be under no obligations or does it simply mean that theyre fond of their own way  whatever else it means its pretty sure to mean that mr touchett remarked  youll see for yourself said lord warburton when does mrs touchett arrive  were quite in the dark as soon as she can find a decent cabin she may be waiting for it yet on the other hand she may already have disembarked in england  in that case she would probably have telegraphed to you  she never telegraphs when you would expect itonly when you dont said the old man she likes to drop on me suddenly she thinks shell find me doing something wrong she has never done so yet but shes not discouraged  its her share in the family trait the independence she speaks of her sons appreciation of the matter was more favourable whatever the high spirit of those young ladies may be her own is a match for it she likes to do everything for herself and has no belief in any ones power to help her she thinks me of no more use than a postagestamp without gum and she would never forgive me if i should presume to go to liverpool to meet her  will you at least let me know when your cousin arrives lord warburton asked  only on the condition ive mentionedthat you dont fall in love with her mr touchett replied  that strikes me as hard dont you think me good enough  i think you too goodbecause i shouldnt like her to marry you she hasnt come here to look for a husband i hope so many young ladies are doing that as if there were no good ones at home then shes probably engaged american girls are usually engaged i believe moreover im not sure after all that youd be a remarkable husband  very likely shes engaged ive known a good many american girls and they always were but i could never see that it made any difference upon my word as for my being a good husband mr touchetts visitor pursued im not sure of that either one can but try  try as much as you please but dont try on my niece smiled the old man whose opposition to the idea was broadly humorous  ah well said lord warburton with a humour broader still perhaps after all shes not worth trying on    chapter ii  while this exchange of pleasantries took place between the two ralph touchett wandered away a little with his usual slouching gait his hands in his pockets and his little rowdyish terrier at his heels his face was turned toward the house but his eyes were bent musingly on the lawn so that he had been an object of observation to a person who had just made her appearance in the ample doorway for some moments before he perceived her his attention was called to her by the conduct of his dog who had suddenly darted forward with a little volley of shrill barks in which the note of welcome however was more sensible than that of defiance the person in question was a young lady who seemed immediately to interpret the greeting of the small beast he advanced with great rapidity and stood at her feet looking up and barking hard whereupon without hesitation she stooped and caught him in her hands holding him face to face while he continued his quick chatter his master now had had time to follow and to see that bunchies new friend was a tall girl in a black dress who at first sight looked pretty she was bareheaded as if she were staying in the housea fact which conveyed perplexity to the son of its master conscious of that immunity from visitors which had for some time been rendered necessary by the latters illhealth meantime the two other gentlemen had also taken note of the newcomer  dear me whos that strange woman mr touchett had asked  perhaps its mrs touchetts niecethe independent young lady lord warburton suggested i think she must be from the way she handles the dog  the collie too had now allowed his attention to be diverted and he trotted toward the young lady in the doorway slowly setting his tail in motion as he went  but wheres my wife then murmured the old man  i suppose the young lady has left her somewhere thats a part of the independence  the girl spoke to ralph smiling while she still held up the terrier is this your little dog sir  he was mine a moment ago but youve suddenly acquired a remarkable air of property in him  couldnt we share him asked the girl hes such a perfect little darling  ralph looked at her a moment she was unexpectedly pretty you may have him altogether he then replied  the young lady seemed to have a great deal of confidence both in herself and in others but this abrupt generosity made her blush i ought to tell you that im probably your cousin she brought out putting down the dog and heres another she added quickly as the collie came up  probably the young man exclaimed laughing i supposed it was quite settled have you arrived with my mother  yes half an hour ago  and has she deposited you and departed again  no she went straight to her room and she told me that if i should see you i was to say to you that you must come to her there at a quarter to seven  the young man looked at his watch thank you very much i shall be punctual and then he looked at his cousin youre very welcome here im delighted to see you  she was looking at everything with an eye that denoted clear perceptionat her companion at the two dogs at the two gentlemen under the trees at the beautiful scene that surrounded her ive never seen anything so lovely as this place ive been all over the house its too enchanting  im sorry you should have been here so long without our knowing it  your mother told me that in england people arrived very quietly so i thought it was all right is one of those gentlemen your father  yes the elder onethe one sitting down said ralph  the girl gave a laugh i dont suppose its the other whos the other  hes a friend of ourslord warburton  oh i hoped there would be a lord its just like a novel and then oh you adorable creature she suddenly cried stooping down and picking up the small dog again  she remained standing where they had met making no offer to advance or to speak to mr touchett and while she lingered so near the threshold slim and charming her interlocutor wondered if she expected the old man to come and pay her his respects american girls were used to a great deal of deference and it had been intimated that this one had a high spirit indeed ralph could see that in her face  wont you come and make acquaintance with my father he nevertheless ventured to ask hes old and infirmhe doesnt leave his chair  ah poor man im very sorry the girl exclaimed immediately moving forward i got the impression from your mother that he was rather intensely active  ralph touchett was silent a moment she hasnt seen him for a year  well he has a lovely place to sit come along little hound  its a dear old place said the young man looking sidewise at his neighbour  whats his name she asked her attention having again reverted to the terrier  my fathers name  yes said the young lady with amusement but dont tell him i asked you  they had come by this time to where old mr touchett was sitting and he slowly got up from his chair to introduce himself  my mother has arrived said ralph and this is miss archer  the old man placed his two hands on her shoulders looked at her a moment with extreme benevolence and then gallantly kissed her its a great pleasure to me to see you here but i wish you had given us a chance to receive you  oh we were received said the girl there were about a dozen servants in the hall and there was an old woman curtseying at the gate  we can do better than thatif we have notice and the old man stood there smiling rubbing his hands and slowly shaking his head at her but mrs touchett doesnt like receptions  she went straight to her room  yesand locked herself in she always does that well i suppose i shall see her next week and mrs touchetts husband slowly resumed his former posture  before that said miss archer shes coming down to dinnerat eight oclock dont you forget a quarter to seven she added turning with a smile to ralph  whats to happen at a quarter to seven  im to see my mother said ralph  ah happy boy the old man commented you must sit downyou must have some tea he observed to his wifes niece  they gave me some tea in my room the moment i got there this young lady answered im sorry youre out of health she added resting her eyes upon her venerable host  oh im an old man my dear its time for me to be old but i shall be the better for having you here  she had been looking all round her againat the lawn the great trees the reedy silvery thames the beautiful old house and while engaged in this survey she had made room in it for her companions a comprehensiveness of observation easily conceivable on the part of a young woman who was evidently both intelligent and excited she had seated herself and had put away the little dog her white hands in her lap were folded upon her black dress her head was erect her eye lighted her flexible figure turned itself easily this way and that in sympathy with the alertness with which she evidently caught impressions her impressions were numerous and they were all reflected in a clear still smile ive never seen anything so beautiful as this  its looking very well said mr touchett i know the way it strikes you ive been through all that but youre very beautiful yourself he added with a politeness by no means crudely jocular and with the happy consciousness that his advanced age gave him the privilege of saying such thingseven to young persons who might possibly take alarm at them  what degree of alarm this young person took need not be exactly measured she instantly rose however with a blush which was not a refutation oh yes of course im lovely she returned with a quick laugh how old is your house is it elizabethan  its early tudor said ralph touchett  she turned toward him watching his face early tudor how very delightful and i suppose there are a great many others  there are many much better ones  dont say that my son the old man protested theres nothing better than this  ive got a very good one i think in some respects its rather better said lord warburton who as yet had not spoken but who had kept an attentive eye upon miss archer he slightly inclined himself smiling he had an excellent manner with women the girl appreciated it in an instant she had not forgotten that this was lord warburton i should like very much to show it to you he added  dont believe him cried the old man dont look at it its a wretched old barracknot to be compared with this  i dont knowi cant judge said the girl smiling at lord warburton  in this discussion ralph touchett took no interest whatever he stood with his hands in his pockets looking greatly as if he should like to renew his conversation with his newfound cousin  are you very fond of dogs he enquired by way of beginning he seemed to recognise that it was an awkward beginning for a clever man  very fond of them indeed  you must keep the terrier you know he went on still awkwardly  ill keep him while im here with pleasure  that will be for a long time i hope  youre very kind i hardly know my aunt must settle that  ill settle it with herat a quarter to seven and ralph looked at his watch again  im glad to be here at all said the girl  i dont believe you allow things to be settled for you  oh yes if theyre settled as i like them  i shall settle this as i like it said ralph its most unaccountable that we should never have known you  i was thereyou had only to come and see me  there where do you mean  in the united states in new york and albany and other american places  ive been thereall over but i never saw you i cant make it out  miss archer just hesitated it was because there had been some disagreement between your mother and my father after my mothers death which took place when i was a child in consequence of it we never expected to see you  ah but i dont embrace all my mothers quarrelsheaven forbid the young man cried youve lately lost your father he went on more gravely  yes more than a year ago after that my aunt was very kind to me she came to see me and proposed that i should come with her to europe  i see said ralph she has adopted you  adopted me the girl stared and her blush came back to her together with a momentary look of pain which gave her interlocutor some alarm he had underestimated the effect of his words lord warburton who appeared constantly desirous of a nearer view of miss archer strolled toward the two cousins at the moment and as he did so she rested her wider eyes on him  oh no she has not adopted me im not a candidate for adoption  i beg a thousand pardons ralph murmured i meanti meant he hardly knew what he meant  you meant she has taken me up yes she likes to take people up she has been very kind to me but she added with a certain visible eagerness of desire to be explicit im very fond of my liberty  are you talking about mrs touchett the old man called out from his chair come here my dear and tell me about her im always thankful for information  the girl hesitated again smiling shes really very benevolent she answered after which she went over to her uncle whose mirth was excited by her words  lord warburton was left standing with ralph touchett to whom in a moment he said you wished a while ago to see my idea of an interesting woman there it is    chapter iii  mrs touchett was certainly a person of many oddities of which her behaviour on returning to her husbands house after many months was a noticeable specimen she had her own way of doing all that she did and this is the simplest description of a character which although by no means without liberal motions rarely succeeded in giving an impression of suavity mrs touchett might do a great deal of good but she never pleased this way of her own of which she was so fond was not intrinsically offensiveit was just unmistakeably distinguished from the ways of others the edges of her conduct were so very clearcut that for susceptible persons it sometimes had a knifelike effect that hard fineness came out in her deportment during the first hours of her return from america under circumstances in which it might have seemed that her first act would have been to exchange greetings with her husband and son mrs touchett for reasons which she deemed excellent always retired on such occasions into impenetrable seclusion postponing the more sentimental ceremony until she had repaired the disorder of dress with a completeness which had the less reason to be of high importance as neither beauty nor vanity were concerned in it she was a plainfaced old woman without graces and without any great elegance but with an extreme respect for her own motives she was usually prepared to explain thesewhen the explanation was asked as a favour and in such a case they proved totally different from those that had been attributed to her she was virtually separated from her husband but she appeared to perceive nothing irregular in the situation it had become clear at an early stage of their community that they should never desire the same thing at the same moment and this appearance had prompted her to rescue disagreement from the vulgar realm of accident she did what she could to erect it into a lawa much more edifying aspect of itby going to live in florence where she bought a house and established herself and by leaving her husband to take care of the english branch of his bank this arrangement greatly pleased her it was so felicitously definite it struck her husband in the same light in a foggy square in london where it was at times the most definite fact he discerned but he would have preferred that such unnatural things should have a greater vagueness to agree to disagree had cost him an effort he was ready to agree to almost anything but that and saw no reason why either assent or dissent should be so terribly consistent mrs touchett indulged in no regrets nor speculations and usually came once a year to spend a month with her husband a period during which she apparently took pains to convince him that she had adopted the right system she was not fond of the english style of life and had three or four reasons for it to which she currently alluded they bore upon minor points of that ancient order but for mrs touchett they amply justified nonresidence she detested breadsauce which as she said looked like a poultice and tasted like soap she objected to the consumption of beer by her maidservants and she affirmed that the british laundress mrs touchett was very particular about the appearance of her linen was not a mistress of her art at fixed intervals she paid a visit to her own country but this last had been longer than any of its predecessors  she had taken up her niecethere was little doubt of that one wet afternoon some four months earlier than the occurrence lately narrated this young lady had been seated alone with a book to say she was so occupied is to say that her solitude did not press upon her for her love of knowledge had a fertilising quality and her imagination was strong there was at this time however a want of fresh taste in her situation which the arrival of an unexpected visitor did much to correct the visitor had not been announced the girl heard her at last walking about the adjoining room it was in an old house at albany a large square double house with a notice of sale in the windows of one of the lower apartments there were two entrances one of which had long been out of use but had never been removed they were exactly alikelarge white doors with an arched frame and wide sidelights perched upon little stoops of red stone which descended sidewise to the brick pavement of the street the two houses together formed a single dwelling the partywall having been removed and the rooms placed in communication these rooms abovestairs were extremely numerous and were painted all over exactly alike in a yellowish white which had grown sallow with time on the third floor there was a sort of arched passage connecting the two sides of the house which isabel and her sisters used in their childhood to call the tunnel and which though it was short and well lighted always seemed to the girl to be strange and lonely especially on winter afternoons she had been in the house at different periods as a child in those days her grandmother lived there then there had been an absence of ten years followed by a return to albany before her fathers death her grandmother old mrs archer had exercised chiefly within the limits of the family a large hospitality in the early period and the little girls often spent weeks under her roofweeks of which isabel had the happiest memory the manner of life was different from that of her own homelarger more plentiful practically more festal the discipline of the nursery was delightfully vague and the opportunity of listening to the conversation of ones elders which with isabel was a highlyvalued pleasure almost unbounded there was a constant coming and going her grandmothers sons and daughters and their children appeared to be in the enjoyment of standing invitations to arrive and remain so that the house offered to a certain extent the appearance of a bustling provincial inn kept by a gentle old landlady who sighed a great deal and never presented a bill isabel of course knew nothing about bills but even as a child she thought her grandmothers home romantic there was a covered piazza behind it furnished with a swing which was a source of tremulous interest and beyond this was a long garden sloping down to the stable and containing peachtrees of barely credible familiarity isabel had stayed with her grandmother at various seasons but somehow all her visits had a flavour of peaches on the other side across the street was an old house that was called the dutch housea peculiar structure dating from the earliest colonial time composed of bricks that had been painted yellow crowned with a gable that was pointed out to strangers defended by a rickety wooden paling and standing sidewise to the street it was occupied by a primary school for children of both sexes kept or rather let go by a demonstrative lady of whom isabels chief recollection was that her hair was fastened with strange bedroomy combs at the temples and that she was the widow of some one of consequence the little girl had been offered the opportunity of laying a foundation of knowledge in this establishment but having spent a single day in it she had protested against its laws and had been allowed to stay at home where in the september days when the windows of the dutch house were open she used to hear the hum of childish voices repeating the multiplication tablean incident in which the elation of liberty and the pain of exclusion were indistinguishably mingled the foundation of her knowledge was really laid in the idleness of her grandmothers house where as most of the other inmates were not reading people she had uncontrolled use of a library full of books with frontispieces which she used to climb upon a chair to take down when she had found one to her tasteshe was guided in the selection chiefly by the frontispieceshe carried it into a mysterious apartment which lay beyond the library and which was called traditionally no one knew why the office whose office it had been and at what period it had flourished she never learned it was enough for her that it contained an echo and a pleasant musty smell and that it was a chamber of disgrace for old pieces of furniture whose infirmities were not always apparent so that the disgrace seemed unmerited and rendered them victims of injustice and with which in the manner of children she had established relations almost human certainly dramatic there was an old haircloth sofa in especial to which she had confided a hundred childish sorrows the place owed much of its mysterious melancholy to the fact that it was properly entered from the second door of the house the door that had been condemned and that it was secured by bolts which a particularly slender little girl found it impossible to slide she knew that this silent motionless portal opened into the street if the sidelights had not been filled with green paper she might have looked out upon the little brown stoop and the wellworn brick pavement but she had no wish to look out for this would have interfered with her theory that there was a strange unseen place on the other sidea place which became to the childs imagination according to its different moods a region of delight or of terror  it was in the office still that isabel was sitting on that melancholy afternoon of early spring which i have just mentioned at this time she might have had the whole house to choose from and the room she had selected was the most depressed of its scenes she had never opened the bolted door nor removed the green paper renewed by other hands from its sidelights she had never assured herself that the vulgar street lay beyond a crude cold rain fell heavily the springtime was indeed an appealand it seemed a cynical insincere appealto patience isabel however gave as little heed as possible to cosmic treacheries she kept her eyes on her book and tried to fix her mind it had lately occurred to her that her mind was a good deal of a vagabond and she had spent much ingenuity in training it to a military step and teaching it to advance to halt to retreat to perform even more complicated manoeuvres at the word of command just now she had given it marching orders and it had been trudging over the sandy plains of a history of german thought suddenly she became aware of a step very different from her own intellectual pace she listened a little and perceived that some one was moving in the library which communicated with the office it struck her first as the step of a person from whom she was looking for a visit then almost immediately announced itself as the tread of a woman and a strangerher possible visitor being neither it had an inquisitive experimental quality which suggested that it would not stop short of the threshold of the office and in fact the doorway of this apartment was presently occupied by a lady who paused there and looked very hard at our heroine she was a plain elderly woman dressed in a comprehensive waterproof mantle she had a face with a good deal of rather violent point  oh she began is that where you usually sit she looked about at the heterogeneous chairs and tables  not when i have visitors said isabel getting up to receive the intruder  she directed their course back to the library while the visitor continued to look about her you seem to have plenty of other rooms theyre in rather better condition but everythings immensely worn  have you come to look at the house isabel asked the servant will show it to you  send her away i dont want to buy it she has probably gone to look for you and is wandering about upstairs she didnt seem at all intelligent you had better tell her its no matter and then since the girl stood there hesitating and wondering this unexpected critic said to her abruptly i suppose youre one of the daughters  isabel thought she had very strange manners it depends upon whose daughters you mean  the late mr archersand my poor sisters  ah said isabel slowly you must be our crazy aunt lydia  is that what your father told you to call me im your aunt lydia but im not at all crazy i havent a delusion and which of the daughters are you  im the youngest of the three and my names isabel  yes the others are lilian and edith and are you the prettiest  i havent the least idea said the girl  i think you must be and in this way the aunt and the niece made friends the aunt had quarrelled years before with her brotherinlaw after the death of her sister taking him to task for the manner in which he brought up his three girls being a hightempered man he had requested her to mind her own business and she had taken him at his word for many years she held no communication with him and after his death had addressed not a word to his daughters who had been bred in that disrespectful view of her which we have just seen isabel betray mrs touchetts behaviour was as usual perfectly deliberate she intended to go to america to look after her investments with which her husband in spite of his great financial position had nothing to do and would take advantage of this opportunity to enquire into the condition of her nieces there was no need of writing for she should attach no importance to any account of them she should elicit by letter she believed always in seeing for ones self isabel found however that she knew a good deal about them and knew about the marriage of the two elder girls knew that their poor father had left very little money but that the house in albany which had passed into his hands was to be sold for their benefit knew finally that edmund ludlow lilians husband had taken upon himself to attend to this matter in consideration of which the young couple who had come to albany during mr archers illness were remaining there for the present and as well as isabel herself occupying the old place  how much money do you expect for it mrs touchett asked of her companion who had brought her to sit in the front parlour which she had inspected without enthusiasm  i havent the least idea said the girl  thats the second time you have said that to me her aunt rejoined and yet you dont look at all stupid  im not stupid but i dont know anything about money  yes thats the way you were brought upas if you were to inherit a million what have you in point of fact inherited  i really cant tell you you must ask edmund and lilian theyll be back in half an hour  in florence we should call it a very bad house said mrs touchett but here i dare say it will bring a high price it ought to make a considerable sum for each of you in addition to that you must have something else its most extraordinary your not knowing the positions of value and theyll probably pull it down and make a row of shops i wonder you dont do that yourself you might let the shops to great advantage  isabel stared the idea of letting shops was new to her i hope they wont pull it down she said im extremely fond of it  i dont see what makes you fond of it your father died here  yes but i dont dislike it for that the girl rather strangely returned i like places in which things have happenedeven if theyre sad things a great many people have died here the place has been full of life  is that what you call being full of life  i mean full of experienceof peoples feelings and sorrows and not of their sorrows only for ive been very happy here as a child  you should go to florence if you like houses in which things have happenedespecially deaths i live in an old palace in which three people have been murdered three that were known and i dont know how many more besides  in an old palace isabel repeated  yes my dear a very different affair from this this is very bourgeois  isabel felt some emotion for she had always thought highly of her grandmothers house but the emotion was of a kind which led her to say i should like very much to go to florence  well if youll be very good and do everything i tell you ill take you there mrs touchett declared  our young womans emotion deepened she flushed a little and smiled at her aunt in silence do everything you tell me i dont think i can promise that  no you dont look like a person of that sort youre fond of your own way but its not for me to blame you  and yet to go to florence the girl exclaimed in a moment id promise almost anything  edmund and lilian were slow to return and mrs touchett had an hours uninterrupted talk with her niece who found her a strange and interesting figure a figure essentiallyalmost the first she had ever met she was as eccentric as isabel had always supposed and hitherto whenever the girl had heard people described as eccentric she had thought of them as offensive or alarming the term had always suggested to her something grotesque and even sinister but her aunt made it a matter of high but easy irony or comedy and led her to ask herself if the common tone which was all she had known had ever been as interesting no one certainly had on any occasion so held her as this little thinlipped brighteyed foreignlooking woman who retrieved an insignificant appearance by a distinguished manner and sitting there in a wellworn waterproof talked with striking familiarity of the courts of europe there was nothing flighty about mrs touchett but she recognised no social superiors and judging the great ones of the earth in a way that spoke of this enjoyed the consciousness of making an impression on a candid and susceptible mind isabel at first had answered a good many questions and it was from her answers apparently that mrs touchett derived a high opinion of her intelligence but after this she had asked a good many and her aunts answers whatever turn they took struck her as food for deep reflexion mrs touchett waited for the return of her other niece as long as she thought reasonable but as at six oclock mrs ludlow had not come in she prepared to take her departure  your sister must be a great gossip is she accustomed to staying out so many hours  youve been out almost as long as she isabel replied she can have left the house but a short time before you came in  mrs touchett looked at the girl without resentment she appeared to enjoy a bold retort and to be disposed to be gracious perhaps she hasnt had so good an excuse as i tell her at any rate that she must come and see me this evening at that horrid hotel she may bring her husband if she likes but she neednt bring you i shall see plenty of you later    chapter iv  mrs ludlow was the eldest of the three sisters and was usually thought the most sensible the classification being in general that lilian was the practical one edith the beauty and isabel the intellectual superior mrs keyes the second of the group was the wife of an officer of the united states engineers and as our history is not further concerned with her it will suffice that she was indeed very pretty and that she formed the ornament of those various military stations chiefly in the unfashionable west to which to her deep chagrin her husband was successively relegated lilian had married a new york lawyer a young man with a loud voice and an enthusiasm for his profession the match was not brilliant any more than ediths but lilian had occasionally been spoken of as a young woman who might be thankful to marry at allshe was so much plainer than her sisters she was however very happy and now as the mother of two peremptory little boys and the mistress of a wedge of brown stone violently driven into fiftythird street seemed to exult in her condition as in a bold escape she was short and solid and her claim to figure was questioned but she was conceded presence though not majesty she had moreover as people said improved since her marriage and the two things in life of which she was most distinctly conscious were her husbands force in argument and her sister isabels originality ive never kept up with isabelit would have taken all my time she had often remarked in spite of which however she held her rather wistfully in sight watching her as a motherly spaniel might watch a free greyhound i want to see her safely marriedthats what i want to see she frequently noted to her husband  well i must say i should have no particular desire to marry her edmund ludlow was accustomed to answer in an extremely audible tone  i know you say that for argument you always take the opposite ground i dont see what youve against her except that shes so original  well i dont like originals i like translations mr ludlow had more than once replied isabels written in a foreign tongue i cant make her out she ought to marry an armenian or a portuguese  thats just what im afraid shell do cried lilian who thought isabel capable of anything  she listened with great interest to the girls account of mrs touchetts appearance and in the evening prepared to comply with their aunts commands of what isabel then said no report has remained but her sisters words had doubtless prompted a word spoken to her husband as the two were making ready for their visit i do hope immensely shell do something handsome for isabel she has evidently taken a great fancy to her  what is it you wish her to do edmund ludlow asked make her a big present  no indeed nothing of the sort but take an interest in hersympathise with her shes evidently just the sort of person to appreciate her she has lived so much in foreign society she told isabel all about it you know youve always thought isabel rather foreign  you want her to give her a little foreign sympathy eh dont you think she gets enough at home  well she ought to go abroad said mrs ludlow shes just the person to go abroad  and you want the old lady to take her is that it  she has offered to take hershes dying to have isabel go but what i want her to do when she gets her there is to give her all the advantages im sure all weve got to do said mrs ludlow is to give her a chance  a chance for what  a chance to develop  oh moses edmund ludlow exclaimed i hope she isnt going to develop any more  if i were not sure you only said that for argument i should feel very badly his wife replied but you know you love her  do you know i love you the young man said jocosely to isabel a little later while he brushed his hat  im sure i dont care whether you do or not exclaimed the girl whose voice and smile however were less haughty than her words  oh she feels so grand since mrs touchetts visit said her sister  but isabel challenged this assertion with a good deal of seriousness you must not say that lily i dont feel grand at all  im sure theres no harm said the conciliatory lily  ah but theres nothing in mrs touchetts visit to make one feel grand  oh exclaimed ludlow shes grander than ever  whenever i feel grand said the girl it will be for a better reason  whether she felt grand or no she at any rate felt different as if something had happened to her left to herself for the evening she sat a while under the lamp her hands empty her usual avocations unheeded then she rose and moved about the room and from one room to another preferring the places where the vague lamplight expired she was restless and even agitated at moments she trembled a little the importance of what had happened was out of proportion to its appearance there had really been a change in her life what it would bring with it was as yet extremely indefinite but isabel was in a situation that gave a value to any change she had a desire to leave the past behind her and as she said to herself to begin afresh this desire indeed was not a birth of the present occasion it was as familiar as the sound of the rain upon the window and it had led to her beginning afresh a great many times she closed her eyes as she sat in one of the dusky corners of the quiet parlour but it was not with a desire for dozing forgetfulness it was on the contrary because she felt too wideeyed and wished to check the sense of seeing too many things at once her imagination was by habit ridiculously active when the door was not open it jumped out of the window she was not accustomed indeed to keep it behind bolts and at important moments when she would have been thankful to make use of her judgement alone she paid the penalty of having given undue encouragement to the faculty of seeing without judging at present with her sense that the note of change had been struck came gradually a host of images of the things she was leaving behind her the years and hours of her life came back to her and for a long time in a stillness broken only by the ticking of the big bronze clock she passed them in review it had been a very happy life and she had been a very fortunate personthis was the truth that seemed to emerge most vividly she had had the best of everything and in a world in which the circumstances of so many people made them unenviable it was an advantage never to have known anything particularly unpleasant it appeared to isabel that the unpleasant had been even too absent from her knowledge for she had gathered from her acquaintance with literature that it was often a source of interest and even of instruction her father had kept it away from herher handsome much loved father who always had such an aversion to it it was a great felicity to have been his daughter isabel rose even to pride in her parentage since his death she had seemed to see him as turning his braver side to his children and as not having managed to ignore the ugly quite so much in practice as in aspiration but this only made her tenderness for him greater it was scarcely even painful to have to suppose him too generous too goodnatured too indifferent to sordid considerations many persons had held that he carried this indifference too far especially the large number of those to whom he owed money of their opinions isabel was never very definitely informed but it may interest the reader to know that while they had recognised in the late mr archer a remarkably handsome head and a very taking manner indeed as one of them had said he was always taking something they had declared that he was making a very poor use of his life he had squandered a substantial fortune he had been deplorably convivial he was known to have gambled freely a few very harsh critics went so far as to say that he had not even brought up his daughters they had had no regular education and no permanent home they had been at once spoiled and neglected they had lived with nursemaids and governesses usually very bad ones or had been sent to superficial schools kept by the french from which at the end of a month they had been removed in tears this view of the matter would have excited isabels indignation for to her own sense her opportunities had been large even when her father had left his daughters for three months at neufchatel with a french bonne who had eloped with a russian nobleman staying at the same hoteleven in this irregular situation an incident of the girls eleventh year she had been neither frightened nor ashamed but had thought it a romantic episode in a liberal education her father had a large way of looking at life of which his restlessness and even his occasional incoherency of conduct had been only a proof he wished his daughters even as children to see as much of the world as possible and it was for this purpose that before isabel was fourteen he had transported them three times across the atlantic giving them on each occasion however but a few months view of the subject proposed a course which had whetted our heroines curiosity without enabling her to satisfy it she ought to have been a partisan of her father for she was the member of his trio who most made up to him for the disagreeables he didnt mention in his last days his general willingness to take leave of a world in which the difficulty of doing as one liked appeared to increase as one grew older had been sensibly modified by the pain of separation from his clever his superior his remarkable girl later when the journeys to europe ceased he still had shown his children all sorts of indulgence and if he had been troubled about moneymatters nothing ever disturbed their irreflective consciousness of many possessions isabel though she danced very well had not the recollection of having been in new york a successful member of the choreographic circle her sister edith was as every one said so very much more fetching edith was so striking an example of success that isabel could have no illusions as to what constituted this advantage or as to the limits of her own power to frisk and jump and shriekabove all with rightness of effect nineteen persons out of twenty including the younger sister herself pronounced edith infinitely the prettier of the two but the twentieth besides reversing this judgement had the entertainment of thinking all the others aesthetic vulgarians isabel had in the depths of her nature an even more unquenchable desire to please than edith but the depths of this young ladys nature were a very outoftheway place between which and the surface communication was interrupted by a dozen capricious forces she saw the young men who came in large numbers to see her sister but as a general thing they were afraid of her they had a belief that some special preparation was required for talking with her her reputation of reading a great deal hung about her like the cloudy envelope of a goddess in an epic it was supposed to engender difficult questions and to keep the conversation at a low temperature the poor girl liked to be thought clever but she hated to be thought bookish she used to read in secret and though her memory was excellent to abstain from showy reference she had a great desire for knowledge but she really preferred almost any source of information to the printed page she had an immense curiosity about life and was constantly staring and wondering she carried within herself a great fund of life and her deepest enjoyment was to feel the continuity between the movements of her own soul and the agitations of the world for this reason she was fond of seeing great crowds and large stretches of country of reading about revolutions and wars of looking at historical picturesa class of efforts as to which she had often committed the conscious solecism of forgiving them much bad painting for the sake of the subject while the civil war went on she was still a very young girl but she passed months of this long period in a state of almost passionate excitement in which she felt herself at times to her extreme confusion stirred almost indiscriminately by the valour of either army of course the circumspection of suspicious swains had never gone the length of making her a social proscript for the number of those whose hearts as they approached her beat only just fast enough to remind them they had heads as well had kept her unacquainted with the supreme disciplines of her sex and age she had had everything a girl could have kindness admiration bonbons bouquets the sense of exclusion from none of the privileges of the world she lived in abundant opportunity for dancing plenty of new dresses the london spectator the latest publications the music of gounod the poetry of browning the prose of george eliot  these things now as memory played over them resolved themselves into a multitude of scenes and figures forgotten things came back to her many others which she had lately thought of great moment dropped out of sight the result was kaleidoscopic but the movement of the instrument was checked at last by the servants coming in with the name of a gentleman the name of the gentleman was caspar goodwood he was a straight young man from boston who had known miss archer for the last twelvemonth and who thinking her the most beautiful young woman of her time had pronounced the time according to the rule i have hinted at a foolish period of history he sometimes wrote to her and had within a week or two written from new york she had thought it very possible he would come inhad indeed all the rainy day been vaguely expecting him now that she learned he was there nevertheless she felt no eagerness to receive him he was the finest young man she had ever seen was indeed quite a splendid young man he inspired her with a sentiment of high of rare respect she had never felt equally moved to it by any other person he was supposed by the world in general to wish to marry her but this of course was between themselves it at least may be affirmed that he had travelled from new york to albany expressly to see her having learned in the former city where he was spending a few days and where he had hoped to find her that she was still at the state capital isabel delayed for some minutes to go to him she moved about the room with a new sense of complications but at last she presented herself and found him standing near the lamp he was tall strong and somewhat stiff he was also lean and brown he was not romantically he was much rather obscurely handsome but his physiognomy had an air of requesting your attention which it rewarded according to the charm you found in blue eyes of remarkable fixedness the eyes of a complexion other than his own and a jaw of the somewhat angular mould which is supposed to bespeak resolution isabel said to herself that it bespoke resolution tonight in spite of which in half an hour caspar goodwood who had arrived hopeful as well as resolute took his way back to his lodging with the feeling of a man defeated he was not it may be added a man weakly to accept defeat    chapter v  ralph touchett was a philosopher but nevertheless he knocked at his mothers door at a quarter to seven with a good deal of eagerness even philosophers have their preferences and it must be admitted that of his progenitors his father ministered most to his sense of the sweetness of filial dependence his father as he had often said to himself was the more motherly his mother on the other hand was paternal and even according to the slang of the day gubernatorial she was nevertheless very fond of her only child and had always insisted on his spending three months of the year with her ralph rendered perfect justice to her affection and knew that in her thoughts and her thoroughly arranged and servanted life his turn always came after the other nearest subjects of her solicitude the various punctualities of performance of the workers of her will he found her completely dressed for dinner but she embraced her boy with her gloved hands and made him sit on the sofa beside her she enquired scrupulously about her husbands health and about the young mans own and receiving no very brilliant account of either remarked that she was more than ever convinced of her wisdom in not exposing herself to the english climate in this case she also might have given way ralph smiled at the idea of his mothers giving way but made no point of reminding her that his own infirmity was not the result of the english climate from which he absented himself for a considerable part of each year  he had been a very small boy when his father daniel tracy touchett a native of rutland in the state of vermont came to england as subordinate partner in a bankinghouse where some ten years later he gained preponderant control daniel touchett saw before him a lifelong residence in his adopted country of which from the first he took a simple sane and accommodating view but as he said to himself he had no intention of disamericanising nor had he a desire to teach his only son any such subtle art it had been for himself so very soluble a problem to live in england assimilated yet unconverted that it seemed to him equally simple his lawful heir should after his death carry on the grey old bank in the white american light he was at pains to intensify this light however by sending the boy home for his education ralph spent several terms at an american school and took a degree at an american university after which as he struck his father on his return as even redundantly native he was placed for some three years in residence at oxford oxford swallowed up harvard and ralph became at last english enough his outward conformity to the manners that surrounded him was none the less the mask of a mind that greatly enjoyed its independence on which nothing long imposed itself and which naturally inclined to adventure and irony indulged in a boundless liberty of appreciation he began with being a young man of promise at oxford he distinguished himself to his fathers ineffable satisfaction and the people about him said it was a thousand pities so clever a fellow should be shut out from a career he might have had a career by returning to his own country though this point is shrouded in uncertainty and even if mr touchett had been willing to part with him which was not the case it would have gone hard with him to put a watery waste permanently between himself and the old man whom he regarded as his best friend ralph was not only fond of his father he admired himhe enjoyed the opportunity of observing him daniel touchett to his perception was a man of genius and though he himself had no aptitude for the banking mystery he made a point of learning enough of it to measure the great figure his father had played it was not this however he mainly relished it was the fine ivory surface polished as by the english air that the old man had opposed to possibilities of penetration daniel touchett had been neither at harvard nor at oxford and it was his own fault if he had placed in his sons hands the key to modern criticism ralph whose head was full of ideas which his father had never guessed had a high esteem for the latters originality americans rightly or wrongly are commended for the ease with which they adapt themselves to foreign conditions but mr touchett had made of the very limits of his pliancy half the ground of his general success he had retained in their freshness most of his marks of primary pressure his tone as his son always noted with pleasure was that of the more luxuriant parts of new england at the end of his life he had become on his own ground as mellow as he was rich he combined consummate shrewdness with the disposition superficially to fraternise and his social position on which he had never wasted a care had the firm perfection of an unthumbed fruit it was perhaps his want of imagination and of what is called the historic consciousness but to many of the impressions usually made by english life upon the cultivated stranger his sense was completely closed there were certain differences he had never perceived certain habits he had never formed certain obscurities he had never sounded as regards these latter on the day he had sounded them his son would have thought less well of him  ralph on leaving oxford had spent a couple of years in travelling after which he had found himself perched on a high stool in his fathers bank the responsibility and honour of such positions is not i believe measured by the height of the stool which depends upon other considerations ralph indeed who had very long legs was fond of standing and even of walking about at his work to this exercise however he was obliged to devote but a limited period for at the end of some eighteen months he had become aware of his being seriously out of health he had caught a violent cold which fixed itself on his lungs and threw them into dire confusion he had to give up work and apply to the letter the sorry injunction to take care of himself at first he slighted the task it appeared to him it was not himself in the least he was taking care of but an uninteresting and uninterested person with whom he had nothing in common this person however improved on acquaintance and ralph grew at last to have a certain grudging tolerance even an undemonstrative respect for him misfortune makes strange bedfellows and our young man feeling that he had something at stake in the matterit usually struck him as his reputation for ordinary witdevoted to his graceless charge an amount of attention of which note was duly taken and which had at least the effect of keeping the poor fellow alive one of his lungs began to heal the other promised to follow its example and he was assured he might outweather a dozen winters if he would betake himself to those climates in which consumptives chiefly congregate as he had grown extremely fond of london he cursed the flatness of exile but at the same time that he cursed he conformed and gradually when he found his sensitive organ grateful even for grim favours he conferred them with a lighter hand he wintered abroad as the phrase is basked in the sun stopped at home when the wind blew went to bed when it rained and once or twice when it had snowed overnight almost never got up again  a secret hoard of indifferencelike a thick cake a fond old nurse might have slipped into his first school outfitcame to his aid and helped to reconcile him to sacrifice since at the best he was too ill for aught but that arduous game as he said to himself there was really nothing he had wanted very much to do so that he had at least not renounced the field of valour at present however the fragrance of forbidden fruit seemed occasionally to float past him and remind him that the finest of pleasures is the rush of action living as he now lived was like reading a good book in a poor translationa meagre entertainment for a young man who felt that he might have been an excellent linguist he had good winters and poor winters and while the former lasted he was sometimes the sport of a vision of virtual recovery but this vision was dispelled some three years before the occurrence of the incidents with which this history opens he had on that occasion remained later than usual in england and had been overtaken by bad weather before reaching algiers he arrived more dead than alive and lay there for several weeks between life and death his convalescence was a miracle but the first use he made of it was to assure himself that such miracles happen but once he said to himself that his hour was in sight and that it behoved him to keep his eyes upon it yet that it was also open to him to spend the interval as agreeably as might be consistent with such a preoccupation with the prospect of losing them the simple use of his faculties became an exquisite pleasure it seemed to him the joys of contemplation had never been sounded he was far from the time when he had found it hard that he should be obliged to give up the idea of distinguishing himself an idea none the less importunate for being vague and none the less delightful for having had to struggle in the same breast with bursts of inspiring selfcriticism his friends at present judged him more cheerful and attributed it to a theory over which they shook their heads knowingly that he would recover his health his serenity was but the array of wild flowers niched in his ruin  it was very probably this sweettasting property of the observed thing in itself that was mainly concerned in ralphs quicklystirred interest in the advent of a young lady who was evidently not insipid if he was consideringly disposed something told him here was occupation enough for a succession of days it may be added in summary fashion that the imagination of lovingas distinguished from that of being lovedhad still a place in his reduced sketch he had only forbidden himself the riot of expression however he shouldnt inspire his cousin with a passion nor would she be able even should she try to help him to one and now tell me about the young lady he said to his mother what do you mean to do with her  mrs touchett was prompt i mean to ask your father to invite her to stay three or four weeks at gardencourt  you neednt stand on any such ceremony as that said ralph my father will ask her as a matter of course  i dont know about that shes my niece shes not his  good lord dear mother what a sense of property thats all the more reason for his asking her but after thati mean after three months for its absurd asking the poor girl to remain but for three or four paltry weekswhat do you mean to do with her  i mean to take her to paris i mean to get her clothing  ah yes thats of course but independently of that  i shall invite her to spend the autumn with me in florence  you dont rise above detail dear mother said ralph i should like to know what you mean to do with her in a general way  my duty mrs touchett declared i suppose you pity her very much she added  no i dont think i pity her she doesnt strike me as inviting compassion i think i envy her before being sure however give me a hint of where you see your duty  in showing her four european countriesi shall leave her the choice of two of themand in giving her the opportunity of perfecting herself in french which she already knows very well  ralph frowned a little that sounds rather dryeven allowing her the choice of two of the countries  if its dry said his mother with a laugh you can leave isabel alone to water it she is as good as a summer rain any day  do you mean shes a gifted being  i dont know whether shes a gifted being but shes a clever girlwith a strong will and a high temper she has no idea of being bored  i can imagine that said ralph and then he added abruptly how do you two get on  do you mean by that that im a bore i dont think she finds me one some girls might i know but isabels too clever for that i think i greatly amuse her we get on because i understand her i know the sort of girl she is shes very frank and im very frank we know just what to expect of each other  ah dear mother ralph exclaimed one always knows what to expect of you youve never surprised me but once and thats todayin presenting me with a pretty cousin whose existence i had never suspected  do you think her so very pretty  very pretty indeed but i dont insist upon that its her general air of being some one in particular that strikes me who is this rare creature and what is she where did you find her and how did you make her acquaintance  i found her in an old house at albany sitting in a dreary room on a rainy day reading a heavy book and boring herself to death she didnt know she was bored but when i left her no doubt of it she seemed very grateful for the service you may say i shouldnt have enlightened hei should have let her alone theres a good deal in that but i acted conscientiously i thought she was meant for something better it occurred to me that it would be a kindness to take her about and introduce her to the world she thinks she knows a great deal of itlike most american girls but like most american girls shes ridiculously mistaken if you want to know i thought she would do me credit i like to be well thought of and for a woman of my age theres no greater convenience in some ways than an attractive niece you know i had seen nothing of my sisters children for years i disapproved entirely of the father but i always meant to do something for them when he should have gone to his reward i ascertained where they were to be found and without any preliminaries went and introduced myself there are two others of them both of whom are married but i saw only the elder who has by the way a very uncivil husband the wife whose name is lily jumped at the idea of my taking an interest in isabel she said it was just what her sister neededthat some one should take an interest in her she spoke of her as you might speak of some young person of geniusin want of encouragement and patronage it may be that isabels a genius but in that case ive not yet learned her special line mrs ludlow was especially keen about my taking her to europe they all regard europe over there as a land of emigration of rescue a refuge for their superfluous population isabel herself seemed very glad to come and the thing was easily arranged there was a little difficulty about the moneyquestion as she seemed averse to being under pecuniary obligations but she has a small income and she supposes herself to be travelling at her own expense  ralph had listened attentively to this judicious report by which his interest in the subject of it was not impaired ah if shes a genius he said we must find out her special line is it by chance for flirting  i dont think so you may suspect that at first but youll be wrong you wont i think in anyway be easily right about her  warburtons wrong then ralph rejoicingly exclaimed he flatters himself he has made that discovery  his mother shook her head lord warburton wont understand her he neednt try  hes very intelligent said ralph but its right he should be puzzled once in a while  isabel will enjoy puzzling a lord mrs touchett remarked  her son frowned a little what does she know about lords  nothing at all that will puzzle him all the more  ralph greeted these words with a laugh and looked out of the window then are you not going down to see my father he asked  at a quarter to eight said mrs touchett  her son looked at his watch youve another quarter of an hour then tell me some more about isabel after which as mrs touchett declined his invitation declaring that he must find out for himself well he pursued shell certainly do you credit but wont she also give you trouble  i hope not but if she does i shall not shrink from it i never do that  she strikes me as very natural said ralph  natural people are not the most trouble  no said ralph you yourself are a proof of that youre extremely natural and im sure you have never troubled any one it takes trouble to do that but tell me this it just occurs to me is isabel capable of making herself disagreeable  ah cried his mother you ask too many questions find that out for yourself  his questions however were not exhausted all this time he said youve not told me what you intend to do with her  do with her you talk as if she were a yard of calico i shall do absolutely nothing with her and she herself will do everything she chooses she gave me notice of that  what you meant then in your telegram was that her characters independent  i never know what i mean in my telegramsespecially those i send from america clearness is too expensive come down to your father  its not yet a quarter to eight said ralph  i must allow for his impatience mrs touchett answered ralph knew what to think of his fathers impatience but making no rejoinder he offered his mother his arm this put it in his power as they descended together to stop her a moment on the middle landing of the staircasethe broad low widearmed staircase of timeblackened oak which was one of the most striking features of gardencourt youve no plan of marrying her he smiled  marrying her i should be sorry to play her such a trick but apart from that shes perfectly able to marry herself she has every facility  do you mean to say she has a husband picked out  i dont know about a husband but theres a young man in boston  ralph went on he had no desire to hear about the young man in boston as my father says theyre always engaged  his mother had told him that he must satisfy his curiosity at the source and it soon became evident he should not want for occasion he had a good deal of talk with his young kinswoman when the two had been left together in the drawingroom lord warburton who had ridden over from his own house some ten miles distant remounted and took his departure before dinner and an hour after this meal was ended mr and mrs touchett who appeared to have quite emptied the measure of their forms withdrew under the valid pretext of fatigue to their respective apartments the young man spent an hour with his cousin though she had been travelling half the day she appeared in no degree spent she was really tired she knew it and knew she should pay for it on the morrow but it was her habit at this period to carry exhaustion to the furthest point and confess to it only when dissimulation broke down a fine hypocrisy was for the present possible she was interested she was as she said to herself floated she asked ralph to show her the pictures there were a great many in the house most of them of his own choosing the best were arranged in an oaken gallery of charming proportions which had a sittingroom at either end of it and which in the evening was usually lighted the light was insufficient to show the pictures to advantage and the visit might have stood over to the morrow this suggestion ralph had ventured to make but isabel looked disappointedsmiling still howeverand said if you please i should like to see them just a little she was eager she knew she was eager and now seemed so she couldnt help it she doesnt take suggestions ralph said to himself but he said it without irritation her pressure amused and even pleased him the lamps were on brackets at intervals and if the light was imperfect it was genial it fell upon the vague squares of rich colour and on the faded gilding of heavy frames it made a sheen on the polished floor of the gallery ralph took a candlestick and moved about pointing out the things he liked isabel inclining to one picture after another indulged in little exclamations and murmurs she was evidently a judge she had a natural taste he was struck with that she took a candlestick herself and held it slowly here and there she lifted it high and as she did so he found himself pausing in the middle of the place and bending his eyes much less upon the pictures than on her presence he lost nothing in truth by these wandering glances for she was better worth looking at than most works of art she was undeniably spare and ponderably light and proveably tall when people had wished to distinguish her from the other two miss archers they had always called her the willowy one her hair which was dark even to blackness had been an object of envy to many women her light grey eyes a little too firm perhaps in her graver moments had an enchanting range of concession they walked slowly up one side of the gallery and down the other and then she said well now i know more than i did when i began  you apparently have a great passion for knowledge her cousin returned  i think i have most girls are horridly ignorant  you strike me as different from most girls  ah some of them wouldbut the way theyre talked to murmured isabel who preferred not to dilate just yet on herself then in a moment to change the subject please tell meisnt there a ghost she went on  a ghost  a castlespectre a thing that appears we call them ghosts in america  so we do here when we see them  you do see them then you ought to in this romantic old house  its not a romantic old house said ralph youll be disappointed if you count on that its a dismally prosaic one theres no romance here but what you may have brought with you  ive brought a great deal but it seems to me ive brought it to the right place  to keep it out of harm certainly nothing will ever happen to it here between my father and me  isabel looked at him a moment is there never any one here but your father and you  my mother of course  oh i know your mother shes not romantic havent you other people  very few  im sorry for that i like so much to see people  oh well invite all the county to amuse you said ralph  now youre making fun of me the girl answered rather gravely who was the gentleman on the lawn when i arrived  a county neighbour he doesnt come very often  im sorry for that i liked him said isabel  why it seemed to me that you barely spoke to him ralph objected  never mind i like him all the same i like your father too immensely  you cant do better than that hes the dearest of the dear  im so sorry he is ill said isabel  you must help me to nurse him you ought to be a good nurse  i dont think i am ive been told im not im said to have too many theories but you havent told me about the ghost she added  ralph however gave no heed to this observation you like my father and you like lord warburton i infer also that you like my mother  i like your mother very much becausebecause and isabel found herself attempting to assign a reason for her affection for mrs touchett  ah we never know why said her companion laughing  i always know why the girl answered its because she doesnt expect one to like her she doesnt care whether one does or not  so you adore herout of perversity well i take greatly after my mother said ralph  i dont believe you do at all you wish people to like you and you try to make them do it  good heavens how you see through one he cried with a dismay that was not altogether jocular  but i like you all the same his cousin went on the way to clinch the matter will be to show me the ghost  ralph shook his head sadly i might show it to you but youd never see it the privilege isnt given to every one its not enviable it has never been seen by a young happy innocent person like you you must have suffered first have suffered greatly have gained some miserable knowledge in that way your eyes are opened to it i saw it long ago said ralph  i told you just now im very fond of knowledge isabel answered  yes of happy knowledgeof pleasant knowledge but you havent suffered and youre not made to suffer i hope youll never see the ghost  she had listened to him attentively with a smile on her lips but with a certain gravity in her eyes charming as he found her she had struck him as rather presumptuousindeed it was a part of her charm and he wondered what she would say im not afraid you know she said which seemed quite presumptuous enough  youre not afraid of suffering  yes im afraid of suffering but im not afraid of ghosts and i think people suffer too easily she added  i dont believe you do said ralph looking at her with his hands in his pockets  i dont think thats a fault she answered its not absolutely necessary to suffer we were not made for that  you were not certainly  im not speaking of myself and she wandered off a little  no it isnt a fault said her cousin its a merit to be strong  only if you dont suffer they call you hard isabel remarked  they passed out of the smaller drawingroom into which they had returned from the gallery and paused in the hall at the foot of the staircase here ralph presented his companion with her bedroom candle which he had taken from a niche never mind what they call you when you do suffer they call you an idiot the great points to be as happy as possible  she looked at him a little she had taken her candle and placed her foot on the oaken stair well she said thats what i came to europe for to be as happy as possible goodnight  goodnight i wish you all success and shall be very glad to contribute to it  she turned away and he watched her as she slowly ascended then with his hands always in his pockets he went back to the empty drawingroom    chapter vi  isabel archer was a young person of many theories her imagination was remarkably active it had been her fortune to possess a finer mind than most of the persons among whom her lot was cast to have a larger perception of surrounding facts and to care for knowledge that was tinged with the unfamiliar it is true that among her contemporaries she passed for a young woman of extraordinary profundity for these excellent people never withheld their admiration from a reach of intellect of which they themselves were not conscious and spoke of isabel as a prodigy of learning a creature reported to have read the classic authorsin translations her paternal aunt mrs varian once spread the rumour that isabel was writing a bookmrs varian having a reverence for books and averred that the girl would distinguish herself in print mrs varian thought highly of literature for which she entertained that esteem that is connected with a sense of privation her own large house remarkable for its assortment of mosaic tables and decorated ceilings was unfurnished with a library and in the way of printed volumes contained nothing but half a dozen novels in paper on a shelf in the apartment of one of the miss varians practically mrs varians acquaintance with literature was confined to the new york interviewer as she very justly said after you had read the interviewer you had lost all faith in culture her tendency with this was rather to keep the interviewer out of the way of her daughters she was determined to bring them up properly and they read nothing at all her impression with regard to isabels labours was quite illusory the girl had never attempted to write a book and had no desire for the laurels of authorship she had no talent for expression and too little of the consciousness of genius she only had a general idea that people were right when they treated her as if she were rather superior whether or no she were superior people were right in admiring her if they thought her so for it seemed to her often that her mind moved more quickly than theirs and this encouraged an impatience that might easily be confounded with superiority it may be affirmed without delay that isabel was probably very liable to the sin of selfesteem she often surveyed with complacency the field of her own nature she was in the habit of taking for granted on scanty evidence that she was right she treated herself to occasions of homage meanwhile her errors and delusions were frequently such as a biographer interested in preserving the dignity of his subject must shrink from specifying her thoughts were a tangle of vague outlines which had never been corrected by the judgement of people speaking with authority in matters of opinion she had had her own way and it had led her into a thousand ridiculous zigzags at moments she discovered she was grotesquely wrong and then she treated herself to a week of passionate humility after this she held her head higher than ever again for it was of no use she had an unquenchable desire to think well of herself she had a theory that it was only under this provision life was worth living that one should be one of the best should be conscious of a fine organisation she couldnt help knowing her organisation was fine should move in a realm of light of natural wisdom of happy impulse of inspiration gracefully chronic it was almost as unnecessary to cultivate doubt of ones self as to cultivate doubt of ones best friend one should try to be ones own best friend and to give ones self in this manner distinguished company the girl had a certain nobleness of imagination which rendered her a good many services and played her a great many tricks she spent half her time in thinking of beauty and bravery and magnanimity she had a fixed determination to regard the world as a place of brightness of free expansion of irresistible action she held it must be detestable to be afraid or ashamed she had an infinite hope that she should never do anything wrong she had resented so strongly after discovering them her mere errors of feeling the discovery always made her tremble as if she had escaped from a trap which might have caught her and smothered her that the chance of inflicting a sensible injury upon another person presented only as a contingency caused her at moments to hold her breath that always struck her as the worst thing that could happen to her on the whole reflectively she was in no uncertainty about the things that were wrong she had no love of their look but when she fixed them hard she recognised them it was wrong to be mean to be jealous to be false to be cruel she had seen very little of the evil of the world but she had seen women who lied and who tried to hurt each other seeing such things had quickened her high spirit it seemed indecent not to scorn them of course the danger of a high spirit was the danger of inconsistencythe danger of keeping up the flag after the place has surrendered a sort of behaviour so crooked as to be almost a dishonour to the flag but isabel who knew little of the sorts of artillery to which young women are exposed flattered herself that such contradictions would never be noted in her own conduct her life should always be in harmony with the most pleasing impression she should produce she would be what she appeared and she would appear what she was sometimes she went so far as to wish that she might find herself some day in a difficult position so that she should have the pleasure of being as heroic as the occasion demanded altogether with her meagre knowledge her inflated ideals her confidence at once innocent and dogmatic her temper at once exacting and indulgent her mixture of curiosity and fastidiousness of vivacity and indifference her desire to look very well and to be if possible even better her determination to see to try to know her combination of the delicate desultory flamelike spirit and the eager and personal creature of conditions she would be an easy victim of scientific criticism if she were not intended to awaken on the readers part an impulse more tender and more purely expectant  it was one of her theories that isabel archer was very fortunate in being independent and that she ought to make some very enlightened use of that state she never called it the state of solitude much less of singleness she thought such descriptions weak and besides her sister lily constantly urged her to come and abide she had a friend whose acquaintance she had made shortly before her fathers death who offered so high an example of useful activity that isabel always thought of her as a model henrietta stackpole had the advantage of an admired ability she was thoroughly launched in journalism and her letters to the interviewer from washington newport the white mountains and other places were universally quoted isabel pronounced them with confidence ephemeral but she esteemed the courage energy and goodhumour of the writer who without parents and without property had adopted three of the children of an infirm and widowed sister and was paying their schoolbills out of the proceeds of her literary labour henrietta was in the van of progress and had clearcut views on most subjects her cherished desire had long been to come to europe and write a series of letters to the interviewer from the radical point of viewan enterprise the less difficult as she knew perfectly in advance what her opinions would be and to how many objections most european institutions lay open when she heard that isabel was coming she wished to start at once thinking naturally that it would be delightful the two should travel together she had been obliged however to postpone this enterprise she thought isabel a glorious creature and had spoken of her covertly in some of her letters though she never mentioned the fact to her friend who would not have taken pleasure in it and was not a regular student of the interviewer henrietta for isabel was chiefly a proof that a woman might suffice to herself and be happy her resources were of the obvious kind but even if one had not the journalistic talent and a genius for guessing as henrietta said what the public was going to want one was not therefore to conclude that one had no vocation no beneficent aptitude of any sort and resign ones self to being frivolous and hollow isabel was stoutly determined not to be hollow if one should wait with the right patience one would find some happy work to ones hand of course among her theories this young lady was not without a collection of views on the subject of marriage the first on the list was a conviction of the vulgarity of thinking too much of it from lapsing into eagerness on this point she earnestly prayed she might be delivered she held that a woman ought to be able to live to herself in the absence of exceptional flimsiness and that it was perfectly possible to be happy without the society of a more or less coarseminded person of another sex the girls prayer was very sufficiently answered something pure and proud that there was in hersomething cold and dry an unappreciated suitor with a taste for analysis might have called ithad hitherto kept her from any great vanity of conjecture on the article of possible husbands few of the men she saw seemed worth a ruinous expenditure and it made her smile to think that one of them should present himself as an incentive to hope and a reward of patience deep in her soulit was the deepest thing therelay a belief that if a certain light should dawn she could give herself completely but this image on the whole was too formidable to be attractive isabels thoughts hovered about it but they seldom rested on it long after a little it ended in alarms it often seemed to her that she thought too much about herself you could have made her colour any day in the year by calling her a rank egoist she was always planning out her development desiring her perfection observing her progress her nature had in her conceit a certain gardenlike quality a suggestion of perfume and murmuring boughs of shady bowers and lengthening vistas which made her feel that introspection was after all an exercise in the open air and that a visit to the recesses of ones spirit was harmless when one returned from it with a lapful of roses but she was often reminded that there were other gardens in the world than those of her remarkable soul and that there were moreover a great many places which were not gardens at allonly dusky pestiferous tracts planted thick with ugliness and misery in the current of that repaid curiosity on which she had lately been floating which had conveyed her to this beautiful old england and might carry her much further still she often checked herself with the thought of the thousands of people who were less happy than herselfa thought which for the moment made her fine full consciousness appear a kind of immodesty what should one do with the misery of the world in a scheme of the agreeable for ones self it must be confessed that this question never held her long she was too young too impatient to live too unacquainted with pain she always returned to her theory that a young woman whom after all every one thought clever should begin by getting a general impression of life this impression was necessary to prevent mistakes and after it should be secured she might make the unfortunate condition of others a subject of special attention  england was a revelation to her and she found herself as diverted as a child at a pantomime in her infantine excursions to europe she had seen only the continent and seen it from the nursery window paris not london was her fathers mecca and into many of his interests there his children had naturally not entered the images of that time moreover had grown faint and remote and the oldworld quality in everything that she now saw had all the charm of strangeness her uncles house seemed a picture made real no refinement of the agreeable was lost upon isabel the rich perfection of gardencourt at once revealed a world and gratified a need the large low rooms with brown ceilings and dusky corners the deep embrasures and curious casements the quiet light on dark polished panels the deep greenness outside that seemed always peeping in the sense of wellordered privacy in the centre of a propertya place where sounds were felicitously accidental where the tread was muffed by the earth itself and in the thick mild air all friction dropped out of contact and all shrillness out of talkthese things were much to the taste of our young lady whose taste played a considerable part in her emotions she formed a fast friendship with her uncle and often sat by his chair when he had had it moved out to the lawn he passed hours in the open air sitting with folded hands like a placid homely household god a god of service who had done his work and received his wages and was trying to grow used to weeks and months made up only of offdays isabel amused him more than she suspectedthe effect she produced upon people was often different from what she supposedand he frequently gave himself the pleasure of making her chatter it was by this term that he qualified her conversation which had much of the point observable in that of the young ladies of her country to whom the ear of the world is more directly presented than to their sisters in other lands like the mass of american girls isabel had been encouraged to express herself her remarks had been attended to she had been expected to have emotions and opinions many of her opinions had doubtless but a slender value many of her emotions passed away in the utterance but they had left a trace in giving her the habit of seeming at least to feel and think and in imparting moreover to her words when she was really moved that prompt vividness which so many people had regarded as a sign of superiority mr touchett used to think that she reminded him of his wife when his wife was in her teens it was because she was fresh and natural and quick to understand to speakso many characteristics of her niecethat he had fallen in love with mrs touchett he never expressed this analogy to the girl herself however for if mrs touchett had once been like isabel isabel was not at all like mrs touchett the old man was full of kindness for her it was a long time as he said since they had had any young life in the house and our rustling quicklymoving clearvoiced heroine was as agreeable to his sense as the sound of flowing water he wanted to do something for her and wished she would ask it of him she would ask nothing but questions it is true that of these she asked a quantity her uncle had a great fund of answers though her pressure sometimes came in forms that puzzled him she questioned him immensely about england about the british constitution the english character the state of politics the manners and customs of the royal family the peculiarities of the aristocracy the way of living and thinking of his neighbours and in begging to be enlightened on these points she usually enquired whether they corresponded with the descriptions in the books the old man always looked at her a little with his fine dry smile while he smoothed down the shawl spread across his legs  the books he once said well i dont know much about the books you must ask ralph about that ive always ascertained for myselfgot my information in the natural form i never asked many questions even i just kept quiet and took notice of course ive had very good opportunitiesbetter than what a young lady would naturally have im of an inquisitive disposition though you mightnt think it if you were to watch me however much you might watch me i should be watching you more ive been watching these people for upwards of thirtyfive years and i dont hesitate to say that ive acquired considerable information its a very fine country on the wholefiner perhaps than what we give it credit for on the other side several improvements i should like to see introduced but the necessity of them doesnt seem to be generally felt as yet when the necessity of a thing is generally felt they usually manage to accomplish it but they seem to feel pretty comfortable about waiting till then i certainly feel more at home among them than i expected to when i first came over i suppose its because ive had a considerable degree of success when youre successful you naturally feel more at home  do you suppose that if im successful i shall feel at home isabel asked  i should think it very probable and you certainly will be successful they like american young ladies very much over here they show them a great deal of kindness but you mustnt feel too much at home you know  oh im by no means sure it will satisfy me isabel judicially emphasised i like the place very much but im not sure i shall like the people  the people are very good people especially if you like them  ive no doubt theyre good isabel rejoined but are they pleasant in society they wont rob me nor beat me but will they make themselves agreeable to me thats what i like people to do i dont hesitate to say so because i always appreciate it i dont believe theyre very nice to girls theyre not nice to them in the novels  i dont know about the novels said mr touchett i believe the novels have a great deal but i dont suppose theyre very accurate we once had a lady who wrote novels staying here she was a friend of ralphs and he asked her down she was very positive quite up to everything but she was not the sort of person you could depend on for evidence too free a fancyi suppose that was it she afterwards published a work of fiction in which she was understood to have given a representationsomething in the nature of a caricature as you might sayof my unworthy self i didnt read it but ralph just handed me the book with the principal passages marked it was understood to be a description of my conversation american peculiarities nasal twang yankee notions stars and stripes well it was not at all accurate she couldnt have listened very attentively i had no objection to her giving a report of my conversation if she liked but i didnt like the idea that she hadnt taken the trouble to listen to it of course i talk like an americani cant talk like a hottentot however i talk ive made them understand me pretty well over here but i dont talk like the old gentleman in that ladys novel he wasnt an american we wouldnt have him over there at any price i just mention that fact to show you that theyre not always accurate of course as ive no daughters and as mrs touchett resides in florence i havent had much chance to notice about the young ladies it sometimes appears as if the young women in the lower class were not very well treated but i guess their position is better in the upper and even to some extent in the middle  gracious isabel exclaimed how many classes have they about fifty i suppose  well i dont know that i ever counted them i never took much notice of the classes thats the advantage of being an american here you dont belong to any class  i hope so said isabel imagine ones belonging to an english class  well i guess some of them are pretty comfortableespecially towards the top but for me there are only two classes the people i trust and the people i dont of those two my dear isabel you belong to the first  im much obliged to you said the girl quickly her way of taking compliments seemed sometimes rather dry she got rid of them as rapidly as possible but as regards this she was sometimes misjudged she was thought insensible to them whereas in fact she was simply unwilling to show how infinitely they pleased her to show that was to show too much im sure the english are very conventional she added  theyve got everything pretty well fixed mr touchett admitted its all settled beforehandthey dont leave it to the last moment  i dont like to have everything settled beforehand said the girl i like more unexpectedness  her uncle seemed amused at her distinctness of preference well its settled beforehand that youll have great success he rejoined i suppose youll like that  i shall not have success if theyre too stupidly conventional im not in the least stupidly conventional im just the contrary thats what they wont like  no no youre all wrong said the old man you cant tell what theyll like theyre very inconsistent thats their principal interest  ah well said isabel standing before her uncle with her hands clasped about the belt of her black dress and looking up and down the lawnthat will suit me perfectly    chapter vii  the two amused themselves time and again with talking of the attitude of the british public as if the young lady had been in a position to appeal to it but in fact the british public remained for the present profoundly indifferent to miss isabel archer whose fortune had dropped her as her cousin said into the dullest house in england her gouty uncle received very little company and mrs touchett not having cultivated relations with her husbands neighbours was not warranted in expecting visits from them she had however a peculiar taste she liked to receive cards for what is usually called social intercourse she had very little relish but nothing pleased her more than to find her halltable whitened with oblong morsels of symbolic pasteboard she flattered herself that she was a very just woman and had mastered the sovereign truth that nothing in this world is got for nothing she had played no social part as mistress of gardencourt and it was not to be supposed that in the surrounding country a minute account should be kept of her comings and goings but it is by no means certain that she did not feel it to be wrong that so little notice was taken of them and that her failure really very gratuitous to make herself important in the neighbourhood had not much to do with the acrimony of her allusions to her husbands adopted country isabel presently found herself in the singular situation of defending the british constitution against her aunt mrs touchett having formed the habit of sticking pins into this venerable instrument isabel always felt an impulse to pull out the pins not that she imagined they inflicted any damage on the tough old parchment but because it seemed to her her aunt might make better use of her sharpness she was very critical herselfit was incidental to her age her sex and her nationality but she was very sentimental as well and there was something in mrs touchetts dryness that set her own moral fountains flowing  now whats your point of view she asked of her aunt when you criticise everything here you should have a point of view yours doesnt seem to be americanyou thought everything over there so disagreeable when i criticise i have mine its thoroughly american  my dear young lady said mrs touchett there are as many points of view in the world as there are people of sense to take them you may say that doesnt make them very numerous american never in the world thats shockingly narrow my point of view thank god is personal  isabel thought this a better answer than she admitted it was a tolerable description of her own manner of judging but it would not have sounded well for her to say so on the lips of a person less advanced in life and less enlightened by experience than mrs touchett such a declaration would savour of immodesty even of arrogance she risked it nevertheless in talking with ralph with whom she talked a great deal and with whom her conversation was of a sort that gave a large licence to extravagance her cousin used as the phrase is to chaff her he very soon established with her a reputation for treating everything as a joke and he was not a man to neglect the privileges such a reputation conferred she accused him of an odious want of seriousness of laughing at all things beginning with himself such slender faculty of reverence as he possessed centred wholly upon his father for the rest he exercised his wit indifferently upon his fathers son this gentlemans weak lungs his useless life his fantastic mother his friends lord warburton in especial his adopted and his native country his charming newfound cousin i keep a band of music in my anteroom he said once to her it has orders to play without stopping it renders me two excellent services it keeps the sounds of the world from reaching the private apartments and it makes the world think that dancings going on within it was dancemusic indeed that you usually heard when you came within earshot of ralphs band the liveliest waltzes seemed to float upon the air isabel often found herself irritated by this perpetual fiddling she would have liked to pass through the anteroom as her cousin called it and enter the private apartments it mattered little that he had assured her they were a very dismal place she would have been glad to undertake to sweep them and set them in order it was but halfhospitality to let her remain outside to punish him for which isabel administered innumerable taps with the ferule of her straight young wit it must be said that her wit was exercised to a large extent in selfdefence for her cousin amused himself with calling her columbia and accusing her of a patriotism so heated that it scorched he drew a caricature of her in which she was represented as a very pretty young woman dressed on the lines of the prevailing fashion in the folds of the national banner isabels chief dread in life at this period of her development was that she should appear narrowminded what she feared next afterwards was that she should really be so but she nevertheless made no scruple of abounding in her cousins sense and pretending to sigh for the charms of her native land she would be as american as it pleased him to regard her and if he chose to laugh at her she would give him plenty of occupation she defended england against his mother but when ralph sang its praises on purpose as she said to work her up she found herself able to differ from him on a variety of points in fact the quality of this small ripe country seemed as sweet to her as the taste of an october pear and her satisfaction was at the root of the good spirits which enabled her to take her cousins chaff and return it in kind if her goodhumour flagged at moments it was not because she thought herself illused but because she suddenly felt sorry for ralph it seemed to her he was talking as a blind and had little heart in what he said i dont know whats the matter with you she observed to him once but i suspect youre a great humbug  thats your privilege ralph answered who had not been used to being so crudely addressed  i dont know what you care for i dont think you care for anything you dont really care for england when you praise it you dont care for america even when you pretend to abuse it  i care for nothing but you dear cousin said ralph  if i could believe even that i should be very glad  ah well i should hope so the young man exclaimed  isabel might have believed it and not have been far from the truth he thought a great deal about her she was constantly present to his mind at a time when his thoughts had been a good deal of a burden to him her sudden arrival which promised nothing and was an openhanded gift of fate had refreshed and quickened them given them wings and something to fly for poor ralph had been for many weeks steeped in melancholy his outlook habitually sombre lay under the shadow of a deeper cloud he had grown anxious about his father whose gout hitherto confined to his legs had begun to ascend into regions more vital the old man had been gravely ill in the spring and the doctors had whispered to ralph that another attack would be less easy to deal with just now he appeared disburdened of pain but ralph could not rid himself of a suspicion that this was a subterfuge of the enemy who was waiting to take him off his guard if the manoeuvre should succeed there would be little hope of any great resistance ralph had always taken for granted that his father would survive himthat his own name would be the first grimly called the father and son had been close companions and the idea of being left alone with the remnant of a tasteless life on his hands was not gratifying to the young man who had always and tacitly counted upon his elders help in making the best of a poor business at the prospect of losing his great motive ralph lost indeed his one inspiration if they might die at the same time it would be all very well but without the encouragement of his fathers society he should barely have patience to await his own turn he had not the incentive of feeling that he was indispensable to his mother it was a rule with his mother to have no regrets he bethought himself of course that it had been a small kindness to his father to wish that of the two the active rather than the passive party should know the felt wound he remembered that the old man had always treated his own forecast of an early end as a clever fallacy which he should be delighted to discredit so far as he might by dying first but of the two triumphs that of refuting a sophistical son and that of holding on a while longer to a state of being which with all abatements he enjoyed ralph deemed it no sin to hope the latter might be vouchsafed to mr touchett  these were nice questions but isabels arrival put a stop to his puzzling over them it even suggested there might be a compensation for the intolerable ennui of surviving his genial sire he wondered whether he were harbouring love for this spontaneous young woman from albany but he judged that on the whole he was not after he had known her for a week he quite made up his mind to this and every day he felt a little more sure lord warburton had been right about her she was a really interesting little figure ralph wondered how their neighbour had found it out so soon and then he said it was only another proof of his friends high abilities which he had always greatly admired if his cousin were to be nothing more than an entertainment to him ralph was conscious she was an entertainment of a high order a character like that he said to himselfa real little passionate force to see at play is the finest thing in nature its finer than the finest work of artthan a greek basrelief than a great titian than a gothic cathedral its very pleasant to be so well treated where one had least looked for it i had never been more blue more bored than for a week before she came i had never expected less that anything pleasant would happen suddenly i receive a titian by the post to hang on my walla greek basrelief to stick over my chimneypiece the key of a beautiful edifice is thrust into my hand and im told to walk in and admire my poor boy youve been sadly ungrateful and now you had better keep very quiet and never grumble again the sentiment of these reflexions was very just but it was not exactly true that ralph touchett had had a key put into his hand his cousin was a very brilliant girl who would take as he said a good deal of knowing but she needed the knowing and his attitude with regard to her though it was contemplative and critical was not judicial he surveyed the edifice from the outside and admired it greatly he looked in at the windows and received an impression of proportions equally fair but he felt that he saw it only by glimpses and that he had not yet stood under the roof the door was fastened and though he had keys in his pocket he had a conviction that none of them would fit she was intelligent and generous it was a fine free nature but what was she going to do with herself this question was irregular for with most women one had no occasion to ask it most women did with themselves nothing at all they waited in attitudes more or less gracefully passive for a man to come that way and furnish them with a destiny isabels originality was that she gave one an impression of having intentions of her own whenever she executes them said ralph may i be there to see  it devolved upon him of course to do the honours of the place mr touchett was confined to his chair and his wifes position was that of rather a grim visitor so that in the line of conduct that opened itself to ralph duty and inclination were harmoniously mixed he was not a great walker but he strolled about the grounds with his cousina pastime for which the weather remained favourable with a persistency not allowed for in isabels somewhat lugubrious prevision of the climate and in the long afternoons of which the length was but the measure of her gratified eagerness they took a boat on the river the dear little river as isabel called it where the opposite shore seemed still a part of the foreground of the landscape or drove over the country in a phaetona low capacious thickwheeled phaeton formerly much used by mr touchett but which he had now ceased to enjoy isabel enjoyed it largely and handling the reins in a manner which approved itself to the groom as knowing was never weary of driving her uncles capital horses through winding lanes and byways full of the rural incidents she had confidently expected to find past cottages thatched and timbered past alehouses latticed and sanded past patches of ancient common and glimpses of empty parks between hedgerows made thick by midsummer when they reached home they usually found tea had been served on the lawn and that mrs touchett had not shrunk from the extremity of handing her husband his cup but the two for the most part sat silent the old man with his head back and his eyes closed his wife occupied with her knitting and wearing that appearance of rare profundity with which some ladies consider the movement of their needles  one day however a visitor had arrived the two young persons after spending an hour on the river strolled back to the house and perceived lord warburton sitting under the trees and engaged in conversation of which even at a distance the desultory character was appreciable with mrs touchett he had driven over from his own place with a portmanteau and had asked as the father and son often invited him to do for a dinner and a lodging isabel seeing him for half an hour on the day of her arrival had discovered in this brief space that she liked him he had indeed rather sharply registered himself on her fine sense and she had thought of him several times she had hoped she should see him againhoped too that she should see a few others gardencourt was not dull the place itself was sovereign her uncle was more and more a sort of golden grandfather and ralph was unlike any cousin she had ever encounteredher idea of cousins having tended to gloom then her impressions were still so fresh and so quickly renewed that there was as yet hardly a hint of vacancy in the view but isabel had need to remind herself that she was interested in human nature and that her foremost hope in coming abroad had been that she should see a great many people when ralph said to her as he had done several times i wonder you find this endurable you ought to see some of the neighbours and some of our friends because we have really got a few though you would never suppose itwhen he offered to invite what he called a lot of people and make her acquainted with english society she encouraged the hospitable impulse and promised in advance to hurl herself into the fray little however for the present had come of his offers and it may be confided to the reader that if the young man delayed to carry them out it was because he found the labour of providing for his companion by no means so severe as to require extraneous help isabel had spoken to him very often about specimens it was a word that played a considerable part in her vocabulary she had given him to understand that she wished to see english society illustrated by eminent cases  well now theres a specimen he said to her as they walked up from the riverside and he recognised lord warburton  a specimen of what asked the girl  a specimen of an english gentleman  do you mean theyre all like him  oh no theyre not all like him  hes a favourable specimen then said isabel because im sure hes nice  yes hes very nice and hes very fortunate  the fortunate lord warburton exchanged a handshake with our heroine and hoped she was very well but i neednt ask that he said since youve been handling the oars  ive been rowing a little isabel answered but how should you know it  oh i know he doesnt row hes too lazy said his lordship indicating ralph touchett with a laugh  he has a good excuse for his laziness isabel rejoined lowering her voice a little  ah he has a good excuse for everything cried lord warburton still with his sonorous mirth  my excuse for not rowing is that my cousin rows so well said ralph she does everything well she touches nothing that she doesnt adorn  it makes one want to be touched miss archer lord warburton declared  be touched in the right sense and youll never look the worse for it said isabel who if it pleased her to hear it said that her accomplishments were numerous was happily able to reflect that such complacency was not the indication of a feeble mind inasmuch as there were several things in which she excelled her desire to think well of herself had at least the element of humility that it always needed to be supported by proof  lord warburton not only spent the night at gardencourt but he was persuaded to remain over the second day and when the second day was ended he determined to postpone his departure till the morrow during this period he addressed many of his remarks to isabel who accepted this evidence of his esteem with a very good grace she found herself liking him extremely the first impression he had made on her had had weight but at the end of an evening spent in his society she scarce fell short of seeing himthough quite without luridityas a hero of romance she retired to rest with a sense of good fortune with a quickened consciousness of possible felicities its very nice to know two such charming people as those she said meaning by those her cousin and her cousins friend it must be added moreover that an incident had occurred which might have seemed to put her goodhumour to the test mr touchett went to bed at halfpast nine oclock but his wife remained in the drawingroom with the other members of the party she prolonged her vigil for something less than an hour and then rising observed to isabel that it was time they should bid the gentlemen goodnight isabel had as yet no desire to go to bed the occasion wore to her sense a festive character and feasts were not in the habit of terminating so early so without further thought she replied very simply  need i go dear aunt ill come up in half an hour  its impossible i should wait for you mrs touchett answered  ah you neednt wait ralph will light my candle isabel gaily engaged  ill light your candle do let me light your candle miss archer lord warburton exclaimed only i beg it shall not be before midnight  mrs touchett fixed her bright little eyes upon him a moment and transferred them coldly to her niece you cant stay alone with the gentlemen youre notyoure not at your blest albany my dear  isabel rose blushing i wish i were she said  oh i say mother ralph broke out  my dear mrs touchett lord warburton murmured  i didnt make your country my lord mrs touchett said majestically i must take it as i find it  cant i stay with my own cousin isabel enquired  im not aware that lord warburton is your cousin  perhaps i had better go to bed the visitor suggested that will arrange it  mrs touchett gave a little look of despair and sat down again oh if its necessary ill stay up till midnight  ralph meanwhile handed isabel her candlestick he had been watching her it had seemed to him her temper was involvedan accident that might be interesting but if he had expected anything of a flare he was disappointed for the girl simply laughed a little nodded goodnight and withdrew accompanied by her aunt for himself he was annoyed at his mother though he thought she was right abovestairs the two ladies separated at mrs touchetts door isabel had said nothing on her way up  of course youre vexed at my interfering with you said mrs touchett  isabel considered im not vexed but im surprisedand a good deal mystified wasnt it proper i should remain in the drawingroom  not in the least young girls herein decent housesdont sit alone with the gentlemen late at night  you were very right to tell me then said isabel i dont understand it but im very glad to know it  i shall always tell you her aunt answered whenever i see you taking what seems to me too much liberty  pray do but i dont say i shall always think your remonstrance just  very likely not youre too fond of your own ways  yes i think im very fond of them but i always want to know the things one shouldnt do  so as to do them asked her aunt  so as to choose said isabel    chapter viii  as she was devoted to romantic effects lord warburton ventured to express a hope that she would come some day and see his house a very curious old place he extracted from mrs touchett a promise that she would bring her niece to lockleigh and ralph signified his willingness to attend the ladies if his father should be able to spare him lord warburton assured our heroine that in the mean time his sisters would come and see her she knew something about his sisters having sounded him during the hours they spent together while he was at gardencourt on many points connected with his family when isabel was interested she asked a great many questions and as her companion was a copious talker she urged him on this occasion by no means in vain he told her he had four sisters and two brothers and had lost both his parents the brothers and sisters were very good peoplenot particularly clever you know he said but very decent and pleasant and he was so good as to hope miss archer might know them well one of the brothers was in the church settled in the family living that of lockleigh which was a heavy sprawling parish and was an excellent fellow in spite of his thinking differently from himself on every conceivable topic and then lord warburton mentioned some of the opinions held by his brother which were opinions isabel had often heard expressed and that she supposed to be entertained by a considerable portion of the human family many of them indeed she supposed she had held herself till he assured her she was quite mistaken that it was really impossible that she had doubtless imagined she entertained them but that she might depend that if she thought them over a little she would find there was nothing in them when she answered that she had already thought several of the questions involved over very attentively he declared that she was only another example of what he had often been struck withthe fact that of all the people in the world the americans were the most grossly superstitious they were rank tories and bigots every one of them there were no conservatives like american conservatives her uncle and her cousin were there to prove it nothing could be more medieval than many of their views they had ideas that people in england nowadays were ashamed to confess to and they had the impudence moreover said his lordship laughing to pretend they knew more about the needs and dangers of this poor dear stupid old england than he who was born in it and owned a considerable slice of itthe more shame to him from all of which isabel gathered that lord warburton was a nobleman of the newest pattern a reformer a radical a contemner of ancient ways his other brother who was in the army in india was rather wild and pigheaded and had not been of much use as yet but to make debts for warburton to payone of the most precious privileges of an elder brother i dont think i shall pay any more said her friend he lives a monstrous deal better than i do enjoys unheardof luxuries and thinks himself a much finer gentleman than i as im a consistent radical i go in only for equality i dont go in for the superiority of the younger brothers two of his four sisters the second and fourth were married one of them having done very well as they said the other only soso the husband of the elder lord haycock was a very good fellow but unfortunately a horrid tory and his wife like all good english wives was worse than her husband the other had espoused a smallish squire in norfolk and though married but the other day had already five children this information and much more lord warburton imparted to his young american listener taking pains to make many things clear and to lay bare to her apprehension the peculiarities of english life isabel was often amused at his explicitness and at the small allowance he seemed to make either for her own experience or for her imagination he thinks im a barbarian she said and that ive never seen forks and spoons and she used to ask him artless questions for the pleasure of hearing him answer seriously then when he had fallen into the trap its a pity you cant see me in my warpaint and feathers she remarked if i had known how kind you are to the poor savages i would have brought over my native costume lord warburton had travelled through the united states and knew much more about them than isabel he was so good as to say that america was the most charming country in the world but his recollections of it appeared to encourage the idea that americans in england would need to have a great many things explained to them if i had only had you to explain things to me in america he said i was rather puzzled in your country in fact i was quite bewildered and the trouble was that the explanations only puzzled me more you know i think they often gave me the wrong ones on purpose theyre rather clever about that over there but when i explain you can trust me about what i tell you theres no mistake there was no mistake at least about his being very intelligent and cultivated and knowing almost everything in the world although he gave the most interesting and thrilling glimpses isabel felt he never did it to exhibit himself and though he had had rare chances and had tumbled in as she put it for high prizes he was as far as possible from making a merit of it he had enjoyed the best things of life but they had not spoiled his sense of proportion his quality was a mixture of the effect of rich experienceoh so easily come bywith a modesty at times almost boyish the sweet and wholesome savour of whichit was as agreeable as something tastedlost nothing from the addition of a tone of responsible kindness  i like your specimen english gentleman very much isabel said to ralph after lord warburton had gone  i like him tooi love him well ralph returned but i pity him more  isabel looked at him askance why that seems to me his only faultthat one cant pity him a little he appears to have everything to know everything to be everything  oh hes in a bad way ralph insisted  i suppose you dont mean in health  no as to that hes detestably sound what i mean is that hes a man with a great position whos playing all sorts of tricks with it he doesnt take himself seriously  does he regard himself as a joke  much worse he regards himself as an impositionas an abuse  well perhaps he is said isabel  perhaps he isthough on the whole i dont think so but in that case whats more pitiable than a sentient selfconscious abuse planted by other hands deeply rooted but aching with a sense of its injustice for me in his place i could be as solemn as a statue of buddha he occupies a position that appeals to my imagination great responsibilities great opportunities great consideration great wealth great power a natural share in the public affairs of a great country but hes all in a muddle about himself his position his power and indeed about everything in the world hes the victim of a critical age he has ceased to believe in himself and he doesnt know what to believe in when i attempt to tell him because if i were he i know very well what i should believe in he calls me a pampered bigot i believe he seriously thinks me an awful philistine he says i dont understand my time i understand it certainly better than he who can neither abolish himself as a nuisance nor maintain himself as an institution  he doesnt look very wretched isabel observed  possibly not though being a man of a good deal of charming taste i think he often has uncomfortable hours but what is it to say of a being of his opportunities that hes not miserable besides i believe he is  i dont said isabel  well her cousin rejoined if he isnt he ought to be  in the afternoon she spent an hour with her uncle on the lawn where the old man sat as usual with his shawl over his legs and his large cup of diluted tea in his hands in the course of conversation he asked her what she thought of their late visitor  isabel was prompt i think hes charming  hes a nice person said mr touchett but i dont recommend you to fall in love with him  i shall not do it then i shall never fall in love but on your recommendation moreover isabel added my cousin gives me rather a sad account of lord warburton  oh indeed i dont know what there may be to say but you must remember that ralph must talk  he thinks your friends too subversiveor not subversive enough i dont quite understand which said isabel  the old man shook his head slowly smiled and put down his cup i dont know which either he goes very far but its quite possible he doesnt go far enough he seems to want to do away with a good many things but he seems to want to remain himself i suppose thats natural but its rather inconsistent  oh i hope hell remain himself said isabel if he were to be done away with his friends would miss him sadly  well said the old man i guess hell stay and amuse his friends i should certainly miss him very much here at gardencourt he always amuses me when he comes over and i think he amuses himself as well theres a considerable number like him round in society theyre very fashionable just now i dont know what theyre trying to dowhether theyre trying to get up a revolution i hope at any rate theyll put it off till after im gone you see they want to disestablish everything but im a pretty big landowner here and i dont want to be disestablished i wouldnt have come over if i had thought they were going to behave like that mr touchett went on with expanding hilarity i came over because i thought england was a safe country i call it a regular fraud if they are going to introduce any considerable changes therell be a large number disappointed in that case  oh i do hope theyll make a revolution isabel exclaimed i should delight in seeing a revolution  let me see said her uncle with a humorous intention i forget whether youre on the side of the old or on the side of the new ive heard you take such opposite views  im on the side of both i guess im a little on the side of everything in a revolutionafter it was well beguni think i should be a high proud loyalist one sympathises more with them and theyve a chance to behave so exquisitely i mean so picturesquely  i dont know that i understand what you mean by behaving picturesquely but it seems to me that you do that always my dear  oh you lovely man if i could believe that the girl interrupted  im afraid after all you wont have the pleasure of going gracefully to the guillotine here just now mr touchett went on if you want to see a big outbreak you must pay us a long visit you see when you come to the point it wouldnt suit them to be taken at their word  of whom are you speaking  well i mean lord warburton and his friendsthe radicals of the upper class of course i only know the way it strikes me they talk about the changes but i dont think they quite realise you and i you know we know what it is to have lived under democratic institutions i always thought them very comfortable but i was used to them from the first and then i aint a lord youre a lady my dear but i aint a lord now over here i dont think it quite comes home to them its a matter of every day and every hour and i dont think many of them would find it as pleasant as what theyve got of course if they want to try its their own business but i expect they wont try very hard  dont you think theyre sincere isabel asked  well they want to feel earnest mr touchett allowed but it seems as if they took it out in theories mostly their radical views are a kind of amusement theyve got to have some amusement and they might have coarser tastes than that you see theyre very luxurious and these progressive ideas are about their biggest luxury they make them feel moral and yet dont damage their position they think a great deal of their position dont let one of them ever persuade you he doesnt for if you were to proceed on that basis youd be pulled up very short  isabel followed her uncles argument which he unfolded with his quaint distinctness most attentively and though she was unacquainted with the british aristocracy she found it in harmony with her general impressions of human nature but she felt moved to put in a protest on lord warburtons behalf i dont believe lord warburtons a humbug i dont care what the others are i should like to see lord warburton put to the test  heaven deliver me from my friends mr touchett answered lord warburtons a very amiable young mana very fine young man he has a hundred thousand a year he owns fifty thousand acres of the soil of this little island and ever so many other things besides he has half a dozen houses to live in he has a seat in parliament as i have one at my own dinnertable he has elegant tastescares for literature for art for science for charming young ladies the most elegant is his taste for the new views it affords him a great deal of pleasuremore perhaps than anything else except the young ladies his old house over therewhat does he call it lockleighis very attractive but i dont think its as pleasant as this that doesnt matter howeverhe has so many others his views dont hurt any one as far as i can see they certainly dont hurt himself and if there were to be a revolution he would come off very easily they wouldnt touch him theyd leave him as he is hes too much liked  ah he couldnt be a martyr even if he wished isabel sighed thats a very poor position  hell never be a martyr unless you make him one said the old man  isabel shook her head there might have been something laughable in the fact that she did it with a touch of melancholy i shall never make any one a martyr  youll never be one i hope  i hope not but you dont pity lord warburton then as ralph does  her uncle looked at her a while with genial acuteness yes i do after all    chapter ix  the two misses molyneux this noblemans sisters came presently to call upon her and isabel took a fancy to the young ladies who appeared to her to show a most original stamp it is true that when she described them to her cousin by that term he declared that no epithet could be less applicable than this to the two misses molyneux since there were fifty thousand young women in england who exactly resembled them deprived of this advantage however isabels visitors retained that of an extreme sweetness and shyness of demeanour and of having as she thought eyes like the balanced basins the circles of ornamental water set in parterres among the geraniums  theyre not morbid at any rate whatever they are our heroine said to herself and she deemed this a great charm for two or three of the friends of her girlhood had been regrettably open to the charge they would have been so nice without it to say nothing of isabels having occasionally suspected it as a tendency of her own the misses molyneux were not in their first youth but they had bright fresh complexions and something of the smile of childhood yes their eyes which isabel admired were round quiet and contented and their figures also of a generous roundness were encased in sealskin jackets their friendliness was great so great that they were almost embarrassed to show it they seemed somewhat afraid of the young lady from the other side of the world and rather looked than spoke their good wishes but they made it clear to her that they hoped she would come to luncheon at lockleigh where they lived with their brother and then they might see her very very often they wondered if she wouldnt come over some day and sleep they were expecting some people on the twentyninth so perhaps she would come while the people were there  im afraid it isnt any one very remarkable said the elder sister but i dare say youll take us as you find us  i shall find you delightful i think youre enchanting just as you are replied isabel who often praised profusely  her visitors flushed and her cousin told her after they were gone that if she said such things to those poor girls they would think she was in some wild free manner practising on them he was sure it was the first time they had been called enchanting  i cant help it isabel answered i think its lovely to be so quiet and reasonable and satisfied i should like to be like that  heaven forbid cried ralph with ardour  i mean to try and imitate them said isabel i want very much to see them at home  she had this pleasure a few days later when with ralph and his mother she drove over to lockleigh she found the misses molyneux sitting in a vast drawingroom she perceived afterwards it was one of several in a wilderness of faded chintz they were dressed on this occasion in black velveteen isabel liked them even better at home than she had done at gardencourt and was more than ever struck with the fact that they were not morbid it had seemed to her before that if they had a fault it was a want of play of mind but she presently saw they were capable of deep emotion before luncheon she was alone with them for some time on one side of the room while lord warburton at a distance talked to mrs touchett  is it true your brothers such a great radical isabel asked she knew it was true but we have seen that her interest in human nature was keen and she had a desire to draw the misses molyneux out  oh dear yes hes immensely advanced said mildred the younger sister  at the same time warburtons very reasonable miss molyneux observed  isabel watched him a moment at the other side of the room he was clearly trying hard to make himself agreeable to mrs touchett ralph had met the frank advances of one of the dogs before the fire that the temperature of an english august in the ancient expanses had not made an impertinence do you suppose your brothers sincere isabel enquired with a smile  oh he must be you know mildred exclaimed quickly while the elder sister gazed at our heroine in silence  do you think he would stand the test  the test  i mean for instance having to give up all this  having to give up lockleigh said miss molyneux finding her voice  yes and the other places what are they called  the two sisters exchanged an almost frightened glance do you meando you mean on account of the expense the younger one asked  i dare say he might let one or two of his houses said the other  let them for nothing isabel demanded  i cant fancy his giving up his property said miss molyneux  ah im afraid he is an impostor isabel returned dont you think its a false position  her companions evidently had lost themselves my brothers position miss molyneux enquired  its thought a very good position said the younger sister its the first position in this part of the county  i dare say you think me very irreverent isabel took occasion to remark i suppose you revere your brother and are rather afraid of him  of course one looks up to ones brother said miss molyneux simply  if you do that he must be very goodbecause you evidently are beautifully good  hes most kind it will never be known the good he does  his ability is known mildred added every one thinks its immense  oh i can see that said isabel but if i were he i should wish to fight to the death i mean for the heritage of the past i should hold it tight  i think one ought to be liberal mildred argued gently weve always been so even from the earliest times  ah well said isabel youve made a great success of it i dont wonder you like it i see youre very fond of crewels  when lord warburton showed her the house after luncheon it seemed to her a matter of course that it should be a noble picture within it had been a good deal modernisedsome of its best points had lost their purity but as they saw it from the gardens a stout grey pile of the softest deepest most weatherfretted hue rising from a broad still moat it affected the young visitor as a castle in a legend the day was cool and rather lustreless the first note of autumn had been struck and the watery sunshine rested on the walls in blurred and desultory gleams washing them as it were in places tenderly chosen where the ache of antiquity was keenest her hosts brother the vicar had come to luncheon and isabel had had five minutes talk with himtime enough to institute a search for a rich ecclesiasticism and give it up as vain the marks of the vicar of lockleigh were a big athletic figure a candid natural countenance a capacious appetite and a tendency to indiscriminate laughter isabel learned afterwards from her cousin that before taking orders he had been a mighty wrestler and that he was still on occasionin the privacy of the family circle as it werequite capable of flooring his man isabel liked himshe was in the mood for liking everything but her imagination was a good deal taxed to think of him as a source of spiritual aid the whole party on leaving lunch went to walk in the grounds but lord warburton exercised some ingenuity in engaging his least familiar guest in a stroll apart from the others  i wish you to see the place properly seriously he said you cant do so if your attention is distracted by irrelevant gossip his own conversation though he told isabel a good deal about the house which had a very curious history was not purely archaeological he reverted at intervals to matters more personalmatters personal to the young lady as well as to himself but at last after a pause of some duration returning for a moment to their ostensible theme ah well he said im very glad indeed you like the old barrack i wish you could see more of itthat you could stay here a while my sisters have taken an immense fancy to youif that would be any inducement  theres no want of inducements isabel answered but im afraid i cant make engagements im quite in my aunts hands  ah pardon me if i say i dont exactly believe that im pretty sure you can do whatever you want  im sorry if i make that impression on you i dont think its a nice impression to make  it has the merit of permitting me to hope and lord warburton paused a moment  to hope what  that in future i may see you often  ah said isabel to enjoy that pleasure i neednt be so terribly emancipated  doubtless not and yet at the same time i dont think your uncle likes me  youre very much mistaken ive heard him speak very highly of you  im glad you have talked about me said lord warburton but i nevertheless dont think hed like me to keep coming to gardencourt  i cant answer for my uncles tastes the girl rejoined though i ought as far as possible to take them into account but for myself i shall be very glad to see you  now thats what i like to hear you say im charmed when you say that  youre easily charmed my lord said isabel  no im not easily charmed and then he stopped a moment but youve charmed me miss archer  these words were uttered with an indefinable sound which startled the girl it struck her as the prelude to something grave she had heard the sound before and she recognised it she had no wish however that for the moment such a prelude should have a sequel and she said as gaily as possible and as quickly as an appreciable degree of agitation would allow her im afraid theres no prospect of my being able to come here again  never said lord warburton  i wont say never i should feel very melodramatic  may i come and see you then some day next week  most assuredly what is there to prevent it  nothing tangible but with you i never feel safe ive a sort of sense that youre always summing people up  you dont of necessity lose by that  its very kind of you to say so but even if i gain stern justice is not what i most love is mrs touchett going to take you abroad  i hope so  is england not good enough for you  thats a very machiavellian speech it doesnt deserve an answer i want to see as many countries as i can  then youll go on judging i suppose  enjoying i hope too  yes thats what you enjoy most i cant make out what youre up to said lord warburton you strike me as having mysterious purposesvast designs  youre so good as to have a theory about me which i dont at all fill out is there anything mysterious in a purpose entertained and executed every year in the most public manner by fifty thousand of my fellowcountrymenthe purpose of improving ones mind by foreign travel  you cant improve your mind miss archer her companion declared its already a most formidable instrument it looks down on us all it despises us  despises you youre making fun of me said isabel seriously  well you think us quaintthats the same thing i wont be thought quaint to begin with im not so in the least i protest  that protest is one of the quaintest things ive ever heard isabel answered with a smile  lord warburton was briefly silent you judge only from the outsideyou dont care he said presently you only care to amuse yourself the note she had heard in his voice a moment before reappeared and mixed with it now was an audible strain of bitternessa bitterness so abrupt and inconsequent that the girl was afraid she had hurt him she had often heard that the english are a highly eccentric people and she had even read in some ingenious author that they are at bottom the most romantic of races was lord warburton suddenly turning romanticwas he going to make her a scene in his own house only the third time they had met she was reassured quickly enough by her sense of his great good manners which was not impaired by the fact that he had already touched the furthest limit of good taste in expressing his admiration of a young lady who had confided in his hospitality she was right in trusting to his good manners for he presently went on laughing a little and without a trace of the accent that had discomposed her i dont mean of course that you amuse yourself with trifles you select great materials the foibles the afflictions of human nature the peculiarities of nations  as regards that said isabel i should find in my own nation entertainment for a lifetime but weve a long drive and my aunt will soon wish to start she turned back toward the others and lord warburton walked beside her in silence but before they reached the others i shall come and see you next week he said  she had received an appreciable shock but as it died away she felt that she couldnt pretend to herself that it was altogether a painful one nevertheless she made answer to his declaration coldly enough just as you please and her coldness was not the calculation of her effecta game she played in a much smaller degree than would have seemed probable to many critics it came from a certain fear    chapter x  the day after her visit to lockleigh she received a note from her friend miss stackpolea note of which the envelope exhibiting in conjunction the postmark of liverpool and the neat calligraphy of the quickfingered henrietta caused her some liveliness of emotion here i am my lovely friend miss stackpole wrote i managed to get off at last i decided only the night before i left new yorkthe interviewer having come round to my figure i put a few things into a bag like a veteran journalist and came down to the steamer in a streetcar where are you and where can we meet i suppose youre visiting at some castle or other and have already acquired the correct accent perhaps even you have married a lord i almost hope you have for i want some introductions to the first people and shall count on you for a few the interviewer wants some light on the nobility my first impressions of the people at large are not rosecoloured but i wish to talk them over with you and you know that whatever i am at least im not superficial ive also something very particular to tell you do appoint a meeting as quickly as you can come to london i should like so much to visit the sights with you or else let me come to you wherever you are i will do so with pleasure for you know everything interests me and i wish to see as much as possible of the inner life  isabel judged best not to show this letter to her uncle but she acquainted him with its purport and as she expected he begged her instantly to assure miss stackpole in his name that he should be delighted to receive her at gardencourt though shes a literary lady he said i suppose that being an american she wont show me up as that other one did she has seen others like me  she has seen no other so delightful isabel answered but she was not altogether at ease about henriettas reproductive instincts which belonged to that side of her friends character which she regarded with least complacency she wrote to miss stackpole however that she would be very welcome under mr touchetts roof and this alert young woman lost no time in announcing her prompt approach she had gone up to london and it was from that centre that she took the train for the station nearest to gardencourt where isabel and ralph were in waiting to receive her  shall i love her or shall i hate her ralph asked while they moved along the platform  whichever you do will matter very little to her said isabel she doesnt care a straw what men think of her  as a man im bound to dislike her then she must be a kind of monster is she very ugly  no shes decidedly pretty  a female interviewera reporter in petticoats im very curious to see her ralph conceded  its very easy to laugh at her but it is not easy to be as brave as she  i should think not crimes of violence and attacks on the person require more or less pluck do you suppose shell interview me  never in the world shell not think you of enough importance  youll see said ralph shell send a description of us all including bunchie to her newspaper  i shall ask her not to isabel answered  you think shes capable of it then  perfectly  and yet youve made her your bosomfriend  ive not made her my bosomfriend but i like her in spite of her faults  ah well said ralph im afraid i shall dislike her in spite of her merits  youll probably fall in love with her at the end of three days  and have my loveletters published in the interviewer never cried the young man  the train presently arrived and miss stackpole promptly descending proved as isabel had promised quite delicately even though rather provincially fair she was a neat plump person of medium stature with a round face a small mouth a delicate complexion a bunch of light brown ringlets at the back of her head and a peculiarly open surprisedlooking eye the most striking point in her appearance was the remarkable fixedness of this organ which rested without impudence or defiance but as if in conscientious exercise of a natural right upon every object it happened to encounter it rested in this manner upon ralph himself a little arrested by miss stackpoles gracious and comfortable aspect which hinted that it wouldnt be so easy as he had assumed to disapprove of her she rustled she shimmered in fresh dovecoloured draperies and ralph saw at a glance that she was as crisp and new and comprehensive as a first issue before the folding from top to toe she had probably no misprint she spoke in a clear high voicea voice not rich but loud yet after she had taken her place with her companions in mr touchetts carriage she struck him as not all in the large type the type of horrid headings that he had expected she answered the enquiries made of her by isabel however and in which the young man ventured to join with copious lucidity and later in the library at gardencourt when she had made the acquaintance of mr touchett his wife not having thought it necessary to appear did more to give the measure of her confidence in her powers  well i should like to know whether you consider yourselves american or english she broke out if once i knew i could talk to you accordingly  talk to us anyhow and we shall be thankful ralph liberally answered  she fixed her eyes on him and there was something in their character that reminded him of large polished buttonsbuttons that might have fixed the elastic loops of some tense receptacle he seemed to see the reflection of surrounding objects on the pupil the expression of a button is not usually deemed human but there was something in miss stackpoles gaze that made him as a very modest man feel vaguely embarrassedless inviolate more dishonoured than he liked this sensation it must be added after he had spent a day or two in her company sensibly diminished though it never wholly lapsed i dont suppose that youre going to undertake to persuade me that youre an american she said  to please you ill be an englishman ill be a turk  well if you can change about that way youre very welcome miss stackpole returned  im sure you understand everything and that differences of nationality are no barrier to you ralph went on  miss stackpole gazed at him still do you mean the foreign languages  the languages are nothing i mean the spiritthe genius  im not sure that i understand you said the correspondent of the interviewer but i expect i shall before i leave  hes whats called a cosmopolite isabel suggested  that means hes a little of everything and not much of any i must say i think patriotism is like charityit begins at home  ah but where does home begin miss stackpole ralph enquired  i dont know where it begins but i know where it ends it ended a long time before i got here  dont you like it over here asked mr touchett with his aged innocent voice  well sir i havent quite made up my mind what ground i shall take i feel a good deal cramped i felt it on the journey from liverpool to london  perhaps you were in a crowded carriage ralph suggested  yes but it was crowded with friendsparty of americans whose acquaintance i had made upon the steamer a lovely group from little rock arkansas in spite of that i felt crampedi felt something pressing upon me i couldnt tell what it was i felt at the very commencement as if i were not going to accord with the atmosphere but i suppose i shall make my own atmosphere thats the true waythen you can breathe your surroundings seem very attractive  ah we too are a lovely group said ralph wait a little and youll see  miss stackpole showed every disposition to wait and evidently was prepared to make a considerable stay at gardencourt she occupied herself in the mornings with literary labour but in spite of this isabel spent many hours with her friend who once her daily task performed deprecated in fact defied isolation isabel speedily found occasion to desire her to desist from celebrating the charms of their common sojourn in print having discovered on the second morning of miss stackpoles visit that she was engaged on a letter to the interviewer of which the title in her exquisitely neat and legible hand exactly that of the copybooks which our heroine remembered at school was americans and tudorsglimpses of gardencourt miss stackpole with the best conscience in the world offered to read her letter to isabel who immediately put in her protest  i dont think you ought to do that i dont think you ought to describe the place  henrietta gazed at her as usual why its just what the people want and its a lovely place  its too lovely to be put in the newspapers and its not what my uncle wants  dont you believe that cried henrietta theyre always delighted afterwards  my uncle wont be delightednor my cousin either theyll consider it a breach of hospitality  miss stackpole showed no sense of confusion she simply wiped her pen very neatly upon an elegant little implement which she kept for the purpose and put away her manuscript of course if you dont approve i wont do it but i sacrifice a beautiful subject  there are plenty of other subjects there are subjects all round you well take some drives ill show you some charming scenery  scenerys not my department i always need a human interest you know im deeply human isabel i always was miss stackpole rejoined i was going to bring in your cousinthe alienated american theres a great demand just now for the alienated american and your cousins a beautiful specimen i should have handled him severely  he would have died of it isabel exclaimed not of the severity but of the publicity  well i should have liked to kill him a little and i should have delighted to do your uncle who seems to me a much nobler typethe american faithful still hes a grand old man i dont see how he can object to my paying him honour  isabel looked at her companion in much wonderment it struck her as strange that a nature in which she found so much to esteem should break down so in spots my poor henrietta she said youve no sense of privacy  henrietta coloured deeply and for a moment her brilliant eyes were suffused while isabel found her more than ever inconsequent you do me great injustice said miss stackpole with dignity ive never written a word about myself  im very sure of that but it seems to me one should be modest for others also  ah thats very good cried henrietta seizing her pen again just let me make a note of it and ill put it in somewhere she was a thoroughly goodnatured woman and half an hour later she was in as cheerful a mood as should have been looked for in a newspaperlady in want of matter ive promised to do the social side she said to isabel and how can i do it unless i get ideas if i cant describe this place dont you know some place i can describe isabel promised she would bethink herself and the next day in conversation with her friend she happened to mention her visit to lord warburtons ancient house ah you must take me therethats just the place for me miss stackpole cried i must get a glimpse of the nobility  i cant take you said isabel but lord warburtons coming here and youll have a chance to see him and observe him only if you intend to repeat his conversation i shall certainly give him warning  dont do that her companion pleaded i want him to be natural  an englishmans never so natural as when hes holding his tongue isabel declared  it was not apparent at the end of three days that her cousin had according to her prophecy lost his heart to their visitor though he had spent a good deal of time in her society they strolled about the park together and sat under the trees and in the afternoon when it was delightful to float along the thames miss stackpole occupied a place in the boat in which hitherto ralph had had but a single companion her presence proved somehow less irreducible to soft particles than ralph had expected in the natural perturbation of his sense of the perfect solubility of that of his cousin for the correspondent of the interviewer prompted mirth in him and he had long since decided that the crescendo of mirth should be the flower of his declining days henrietta on her side failed a little to justify isabels declaration with regard to her indifference to masculine opinion for poor ralph appeared to have presented himself to her as an irritating problem which it would be almost immoral not to work out  what does he do for a living she asked of isabel the evening of her arrival does he go round all day with his hands in his pockets  he does nothing smiled isabel hes a gentleman of large leisure  well i call that a shamewhen i have to work like a carconductor miss stackpole replied i should like to show him up  hes in wretched health hes quite unfit for work isabel urged  pshaw dont you believe it i work when im sick cried her friend later when she stepped into the boat on joining the waterparty she remarked to ralph that she supposed he hated her and would like to drown her  ah no said ralph i keep my victims for a slower torture and youd be such an interesting one  well you do torture me i may say that but i shock all your prejudices thats one comfort  my prejudices i havent a prejudice to bless myself with theres intellectual poverty for you  the more shame to you ive some delicious ones of course i spoil your flirtation or whatever it is you call it with your cousin but i dont care for that as i render her the service of drawing you out shell see how thin you are  ah do draw me out ralph exclaimed so few people will take the trouble  miss stackpole in this undertaking appeared to shrink from no effort resorting largely whenever the opportunity offered to the natural expedient of interrogation on the following day the weather was bad and in the afternoon the young man by way of providing indoor amusement offered to show her the pictures henrietta strolled through the long gallery in his society while he pointed out its principal ornaments and mentioned the painters and subjects miss stackpole looked at the pictures in perfect silence committing herself to no opinion and ralph was gratified by the fact that she delivered herself of none of the little readymade ejaculations of delight of which the visitors to gardencourt were so frequently lavish this young lady indeed to do her justice was but little addicted to the use of conventional terms there was something earnest and inventive in her tone which at times in its strained deliberation suggested a person of high culture speaking a foreign language ralph touchett subsequently learned that she had at one time officiated as art critic to a journal of the other world but she appeared in spite of this fact to carry in her pocket none of the small change of admiration suddenly just after he had called her attention to a charming constable she turned and looked at him as if he himself had been a picture  do you always spend your time like this she demanded  i seldom spend it so agreeably  well you know what i meanwithout any regular occupation  ah said ralph im the idlest man living  miss stackpole directed her gaze to the constable again and ralph bespoke her attention for a small lancret hanging near it which represented a gentleman in a pink doublet and hose and a ruff leaning against the pedestal of the statue of a nymph in a garden and playing the guitar to two ladies seated on the grass thats my ideal of a regular occupation he said  miss stackpole turned to him again and though her eyes had rested upon the picture he saw she had missed the subject she was thinking of something much more serious i dont see how you can reconcile it to your conscience  my dear lady i have no conscience  well i advise you to cultivate one youll need it the next time you go to america  i shall probably never go again  are you ashamed to show yourself  ralph meditated with a mild smile i suppose that if one has no conscience one has no shame  well youve got plenty of assurance henrietta declared do you consider it right to give up your country  ah one doesnt give up ones country any more than one gives up ones grandmother theyre both antecedent to choiceelements of ones composition that are not to be eliminated  i suppose that means that youve tried and been worsted what do they think of you over here  they delight in me  thats because you truckle to them  ah set it down a little to my natural charm ralph sighed  i dont know anything about your natural charm if youve got any charm its quite unnatural its wholly acquiredor at least youve tried hard to acquire it living over here i dont say youve succeeded its a charm that i dont appreciate anyway make yourself useful in some way and then well talk about it well now tell me what i shall do said ralph  go right home to begin with  yes i see and then  take right hold of something  well now what sort of thing  anything you please so long as you take hold some new idea some big work  is it very difficult to take hold ralph enquired  not if you put your heart into it  ah my heart said ralph if it depends upon my heart  havent you got a heart  i had one a few days ago but ive lost it since  youre not serious miss stackpole remarked thats whats the matter with you but for all this in a day or two she again permitted him to fix her attention and on the later occasion assigned a different cause to her mysterious perversity i know whats the matter with you mr touchett she said you think youre too good to get married  i thought so till i knew you miss stackpole ralph answered and then i suddenly changed my mind  oh pshaw henrietta groaned  then it seemed to me said ralph that i was not good enough  it would improve you besides its your duty  ah cried the young man one has so many duties is that a duty too  of course it isdid you never know that before its every ones duty to get married  ralph meditated a moment he was disappointed there was something in miss stackpole he had begun to like it seemed to him that if she was not a charming woman she was at least a very good sort she was wanting in distinction but as isabel had said she was brave she went into cages she flourished lashes like a spangled liontamer he had not supposed her to be capable of vulgar arts but these last words struck him as a false note when a marriageable young woman urges matrimony on an unencumbered young man the most obvious explanation of her conduct is not the altruistic impulse  ah well now theres a good deal to be said about that ralph rejoined  there may be but thats the principal thing i must say i think it looks very exclusive going round all alone as if you thought no woman was good enough for you do you think youre better than any one else in the world in america its usual for people to marry  if its my duty ralph asked is it not by analogy yours as well  miss stackpoles ocular surfaces unwinkingly caught the sun have you the fond hope of finding a flaw in my reasoning of course ive as good a right to marry as any one else  well then said ralph i wont say it vexes me to see you single it delights me rather  youre not serious yet you never will be  shall you not believe me to be so on the day i tell you i desire to give up the practice of going round alone  miss stackpole looked at him for a moment in a manner which seemed to announce a reply that might technically be called encouraging but to his great surprise this expression suddenly resolved itself into an appearance of alarm and even of resentment no not even then she answered dryly after which she walked away  ive not conceived a passion for your friend ralph said that evening to isabel though we talked some time this morning about it  and you said something she didnt like the girl replied  ralph stared has she complained of me  she told me she thinks theres something very low in the tone of europeans towards women  does she call me a european  one of the worst she told me you had said to her something that an american never would have said but she didnt repeat it  ralph treated himself to a luxury of laughter shes an extraordinary combination did she think i was making love to her  no i believe even americans do that but she apparently thought you mistook the intention of something she had said and put an unkind construction on it  i thought she was proposing marriage to me and i accepted her was that unkind  isabel smiled it was unkind to me i dont want you to marry  my dear cousin whats one to do among you all ralph demanded miss stackpole tells me its my bounden duty and that its hers in general to see i do mine  she has a great sense of duty said isabel gravely she has indeed and its the motive of everything she says thats what i like her for she thinks its unworthy of you to keep so many things to yourself thats what she wanted to express if you thought she was trying toto attract you you were very wrong  its true it was an odd way but i did think she was trying to attract me forgive my depravity  youre very conceited she had no interested views and never supposed you would think she had  one must be very modest then to talk with such women ralph said humbly but its a very strange type shes too personalconsidering that she expects other people not to be she walks in without knocking at the door  yes isabel admitted she doesnt sufficiently recognise the existence of knockers and indeed im not sure that she doesnt think them rather a pretentious ornament she thinks ones door should stand ajar but i persist in liking her  i persist in thinking her too familiar ralph rejoined naturally somewhat uncomfortable under the sense of having been doubly deceived in miss stackpole  well said isabel smiling im afraid its because shes rather vulgar that i like her  she would be flattered by your reason  if i should tell her i wouldnt express it in that way i should say its because theres something of the people in her  what do you know about the people and what does she for that matter  she knows a great deal and i know enough to feel that shes a kind of emanation of the great democracyof the continent the country the nation i dont say that she sums it all up that would be too much to ask of her but she suggests it she vividly figures it  you like her then for patriotic reasons im afraid it is on those very grounds i object to her  ah said isabel with a kind of joyous sigh i like so many things if a thing strikes me with a certain intensity i accept it i dont want to swagger but i suppose im rather versatile i like people to be totally different from henriettain the style of lord warburtons sisters for instance so long as i look at the misses molyneux they seem to me to answer a kind of ideal then henrietta presents herself and im straightway convinced by her not so much in respect to herself as in respect to what masses behind her  ah you mean the back view of her ralph suggested  what she says is true his cousin answered youll never be serious i like the great country stretching away beyond the rivers and across the prairies blooming and smiling and spreading till it stops at the green pacific a strong sweet fresh odour seems to rise from it and henriettapardon my similehas something of that odour in her garments  isabel blushed a little as she concluded this speech and the blush together with the momentary ardour she had thrown into it was so becoming to her that ralph stood smiling at her for a moment after she had ceased speaking im not sure the pacifics so green as that he said but youre a young woman of imagination henrietta however does smell of the futureit almost knocks one down    chapter xi  he took a resolve after this not to misinterpret her words even when miss stackpole appeared to strike the personal note most strongly he bethought himself that persons in her view were simple and homogeneous organisms and that he for his own part was too perverted a representative of the nature of man to have a right to deal with her in strict reciprocity he carried out his resolve with a great deal of tact and the young lady found in renewed contact with him no obstacle to the exercise of her genius for unshrinking enquiry the general application of her confidence her situation at gardencourt therefore appreciated as we have seen her to be by isabel and full of appreciation herself of that free play of intelligence which to her sense rendered isabels character a sisterspirit and of the easy venerableness of mr touchett whose noble tone as she said met with her full approvalher situation at gardencourt would have been perfectly comfortable had she not conceived an irresistible mistrust of the little lady for whom she had at first supposed herself obliged to allow as mistress of the house she presently discovered in truth that this obligation was of the lightest and that mrs touchett cared very little how miss stackpole behaved mrs touchett had defined her to isabel as both an adventuress and a boreadventuresses usually giving one more of a thrill she had expressed some surprise at her nieces having selected such a friend yet had immediately added that she knew isabels friends were her own affair and that she had never undertaken to like them all or to restrict the girl to those she liked  if you could see none but the people i like my dear youd have a very small society mrs touchett frankly admitted and i dont think i like any man or woman well enough to recommend them to you when it comes to recommending its a serious affair i dont like miss stackpoleeverything about her displeases me she talks so much too loud and looks at one as if one wanted to look at herwhich one doesnt im sure she has lived all her life in a boardinghouse and i detest the manners and the liberties of such places if you ask me if i prefer my own manners which you doubtless think very bad ill tell you that i prefer them immensely miss stackpole knows i detest boardinghouse civilisation and she detests me for detesting it because she thinks it the highest in the world shed like gardencourt a great deal better if it were a boardinghouse for me i find it almost too much of one we shall never get on together therefore and theres no use trying  mrs touchett was right in guessing that henrietta disapproved of her but she had not quite put her finger on the reason a day or two after miss stackpoles arrival she had made some invidious reflexions on american hotels which excited a vein of counterargument on the part of the correspondent of the interviewer who in the exercise of her profession had acquainted herself in the western world with every form of caravansary henrietta expressed the opinion that american hotels were the best in the world and mrs touchett fresh from a renewed struggle with them recorded a conviction that they were the worst ralph with his experimental geniality suggested by way of healing the breach that the truth lay between the two extremes and that the establishments in question ought to be described as fair middling this contribution to the discussion however miss stackpole rejected with scorn middling indeed if they were not the best in the world they were the worst but there was nothing middling about an american hotel  we judge from different points of view evidently said mrs touchett i like to be treated as an individual you like to be treated as a party  i dont know what you mean henrietta replied i like to be treated as an american lady  poor american ladies cried mrs touchett with a laugh theyre the slaves of slaves  theyre the companions of freemen henrietta retorted  theyre the companions of their servantsthe irish chambermaid and the negro waiter they share their work  do you call the domestics in an american household slaves miss stackpole enquired if thats the way you desire to treat them no wonder you dont like america  if youve not good servants youre miserable mrs touchett serenely said theyre very bad in america but ive five perfect ones in florence  i dont see what you want with five henrietta couldnt help observing i dont think i should like to see five persons surrounding me in that menial position  i like them in that position better than in some others proclaimed mrs touchett with much meaning  should you like me better if i were your butler dear her husband asked  i dont think i should you wouldnt at all have the tenue  the companions of freemeni like that miss stackpole said ralph its a beautiful description  when i said freemen i didnt mean you sir  and this was the only reward that ralph got for his compliment miss stackpole was baffled she evidently thought there was something treasonable in mrs touchetts appreciation of a class which she privately judged to be a mysterious survival of feudalism it was perhaps because her mind was oppressed with this image that she suffered some days to elapse before she took occasion to say to isabel my dear friend i wonder if youre growing faithless  faithless faithless to you henrietta  no that would be a great pain but its not that  faithless to my country then  ah that i hope will never be when i wrote to you from liverpool i said i had something particular to tell you youve never asked me what it is is it because youve suspected  suspected what as a rule i dont think i suspect said isabel  i remember now that phrase in your letter but i confess i had forgotten it what have you to tell me  henrietta looked disappointed and her steady gaze betrayed it you dont ask that rightas if you thought it important youre changedyoure thinking of other things  tell me what you mean and ill think of that  will you really think of it thats what i wish to be sure of  ive not much control of my thoughts but ill do my best said isabel henrietta gazed at her in silence for a period which tried isabels patience so that our heroine added at last do you mean that youre going to be married  not till ive seen europe said miss stackpole what are you laughing at she went on what i mean is that mr goodwood came out in the steamer with me  ah isabel responded  you say that right i had a good deal of talk with him he has come after you  did he tell you so  no he told me nothing thats how i knew it said henrietta cleverly he said very little about you but i spoke of you a good deal  isabel waited at the mention of mr goodwoods name she had turned a little pale im very sorry you did that she observed at last  it was a pleasure to me and i liked the way he listened i could have talked a long time to such a listener he was so quiet so intense he drank it all in  what did you say about me isabel asked  i said you were on the whole the finest creature i know  im very sorry for that he thinks too well of me already he oughtnt to be encouraged  hes dying for a little encouragement i see his face now and his earnest absorbed look while i talked i never saw an ugly man look so handsome  hes very simpleminded said isabel and hes not so ugly  theres nothing so simplifying as a grand passion  its not a grand passion im very sure its not that  you dont say that as if you were sure  isabel gave rather a cold smile i shall say it better to mr goodwood himself  hell soon give you a chance said henrietta isabel offered no answer to this assertion which her companion made with an air of great confidence hell find you changed the latter pursued youve been affected by your new surroundings  very likely im affected by everything  by everything but mr goodwood miss stackpole exclaimed with a slightly harsh hilarity  isabel failed even to smile back and in a moment she said did he ask you to speak to me  not in so many words but his eyes asked itand his handshake when he bade me goodbye  thank you for doing so and isabel turned away  yes youre changed youve got new ideas over here her friend continued  i hope so said isabel one should get as many new ideas as possible  yes but they shouldnt interfere with the old ones when the old ones have been the right ones  isabel turned about again if you mean that i had any idea with regard to mr goodwood but she faltered before her friends implacable glitter  my dear child you certainly encouraged him  isabel made for the moment as if to deny this charge instead of which however she presently answered its very true i did encourage him and then she asked if her companion had learned from mr goodwood what he intended to do it was a concession to her curiosity for she disliked discussing the subject and found henrietta wanting in delicacy  i asked him and he said he meant to do nothing miss stackpole answered but i dont believe that hes not a man to do nothing he is a man of high bold action whatever happens to him hell always do something and whatever he does will always be right  i quite believe that henrietta might be wanting in delicacy but it touched the girl all the same to hear this declaration  ah you do care for him her visitor rang out  whatever he does will always be right isabel repeated when a mans of that infallible mould what does it matter to him what one feels  it may not matter to him but it matters to ones self  ah what it matters to methats not what were discussing said isabel with a cold smile  this time her companion was grave well i dont care you have changed youre not the girl you were a few short weeks ago and mr goodwood will see it i expect him here any day  i hope hell hate me then said isabel  i believe you hope it about as much as i believe him capable of it  to this observation our heroine made no return she was absorbed in the alarm given her by henriettas intimation that caspar goodwood would present himself at gardencourt she pretended to herself however that she thought the event impossible and later she communicated her disbelief to her friend for the next fortyeight hours nevertheless she stood prepared to hear the young mans name announced the feeling pressed upon her it made the air sultry as if there were to be a change of weather and the weather socially speaking had been so agreeable during isabels stay at gardencourt that any change would be for the worse her suspense indeed was dissipated the second day she had walked into the park in company with the sociable bunchie and after strolling about for some time in a manner at once listless and restless had seated herself on a gardenbench within sight of the house beneath a spreading beech where in a white dress ornamented with black ribbons she formed among the flickering shadows a graceful and harmonious image she entertained herself for some moments with talking to the little terrier as to whom the proposal of an ownership divided with her cousin had been applied as impartially as possibleas impartially as bunchies own somewhat fickle and inconstant sympathies would allow but she was notified for the first time on this occasion of the finite character of bunchies intellect hitherto she had been mainly struck with its extent it seemed to her at last that she would do well to take a book formerly when heavyhearted she had been able with the help of some wellchosen volume to transfer the seat of consciousness to the organ of pure reason of late it was not to be denied literature had seemed a fading light and even after she had reminded herself that her uncles library was provided with a complete set of those authors which no gentlemans collection should be without she sat motionless and emptyhanded her eyes bent on the cool green turf of the lawn her meditations were presently interrupted by the arrival of a servant who handed her a letter the letter bore the london postmark and was addressed in a hand she knewthat came into her vision already so held by him with the vividness of the writers voice or his face this document proved short and may be given entire  my dear miss archeri dont know whether you will have heard of my coming to england but even if you have not it will scarcely be a surprise to you you will remember that when you gave me my dismissal at albany three months ago i did not accept it i protested against it you in fact appeared to accept my protest and to admit that i had the right on my side i had come to see you with the hope that you would let me bring you over to my conviction my reasons for entertaining this hope had been of the best but you disappointed it i found you changed and you were able to give me no reason for the change you admitted that you were unreasonable and it was the only concession you would make but it was a very cheap one because thats not your character no you are not and you never will be arbitrary or capricious therefore it is that i believe you will let me see you again you told me that im not disagreeable to you and i believe it for i dont see why that should be i shall always think of you i shall never think of any one else i came to england simply because you are here i couldnt stay at home after you had gone i hated the country because you were not in it if i like this country at present it is only because it holds you i have been to england before but have never enjoyed it much may i not come and see you for half an hour this at present is the dearest wish of yours faithfully  caspar goodwood   isabel read this missive with such deep attention that she had not perceived an approaching tread on the soft grass looking up however as she mechanically folded it she saw lord warburton standing before her    chapter xii  she put the letter into her pocket and offered her visitor a smile of welcome exhibiting no trace of discomposure and half surprised at her coolness  they told me you were out here said lord warburton and as there was no one in the drawingroom and its really you that i wish to see i came out with no more ado  isabel had got up she felt a wish for the moment that he should not sit down beside her i was just going indoors  please dont do that its much jollier here ive ridden over from lockleigh its a lovely day his smile was peculiarly friendly and pleasing and his whole person seemed to emit that radiance of goodfeeling and good fare which had formed the charm of the girls first impression of him it surrounded him like a zone of fine june weather  well walk about a little then said isabel who could not divest herself of the sense of an intention on the part of her visitor and who wished both to elude the intention and to satisfy her curiosity about it it had flashed upon her vision once before and it had given her on that occasion as we know a certain alarm this alarm was composed of several elements not all of which were disagreeable she had indeed spent some days in analysing them and had succeeded in separating the pleasant part of the idea of lord warburtons making up to her from the painful it may appear to some readers that the young lady was both precipitate and unduly fastidious but the latter of these facts if the charge be true may serve to exonerate her from the discredit of the former she was not eager to convince herself that a territorial magnate as she had heard lord warburton called was smitten with her charms the fact of a declaration from such a source carrying with it really more questions than it would answer she had received a strong impression of his being a personage and she had occupied herself in examining the image so conveyed at the risk of adding to the evidence of her selfsufficiency it must be said that there had been moments when this possibility of admiration by a personage represented to her an aggression almost to the degree of an affront quite to the degree of an inconvenience she had never yet known a personage there had been no personages in this sense in her life there were probably none such at all in her native land when she had thought of individual eminence she had thought of it on the basis of character and witof what one might like in a gentlemans mind and in his talk she herself was a charactershe couldnt help being aware of that and hitherto her visions of a completed consciousness had concerned themselves largely with moral imagesthings as to which the question would be whether they pleased her sublime soul lord warburton loomed up before her largely and brightly as a collection of attributes and powers which were not to be measured by this simple rule but which demanded a different sort of appreciationan appreciation that the girl with her habit of judging quickly and freely felt she lacked patience to bestow he appeared to demand of her something that no one else as it were had presumed to do what she felt was that a territorial a political a social magnate had conceived the design of drawing her into the system in which he rather invidiously lived and moved a certain instinct not imperious but persuasive told her to resistmurmured to her that virtually she had a system and an orbit of her own it told her other things besidesthings which both contradicted and confirmed each other that a girl might do much worse than trust herself to such a man and that it would be very interesting to see something of his system from his own point of view that on the other hand however there was evidently a great deal of it which she should regard only as a complication of every hour and that even in the whole there was something stiff and stupid which would make it a burden furthermore there was a young man lately come from america who had no system at all but who had a character of which it was useless for her to try to persuade herself that the impression on her mind had been light the letter she carried in her pocket all sufficiently reminded her of the contrary smile not however i venture to repeat at this simple young woman from albany who debated whether she should accept an english peer before he had offered himself and who was disposed to believe that on the whole she could do better she was a person of great good faith and if there was a great deal of folly in her wisdom those who judge her severely may have the satisfaction of finding that later she became consistently wise only at the cost of an amount of folly which will constitute almost a direct appeal to charity  lord warburton seemed quite ready to walk to sit or to do anything that isabel should propose and he gave her this assurance with his usual air of being particularly pleased to exercise a social virtue but he was nevertheless not in command of his emotions and as he strolled beside her for a moment in silence looking at her without letting her know it there was something embarrassed in his glance and his misdirected laughter yes assuredlyas we have touched on the point we may return to it for a moment againthe english are the most romantic people in the world and lord warburton was about to give an example of it he was about to take a step which would astonish all his friends and displease a great many of them and which had superficially nothing to recommend it the young lady who trod the turf beside him had come from a queer country across the sea which he knew a good deal about her antecedents her associations were very vague to his mind except in so far as they were generic and in this sense they showed as distinct and unimportant miss archer had neither a fortune nor the sort of beauty that justifies a man to the multitude and he calculated that he had spent about twentysix hours in her company he had summed up all thisthe perversity of the impulse which had declined to avail itself of the most liberal opportunities to subside and the judgement of mankind as exemplified particularly in the more quicklyjudging half of it he had looked these things well in the face and then had dismissed them from his thoughts he cared no more for them than for the rosebud in his buttonhole it is the good fortune of a man who for the greater part of a lifetime has abstained without effort from making himself disagreeable to his friends that when the need comes for such a course it is not discredited by irritating associations  i hope you had a pleasant ride said isabel who observed her companions hesitancy  it would have been pleasant if for nothing else than that it brought me here  are you so fond of gardencourt the girl asked more and more sure that he meant to make some appeal to her wishing not to challenge him if he hesitated and yet to keep all the quietness of her reason if he proceeded it suddenly came upon her that her situation was one which a few weeks ago she would have deemed deeply romantic the park of an old english countryhouse with the foreground embellished by a great as she supposed nobleman in the act of making love to a young lady who on careful inspection should be found to present remarkable analogies with herself but if she was now the heroine of the situation she succeeded scarcely the less in looking at it from the outside  i care nothing for gardencourt said her companion i care only for you  youve known me too short a time to have a right to say that and i cant believe youre serious  these words of isabels were not perfectly sincere for she had no doubt whatever that he himself was they were simply a tribute to the fact of which she was perfectly aware that those he had just uttered would have excited surprise on the part of a vulgar world and moreover if anything beside the sense she had already acquired that lord warburton was not a loose thinker had been needed to convince her the tone in which he replied would quite have served the purpose  ones right in such a matter is not measured by the time miss archer its measured by the feeling itself if i were to wait three months it would make no difference i shall not be more sure of what i mean than i am today of course ive seen you very little but my impression dates from the very first hour we met i lost no time i fell in love with you then it was at first sight as the novels say i know now thats not a fancyphrase and i shall think better of novels for evermore those two days i spent here settled it i dont know whether you suspected i was doing so but i paidmentally speaking i meanthe greatest possible attention to you nothing you said nothing you did was lost upon me when you came to lockleigh the other dayor rather when you went awayi was perfectly sure nevertheless i made up my mind to think it over and to question myself narrowly ive done so all these days ive done nothing else i dont make mistakes about such things im a very judicious animal i dont go off easily but when im touched its for life its for life miss archer its for life lord warburton repeated in the kindest tenderest pleasantest voice isabel had ever heard and looking at her with eyes charged with the light of a passion that had sifted itself clear of the baser parts of emotionthe heat the violence the unreasonand that burned as steadily as a lamp in a windless place  by tacit consent as he talked they had walked more and more slowly and at last they stopped and he took her hand ah lord warburton how little you know me isabel said very gently gently too she drew her hand away  dont taunt me with that that i dont know you better makes me unhappy enough already its all my loss but thats what i want and it seems to me im taking the best way if youll be my wife then i shall know you and when i tell you all the good i think of you youll not be able to say its from ignorance  if you know me little i know you even less said isabel  you mean that unlike yourself i may not improve on acquaintance ah of course thats very possible but think to speak to you as i do how determined i must be to try and give satisfaction you do like me rather dont you  i like you very much lord warburton she answered and at this moment she liked him immensely  i thank you for saying that it shows you dont regard me as a stranger i really believe ive filled all the other relations of life very creditably and i dont see why i shouldnt fill this onein which i offer myself to youseeing that i care so much more about it ask the people who know me well ive friends wholl speak for me  i dont need the recommendation of your friends said isabel  ah now thats delightful of you you believe in me yourself  completely isabel declared she quite glowed there inwardly with the pleasure of feeling she did  the light in her companions eyes turned into a smile and he gave a long exhalation of joy if youre mistaken miss archer let me lose all i possess  she wondered whether he meant this for a reminder that he was rich and on the instant felt sure that he didnt he was thinking that as he would have said himself and indeed he might safely leave it to the memory of any interlocutor especially of one to whom he was offering his hand isabel had prayed that she might not be agitated and her mind was tranquil enough even while she listened and asked herself what it was best she should say to indulge in this incidental criticism what she should say had she asked herself her foremost wish was to say something if possible not less kind than what he had said to her his words had carried perfect conviction with them she felt she did all so mysteriously matter to him i thank you more than i can say for your offer she returned at last it does me great honour  ah dont say that he broke out i was afraid youd say something like that i dont see what youve to do with that sort of thing i dont see why you should thank meits i who ought to thank you for listening to me a man you know so little coming down on you with such a thumper of course its a great question i must tell you that id rather ask it than have it to answer myself but the way youve listenedor at least your having listened at allgives me some hope  dont hope too much isabel said  oh miss archer her companion murmured smiling again in his seriousness as if such a warning might perhaps be taken but as the play of high spirits the exuberance of elation  should you be greatly surprised if i were to beg you not to hope at all isabel asked  surprised i dont know what you mean by surprise it wouldnt be that it would be a feeling very much worse  isabel walked on again she was silent for some minutes im very sure that highly as i already think of you my opinion of you if i should know you well would only rise but im by no means sure that you wouldnt be disappointed and i say that not in the least out of conventional modesty its perfectly sincere  im willing to risk it miss archer her companion replied  its a great question as you say its a very difficult question  i dont expect you of course to answer it outright think it over as long as may be necessary if i can gain by waiting ill gladly wait a long time only remember that in the end my dearest happiness depends on your answer  i should be very sorry to keep you in suspense said isabel  oh dont mind id much rather have a good answer six months hence than a bad one today  but its very probable that even six months hence i shouldnt be able to give you one that youd think good  why not since you really like me  ah you must never doubt that said isabel  well then i dont see what more you ask  its not what i ask its what i can give i dont think i should suit you i really dont think i should  you neednt worry about that thats my affair you neednt be a better royalist than the king  its not only that said isabel but im not sure i wish to marry any one  very likely you dont ive no doubt a great many women begin that way said his lordship who be it averred did not in the least believe in the axiom he thus beguiled his anxiety by uttering but theyre frequently persuaded  ah thats because they want to be and isabel lightly laughed her suitors countenance fell and he looked at her for a while in silence im afraid its my being an englishman that makes you hesitate he said presently i know your uncle thinks you ought to marry in your own country  isabel listened to this assertion with some interest it had never occurred to her that mr touchett was likely to discuss her matrimonial prospects with lord warburton has he told you that  i remember his making the remark he spoke perhaps of americans generally  he appears himself to have found it very pleasant to live in england isabel spoke in a manner that might have seemed a little perverse but which expressed both her constant perception of her uncles outward felicity and her general disposition to elude any obligation to take a restricted view  it gave her companion hope and he immediately cried with warmth ah my dear miss archer old englands a very good sort of country you know and it will be still better when weve furbished it up a little  oh dont furbish it lord warburton leave it alone i like it this way  well then if you like it im more and more unable to see your objection to what i propose  im afraid i cant make you understand  you ought at least to try ive a fair intelligence are you afraidafraid of the climate we can easily live elsewhere you know you can pick out your climate the whole world over  these words were uttered with a breadth of candour that was like the embrace of strong armsthat was like the fragrance straight in her face and by his clean breathing lips of she knew not what strange gardens what charged airs she would have given her little finger at that moment to feel strongly and simply the impulse to answer lord warburton its impossible for me to do better in this wonderful world i think than commit myself very gratefully to your loyalty but though she was lost in admiration of her opportunity she managed to move back into the deepest shade of it even as some wild caught creature in a vast cage the splendid security so offered her was not the greatest she could conceive what she finally bethought herself of saying was something very differentsomething that deferred the need of really facing her crisis dont think me unkind if i ask you to say no more about this today  certainly certainly her companion cried i wouldnt bore you for the world  youve given me a great deal to think about and i promise you to do it justice  thats all i ask of you of courseand that youll remember how absolutely my happiness is in your hands  isabel listened with extreme respect to this admonition but she said after a minute i must tell you that what i shall think about is some way of letting you know that what you ask is impossibleletting you know it without making you miserable  theres no way to do that miss archer i wont say that if you refuse me youll kill me i shall not die of it but i shall do worse i shall live to no purpose  youll live to marry a better woman than i  dont say that please said lord warburton very gravely thats fair to neither of us  to marry a worse one then  if there are better women than you i prefer the bad ones thats all i can say he went on with the same earnestness theres no accounting for tastes  his gravity made her feel equally grave and she showed it by again requesting him to drop the subject for the present ill speak to you myselfvery soon perhaps i shall write to you  at your convenience yes he replied whatever time you take it must seem to me long and i suppose i must make the best of that  i shall not keep you in suspense i only want to collect my mind a little  he gave a melancholy sigh and stood looking at her a moment with his hands behind him giving short nervous shakes to his huntingcrop do you know im very much afraid of itof that remarkable mind of yours  our heroines biographer can scarcely tell why but the question made her start and brought a conscious blush to her cheek she returned his look a moment and then with a note in her voice that might almost have appealed to his compassion so am i my lord she oddly exclaimed  his compassion was not stirred however all he possessed of the faculty of pity was needed at home ah be merciful be merciful he murmured  i think you had better go said isabel ill write to you  very good but whatever you write ill come and see you you know and then he stood reflecting his eyes fixed on the observant countenance of bunchie who had the air of having understood all that had been said and of pretending to carry off the indiscretion by a simulated fit of curiosity as to the roots of an ancient oak theres one thing more he went on you know if you dont like lockleighif you think its damp or anything of that sortyou need never go within fifty miles of it its not damp by the way ive had the house thoroughly examined its perfectly safe and right but if you shouldnt fancy it you neednt dream of living in it theres no difficulty whatever about that there are plenty of houses i thought id just mention it some people dont like a moat you know goodbye  i adore a moat said isabel goodbye  he held out his hand and she gave him hers a momenta moment long enough for him to bend his handsome bared head and kiss it then still agitating in his mastered emotion his implement of the chase he walked rapidly away he was evidently much upset  isabel herself was upset but she had not been affected as she would have imagined what she felt was not a great responsibility a great difficulty of choice it appeared to her there had been no choice in the question she couldnt marry lord warburton the idea failed to support any enlightened prejudice in favour of the free exploration of life that she had hitherto entertained or was now capable of entertaining she must write this to him she must convince him and that duty was comparatively simple but what disturbed her in the sense that it struck her with wonderment was this very fact that it cost her so little to refuse a magnificent chance with whatever qualifications one would lord warburton had offered her a great opportunity the situation might have discomforts might contain oppressive might contain narrowing elements might prove really but a stupefying anodyne but she did her sex no injustice in believing that nineteen women out of twenty would have accommodated themselves to it without a pang why then upon her also should it not irresistibly impose itself who was she what was she that she should hold herself superior what view of life what design upon fate what conception of happiness had she that pretended to be larger than these large these fabulous occasions if she wouldnt do such a thing as that then she must do great things she must do something greater poor isabel found ground to remind herself from time to time that she must not be too proud and nothing could be more sincere than her prayer to be delivered from such a danger the isolation and loneliness of pride had for her mind the horror of a desert place if it had been pride that interfered with her accepting lord warburton such a betise was singularly misplaced and she was so conscious of liking him that she ventured to assure herself it was the very softness and the fine intelligence of sympathy she liked him too much to marry him that was the truth something assured her there was a fallacy somewhere in the glowing logic of the propositionas he saw iteven though she mightnt put her very finest fingerpoint on it and to inflict upon a man who offered so much a wife with a tendency to criticise would be a peculiarly discreditable act she had promised him she would consider his question and when after he had left her she wandered back to the bench where he had found her and lost herself in meditation it might have seemed that she was keeping her vow but this was not the case she was wondering if she were not a cold hard priggish person and on her at last getting up and going rather quickly back to the house felt as she had said to her friend really frightened at herself    chapter xiii  it was this feeling and not the wish to ask adviceshe had no desire whatever for thatthat led her to speak to her uncle of what had taken place she wished to speak to some one she should feel more natural more human and her uncle for this purpose presented himself in a more attractive light than either her aunt or her friend henrietta her cousin of course was a possible confidant but she would have had to do herself violence to air this special secret to ralph so the next day after breakfast she sought her occasion her uncle never left his apartment till the afternoon but he received his cronies as he said in his dressingroom isabel had quite taken her place in the class so designated which for the rest included the old mans son his physician his personal servant and even miss stackpole mrs touchett did not figure in the list and this was an obstacle the less to isabels finding her host alone he sat in a complicated mechanical chair at the open window of his room looking westward over the park and the river with his newspapers and letters piled up beside him his toilet freshly and minutely made and his smooth speculative face composed to benevolent expectation  she approached her point directly i think i ought to let you know that lord warburton has asked me to marry him i suppose i ought to tell my aunt but it seems best to tell you first  the old man expressed no surprise but thanked her for the confidence she showed him do you mind telling me whether you accepted him he then enquired  ive not answered him definitely yet ive taken a little time to think of it because that seems more respectful but i shall not accept him  mr touchett made no comment upon this he had the air of thinking that whatever interest he might take in the matter from the point of view of sociability he had no active voice in it well i told you youd be a success over here americans are highly appreciated  very highly indeed said isabel but at the cost of seeming both tasteless and ungrateful i dont think i can marry lord warburton  well her uncle went on of course an old man cant judge for a young lady im glad you didnt ask me before you made up your mind i suppose i ought to tell you he added slowly but as if it were not of much consequence that ive known all about it these three days  about lord warburtons state of mind  about his intentions as they say here he wrote me a very pleasant letter telling me all about them should you like to see his letter the old man obligingly asked  thank you i dont think i care about that but im glad he wrote to you it was right that he should and he would be certain to do what was right  ah well i guess you do like him mr touchett declared you neednt pretend you dont  i like him extremely im very free to admit that but i dont wish to marry any one just now  you think some one may come along whom you may like better well thats very likely said mr touchett who appeared to wish to show his kindness to the girl by easing off her decision as it were and finding cheerful reasons for it  i dont care if i dont meet any one else i like lord warburton quite well enough she fell into that appearance of a sudden change of point of view with which she sometimes startled and even displeased her interlocutors  her uncle however seemed proof against either of these impressions hes a very fine man he resumed in a tone which might have passed for that of encouragement his letter was one of the pleasantest ive received for some weeks i suppose one of the reasons i liked it was that it was all about you that is all except the part that was about himself i suppose he told you all that  he would have told me everything i wished to ask him isabel said  but you didnt feel curious  my curiosity would have been idleonce i had determined to decline his offer  you didnt find it sufficiently attractive mr touchett enquired  she was silent a little i suppose it was that she presently admitted but i dont know why  fortunately ladies are not obliged to give reasons said her uncle theres a great deal thats attractive about such an idea but i dont see why the english should want to entice us away from our native land i know that we try to attract them over there but thats because our population is insufficient here you know theyre rather crowded however i presume theres room for charming young ladies everywhere  there seems to have been room here for you said isabel whose eyes had been wandering over the large pleasurespaces of the park  mr touchett gave a shrewd conscious smile theres room everywhere my dear if youll pay for it i sometimes think ive paid too much for this perhaps you also might have to pay too much  perhaps i might the girl replied  that suggestion gave her something more definite to rest on than she had found in her own thoughts and the fact of this association of her uncles mild acuteness with her dilemma seemed to prove that she was concerned with the natural and reasonable emotions of life and not altogether a victim to intellectual eagerness and vague ambitionsambitions reaching beyond lord warburtons beautiful appeal reaching to something indefinable and possibly not commendable in so far as the indefinable had an influence upon isabels behaviour at this juncture it was not the conception even unformulated of a union with caspar goodwood for however she might have resisted conquest at her english suitors large quiet hands she was at least as far removed from the disposition to let the young man from boston take positive possession of her the sentiment in which she sought refuge after reading his letter was a critical view of his having come abroad for it was part of the influence he had upon her that he seemed to deprive her of the sense of freedom there was a disagreeably strong push a kind of hardness of presence in his way of rising before her she had been haunted at moments by the image by the danger of his disapproval and had wondereda consideration she had never paid in equal degree to any one elsewhether he would like what she did the difficulty was that more than any man she had ever known more than poor lord warburton she had begun now to give his lordship the benefit of this epithet caspar goodwood expressed for her an energyand she had already felt it as a power that was of his very nature it was in no degree a matter of his advantagesit was a matter of the spirit that sat in his clearburning eyes like some tireless watcher at a window she might like it or not but he insisted ever with his whole weight and force even in ones usual contact with him one had to reckon with that the idea of a diminished liberty was particularly disagreeable to her at present since she had just given a sort of personal accent to her independence by looking so straight at lord warburtons big bribe and yet turning away from it sometimes caspar goodwood had seemed to range himself on the side of her destiny to be the stubbornest fact she knew she said to herself at such moments that she might evade him for a time but that she must make terms with him at lastterms which would be certain to be favourable to himself her impulse had been to avail herself of the things that helped her to resist such an obligation and this impulse had been much concerned in her eager acceptance of her aunts invitation which had come to her at an hour when she expected from day to day to see mr goodwood and when she was glad to have an answer ready for something she was sure he would say to her when she had told him at albany on the evening of mrs touchetts visit that she couldnt then discuss difficult questions dazzled as she was by the great immediate opening of her aunts offer of europe he declared that this was no answer at all and it was now to obtain a better one that he was following her across the sea to say to herself that he was a kind of grim fate was well enough for a fanciful young woman who was able to take much for granted in him but the reader has a right to a nearer and a clearer view  he was the son of a proprietor of wellknown cottonmills in massachusettsa gentleman who had accumulated a considerable fortune in the exercise of this industry caspar at present managed the works and with a judgement and a temper which in spite of keen competition and languid years had kept their prosperity from dwindling he had received the better part of his education at harvard college where however he had gained renown rather as a gymnast and an oarsman than as a gleaner of more dispersed knowledge later on he had learned that the finer intelligence too could vault and pull and strainmight even breaking the record treat itself to rare exploits he had thus discovered in himself a sharp eye for the mystery of mechanics and had invented an improvement in the cottonspinning process which was now largely used and was known by his name you might have seen it in the newspapers in connection with this fruitful contrivance assurance of which he had given to isabel by showing her in the columns of the new york interviewer an exhaustive article on the goodwood patentan article not prepared by miss stackpole friendly as she had proved herself to his more sentimental interests there were intricate bristling things he rejoiced in he liked to organise to contend to administer he could make people work his will believe in him march before him and justify him this was the art as they said of managing menwhich rested in him further on a bold though brooding ambition it struck those who knew him well that he might do greater things than carry on a cottonfactory there was nothing cottony about caspar goodwood and his friends took for granted that he would somehow and somewhere write himself in bigger letters but it was as if something large and confused something dark and ugly would have to call upon him he was not after all in harmony with mere smug peace and greed and gain an order of things of which the vital breath was ubiquitous advertisement it pleased isabel to believe that he might have ridden on a plunging steed the whirlwind of a great wara war like the civil strife that had overdarkened her conscious childhood and his ripening youth  she liked at any rate this idea of his being by character and in fact a mover of menliked it much better than some other points in his nature and aspect she cared nothing for his cottonmillthe goodwood patent left her imagination absolutely cold she wished him no ounce less of his manhood but she sometimes thought he would be rather nicer if he looked for instance a little differently his jaw was too square and set and his figure too straight and stiff these things suggested a want of easy consonance with the deeper rhythms of life then she viewed with reserve a habit he had of dressing always in the same manner it was not apparently that he wore the same clothes continually for on the contrary his garments had a way of looking rather too new but they all seemed of the same piece the figure the stuff was so drearily usual she had reminded herself more than once that this was a frivolous objection to a person of his importance and then she had amended the rebuke by saying that it would be a frivolous objection only if she were in love with him she was not in love with him and therefore might criticise his small defects as well as his greatwhich latter consisted in the collective reproach of his being too serious or rather not of his being so since one could never be but certainly of his seeming so he showed his appetites and designs too simply and artlessly when one was alone with him he talked too much about the same subject and when other people were present he talked too little about anything and yet he was of supremely strong clean makewhich was so much she saw the different fitted parts of him as she had seen in museums and portraits the different fitted parts of armoured warriorsin plates of steel handsomely inlaid with gold it was very strange where ever was any tangible link between her impression and her act caspar goodwood had never corresponded to her idea of a delightful person and she supposed that this was why he left her so harshly critical when however lord warburton who not only did correspond with it but gave an extension to the term appealed to her approval she found herself still unsatisfied it was certainly strange  the sense of her incoherence was not a help to answering mr goodwoods letter and isabel determined to leave it a while unhonoured if he had determined to persecute her he must take the consequences foremost among which was his being left to perceive how little it charmed her that he should come down to gardencourt she was already liable to the incursions of one suitor at this place and though it might be pleasant to be appreciated in opposite quarters there was a kind of grossness in entertaining two such passionate pleaders at once even in a case where the entertainment should consist of dismissing them she made no reply to mr goodwood but at the end of three days she wrote to lord warburton and the letter belongs to our history  dear lord warburtona great deal of earnest thought has not led me to change my mind about the suggestion you were so kind as to make me the other day i am not i am really and truly not able to regard you in the light of a companion for life or to think of your homeyour various homesas the settled seat of my existence these things cannot be reasoned about and i very earnestly entreat you not to return to the subject we discussed so exhaustively we see our lives from our own point of view that is the privilege of the weakest and humblest of us and i shall never be able to see mine in the manner you proposed kindly let this suffice you and do me the justice to believe that i have given your proposal the deeply respectful consideration it deserves it is with this very great regard that i remain sincerely yours  isabel archer  while the author of this missive was making up her mind to dispatch it henrietta stackpole formed a resolve which was accompanied by no demur she invited ralph touchett to take a walk with her in the garden and when he had assented with that alacrity which seemed constantly to testify to his high expectations she informed him that she had a favour to ask of him it may be admitted that at this information the young man flinched for we know that miss stackpole had struck him as apt to push an advantage the alarm was unreasoned however for he was clear about the area of her indiscretion as little as advised of its vertical depth and he made a very civil profession of the desire to serve her he was afraid of her and presently told her so when you look at me in a certain way my knees knock together my faculties desert me im filled with trepidation and i ask only for strength to execute your commands youve an address that ive never encountered in any woman  well henrietta replied goodhumouredly if i had not known before that you were trying somehow to abash me i should know it now of course im easy gamei was brought up with such different customs and ideas im not used to your arbitrary standards and ive never been spoken to in america as you have spoken to me if a gentleman conversing with me over there were to speak to me like that i shouldnt know what to make of it we take everything more naturally over there and after all were a great deal more simple i admit that im very simple myself of course if you choose to laugh at me for it youre very welcome but i think on the whole i would rather be myself than you im quite content to be myself i dont want to change there are plenty of people that appreciate me just as i am its true theyre nice fresh freeborn americans henrietta had lately taken up the tone of helpless innocence and large concession i want you to assist me a little she went on i dont care in the least whether i amuse you while you do so or rather im perfectly willing your amusement should be your reward i want you to help me about isabel  has she injured you ralph asked  if she had i shouldnt mind and i should never tell you what im afraid of is that shell injure herself  i think thats very possible said ralph  his companion stopped in the gardenwalk fixing on him perhaps the very gaze that unnerved him that too would amuse you i suppose the way you do say things i never heard any one so indifferent  to isabel ah not that  well youre not in love with her i hope  how can that be when im in love with another  youre in love with yourself thats the other miss stackpole declared much good may it do you but if you wish to be serious once in your life heres a chance and if you really care for your cousin heres an opportunity to prove it i dont expect you to understand her thats too much to ask but you neednt do that to grant my favour ill supply the necessary intelligence  i shall enjoy that immensely ralph exclaimed ill be caliban and you shall be ariel  youre not at all like caliban because youre sophisticated and caliban was not but im not talking about imaginary characters im talking about isabel isabels intensely real what i wish to tell you is that i find her fearfully changed  since you came do you mean  since i came and before i came shes not the same as she once so beautifully was  as she was in america  yes in america i suppose you know she comes from there she cant help it but she does  do you want to change her back again  of course i do and i want you to help me  ah said ralph im only caliban im not prospero  you were prospero enough to make her what she has become youve acted on isabel archer since she came here mr touchett  i my dear miss stackpole never in the world isabel archer has acted on meyes she acts on every one but ive been absolutely passive  youre too passive then you had better stir yourself and be careful isabels changing every day shes drifting awayright out to sea ive watched her and i can see it shes not the bright american girl she was shes taking different views a different colour and turning away from her old ideals i want to save those ideals mr touchett and thats where you come in  not surely as an ideal  well i hope not henrietta replied promptly ive got a fear in my heart that shes going to marry one of these fell europeans and i want to prevent it  ah i see cried ralph and to prevent it you want me to step in and marry her  not quite that remedy would be as bad as the disease for youre the typical the fell european from whom i wish to rescue her no i wish you to take an interest in another persona young man to whom she once gave great encouragement and whom she now doesnt seem to think good enough hes a thoroughly grand man and a very dear friend of mine and i wish very much you would invite him to pay a visit here  ralph was much puzzled by this appeal and it is perhaps not to the credit of his purity of mind that he failed to look at it at first in the simplest light it wore to his eyes a tortuous air and his fault was that he was not quite sure that anything in the world could really be as candid as this request of miss stackpoles appeared that a young woman should demand that a gentleman whom she described as her very dear friend should be furnished with an opportunity to make himself agreeable to another young woman a young woman whose attention had wandered and whose charms were greaterthis was an anomaly which for the moment challenged all his ingenuity of interpretation to read between the lines was easier than to follow the text and to suppose that miss stackpole wished the gentleman invited to gardencourt on her own account was the sign not so much of a vulgar as of an embarrassed mind even from this venial act of vulgarity however ralph was saved and saved by a force that i can only speak of as inspiration with no more outward light on the subject than he already possessed he suddenly acquired the conviction that it would be a sovereign injustice to the correspondent of the interviewer to assign a dishonourable motive to any act of hers this conviction passed into his mind with extreme rapidity it was perhaps kindled by the pure radiance of the young ladys imperturbable gaze he returned this challenge a moment consciously resisting an inclination to frown as one frowns in the presence of larger luminaries whos the gentleman you speak of  mr caspar goodwoodof boston he has been extremely attentive to isabeljust as devoted to her as he can live he has followed her out here and hes at present in london i dont know his address but i guess i can obtain it  ive never heard of him said ralph  well i suppose you havent heard of every one i dont believe he has ever heard of you but thats no reason why isabel shouldnt marry him  ralph gave a mild ambiguous laugh what a rage you have for marrying people do you remember how you wanted to marry me the other day  ive got over that you dont know how to take such ideas mr goodwood does however and thats what i like about him hes a splendid man and a perfect gentleman and isabel knows it  is she very fond of him  if she isnt she ought to be hes simply wrapped up in her  and you wish me to ask him here said ralph reflectively  it would be an act of true hospitality  caspar goodwood ralph continuedits rather a striking name  i dont care anything about his name it might be ezekiel jenkins and i should say the same hes the only man i have ever seen whom i think worthy of isabel  youre a very devoted friend said ralph  of course i am if you say that to pour scorn on me i dont care  i dont say it to pour scorn on you im very much struck with it  youre more satiric than ever but i advise you not to laugh at mr goodwood  i assure you im very serious you ought to understand that said ralph  in a moment his companion understood it i believe you are now youre too serious  youre difficult to please  oh youre very serious indeed you wont invite mr goodwood  i dont know said ralph im capable of strange things tell me a little about mr goodwood whats he like  hes just the opposite of you hes at the head of a cottonfactory a very fine one  has he pleasant manners asked ralph  splendid mannersin the american style  would he be an agreeable member of our little circle  i dont think hed care much about our little circle hed concentrate on isabel  and how would my cousin like that  very possibly not at all but it will be good for her it will call back her thoughts  call them backfrom where  from foreign parts and other unnatural places three months ago she gave mr goodwood every reason to suppose he was acceptable to her and its not worthy of isabel to go back on a real friend simply because she has changed the scene ive changed the scene too and the effect of it has been to make me care more for my old associations than ever its my belief that the sooner isabel changes it back again the better i know her well enough to know that she would never be truly happy over here and i wish her to form some strong american tie that will act as a preservative  arent you perhaps a little too much in a hurry ralph enquired dont you think you ought to give her more of a chance in poor old england  a chance to ruin her bright young life ones never too much in a hurry to save a precious human creature from drowning  as i understand it then said ralph you wish me to push mr goodwood overboard after her do you know he added that ive never heard her mention his name  henrietta gave a brilliant smile im delighted to hear that it proves how much she thinks of him  ralph appeared to allow that there was a good deal in this and he surrendered to thought while his companion watched him askance if i should invite mr goodwood he finally said it would be to quarrel with him  dont do that hed prove the better man  you certainly are doing your best to make me hate him i really dont think i can ask him i should be afraid of being rude to him  its just as you please henrietta returned i had no idea you were in love with her yourself  do you really believe that the young man asked with lifted eyebrows  thats the most natural speech ive ever heard you make of course i believe it miss stackpole ingeniously said  well ralph concluded to prove to you that youre wrong ill invite him it must be of course as a friend of yours  it will not be as a friend of mine that hell come and it will not be to prove to me that im wrong that youll ask himbut to prove it to yourself  these last words of miss stackpoles on which the two presently separated contained an amount of truth which ralph touchett was obliged to recognise but it so far took the edge from too sharp a recognition that in spite of his suspecting it would be rather more indiscreet to keep than to break his promise he wrote mr goodwood a note of six lines expressing the pleasure it would give mr touchett the elder that he should join a little party at gardencourt of which miss stackpole was a valued member having sent his letter to the care of a banker whom henrietta suggested he waited in some suspense he had heard this fresh formidable figure named for the first time for when his mother had mentioned on her arrival that there was a story about the girls having an admirer at home the idea had seemed deficient in reality and he had taken no pains to ask questions the answers to which would involve only the vague or the disagreeable now however the native admiration of which his cousin was the object had become more concrete it took the form of a young man who had followed her to london who was interested in a cottonmill and had manners in the most splendid of the american styles ralph had two theories about this intervenes either his passion was a sentimental fiction of miss stackpoles there was always a sort of tacit understanding among women born of the solidarity of the sex that they should discover or invent lovers for each other in which case he was not to be feared and would probably not accept the invitation or else he would accept the invitation and in this event prove himself a creature too irrational to demand further consideration the latter clause of ralphs argument might have seemed incoherent but it embodied his conviction that if mr goodwood were interested in isabel in the serious manner described by miss stackpole he would not care to present himself at gardencourt on a summons from the latter lady on this supposition said ralph he must regard her as a thorn on the stem of his rose as an intercessor he must find her wanting in tact  two days after he had sent his invitation he received a very short note from caspar goodwood thanking him for it regretting that other engagements made a visit to gardencourt impossible and presenting many compliments to miss stackpole ralph handed the note to henrietta who when she had read it exclaimed well i never have heard of anything so stiff  im afraid he doesnt care so much about my cousin as you suppose ralph observed  no its not that its some subtler motive his natures very deep but im determined to fathom it and i shall write to him to know what he means  his refusal of ralphs overtures was vaguely disconcerting from the moment he declined to come to gardencourt our friend began to think him of importance he asked himself what it signified to him whether isabels admirers should be desperadoes or laggards they were not rivals of his and were perfectly welcome to act out their genius nevertheless he felt much curiosity as to the result of miss stackpoles promised enquiry into the causes of mr goodwoods stiffnessa curiosity for the present ungratified inasmuch as when he asked her three days later if she had written to london she was obliged to confess she had written in vain mr goodwood had not replied  i suppose hes thinking it over she said he thinks everything over hes not really at all impetuous but im accustomed to having my letters answered the same day she presently proposed to isabel at all events that they should make an excursion to london together if i must tell the truth she observed im not seeing much at this place and i shouldnt think you were either ive not even seen that aristocratwhats his namelord washburton he seems to let you severely alone  lord warburtons coming tomorrow i happen to know replied her friend who had received a note from the master of lockleigh in answer to her own letter youll have every opportunity of turning him inside out  well he may do for one letter but whats one letter when you want to write fifty ive described all the scenery in this vicinity and raved about all the old women and donkeys you may say what you please scenery doesnt make a vital letter i must go back to london and get some impressions of real life i was there but three days before i came away and thats hardly time to get in touch  as isabel on her journey from new york to gardencourt had seen even less of the british capital than this it appeared a happy suggestion of henriettas that the two should go thither on a visit of pleasure the idea struck isabel as charming he was curious of the thick detail of london which had always loomed large and rich to her they turned over their schemes together and indulged in visions of romantic hours they would stay at some picturesque old innone of the inns described by dickensand drive over the town in those delightful hansoms henrietta was a literary woman and the great advantage of being a literary woman was that you could go everywhere and do everything they would dine at a coffeehouse and go afterwards to the play they would frequent the abbey and the british museum and find out where doctor johnson had lived and goldsmith and addison isabel grew eager and presently unveiled the bright vision to ralph who burst into a fit of laughter which scarce expressed the sympathy she had desired  its a delightful plan he said i advise you to go to the dukes head in covent garden an easy informal oldfashioned place and ill have you put down at my club  do you mean its improper isabel asked dear me isnt anything proper here with henrietta surely i may go anywhere she isnt hampered in that way she has travelled over the whole american continent and can at least find her way about this minute island  ah then said ralph let me take advantage of her protection to go up to town as well i may never have a chance to travel so safely    chapter xiv  miss stackpole would have prepared to start immediately but isabel as we have seen had been notified that lord warburton would come again to gardencourt and she believed it her duty to remain there and see him for four or five days he had made no response to her letter then he had written very briefly to say he would come to luncheon two days later there was something in these delays and postponements that touched the girl and renewed her sense of his desire to be considerate and patient not to appear to urge her too grossly a consideration the more studied that she was so sure he really liked her isabel told her uncle she had written to him mentioning also his intention of coming and the old man in consequence left his room earlier than usual and made his appearance at the two oclock repast this was by no means an act of vigilance on his part but the fruit of a benevolent belief that his being of the company might help to cover any conjoined straying away in case isabel should give their noble visitor another hearing that personage drove over from lockleigh and brought the elder of his sisters with him a measure presumably dictated by reflexions of the same order as mr touchetts the two visitors were introduced to miss stackpole who at luncheon occupied a seat adjoining lord warburtons isabel who was nervous and had no relish for the prospect of again arguing the question he had so prematurely opened could not help admiring his goodhumoured selfpossession which quite disguised the symptoms of that preoccupation with her presence it was natural she should suppose him to feel he neither looked at her nor spoke to her and the only sign of his emotion was that he avoided meeting her eyes he had plenty of talk for the others however and he appeared to eat his luncheon with discrimination and appetite miss molyneux who had a smooth nunlike forehead and wore a large silver cross suspended from her neck was evidently preoccupied with henrietta stackpole upon whom her eyes constantly rested in a manner suggesting a conflict between deep alienation and yearning wonder of the two ladies from lockleigh she was the one isabel had liked best there was such a world of hereditary quiet in her isabel was sure moreover that her mild forehead and silver cross referred to some weird anglican mysterysome delightful reinstitution perhaps of the quaint office of the canoness she wondered what miss molyneux would think of her if she knew miss archer had refused her brother and then she felt sure that miss molyneux would never knowthat lord warburton never told her such things he was fond of her and kind to her but on the whole he told her little such at least was isabels theory when at table she was not occupied in conversation she was usually occupied in forming theories about her neighbours according to isabel if miss molyneux should ever learn what had passed between miss archer and lord warburton she would probably be shocked at such a girls failure to rise or no rather this was our heroines last position she would impute to the young american but a due consciousness of inequality  whatever isabel might have made of her opportunities at all events henrietta stackpole was by no means disposed to neglect those in which she now found herself immersed do you know youre the first lord ive ever seen she said very promptly to her neighbour i suppose you think im awfully benighted  youve escaped seeing some very ugly men lord warburton answered looking a trifle absently about the table  are they very ugly they try to make us believe in america that theyre all handsome and magnificent and that they wear wonderful robes and crowns  ah the robes and crowns are gone out of fashion said lord warburton like your tomahawks and revolvers  im sorry for that i think an aristocracy ought to be splendid henrietta declared if its not that what is it  oh you know it isnt much at the best her neighbour allowed wont you have a potato  i dont care much for these european potatoes i shouldnt know you from an ordinary american gentleman  do talk to me as if i were one said lord warburton i dont see how you manage to get on without potatoes you must find so few things to eat over here  henrietta was silent a little there was a chance he was not sincere ive had hardly any appetite since ive been here she went on at last so it doesnt much matter i dont approve of you you know i feel as if i ought to tell you that  dont approve of me  yes i dont suppose any one ever said such a thing to you before did they i dont approve of lords as an institution i think the world has got beyond themfar beyond  oh so do i i dont approve of myself in the least sometimes it comes over mehow i should object to myself if i were not myself dont you know but thats rather good by the waynot to be vainglorious  why dont you give it up then miss stackpole enquired  give upa asked lord warburton meeting her harsh inflexion with a very mellow one  give up being a lord  oh im so little of one one would really forget all about it if you wretched americans were not constantly reminding one however i do think of giving it up the little there is left of it one of these days  i should like to see you do it henrietta exclaimed rather grimly  ill invite you to the ceremony well have a supper and a dance  well said miss stackpole i like to see all sides i dont approve of a privileged class but i like to hear what they have to say for themselves  mighty little as you see  i should like to draw you out a little more henrietta continued but youre always looking away youre afraid of meeting my eye i see you want to escape me  no im only looking for those despised potatoes  please explain about that young ladyyour sisterthen i dont understand about her is she a lady  shes a capital good girl  i dont like the way you say thatas if you wanted to change the subject is her position inferior to yours  we neither of us have any position to speak of but shes better off than i because she has none of the bother  yes she doesnt look as if she had much bother i wish i had as little bother as that you do produce quiet people over here whatever else you may do  ah you see one takes life easily on the whole said lord warburton and then you know were very dull ah we can be dull when we try  i should advise you to try something else i shouldnt know what to talk to your sister about she looks so different is that silver cross a badge  a badge  a sign of rank  lord warburtons glance had wandered a good deal but at this it met the gaze of his neighbour oh yes he answered in a moment the women go in for those things the silver cross is worn by the eldest daughters of viscounts which was his harmless revenge for having occasionally had his credulity too easily engaged in america after luncheon he proposed to isabel to come into the gallery and look at the pictures and though she knew he had seen the pictures twenty times she complied without criticising this pretext her conscience now was very easy ever since she sent him her letter she had felt particularly light of spirit he walked slowly to the end of the gallery staring at its contents and saying nothing and then he suddenly broke out i hoped you wouldnt write to me that way  it was the only way lord warburton said the girl do try and believe that  if i could believe it of course i should let you alone but we cant believe by willing it and i confess i dont understand i could understand your disliking me that i could understand well but that you should admit you do  what have i admitted isabel interrupted turning slightly pale  that you think me a good fellow isnt that it she said nothing and he went on you dont seem to have any reason and that gives me a sense of injustice  i have a reason lord warburton she said it in a tone that made his heart contract  i should like very much to know it  ill tell you some day when theres more to show for it  excuse my saying that in the mean time i must doubt of it  you make me very unhappy said isabel  im not sorry for that it may help you to know how i feel will you kindly answer me a question isabel made no audible assent but he apparently saw in her eyes something that gave him courage to go on do you prefer some one else  thats a question id rather not answer  ah you do then her suitor murmured with bitterness  the bitterness touched her and she cried out youre mistaken i dont  he sat down on a bench unceremoniously doggedly like a man in trouble leaning his elbows on his knees and staring at the floor i cant even be glad of that he said at last throwing himself back against the wall for that would be an excuse  she raised her eyebrows in surprise an excuse must i excuse myself  he paid however no answer to the question another idea had come into his head is it my political opinions do you think i go too far  i cant object to your political opinions because i dont understand them  you dont care what i think he cried getting up its all the same to you  isabel walked to the other side of the gallery and stood there showing him her charming back her light slim figure the length of her white neck as she bent her head and the density of her dark braids she stopped in front of a small picture as if for the purpose of examining it and there was something so young and free in her movement that her very pliancy seemed to mock at him her eyes however saw nothing they had suddenly been suffused with tears in a moment he followed her and by this time she had brushed her tears away but when she turned round her face was pale and the expression of her eyes strange that reason that i wouldnt tell youill tell it you after all its that i cant escape my fate  your fate  i should try to escape it if i were to marry you  i dont understand why should not that be your fate as well as anything else  because its not said isabel femininely i know its not its not my fate to give upi know it cant be  poor lord warburton stared an interrogative point in either eye do you call marrying me giving up  not in the usual sense its gettinggettinggetting a great deal but its giving up other chances  other chances for what  i dont mean chances to marry said isabel her colour quickly coming back to her and then she stopped looking down with a deep frown as if it were hopeless to attempt to make her meaning clear  i dont think it presumptuous in me to suggest that youll gain more than youll lose her companion observed  i cant escape unhappiness said isabel in marrying you i shall be trying to  i dont know whether youd try to but you certainly would that i must in candour admit he exclaimed with an anxious laugh  i mustnti cant cried the girl  well if youre bent on being miserable i dont see why you should make me so whatever charms a life of misery may have for you it has none for me  im not bent on a life of misery said isabel ive always been intensely determined to be happy and ive often believed i should be ive told people that you can ask them but it comes over me every now and then that i can never be happy in any extraordinary way not by turning away by separating myself  by separating yourself from what  from life from the usual chances and dangers from what most people know and suffer  lord warburton broke into a smile that almost denoted hope why my dear miss archer he began to explain with the most considerate eagerness i dont offer you any exoneration from life or from any chances or dangers whatever i wish i could depend upon it i would for what do you take me pray heaven help me im not the emperor of china all i offer you is the chance of taking the common lot in a comfortable sort of way the common lot why im devoted to the common lot strike an alliance with me and i promise you that you shall have plenty of it you shall separate from nothing whatevernot even from your friend miss stackpole  shed never approve of it said isabel trying to smile and take advantage of this sideissue despising herself too not a little for doing so  are we speaking of miss stackpole his lordship asked impatiently i never saw a person judge things on such theoretic grounds  now i suppose youre speaking of me said isabel with humility and she turned away again for she saw miss molyneux enter the gallery accompanied by henrietta and by ralph  lord warburtons sister addressed him with a certain timidity and reminded him she ought to return home in time for tea as she was expecting company to partake of it he made no answerapparently not having heard her he was preoccupied and with good reason miss molyneuxas if he had been royaltystood like a ladyinwaiting  well i never miss molyneux said henrietta stackpole if i wanted to go hed have to go if i wanted my brother to do a thing hed have to do it  oh warburton does everything one wants miss molyneux answered with a quick shy laugh how very many pictures you have she went on turning to ralph  they look a good many because theyre all put together said ralph but its really a bad way  oh i think its so nice i wish we had a gallery at lockleigh im so very fond of pictures miss molyneux went on persistently to ralph as if she were afraid miss stackpole would address her again henrietta appeared at once to fascinate and to frighten her  ah yes pictures are very convenient said ralph who appeared to know better what style of reflexion was acceptable to her  theyre so very pleasant when it rains the young lady continued it has rained of late so very often  im sorry youre going away lord warburton said henrietta i wanted to get a great deal more out of you  im not going away lord warburton answered  your sister says you must in america the gentlemen obey the ladies  im afraid we have some people to tea said miss molyneux looking at her brother  very good my dear well go  i hoped you would resist henrietta exclaimed i wanted to see what miss molyneux would do  i never do anything said this young lady  i suppose in your position its sufficient for you to exist miss stackpole returned i should like very much to see you at home  you must come to lockleigh again said miss molyneux very sweetly to isabel ignoring this remark of isabels friend isabel looked into her quiet eyes a moment and for that moment seemed to see in their grey depths the reflexion of everything she had rejected in rejecting lord warburtonthe peace the kindness the honour the possessions a deep security and a great exclusion she kissed miss molyneux and then she said im afraid i can never come again  never again  im afraid im going away  oh im so very sorry said miss molyneux i think thats so very wrong of you  lord warburton watched this little passage then he turned away and stared at a picture ralph leaning against the rail before the picture with his hands in his pockets had for the moment been watching him  i should like to see you at home said henrietta whom lord warburton found beside him i should like an hours talk with you there are a great many questions i wish to ask you  i shall be delighted to see you the proprietor of lockleigh answered but im certain not to be able to answer many of your questions when will you come  whenever miss archer will take me were thinking of going to london but well go and see you first im determined to get some satisfaction out of you  if it depends upon miss archer im afraid you wont get much she wont come to lockleigh she doesnt like the place  she told me it was lovely said henrietta  lord warburton hesitated she wont come all the same you had better come alone he added  henrietta straightened herself and her large eyes expanded would you make that remark to an english lady she enquired with soft asperity  lord warburton stared yes if i liked her enough  youd be careful not to like her enough if miss archer wont visit your place again its because she doesnt want to take me i know what she thinks of me and i suppose you think the samethat i oughtnt to bring in individuals lord warburton was at a loss he had not been made acquainted with miss stackpoles professional character and failed to catch her allusion miss archer has been warning you she therefore went on  warning me  isnt that why she came off alone with you hereto put you on your guard  oh dear no said lord warburton brazenly our talk had no such solemn character as that  well youve been on your guardintensely i suppose its natural to you thats just what i wanted to observe and so too miss molyneuxshe wouldnt commit herself you have been warned anyway henrietta continued addressing this young lady but for you it wasnt necessary  i hope not said miss molyneux vaguely  miss stackpole takes notes ralph soothingly explained shes a great satirist she sees through us all and she works us up  well i must say i never have had such a collection of bad material henrietta declared looking from isabel to lord warburton and from this nobleman to his sister and to ralph theres something the matter with you all youre as dismal as if you had got a bad cable  you do see through us miss stackpole said ralph in a low tone giving her a little intelligent nod as he led the party out of the gallery theres something the matter with us all  isabel came behind these two miss molyneux who decidedly liked her immensely had taken her arm to walk beside her over the polished floor lord warburton strolled on the other side with his hands behind him and his eyes lowered for some moments he said nothing and then is it true youre going to london he asked  i believe it has been arranged  and when shall you come back  in a few days but probably for a very short time im going to paris with my aunt  when then shall i see you again  not for a good while said isabel but some day or other i hope  do you really hope it  very much  he went a few steps in silence then he stopped and put out his hand goodbye  goodbye said isabel  miss molyneux kissed her again and she let the two depart after it without rejoining henrietta and ralph she retreated to her own room in which apartment before dinner she was found by mrs touchett who had stopped on her way to the salon i may as well tell you said that lady that your uncle has informed me of your relations with lord warburton  isabel considered relations theyre hardly relations thats the strange part of it he has seen me but three or four times  why did you tell your uncle rather than me mrs touchett dispassionately asked  again the girl hesitated because he knows lord warburton better  yes but i know you better  im not sure of that said isabel smiling  neither am i after all especially when you give me that rather conceited look one would think you were awfully pleased with yourself and had carried off a prize i suppose that when you refuse an offer like lord warburtons its because you expect to do something better  ah my uncle didnt say that cried isabel smiling still    chapter xv  it had been arranged that the two young ladies should proceed to london under ralphs escort though mrs touchett looked with little favour on the plan it was just the sort of plan she said that miss stackpole would be sure to suggest and she enquired if the correspondent of the interviewer was to take the party to stay at her favourite boardinghouse  i dont care where she takes us to stay so long as theres local colour said isabel thats what were going to london for  i suppose that after a girl has refused an english lord she may do anything her aunt rejoined after that one neednt stand on trifles  should you have liked me to marry lord warburton isabel enquired  of course i should  i thought you disliked the english so much  so i do but its all the greater reason for making use of them  is that your idea of marriage and isabel ventured to add that her aunt appeared to her to have made very little use of mr touchett  your uncles not an english nobleman said mrs touchett though even if he had been i should still probably have taken up my residence in florence  do you think lord warburton could make me any better than i am the girl asked with some animation i dont mean im too good to improve i mean that i dont love lord warburton enough to marry him  you did right to refuse him then said mrs touchett in her smallest sparest voice only the next great offer you get i hope youll manage to come up to your standard  we had better wait till the offer comes before we talk about it i hope very much i may have no more offers for the present they upset me completely  you probably wont be troubled with them if you adopt permanently the bohemian manner of life however ive promised ralph not to criticise  ill do whatever ralph says is right isabel returned ive unbounded confidence in ralph  his mothers much obliged to you this lady dryly laughed  it seems to me indeed she ought to feel it isabel irrepressibly answered  ralph had assured her that there would be no violation of decency in their paying a visitthe little party of threeto the sights of the metropolis but mrs touchett took a different view like many ladies of her country who had lived a long time in europe she had completely lost her native tact on such points and in her reaction not in itself deplorable against the liberty allowed to young persons beyond the seas had fallen into gratuitous and exaggerated scruples ralph accompanied their visitors to town and established them at a quiet inn in a street that ran at right angles to piccadilly his first idea had been to take them to his fathers house in winchester square a large dull mansion which at this period of the year was shrouded in silence and brown holland but he bethought himself that the cook being at gardencourt there was no one in the house to get them their meals and pratts hotel accordingly became their restingplace ralph on his side found quarters in winchester square having a den there of which he was very fond and being familiar with deeper fears than that of a cold kitchen he availed himself largely indeed of the resources of pratts hotel beginning his day with an early visit to his fellow travellers who had mr pratt in person in a large bulging white waistcoat to remove their dishcovers ralph turned up as he said after breakfast and the little party made out a scheme of entertainment for the day as london wears in the month of september a face blank but for its smears of prior service the young man who occasionally took an apologetic tone was obliged to remind his companion to miss stackpoles high derision that there wasnt a creature in town  i suppose you mean the aristocracy are absent henrietta answered but i dont think you could have a better proof that if they were absent altogether they wouldnt be missed it seems to me the place is about as full as it can be theres no one here of course but three or four millions of people what is it you call themthe lowermiddle class theyre only the population of london and thats of no consequence  ralph declared that for him the aristocracy left no void that miss stackpole herself didnt fill and that a more contented man was nowhere at that moment to be found in this he spoke the truth for the stale september days in the huge halfempty town had a charm wrapped in them as a coloured gem might be wrapped in a dusty cloth when he went home at night to the empty house in winchester square after a chain of hours with his comparatively ardent friends he wandered into the big dusky diningroom where the candle he took from the halltable after letting himself in constituted the only illumination the square was still the house was still when he raised one of the windows of the diningroom to let in the air he heard the slow creak of the boots of a lone constable his own step in the empty place seemed loud and sonorous some of the carpets had been raised and whenever he moved he roused a melancholy echo he sat down in one of the armchairs the big dark dining table twinkled here and there in the small candlelight the pictures on the wall all of them very brown looked vague and incoherent there was a ghostly presence as of dinners long since digested of tabletalk that had lost its actuality this hint of the supernatural perhaps had something to do with the fact that his imagination took a flight and that he remained in his chair a long time beyond the hour at which he should have been in bed doing nothing not even reading the evening paper i say he did nothing and i maintain the phrase in the face of the fact that he thought at these moments of isabel to think of isabel could only be for him an idle pursuit leading to nothing and profiting little to any one his cousin had not yet seemed to him so charming as during these days spent in sounding touristfashion the deeps and shallows of the metropolitan element isabel was full of premises conclusions emotions if she had come in search of local colour she found it everywhere she asked more questions than he could answer and launched brave theories as to historic cause and social effect that he was equally unable to accept or to refute the party went more than once to the british museum and to that brighter palace of art which reclaims for antique variety so large an area of a monotonous suburb they spent a morning in the abbey and went on a pennysteamer to the tower they looked at pictures both in public and private collections and sat on various occasions beneath the great trees in kensington gardens henrietta proved an indestructible sightseer and a more lenient judge than ralph had ventured to hope she had indeed many disappointments and london at large suffered from her vivid remembrance of the strong points of the american civic idea but she made the best of its dingy dignities and only heaved an occasional sigh and uttered a desultory well which led no further and lost itself in retrospect the truth was that as she said herself she was not in her element ive not a sympathy with inanimate objects she remarked to isabel at the national gallery and she continued to suffer from the meagreness of the glimpse that had as yet been vouchsafed to her of the inner life landscapes by turner and assyrian bulls were a poor substitute for the literary dinnerparties at which she had hoped to meet the genius and renown of great britain  where are your public men where are your men and women of intellect she enquired of ralph standing in the middle of trafalgar square as if she had supposed this to be a place where she would naturally meet a few thats one of them on the top of the column you saylord nelson was he a lord too wasnt he high enough that they had to stick him a hundred feet in the air thats the pasti dont care about the past i want to see some of the leading minds of the present i wont say of the future because i dont believe much in your future poor ralph had few leading minds among his acquaintance and rarely enjoyed the pleasure of buttonholing a celebrity a state of things which appeared to miss stackpole to indicate a deplorable want of enterprise if i were on the other side i should call she said and tell the gentleman whoever he might be that i had heard a great deal about him and had come to see for myself but i gather from what you say that this is not the custom here you seem to have plenty of meaningless customs but none of those that would help along we are in advance certainly i suppose i shall have to give up the social side altogether and henrietta though she went about with her guidebook and pencil and wrote a letter to the interviewer about the tower in which she described the execution of lady jane grey had a sad sense of falling below her mission  the incident that had preceded isabels departure from gardencourt left a painful trace in our young womans mind when she felt again in her face as from a recurrent wave the cold breath of her last suitors surprise she could only muffle her head till the air cleared she could not have done less than what she did this was certainly true but her necessity all the same had been as graceless as some physical act in a strained attitude and she felt no desire to take credit for her conduct mixed with this imperfect pride nevertheless was a feeling of freedom which in itself was sweet and which as she wandered through the great city with her illmatched companions occasionally throbbed into odd demonstrations when she walked in kensington gardens she stopped the children mainly of the poorer sort whom she saw playing on the grass she asked them their names and gave them sixpence and when they were pretty kissed them ralph noticed these quaint charities he noticed everything she did one afternoon that his companions might pass the time he invited them to tea in winchester square and he had the house set in order as much as possible for their visit there was another guest to meet them an amiable bachelor an old friend of ralphs who happened to be in town and for whom prompt commerce with miss stackpole appeared to have neither difficulty nor dread mr bantling a stout sleek smiling man of forty wonderfully dressed universally informed and incoherently amused laughed immoderately at everything henrietta said gave her several cups of tea examined in her society the bricabrac of which ralph had a considerable collection and afterwards when the host proposed they should go out into the square and pretend it was a fetechampetre walked round the limited enclosure several times with her and at a dozen turns of their talk bounded responsiveas with a positive passion for argumentto her remarks upon the inner life  oh i see i dare say you found it very quiet at gardencourt naturally theres not much going on there when theres such a lot of illness about touchetts very bad you know the doctors have forbidden his being in england at all and he has only come back to take care of his father the old man i believe has half a dozen things the matter with him they call it gout but to my certain knowledge he has organic disease so developed that you may depend upon it hell go some day soon quite quickly of course that sort of thing makes a dreadfully dull house i wonder they have people when they can do so little for them then i believe mr touchetts always squabbling with his wife she lives away from her husband you know in that extraordinary american way of yours if you want a house where theres always something going on i recommend you to go down and stay with my sister lady pensil in bedfordshire ill write to her tomorrow and im sure shell be delighted to ask you i know just what you wantyou want a house where they go in for theatricals and picnics and that sort of thing my sisters just that sort of woman shes always getting up something or other and shes always glad to have the sort of people who help her im sure shell ask you down by return of post shes tremendously fond of distinguished people and writers she writes herself you know but i havent read everything she has written its usually poetry and i dont go in much for poetryunless its byron i suppose you think a great deal of byron in america mr bantling continued expanding in the stimulating air of miss stackpoles attention bringing up his sequences promptly and changing his topic with an easy turn of hand yet he none the less gracefully kept in sight of the idea dazzling to henrietta of her going to stay with lady pensil in bedfordshire i understand what you want you want to see some genuine english sport the touchetts arent english at all you know they have their own habits their own language their own foodsome odd religion even i believe of their own the old man thinks its wicked to hunt im told you must get down to my sisters in time for the theatricals and im sure shell be glad to give you a part im sure you act well i know youre very clever my sisters forty years old and has seven children but shes going to play the principal part plain as she is she makes up awfully welli will say for her of course you neednt act if you dont want to  in this manner mr bantling delivered himself while they strolled over the grass in winchester square which although it had been peppered by the london soot invited the tread to linger henrietta thought her blooming easyvoiced bachelor with his impressibility to feminine merit and his splendid range of suggestion a very agreeable man and she valued the opportunity he offered her i dont know but i would go if your sister should ask me i think it would be my duty what do you call her name  pensil its an odd name but it isnt a bad one  i think one names as good as another but whats her rank  oh shes a barons wife a convenient sort of rank youre fine enough and youre not too fine  i dont know but what shed be too fine for me what do you call the place she lives inbedfordshire  she lives away in the northern corner of it its a tiresome country but i dare say you wont mind it ill try and run down while youre there  all this was very pleasant to miss stackpole and she was sorry to be obliged to separate from lady pensils obliging brother but it happened that she had met the day before in piccadilly some friends whom she had not seen for a year the miss climbers two ladies from wilmington delaware who had been travelling on the continent and were now preparing to reembark henrietta had had a long interview with them on the piccadilly pavement and though the three ladies all talked at once they had not exhausted their store it had been agreed therefore that henrietta should come and dine with them in their lodgings in jermyn street at six oclock on the morrow and she now bethought herself of this engagement she prepared to start for jermyn street taking leave first of ralph touchett and isabel who seated on garden chairs in another part of the enclosure were occupiedif the term may be usedwith an exchange of amenities less pointed than the practical colloquy of miss stackpole and mr bantling when it had been settled between isabel and her friend that they should be reunited at some reputable hour at pratts hotel ralph remarked that the latter must have a cab she couldnt walk all the way to jermyn street  i suppose you mean its improper for me to walk alone henrietta exclaimed merciful powers have i come to this  theres not the slightest need of your walking alone mr bantling gaily interposed i should be greatly pleased to go with you  i simply meant that youd be late for dinner ralph returned those poor ladies may easily believe that we refuse at the last to spare you  you had better have a hansom henrietta said isabel  ill get you a hansom if youll trust me mr bantling went on  we might walk a little till we meet one  i dont see why i shouldnt trust him do you henrietta enquired of isabel  i dont see what mr bantling could do to you isabel obligingly answered but if you like well walk with you till you find your cab  never mind well go alone come on mr bantling and take care you get me a good one  mr bantling promised to do his best and the two took their departure leaving the girl and her cousin together in the square over which a clear september twilight had now begun to gather it was perfectly still the wide quadrangle of dusky houses showed lights in none of the windows where the shutters and blinds were closed the pavements were a vacant expanse and putting aside two small children from a neighbouring slum who attracted by symptoms of abnormal animation in the interior poked their faces between the rusty rails of the enclosure the most vivid object within sight was the big red pillarpost on the southeast corner  henrietta will ask him to get into the cab and go with her to jermyn street ralph observed he always spoke of miss stackpole as henrietta  very possibly said his companion  or rather no she wont he went on but bantling will ask leave to get in  very likely again im glad very theyre such good friends  she has made a conquest he thinks her a brilliant woman it may go far said ralph  isabel was briefly silent i call henrietta a very brilliant woman but i dont think it will go far they would never really know each other he has not the least idea what she really is and she has no just comprehension of mr bantling  theres no more usual basis of union than a mutual misunderstanding but it ought not to be so difficult to understand bob bantling ralph added he is a very simple organism  yes but henriettas a simpler one still and pray what am i to do isabel asked looking about her through the fading light in which the limited landscapegardening of the square took on a large and effective appearance i dont imagine that youll propose that you and i for our amusement shall drive about london in a hansom  theres no reason we shouldnt stay hereif you dont dislike it its very warm there will be half an hour yet before dark and if you permit it ill light a cigarette  you may do what you please said isabel if youll amuse me till seven oclock i propose at that hour to go back and partake of a simple and solitary repasttwo poached eggs and a muffinat pratts hotel  maynt i dine with you ralph asked  no youll dine at your club  they had wandered back to their chairs in the centre of the square again and ralph had lighted his cigarette it would have given him extreme pleasure to be present in person at the modest little feast she had sketched but in default of this he liked even being forbidden for the moment however he liked immensely being alone with her in the thickening dusk in the centre of the multitudinous town it made her seem to depend upon him and to be in his power this power he could exert but vaguely the best exercise of it was to accept her decisions submissively which indeed there was already an emotion in doing why wont you let me dine with you he demanded after a pause  because i dont care for it  i suppose youre tired of me  i shall be an hour hence you see i have the gift of foreknowledge  oh i shall be delightful meanwhile said ralph  but he said nothing more and as she made no rejoinder they sat some time in a stillness which seemed to contradict his promise of entertainment it seemed to him she was preoccupied and he wondered what she was thinking about there were two or three very possible subjects at last he spoke again is your objection to my society this evening caused by your expectation of another visitor  she turned her head with a glance of her clear fair eyes another visitor what visitor should i have  he had none to suggest which made his question seem to himself silly as well as brutal youve a great many friends that i dont know youve a whole past from which i was perversely excluded  you were reserved for my future you must remember that my past is over there across the water theres none of it here in london  very good then since your future is seated beside you capital thing to have your future so handy and ralph lighted another cigarette and reflected that isabel probably meant she had received news that mr caspar goodwood had crossed to paris after he had lighted his cigarette he puffed it a while and then he resumed i promised just now to be very amusing but you see i dont come up to the mark and the fact is theres a good deal of temerity in ones undertaking to amuse a person like you what do you care for my feeble attempts youve grand ideasyouve a high standard in such matters i ought at least to bring in a band of music or a company of mountebanks  one mountebanks enough and you do very well pray go on and in another ten minutes i shall begin to laugh  i assure you im very serious said ralph you do really ask a great deal  i dont know what you mean i ask nothing  you accept nothing said ralph she coloured and now suddenly it seemed to her that she guessed his meaning but why should he speak to her of such things he hesitated a little and then he continued theres something i should like very much to say to you its a question i wish to ask it seems to me ive a right to ask it because ive a kind of interest in the answer  ask what you will isabel replied gently and ill try to satisfy you  well then i hope you wont mind my saying that warburton has told me of something that has passed between you  isabel suppressed a start she sat looking at her open fan very good i suppose it was natural he should tell you  i have his leave to let you know he has done so he has some hope still said ralph  still  he had it a few days ago  i dont believe he has any now said the girl  im very sorry for him then hes such an honest man  pray did he ask you to talk to me  no not that but he told me because he couldnt help it were old friends and he was greatly disappointed he sent me a line asking me to come and see him and i drove over to lockleigh the day before he and his sister lunched with us he was very heavyhearted he had just got a letter from you  did he show you the letter asked isabel with momentary loftiness  by no means but he told me it was a neat refusal i was very sorry for him ralph repeated  for some moments isabel said nothing then at last do you know how often he had seen me she enquired five or six times  thats to your glory  its not for that i say it  what then do you say it for not to prove that poor warburtons state of minds superficial because im pretty sure you dont think that  isabel certainly was unable to say she thought it but presently she said something else if youve not been requested by lord warburton to argue with me then youre doing it disinterestedlyor for the love of argument  ive no wish to argue with you at all i only wish to leave you alone im simply greatly interested in your own sentiments  im greatly obliged to you cried isabel with a slightly nervous laugh  of course you mean that im meddling in what doesnt concern me but why shouldnt i speak to you of this matter without annoying you or embarrassing myself whats the use of being your cousin if i cant have a few privileges whats the use of adoring you without hope of a reward if i cant have a few compensations whats the use of being ill and disabled and restricted to mere spectatorship at the game of life if i really cant see the show when ive paid so much for my ticket tell me this ralph went on while she listened to him with quickened attention what had you in mind when you refused lord warburton  what had i in mind  what was the logicthe view of your situationthat dictated so remarkable an act  i didnt wish to marry himif thats logic  no thats not logicand i knew that before its really nothing you know what was it you said to yourself you certainly said more than that  isabel reflected a moment then answered with a question of her own why do you call it a remarkable act thats what your mother thinks too  warburtons such a thorough good sort as a man i consider he has hardly a fault and then hes what they call here no end of a swell he has immense possessions and his wife would be thought a superior being he unites the intrinsic and the extrinsic advantages  isabel watched her cousin as to see how far he would go i refused him because he was too perfect then im not perfect myself and hes too good for me besides his perfection would irritate me  thats ingenious rather than candid said ralph as a fact you think nothing in the world too perfect for you  do you think im so good  no but youre exacting all the same without the excuse of thinking yourself good nineteen women out of twenty however even of the most exacting sort would have managed to do with warburton perhaps you dont know how he has been stalked  i dont wish to know but it seems to me said isabel that one day when we talked of him you mentioned odd things in him ralph smokingly considered i hope that what i said then had no weight with you for they were not faults the things i spoke of they were simply peculiarities of his position if i had known he wished to marry you id never have alluded to them i think i said that as regards that position he was rather a sceptic it would have been in your power to make him a believer  i think not i dont understand the matter and im not conscious of any mission of that sort youre evidently disappointed isabel added looking at her cousin with rueful gentleness youd have liked me to make such a marriage  not in the least im absolutely without a wish on the subject i dont pretend to advise you and i content myself with watching youwith the deepest interest  she gave rather a conscious sigh i wish i could be as interesting to myself as i am to you  there youre not candid again youre extremely interesting to yourself do you know however said ralph that if youve really given warburton his final answer im rather glad it has been what it was i dont mean im glad for you and still less of course for him im glad for myself  are you thinking of proposing to me  by no means from the point of view i speak of that would be fatal i should kill the goose that supplies me with the material of my inimitable omelettes i use that animal as the symbol of my insane illusions what i mean is that i shall have the thrill of seeing what a young lady does who wont marry lord warburton  thats what your mother counts upon too said isabel  ah there will be plenty of spectators we shall hang on the rest of your career i shall not see all of it but i shall probably see the most interesting years of course if you were to marry our friend youd still have a careera very decent in fact a very brilliant one but relatively speaking it would be a little prosaic it would be definitely marked out in advance it would be wanting in the unexpected you know im extremely fond of the unexpected and now that youve kept the game in your hands i depend on your giving us some grand example of it  i dont understand you very well said isabel but i do so well enough to be able to say that if you look for grand examples of anything from me i shall disappoint you  youll do so only by disappointing yourself and that will go hard with you  to this she made no direct reply there was an amount of truth in it that would bear consideration at last she said abruptly i dont see what harm there is in my wishing not to tie myself i dont want to begin life by marrying there are other things a woman can do  theres nothing she can do so well but youre of course so manysided  if ones twosided its enough said isabel  youre the most charming of polygons her companion broke out at a glance from his companion however he became grave and to prove it went on you want to see lifeyoull be hanged if you dont as the young men say  i dont think i want to see it as the young men want to see it but i do want to look about me  you want to drain the cup of experience  no i dont wish to touch the cup of experience its a poisoned drink i only want to see for myself  you want to see but not to feel ralph remarked  i dont think that if ones a sentient being one can make the distinction im a good deal like henrietta the other day when i asked her if she wished to marry she said not till ive seen europe i too dont wish to marry till ive seen europe  you evidently expect a crowned head will be struck with you  no that would be worse than marrying lord warburton but its getting very dark isabel continued and i must go home she rose from her place but ralph only sat still and looked at her as he remained there she stopped and they exchanged a gaze that was full on either side but especially on ralphs of utterances too vague for words  youve answered my question he said at last youve told me what i wanted im greatly obliged to you  it seems to me ive told you very little  youve told me the great thing that the world interests you and that you want to throw yourself into it  her silvery eyes shone a moment in the dusk i never said that i think you meant it dont repudiate it its so fine  i dont know what youre trying to fasten upon me for im not in the least an adventurous spirit women are not like men  ralph slowly rose from his seat and they walked together to the gate of the square no he said women rarely boast of their courage men do so with a certain frequency  men have it to boast of  women have it too youve a great deal  enough to go home in a cab to pratts hotel but not more  ralph unlocked the gate and after they had passed out he fastened it well find your cab he said and as they turned toward a neighbouring street in which this quest might avail he asked her again if he mightnt see her safely to the inn  by no means she answered youre very tired you must go home and go to bed  the cab was found and he helped her into it standing a moment at the door when people forget im a poor creature im often incommoded he said but its worse when they remember it    chapter xvi  she had had no hidden motive in wishing him not to take her home it simply struck her that for some days past she had consumed an inordinate quantity of his time and the independent spirit of the american girl whom extravagance of aid places in an attitude that she ends by finding affected had made her decide that for these few hours she must suffice to herself she had moreover a great fondness for intervals of solitude which since her arrival in england had been but meagrely met it was a luxury she could always command at home and she had wittingly missed it that evening however an incident occurred whichhad there been a critic to note itwould have taken all colour from the theory that the wish to be quite by herself had caused her to dispense with her cousins attendance seated toward nine oclock in the dim illumination of pratts hotel and trying with the aid of two tall candles to lose herself in a volume she had brought from gardencourt she succeeded only to the extent of reading other words than those printed on the pagewords that ralph had spoken to her that afternoon suddenly the wellmuffed knuckle of the waiter was applied to the door which presently gave way to his exhibition even as a glorious trophy of the card of a visitor when this memento had offered to her fixed sight the name of mr caspar goodwood she let the man stand before her without signifying her wishes  shall i show the gentleman up maam he asked with a slightly encouraging inflexion  isabel hesitated still and while she hesitated glanced at the mirror he may come in she said at last and waited for him not so much smoothing her hair as girding her spirit  caspar goodwood was accordingly the next moment shaking hands with her but saying nothing till the servant had left the room why didnt you answer my letter he then asked in a quick full slightly peremptory tonethe tone of a man whose questions were habitually pointed and who was capable of much insistence  she answered by a ready question how did you know i was here  miss stackpole let me know said caspar goodwood she told me you would probably be at home alone this evening and would be willing to see me  where did she see youto tell you that  she didnt see me she wrote to me  isabel was silent neither had sat down they stood there with an air of defiance or at least of contention henrietta never told me she was writing to you she said at last this is not kind of her  is it so disagreeable to you to see me asked the young man  i didnt expect it i dont like such surprises  but you knew i was in town it was natural we should meet  do you call this meeting i hoped i shouldnt see you in so big a place as london it seemed very possible  it was apparently repugnant to you even to write to me her visitor went on  isabel made no reply the sense of henrietta stackpoles treachery as she momentarily qualified it was strong within her henriettas certainly not a model of all the delicacies she exclaimed with bitterness it was a great liberty to take  i suppose im not a model eitherof those virtues or of any others the faults mine as much as hers  as isabel looked at him it seemed to her that his jaw had never been more square this might have displeased her but she took a different turn no its not your fault so much as hers what youve done was inevitable i suppose for you  it was indeed cried caspar goodwood with a voluntary laugh  and now that ive come at any rate maynt i stay  you may sit down certainly  she went back to her chair again while her visitor took the first place that offered in the manner of a man accustomed to pay little thought to that sort of furtherance ive been hoping every day for an answer to my letter you might have written me a few lines  it wasnt the trouble of writing that prevented me i could as easily have written you four pages as one but my silence was an intention isabel said i thought it the best thing  he sat with his eyes fixed on hers while she spoke then he lowered them and attached them to a spot in the carpet as if he were making a strong effort to say nothing but what he ought he was a strong man in the wrong and he was acute enough to see that an uncompromising exhibition of his strength would only throw the falsity of his position into relief isabel was not incapable of tasting any advantage of position over a person of this quality and though little desirous to flaunt it in his face she could enjoy being able to say you know you oughtnt to have written to me yourself and to say it with an air of triumph  caspar goodwood raised his eyes to her own again they seemed to shine through the vizard of a helmet he had a strong sense of justice and was ready any day in the yearover and above thisto argue the question of his rights you said you hoped never to hear from me again i know that but i never accepted any such rule as my own i warned you that you should hear very soon  i didnt say i hoped never to hear from you said isabel  not for five years then for ten years twenty years its the same thing  do you find it so it seems to me theres a great difference i can imagine that at the end of ten years we might have a very pleasant correspondence i shall have matured my epistolary style  she looked away while she spoke these words knowing them of so much less earnest a cast than the countenance of her listener her eyes however at last came back to him just as he said very irrelevantly are you enjoying your visit to your uncle  very much indeed she dropped but then she broke out what good do you expect to get by insisting  the good of not losing you  youve no right to talk of losing whats not yours and even from your own point of view isabel added you ought to know when to let one alone  i disgust you very much said caspar goodwood gloomily not as if to provoke her to compassion for a man conscious of this blighting fact but as if to set it well before himself so that he might endeavour to act with his eyes on it  yes you dont at all delight me you dont fit in not in any way just now and the worst is that your putting it to the proof in this manner is quite unnecessary it wasnt certainly as if his nature had been soft so that pinpricks would draw blood from it and from the first of her acquaintance with him and of her having to defend herself against a certain air that he had of knowing better what was good for her than she knew herself she had recognised the fact that perfect frankness was her best weapon to attempt to spare his sensibility or to escape from him edgewise as one might do from a man who had barred the way less sturdilythis in dealing with caspar goodwood who would grasp at everything of every sort that one might give him was wasted agility it was not that he had not susceptibilities but his passive surface as well as his active was large and hard and he might always be trusted to dress his wounds so far as they required it himself she came back even for her measure of possible pangs and aches in him to her old sense that he was naturally plated and steeled armed essentially for aggression  i cant reconcile myself to that he simply said there was a dangerous liberality about it for she felt how open it was to him to make the point that he had not always disgusted her  i cant reconcile myself to it either and its not the state of things that ought to exist between us if youd only try to banish me from your mind for a few months we should be on good terms again  i see if i should cease to think of you at all for a prescribed time i should find i could keep it up indefinitely  indefinitely is more than i ask its more even than i should like  you know that what you ask is impossible said the young man taking his adjective for granted in a manner she found irritating  arent you capable of making a calculated effort she demanded youre strong for everything else why shouldnt you be strong for that  an effort calculated for what and then as she hung fire im capable of nothing with regard to you he went on but just of being infernally in love with you if ones strong one loves only the more strongly  theres a good deal in that and indeed our young lady felt the force of itfelt it thrown off into the vast of truth and poetry as practically a bait to her imagination but she promptly came round think of me or not as you find most possible only leave me alone  until when  well for a year or two  which do you mean between one year and two theres all the difference in the world  call it two then said isabel with a studied effect of eagerness  and what shall i gain by that her friend asked with no sign of wincing  youll have obliged me greatly  and what will be my reward  do you need a reward for an act of generosity  yes when it involves a great sacrifice  theres no generosity without some sacrifice men dont understand such things if you make the sacrifice youll have all my admiration  i dont care a cent for your admirationnot one straw with nothing to show for it when will you marry me thats the only question  neverif you go on making me feel only as i feel at present  what do i gain then by not trying to make you feel otherwise  youll gain quite as much as by worrying me to death caspar goodwood bent his eyes again and gazed a while into the crown of his hat a deep flush overspread his face she could see her sharpness had at last penetrated this immediately had a valueclassic romantic redeeming what did she know for her the strong man in pain was one of the categories of the human appeal little charm as he might exert in the given case why do you make me say such things to you she cried in a trembling voice i only want to be gentleto be thoroughly kind its not delightful to me to feel people care for me and yet to have to try and reason them out of it i think others also ought to be considerate we have each to judge for ourselves i know youre considerate as much as you can be youve good reasons for what you do but i really dont want to marry or to talk about it at all now i shall probably never do itno never ive a perfect right to feel that way and its no kindness to a woman to press her so hard to urge her against her will if i give you pain i can only say im very sorry its not my fault i cant marry you simply to please you i wont say that i shall always remain your friend because when women say that in these situations it passes i believe for a sort of mockery but try me some day  caspar goodwood during this speech had kept his eyes fixed upon the name of his hatter and it was not until some time after she had ceased speaking that he raised them when he did so the sight of a rosy lovely eagerness in isabels face threw some confusion into his attempt to analyse her words ill go homeill go tomorrowill leave you alone he brought out at last only he heavily said i hate to lose sight of you  never fear i shall do no harm  youll marry some one else as sure as i sit here caspar goodwood declared  do you think that a generous charge  why not plenty of men will try to make you  i told you just now that i dont wish to marry and that i almost certainly never shall  i know you did and i like your almost certainly i put no faith in what you say  thank you very much do you accuse me of lying to shake you off you say very delicate things  why should i not say that youve given me no pledge of anything at all  no thats all that would be wanting  you may perhaps even believe youre safefrom wishing to be but youre not the young man went on as if preparing himself for the worst  very well then well put it that im not safe have it as you please  i dont know however said caspar goodwood that my keeping you in sight would prevent it  dont you indeed im after all very much afraid of you do you think im so very easily pleased she asked suddenly changing her tone  noi dont i shall try to console myself with that but there are a certain number of very dazzling men in the world no doubt and if there were only one it would be enough the most dazzling of all will make straight for you youll be sure to take no one who isnt dazzling  if you mean by dazzling brilliantly clever isabel saidand i cant imagine what else you meani dont need the aid of a clever man to teach me how to live i can find it out for myself  find out how to live alone i wish that when you have youd teach me  she looked at him a moment then with a quick smile oh you ought to marry she said  he might be pardoned if for an instant this exclamation seemed to him to sound the infernal note and it is not on record that her motive for discharging such a shaft had been of the clearest he oughtnt to stride about lean and hungry howevershe certainly felt that for him god forgive you he murmured between his teeth as he turned away  her accent had put her slightly in the wrong and after a moment she felt the need to right herself the easiest way to do it was to place him where she had been you do me great injusticeyou say what you dont know she broke out i shouldnt be an easy victimive proved it  oh to me perfectly  ive proved it to others as well and she paused a moment i refused a proposal of marriage last week what they callno doubta dazzling one  im very glad to hear it said the young man gravely  it was a proposal many girls would have accepted it had everything to recommend it isabel had not proposed to herself to tell this story but now she had begun the satisfaction of speaking it out and doing herself justice took possession of her i was offered a great position and a great fortuneby a person whom i like extremely  caspar watched her with intense interest is he an englishman  hes an english nobleman said isabel  her visitor received this announcement at first in silence but at last said im glad hes disappointed  well then as you have companions in misfortune make the best of it  i dont call him a companion said casper grimly  why notsince i declined his offer absolutely  that doesnt make him my companion besides hes an englishman  and pray isnt an englishman a human being isabel asked  oh those people theyre not of my humanity and i dont care what becomes of them  youre very angry said the girl weve discussed this matter quite enough  oh yes im very angry i plead guilty to that  she turned away from him walked to the open window and stood a moment looking into the dusky void of the street where a turbid gaslight alone represented social animation for some time neither of these young persons spoke caspar lingered near the chimneypiece with eyes gloomily attached she had virtually requested him to gohe knew that but at the risk of making himself odious he kept his ground she was far too dear to him to be easily renounced and he had crossed the sea all to wring from her some scrap of a vow presently she left the window and stood again before him you do me very little justiceafter my telling you what i told you just now im sorry i told yousince it matters so little to you  ah cried the young man if you were thinking of me when you did it and then he paused with the fear that she might contradict so happy a thought  i was thinking of you a little said isabel  a little i dont understand if the knowledge of what i feel for you had any weight with you at all calling it a little is a poor account of it  isabel shook her head as if to carry off a blunder ive refused a most kind noble gentleman make the most of that  i thank you then said caspar goodwood gravely i thank you immensely  and now you had better go home  may i not see you again he asked  i think its better not youll be sure to talk of this and you see it leads to nothing  i promise you not to say a word that will annoy you  isabel reflected and then answered i return in a day or two to my uncles and i cant propose to you to come there it would be too inconsistent  caspar goodwood on his side considered you must do me justice too i received an invitation to your uncles more than a week ago and i declined it  she betrayed surprise from whom was your invitation  from mr ralph touchett whom i suppose to be your cousin i declined it because i had not your authorisation to accept it the suggestion that mr touchett should invite me appeared to have come from miss stackpole  it certainly never did from me henrietta really goes very far isabel added  dont be too hard on herthat touches me  no if you declined you did quite right and i thank you for it and she gave a little shudder of dismay at the thought that lord warburton and mr goodwood might have met at gardencourt it would have been so awkward for lord warburton  when you leave your uncle where do you go her companion asked  i go abroad with my auntto florence and other places  the serenity of this announcement struck a chill to the young mans heart he seemed to see her whirled away into circles from which he was inexorably excluded nevertheless he went on quickly with his questions and when shall you come back to america  perhaps not for a long time im very happy here  do you mean to give up your country  dont be an infant  well youll be out of my sight indeed said caspar goodwood  i dont know she answered rather grandly the worldwith all these places so arranged and so touching each othercomes to strike one as rather small  its a sight too big for me caspar exclaimed with a simplicity our young lady might have found touching if her face had not been set against concessions  this attitude was part of a system a theory that she had lately embraced and to be thorough she said after a moment dont think me unkind if i say its just thatbeing out of your sightthat i like if you were in the same place i should feel you were watching me and i dont like thati like my liberty too much if theres a thing in the world im fond of she went on with a slight recurrence of grandeur its my personal independence  but whatever there might be of the too superior in this speech moved caspar goodwoods admiration there was nothing he winced at in the large air of it he had never supposed she hadnt wings and the need of beautiful free movementshe wasnt with his own long arms and strides afraid of any force in her isabels words if they had been meant to shock him failed of the mark and only made him smile with the sense that here was common ground who would wish less to curtail your liberty than i what can give me greater pleasure than to see you perfectly independentdoing whatever you like its to make you independent that i want to marry you  thats a beautiful sophism said the girl with a smile more beautiful still  an unmarried womana girl of your ageisnt independent there are all sorts of things she cant do shes hampered at every step  thats as she looks at the question isabel answered with much spirit im not in my first youthi can do what i choosei belong quite to the independent class ive neither father nor mother im poor and of a serious disposition im not pretty i therefore am not bound to be timid and conventional indeed i cant afford such luxuries besides i try to judge things for myself to judge wrong i think is more honourable than not to judge at all i dont wish to be a mere sheep in the flock i wish to choose my fate and know something of human affairs beyond what other people think it compatible with propriety to tell me she paused a moment but not long enough for her companion to reply he was apparently on the point of doing so when she went on let me say this to you mr goodwood youre so kind as to speak of being afraid of my marrying if you should hear a rumour that im on the point of doing sogirls are liable to have such things said about themremember what i have told you about my love of liberty and venture to doubt it  there was something passionately positive in the tone in which she gave him this advice and he saw a shining candour in her eyes that helped him to believe her on the whole he felt reassured and you might have perceived it by the manner in which he said quite eagerly you want simply to travel for two years im quite willing to wait two years and you may do what you like in the interval if thats all you want pray say so i dont want you to be conventional do i strike you as conventional myself do you want to improve your mind your minds quite good enough for me but if it interests you to wander about a while and see different countries i shall be delighted to help you in any way in my power  youre very generous thats nothing new to me the best way to help me will be to put as many hundred miles of sea between us as possible  one would think you were going to commit some atrocity said caspar goodwood  perhaps i am i wish to be free even to do that if the fancy takes me  well then he said slowly ill go home and he put out his hand trying to look contented and confident  isabels confidence in him however was greater than any he could feel in her not that he thought her capable of committing an atrocity but turn it over as he would there was something ominous in the way she reserved her option as she took his hand she felt a great respect for him she knew how much he cared for her and she thought him magnanimous they stood so for a moment looking at each other united by a handclasp which was not merely passive on her side thats right she said very kindly almost tenderly youll lose nothing by being a reasonable man  but ill come back wherever you are two years hence he returned with characteristic grimness  we have seen that our young lady was inconsequent and at this she suddenly changed her note ah remember i promise nothingabsolutely nothing then more softly as if to help him to leave her and remember too that i shall not be an easy victim  youll get very sick of your independence  perhaps i shall its even very probable when that day comes i shall be very glad to see you  she had laid her hand on the knob of the door that led into her room and she waited a moment to see whether her visitor would not take his departure but he appeared unable to move there was still an immense unwillingness in his attitude and a sore remonstrance in his eyes i must leave you now said isabel and she opened the door and passed into the other room  this apartment was dark but the darkness was tempered by a vague radiance sent up through the window from the court of the hotel and isabel could make out the masses of the furniture the dim shining of the mirror and the looming of the big fourposted bed she stood still a moment listening and at last she heard caspar goodwood walk out of the sittingroom and close the door behind him she stood still a little longer and then by an irresistible impulse dropped on her knees before her bed and hid her face in her arms    chapter xvii  she was not praying she was tremblingtrembling all over vibration was easy to her was in fact too constant with her and she found herself now humming like a smitten harp she only asked however to put on the cover to case herself again in brown holland but she wished to resist her excitement and the attitude of devotion which she kept for some time seemed to help her to be still she intensely rejoiced that caspar goodwood was gone there was something in having thus got rid of him that was like the payment for a stamped receipt of some debt too long on her mind as she felt the glad relief she bowed her head a little lower the sense was there throbbing in her heart it was part of her emotion but it was a thing to be ashamed ofit was profane and out of place it was not for some ten minutes that she rose from her knees and even when she came back to the sittingroom her tremor had not quite subsided it had had verily two causes part of it was to be accounted for by her long discussion with mr goodwood but it might be feared that the rest was simply the enjoyment she found in the exercise of her power she sat down in the same chair again and took up her book but without going through the form of opening the volume she leaned back with that low soft aspiring murmur with which she often uttered her response to accidents of which the brighter side was not superficially obvious and yielded to the satisfaction of having refused two ardent suitors in a fortnight that love of liberty of which she had given caspar goodwood so bold a sketch was as yet almost exclusively theoretic she had not been able to indulge it on a large scale but it appeared to her she had done something she had tasted of the delight if not of battle at least of victory she had done what was truest to her plan in the glow of this consciousness the image of mr goodwood taking his sad walk homeward through the dingy town presented itself with a certain reproachful force so that as at the same moment the door of the room was opened she rose with an apprehension that he had come back but it was only henrietta stackpole returning from her dinner  miss stackpole immediately saw that our young lady had been through something and indeed the discovery demanded no great penetration she went straight up to her friend who received her without a greeting isabels elation in having sent caspar goodwood back to america presupposed her being in a manner glad he had come to see her but at the same time she perfectly remembered henrietta had had no right to set a trap for her has he been here dear the latter yearningly asked  isabel turned away and for some moments answered nothing you acted very wrongly she declared at last  i acted for the best i only hope you acted as well  youre not the judge i cant trust you said isabel  this declaration was unflattering but henrietta was much too unselfish to heed the charge it conveyed she cared only for what it intimated with regard to her friend isabel archer she observed with equal abruptness and solemnity if you marry one of these people ill never speak to you again  before making so terrible a threat you had better wait till im asked isabel replied never having said a word to miss stackpole about lord warburtons overtures she had now no impulse whatever to justify herself to henrietta by telling her that she had refused that nobleman  oh youll be asked quick enough once you get off on the continent annie climber was asked three times in italypoor plain little annie  well if annie climber wasnt captured why should i be  i dont believe annie was pressed but youll be  thats a flattering conviction said isabel without alarm  i dont flatter you isabel i tell you the truth cried her friend i hope you dont mean to tell me that you didnt give mr goodwood some hope  i dont see why i should tell you anything as i said to you just now i cant trust you but since youre so much interested in mr goodwood i wont conceal from you that he returns immediately to america  you dont mean to say youve sent him off henrietta almost shrieked  i asked him to leave me alone and i ask you the same henrietta miss stackpole glittered for an instant with dismay and then passed to the mirror over the chimneypiece and took off her bonnet i hope youve enjoyed your dinner isabel went on  but her companion was not to be diverted by frivolous propositions do you know where youre going isabel archer  just now im going to bed said isabel with persistent frivolity  do you know where youre drifting henrietta pursued holding out her bonnet delicately  no i havent the least idea and i find it very pleasant not to know a swift carriage of a dark night rattling with four horses over roads that one cant seethats my idea of happiness  mr goodwood certainly didnt teach you to say such things as thatlike the heroine of an immoral novel said miss stackpole youre drifting to some great mistake  isabel was irritated by her friends interference yet she still tried to think what truth this declaration could represent she could think of nothing that diverted her from saying you must be very fond of me henrietta to be willing to be so aggressive  i love you intensely isabel said miss stackpole with feeling  well if you love me intensely let me as intensely alone i asked that of mr goodwood and i must also ask it of you  take care youre not let alone too much  thats what mr goodwood said to me i told him i must take the risks  youre a creature of risksyou make me shudder cried henrietta when does mr goodwood return to america  i dont knowhe didnt tell me  perhaps you didnt enquire said henrietta with the note of righteous irony  i gave him too little satisfaction to have the right to ask questions of him  this assertion seemed to miss stackpole for a moment to bid defiance to comment but at last she exclaimed well isabel if i didnt know you i might think you were heartless  take care said isabel youre spoiling me  im afraid ive done that already i hope at least miss stackpole added that he may cross with annie climber  isabel learned from her the next morning that she had determined not to return to gardencourt where old mr touchett had promised her a renewed welcome but to await in london the arrival of the invitation that mr bantling had promised her from his sister lady pensil miss stackpole related very freely her conversation with ralph touchetts sociable friend and declared to isabel that she really believed she had now got hold of something that would lead to something on the receipt of lady pensils lettermr bantling had virtually guaranteed the arrival of this documentshe would immediately depart for bedfordshire and if isabel cared to look out for her impressions in the interviewer she would certainly find them henrietta was evidently going to see something of the inner life this time  do you know where youre drifting henrietta stackpole isabel asked imitating the tone in which her friend had spoken the night before  im drifting to a big positionthat of the queen of american journalism if my next letter isnt copied all over the west ill swallow my penwiper  she had arranged with her friend miss annie climber the young lady of the continental offers that they should go together to make those purchases which were to constitute miss climbers farewell to a hemisphere in which she at least had been appreciated and she presently repaired to jermyn street to pick up her companion shortly after her departure ralph touchett was announced and as soon as he came in isabel saw he had something on his mind he very soon took his cousin into his confidence he had received from his mother a telegram to the effect that his father had had a sharp attack of his old malady that she was much alarmed and that she begged he would instantly return to gardencourt on this occasion at least mrs touchetts devotion to the electric wire was not open to criticism  ive judged it best to see the great doctor sir matthew hope first ralph said by great good luck hes in town hes to see me at halfpast twelve and i shall make sure of his coming down to gardencourtwhich he will do the more readily as he has already seen my father several times both there and in london theres an express at twofortyfive which i shall take and youll come back with me or remain here a few days longer exactly as you prefer  i shall certainly go with you isabel returned i dont suppose i can be of any use to my uncle but if hes ill i shall like to be near him  i think youre fond of him said ralph with a certain shy pleasure in his face you appreciate him which all the world hasnt done the qualitys too fine  i quite adore him isabel after a moment said  thats very well after his son hes your greatest admirer she welcomed this assurance but she gave secretly a small sigh of relief at the thought that mr touchett was one of those admirers who couldnt propose to marry her this however was not what she spoke she went on to inform ralph that there were other reasons for her not remaining in london she was tired of it and wished to leave it and then henrietta was going awaygoing to stay in bedfordshire  in bedfordshire  with lady pensil the sister of mr bantling who has answered for an invitation  ralph was feeling anxious but at this he broke into a laugh suddenly none the less his gravity returned bantlings a man of courage but if the invitation should get lost on the way  i thought the british postoffice was impeccable  the good homer sometimes nods said ralph however he went on more brightly the good bantling never does and whatever happens hell take care of henrietta  ralph went to keep his appointment with sir matthew hope and isabel made her arrangements for quitting pratts hotel her uncles danger touched her nearly and while she stood before her open trunk looking about her vaguely for what she should put into it the tears suddenly rose to her eyes it was perhaps for this reason that when ralph came back at two oclock to take her to the station she was not yet ready he found miss stackpole however in the sittingroom where she had just risen from her luncheon and this lady immediately expressed her regret at his fathers illness  hes a grand old man she said hes faithful to the last if its really to be the lastpardon my alluding to it but you must often have thought of the possibilityim sorry that i shall not be at gardencourt  youll amuse yourself much more in bedfordshire  i shall be sorry to amuse myself at such a time said henrietta with much propriety but she immediately added i should like so to commemorate the closing scene  my father may live a long time said ralph simply then adverting to topics more cheerful he interrogated miss stackpole as to her own future  now that ralph was in trouble she addressed him in a tone of larger allowance and told him that she was much indebted to him for having made her acquainted with mr bantling he has told me just the things i want to know she said all the society items and all about the royal family i cant make out that what he tells me about the royal family is much to their credit but he says thats only my peculiar way of looking at it well all i want is that he should give me the facts i can put them together quick enough once ive got them and she added that mr bantling had been so good as to promise to come and take her out that afternoon  to take you where ralph ventured to enquire  to buckingham palace hes going to show me over it so that i may get some idea how they live  ah said ralph we leave you in good hands the first thing we shall hear is that youre invited to windsor castle  if they ask me i shall certainly go once i get started im not afraid but for all that henrietta added in a moment im not satisfied im not at peace about isabel  what is her last misdemeanour  well ive told you before and i suppose theres no harm in my going on i always finish a subject that i take up mr goodwood was here last night  ralph opened his eyes he even blushed a littlehis blush being the sign of an emotion somewhat acute he remembered that isabel in separating from him in winchester square had repudiated his suggestion that her motive in doing so was the expectation of a visitor at pratts hotel and it was a new pang to him to have to suspect her of duplicity on the other hand he quickly said to himself what concern was it of his that she should have made an appointment with a lover had it not been thought graceful in every age that young ladies should make a mystery of such appointments ralph gave miss stackpole a diplomatic answer i should have thought that with the views you expressed to me the other day this would satisfy you perfectly  that he should come to see her that was very well as far as it went it was a little plot of mine i let him know that we were in london and when it had been arranged that i should spend the evening out i sent him a wordthe word we just utter to the wise i hoped he would find her alone i wont pretend i didnt hope that youd be out of the way he came to see her but he might as well have stayed away  isabel was crueland ralphs face lighted with the relief of his cousins not having shown duplicity  i dont exactly know what passed between them but she gave him no satisfactionshe sent him back to america  poor mr goodwood ralph sighed  her only idea seems to be to get rid of him henrietta went on  poor mr goodwood ralph repeated the exclamation it must be confessed was automatic it failed exactly to express his thoughts which were taking another line  you dont say that as if you felt it i dont believe you care  ah said ralph you must remember that i dont know this interesting young manthat ive never seen him  well i shall see him and i shall tell him not to give up if i didnt believe isabel would come round miss stackpole addedwell id give up myself i mean id give her up    chapter xviii  it had occurred to ralph that in the conditions isabels parting with her friend might be of a slightly embarrassed nature and he went down to the door of the hotel in advance of his cousin who after a slight delay followed with the traces of an unaccepted remonstrance as he thought in her eyes the two made the journey to gardencourt in almost unbroken silence and the servant who met them at the station had no better news to give them of mr touchetta fact which caused ralph to congratulate himself afresh on sir matthew hopes having promised to come down in the five oclock train and spend the night mrs touchett he learned on reaching home had been constantly with the old man and was with him at that moment and this fact made ralph say to himself that after all what his mother wanted was just easy occasion the finer natures were those that shone at the larger times isabel went to her own room noting throughout the house that perceptible hush which precedes a crisis at the end of an hour however she came downstairs in search of her aunt whom she wished to ask about mr touchett she went into the library but mrs touchett was not there and as the weather which had been damp and chill was now altogether spoiled it was not probable she had gone for her usual walk in the grounds isabel was on the point of ringing to send a question to her room when this purpose quickly yielded to an unexpected soundthe sound of low music proceeding apparently from the saloon she knew her aunt never touched the piano and the musician was therefore probably ralph who played for his own amusement that he should have resorted to this recreation at the present time indicated apparently that his anxiety about his father had been relieved so that the girl took her way almost with restored cheer toward the source of the harmony the drawingroom at gardencourt was an apartment of great distances and as the piano was placed at the end of it furthest removed from the door at which she entered her arrival was not noticed by the person seated before the instrument this person was neither ralph nor his mother it was a lady whom isabel immediately saw to be a stranger to herself though her back was presented to the door this backan ample and welldressed oneisabel viewed for some moments with surprise the lady was of course a visitor who had arrived during her absence and who had not been mentioned by either of the servantsone of them her aunts maidof whom she had had speech since her return isabel had already learned however with what treasures of reserve the function of receiving orders may be accompanied and she was particularly conscious of having been treated with dryness by her aunts maid through whose hands she had slipped perhaps a little too mistrustfully and with an effect of plumage but the more lustrous the advent of a guest was in itself far from disconcerting she had not yet divested herself of a young faith that each new acquaintance would exert some momentous influence on her life by the time she had made these reflexions she became aware that the lady at the piano played remarkably well she was playing something of schubertsisabel knew not what but recognised schubertand she touched the piano with a discretion of her own it showed skill it showed feeling isabel sat down noiselessly on the nearest chair and waited till the end of the piece when it was finished she felt a strong desire to thank the player and rose from her seat to do so while at the same time the stranger turned quickly round as if but just aware of her presence  thats very beautiful and your playing makes it more beautiful still said isabel with all the young radiance with which she usually uttered a truthful rapture  you dont think i disturbed mr touchett then the musician answered as sweetly as this compliment deserved the house is so large and his room so far away that i thought i might venture especially as i played justjust du bout des doigts  shes a frenchwoman isabel said to herself she says that as if she were french and this supposition made the visitor more interesting to our speculative heroine i hope my uncles doing well isabel added i should think that to hear such lovely music as that would really make him feel better  the lady smiled and discriminated im afraid there are moments in life when even schubert has nothing to say to us we must admit however that they are our worst  im not in that state now then said isabel on the contrary i should be so glad if you would play something more  if it will give you pleasuredelighted and this obliging person took her place again and struck a few chords while isabel sat down nearer the instrument suddenly the newcomer stopped with her hands on the keys halfturning and looking over her shoulder she was forty years old and not pretty though her expression charmed pardon me she said but are you the niecethe young american  im my aunts niece isabel replied with simplicity  the lady at the piano sat still a moment longer casting her air of interest over her shoulder thats very well were compatriots and then she began to play  ah then shes not french isabel murmured and as the opposite supposition had made her romantic it might have seemed that this revelation would have marked a drop but such was not the fact rarer even than to be french seemed it to be american on such interesting terms  the lady played in the same manner as before softly and solemnly and while she played the shadows deepened in the room the autumn twilight gathered in and from her place isabel could see the rain which had now begun in earnest washing the coldlooking lawn and the wind shaking the great trees at last when the music had ceased her companion got up and coming nearer with a smile before isabel had time to thank her again said im very glad youve come back ive heard a great deal about you  isabel thought her a very attractive person but nevertheless spoke with a certain abruptness in reply to this speech from whom have you heard about me  the stranger hesitated a single moment and then from your uncle she answered ive been here three days and the first day he let me come and pay him a visit in his room then he talked constantly of you  as you didnt know me that must rather have bored you  it made me want to know you all the more that since thenyour aunt being so much with mr touchettive been quite alone and have got rather tired of my own society ive not chosen a good moment for my visit  a servant had come in with lamps and was presently followed by another bearing the teatray on the appearance of this repast mrs touchett had apparently been notified for she now arrived and addressed herself to the teapot her greeting to her niece did not differ materially from her manner of raising the lid of this receptacle in order to glance at the contents in neither act was it becoming to make a show of avidity questioned about her husband she was unable to say he was better but the local doctor was with him and much light was expected from this gentlemans consultation with sir matthew hope  i suppose you two ladies have made acquaintance she pursued if you havent i recommend you to do so for so long as we continueralph and ito cluster about mr touchetts bed youre not likely to have much society but each other  i know nothing about you but that youre a great musician isabel said to the visitor  theres a good deal more than that to know mrs touchett affirmed in her little dry tone  a very little of it i am sure will content miss archer the lady exclaimed with a light laugh im an old friend of your aunts ive lived much in florence im madame merle she made this last announcement as if she were referring to a person of tolerably distinct identity for isabel however it represented little she could only continue to feel that madame merle had as charming a manner as any she had ever encountered  shes not a foreigner in spite of her name said mrs touchett  she was borni always forget where you were born  its hardly worth while then i should tell you  on the contrary said mrs touchett who rarely missed a logical point if i remembered your telling me would be quite superfluous  madame merle glanced at isabel with a sort of worldwide smile a thing that overreached frontiers i was born under the shadow of the national banner  shes too fond of mystery said mrs touchett thats her great fault  ah exclaimed madame merle ive great faults but i dont think thats one of then it certainly isnt the greatest i came into the world in the brooklyn navyyard my father was a high officer in the united states navy and had a posta post of responsibilityin that establishment at the time i suppose i ought to love the sea but i hate it thats why i dont return to america i love the land the great thing is to love something  isabel as a dispassionate witness had not been struck with the force of mrs touchetts characterisation of her visitor who had an expressive communicative responsive face by no means of the sort which to isabels mind suggested a secretive disposition it was a face that told of an amplitude of nature and of quick and free motions and though it had no regular beauty was in the highest degree engaging and attaching madame merle was a tall fair smooth woman everything in her person was round and replete though without those accumulations which suggest heaviness her features were thick but in perfect proportion and harmony and her complexion had a healthy clearness her grey eyes were small but full of light and incapable of stupidityincapable according to some people even of tears she had a liberal fullrimmed mouth which when she smiled drew itself upward to the left side in a manner that most people thought very odd some very affected and a few very graceful isabel inclined to range herself in the last category madame merle had thick fair hair arranged somehow classically and as if she were a bust isabel judgeda juno or a niobe and large white hands of a perfect shape a shape so perfect that their possessor preferring to leave them unadorned wore no jewelled rings isabel had taken her at first as we have seen for a frenchwoman but extended observation might have ranked her as a germana german of high degree perhaps an austrian a baroness a countess a princess it would never have been supposed she had come into the world in brooklynthough one could doubtless not have carried through any argument that the air of distinction marking her in so eminent a degree was inconsistent with such a birth it was true that the national banner had floated immediately over her cradle and the breezy freedom of the stars and stripes might have shed an influence upon the attitude she there took towards life and yet she had evidently nothing of the fluttered flapping quality of a morsel of bunting in the wind her manner expressed the repose and confidence which come from a large experience experience however had not quenched her youth it had simply made her sympathetic and supple she was in a word a woman of strong impulses kept in admirable order this commended itself to isabel as an ideal combination  the girl made these reflexions while the three ladies sat at their tea but that ceremony was interrupted before long by the arrival of the great doctor from london who had been immediately ushered into the drawingroom mrs touchett took him off to the library for a private talk and then madame merle and isabel parted to meet again at dinner the idea of seeing more of this interesting woman did much to mitigate isabels sense of the sadness now settling on gardencourt  when she came into the drawingroom before dinner she found the place empty but in the course of a moment ralph arrived his anxiety about his father had been lightened sir matthew hopes view of his condition was less depressed than his own had been the doctor recommended that the nurse alone should remain with the old man for the next three or four hours so that ralph his mother and the great physician himself were free to dine at table mrs touchett and sir matthew appeared madame merle was the last  before she came isabel spoke of her to ralph who was standing before the fireplace pray who is this madame merle  the cleverest woman i know not excepting yourself said ralph  i thought she seemed very pleasant  i was sure youd think her very pleasant  is that why you invited her  i didnt invite her and when we came back from london i didnt know she was here no one invited her shes a friend of my mothers and just after you and i went to town my mother got a note from her she had arrived in england she usually lives abroad though she has first and last spent a good deal of time here and asked leave to come down for a few days shes a woman who can make such proposals with perfect confidence shes so welcome wherever she goes and with my mother there could be no question of hesitating shes the one person in the world whom my mother very much admires if she were not herself which she after all much prefers she would like to be madame merle it would indeed be a great change  well shes very charming said isabel and she plays beautifully  she does everything beautifully shes complete  isabel looked at her cousin a moment you dont like her  on the contrary i was once in love with her  and she didnt care for you and thats why you dont like her  how can we have discussed such things monsieur merle was then living  is he dead now  so she says  dont you believe her  yes because the statement agrees with the probabilities the husband of madame merle would be likely to pass away  isabel gazed at her cousin again i dont know what you mean you mean somethingthat you dont mean what was monsieur merle  the husband of madame  youre very odious has she any children  not the least little childfortunately  fortunately  i mean fortunately for the child shed be sure to spoil it  isabel was apparently on the point of assuring her cousin for the third time that he was odious but the discussion was interrupted by the arrival of the lady who was the topic of it she came rustling in quickly apologising for being late fastening a bracelet dressed in dark blue satin which exposed a white bosom that was ineffectually covered by a curious silver necklace ralph offered her his arm with the exaggerated alertness of a man who was no longer a lover  even if this had still been his condition however ralph had other things to think about the great doctor spent the night at gardencourt and returning to london on the morrow after another consultation with mr touchetts own medical adviser concurred in ralphs desire that he should see the patient again on the day following on the day following sir matthew hope reappeared at gardencourt and now took a less encouraging view of the old man who had grown worse in the twentyfour hours his feebleness was extreme and to his son who constantly sat by his bedside it often seemed that his end must be at hand the local doctor a very sagacious man in whom ralph had secretly more confidence than in his distinguished colleague was constantly in attendance and sir matthew hope came back several times mr touchett was much of the time unconscious he slept a great deal he rarely spoke isabel had a great desire to be useful to him and was allowed to watch with him at hours when his other attendants of whom mrs touchett was not the least regular went to take rest he never seemed to know her and she always said to herself suppose he should die while im sitting here an idea which excited her and kept her awake once he opened his eyes for a while and fixed them upon her intelligently but when she went to him hoping he would recognise her he closed them and relapsed into stupor the day after this however he revived for a longer time but on this occasion ralph only was with him the old man began to talk much to his sons satisfaction who assured him that they should presently have him sitting up  no my boy said mr touchett not unless you bury me in a sitting posture as some of the ancientswas it the ancientsused to do  ah daddy dont talk about that ralph murmured you mustnt deny that youre getting better  there will be no need of my denying it if you dont say it the old man answered why should we prevaricate just at the last we never prevaricated before ive got to die some time and its better to die when ones sick than when ones well im very sickas sick as i shall ever be i hope you dont want to prove that i shall ever be worse than this that would be too bad you dont well then  having made this excellent point he became quiet but the next time that ralph was with him he again addressed himself to conversation the nurse had gone to her supper and ralph was alone in charge having just relieved mrs touchett who had been on guard since dinner the room was lighted only by the flickering fire which of late had become necessary and ralphs tall shadow was projected over wall and ceiling with an outline constantly varying but always grotesque  whos that with meis it my son the old man asked  yes its your son daddy  and is there no one else  no one else  mr touchett said nothing for a while and then i want to talk a little he went on  wont it tire you ralph demurred  it wont matter if it does i shall have a long rest i want to talk about you  ralph had drawn nearer to the bed he sat leaning forward with his hand on his fathers you had better select a brighter topic  you were always bright i used to be proud of your brightness i should like so much to think youd do something  if you leave us said ralph i shall do nothing but miss you  thats just what i dont want its what i want to talk about you must get a new interest  i dont want a new interest daddy i have more old ones than i know what to do with  the old man lay there looking at his son his face was the face of the dying but his eyes were the eyes of daniel touchett he seemed to be reckoning over ralphs interests of course you have your mother he said at last youll take care of her  my mother will always take care of herself ralph returned  well said his father perhaps as she grows older shell need a little help  i shall not see that shell outlive me  very likely she will but thats no reason mr touchett let his phrase die away in a helpless but not quite querulous sigh and remained silent again  dont trouble yourself about us said his son my mother and i get on very well together you know  you get on by always being apart thats not natural  if you leave us we shall probably see more of each other  well the old man observed with wandering irrelevance it cant be said that my death will make much difference in your mothers life  it will probably make more than you think  well shell have more money said mr touchett ive left her a good wifes portion just as if she had been a good wife  she has been one daddy according to her own theory she has never troubled you  ah some troubles are pleasant mr touchett murmured those youve given me for instance but your mother has been lesslesswhat shall i call it less out of the way since ive been ill i presume she knows ive noticed it  i shall certainly tell her so im so glad you mention it  it wont make any difference to her she doesnt do it to please me she does it to pleaseto please and he lay a while trying to think why she did it she does it because it suits her but thats not what i want to talk about he added its about you youll be very well off  yes said ralph i know that but i hope youve not forgotten the talk we had a year agowhen i told you exactly what money i should need and begged you to make some good use of the rest  yes yes i remember i made a new willin a few days i suppose it was the first time such a thing had happeneda young man trying to get a will made against him  it is not against me said ralph it would be against me to have a large property to take care of its impossible for a man in my state of health to spend much money and enough is as good as a feast  well youll have enoughand something over there will be more than enough for onethere will be enough for two  thats too much said ralph  ah dont say that the best thing you can do when im gone will be to marry  ralph had foreseen what his father was coming to and this suggestion was by no means fresh it had long been mr touchetts most ingenious way of taking the cheerful view of his sons possible duration ralph had usually treated it facetiously but present circumstances proscribed the facetious he simply fell back in his chair and returned his fathers appealing gaze  if i with a wife who hasnt been very fond of me have had a very happy life said the old man carrying his ingenuity further still what a life mightnt you have if you should marry a person different from mrs touchett there are more different from her than there are like her ralph still said nothing and after a pause his father resumed softly what do you think of your cousin  at this ralph started meeting the question with a strained smile do i understand you to propose that i should marry isabel  well thats what it comes to in the end dont you like isabel  yes very much and ralph got up from his chair and wandered over to the fire he stood before it an instant and then he stooped and stirred it mechanically i like isabel very much he repeated  well said his father i know she likes you she has told me how much she likes you  did she remark that she would like to marry me  no but she cant have anything against you and shes the most charming young lady ive ever seen and she would be good to you i have thought a great deal about it  so have i said ralph coming back to the bedside again i dont mind telling you that  you are in love with her then i should think you would be its as if she came over on purpose  no im not in love with her but i should be ifif certain things were different  ah things are always different from what they might be said the old man if you wait for them to change youll never do anything i dont know whether you know he went on but i suppose theres no harm in my alluding to it at such an hour as this there was some one wanted to marry isabel the other day and she wouldnt have him  i know she refused warburton he told me himself  well that proves theres a chance for somebody else  somebody else took his chance the other day in londonand got nothing by it  was it you mr touchett eagerly asked  no it was an older friend a poor gentleman who came over from america to see about it  well im sorry for him whoever he was but it only proves what i saythat the ways open to you  if it is dear father its all the greater pity that im unable to tread it i havent many convictions but i have three or four that i hold strongly one is that people on the whole had better not marry their cousins another is that people in an advanced stage of pulmonary disorder had better not marry at all  the old man raised his weak hand and moved it to and fro before his face what do you mean by that you look at things in a way that would make everything wrong what sort of a cousin is a cousin that you had never seen for more than twenty years of her life were all each others cousins and if we stopped at that the human race would die out its just the same with your bad lung youre a great deal better than you used to be all you want is to lead a natural life it is a great deal more natural to marry a pretty young lady that youre in love with than it is to remain single on false principles  im not in love with isabel said ralph  you said just now that you would be if you didnt think it wrong i want to prove to you that it isnt wrong  it will only tire you dear daddy said ralph who marvelled at his fathers tenacity and at his finding strength to insist then where shall we all be  where shall you be if i dont provide for you you wont have anything to do with the bank and you wont have me to take care of you say youve so many interests but i cant make them out  ralph leaned back in his chair with folded arms his eyes were fixed for some time in meditation at last with the air of a man fairly mustering courage i take a great interest in my cousin he said but not the sort of interest you desire i shall not live many years but i hope i shall live long enough to see what she does with herself shes entirely independent of me i can exercise very little influence upon her life but i should like to do something for her  what should you like to do  i should like to put a little wind in her sails  what do you mean by that  i should like to put it into her power to do some of the things she wants she wants to see the world for instance i should like to put money in her purse  ah im glad youve thought of that said the old man but ive thought of it too ive left her a legacyfive thousand pounds  thats capital its very kind of you but i should like to do a little more  something of that veiled acuteness with which it had been on daniel touchetts part the habit of a lifetime to listen to a financial proposition still lingered in the face in which the invalid had not obliterated the man of business i shall be happy to consider it he said softly  isabels poor then my mother tells me that she has but a few hundred dollars a year i should like to make her rich  what do you mean by rich  i call people rich when theyre able to meet the requirements of their imagination isabel has a great deal of imagination  so have you my son said mr touchett listening very attentively but a little confusedly  you tell me i shall have money enough for two what i want is that you should kindly relieve me of my superfluity and make it over to isabel divide my inheritance into two equal halves and give her the second  to do what she likes with  absolutely what she likes  and without an equivalent  what equivalent could there be  the one ive already mentioned  her marryingsome one or other its just to do away with anything of that sort that i make my suggestion if she has an easy income shell never have to marry for a support thats what i want cannily to prevent she wishes to be free and your bequest will make her free  well you seem to have thought it out said mr touchett but i dont see why you appeal to me the money will be yours and you can easily give it to her yourself  ralph openly stared ah dear father i cant offer isabel money  the old man gave a groan dont tell me youre not in love with her do you want me to have the credit of it  entirely i should like it simply to be a clause in your will without the slightest reference to me  do you want me to make a new will then  a few words will do it you can attend to it the next time you feel a little lively  you must telegraph to mr hilary then ill do nothing without my solicitor  you shall see mr hilary tomorrow  hell think weve quarrelled you and i said the old man  very probably i shall like him to think it said ralph smiling and to carry out the idea i give you notice that i shall be very sharp quite horrid and strange with you  the humour of this appeared to touch his father who lay a little while taking it in ill do anything you like mr touchett said at last but im not sure its right you say you want to put wind in her sails but arent you afraid of putting too much  i should like to see her going before the breeze ralph answered  you speak as if it were for your mere amusement  so it is a good deal  well i dont think i understand said mr touchett with a sigh young men are very different from what i was when i cared for a girlwhen i was youngi wanted to do more than look at her  youve scruples that i shouldnt have had and youve ideas that i shouldnt have had either you say isabel wants to be free and that her being rich will keep her from marrying for money do you think that shes a girl to do that  by no means but she has less money than she has ever had before her father then gave her everything because he used to spend his capital she has nothing but the crumbs of that feast to live on and she doesnt really know how meagre they areshe has yet to learn it my mother has told me all about it isabel will learn it when shes really thrown upon the world and it would be very painful to me to think of her coming to the consciousness of a lot of wants she should be unable to satisfy  ive left her five thousand pounds she can satisfy a good many wants with that  she can indeed but she would probably spend it in two or three years  you think shed be extravagant then  most certainly said ralph smiling serenely  poor mr touchetts acuteness was rapidly giving place to pure confusion it would merely be a question of time then her spending the larger sum  nothough at first i think shed plunge into that pretty freely shed probably make over a part of it to each of her sisters but after that shed come to her senses remember she has still a lifetime before her and live within her means  well you have worked it out said the old man helplessly you do take an interest in her certainly  you cant consistently say i go too far you wished me to go further  well i dont know mr touchett answered i dont think i enter into your spirit it seems to me immoral  immoral dear daddy  well i dont know that its right to make everything so easy for a person  it surely depends upon the person when the persons good your making things easy is all to the credit of virtue to facilitate the execution of good impulses what can be a nobler act  this was a little difficult to follow and mr touchett considered it for a while at last he said isabels a sweet young thing but do you think shes so good as that  shes as good as her best opportunities ralph returned  well mr touchett declared she ought to get a great many opportunities for sixty thousand pounds  ive no doubt she will  of course ill do what you want said the old man i only want to understand it a little  well dear daddy dont you understand it now his son caressingly asked if you dont we wont take any more trouble about it well leave it alone  mr touchett lay a long time still ralph supposed he had given up the attempt to follow but at last quite lucidly he began again tell me this first doesnt it occur to you that a young lady with sixty thousand pounds may fall a victim to the fortunehunters  shell hardly fall a victim to more than one  well ones too many  decidedly thats a risk and it has entered into my calculation i think its appreciable but i think its small and im prepared to take it  poor mr touchetts acuteness had passed into perplexity and his perplexity now passed into admiration well you have gone into it he repeated but i dont see what good youre to get of it  ralph leaned over his fathers pillows and gently smoothed them he was aware their talk had been unduly prolonged i shall get just the good i said a few moments ago i wished to put into isabels reachthat of having met the requirements of my imagination but its scandalous the way ive taken advantage of you    chapter xix  as mrs touchett had foretold isabel and madame merle were thrown much together during the illness of their host so that if they had not become intimate it would have been almost a breach of good manners their manners were of the best but in addition to this they happened to please each other it is perhaps too much to say that they swore an eternal friendship but tacitly at least they called the future to witness isabel did so with a perfectly good conscience though she would have hesitated to admit she was intimate with her new friend in the high sense she privately attached to this term she often wondered indeed if she ever had been or ever could be intimate with any one she had an ideal of friendship as well as of several other sentiments which it failed to seem to her in this caseit had not seemed to her in other casesthat the actual completely expressed but she often reminded herself that there were essential reasons why ones ideal could never become concrete it was a thing to believe in not to seea matter of faith not of experience experience however might supply us with very creditable imitations of it and the part of wisdom was to make the best of these certainly on the whole isabel had never encountered a more agreeable and interesting figure than madame merle she had never met a person having less of that fault which is the principal obstacle to friendshipthe air of reproducing the more tiresome the stale the toofamiliar parts of ones own character the gates of the girls confidence were opened wider than they had ever been she said things to this amiable auditress that she had not yet said to any one sometimes she took alarm at her candour it was as if she had given to a comparative stranger the key to her cabinet of jewels these spiritual gems were the only ones of any magnitude that isabel possessed but there was all the greater reason for their being carefully guarded afterwards however she always remembered that one should never regret a generous error and that if madame merle had not the merits she attributed to her so much the worse for madame merle there was no doubt she had great meritsshe was charming sympathetic intelligent cultivated more than this for it had not been isabels illfortune to go through life without meeting in her own sex several persons of whom no less could fairly be said she was rare superior and preeminent there are many amiable people in the world and madame merle was far from being vulgarly goodnatured and restlessly witty she knew how to thinkan accomplishment rare in women and she had thought to very good purpose of course too she knew how to feel isabel couldnt have spent a week with her without being sure of that this was indeed madame merles great talent her most perfect gift life had told upon her she had felt it strongly and it was part of the satisfaction to be taken in her society that when the girl talked of what she was pleased to call serious matters this lady understood her so easily and quickly emotion it is true had become with her rather historic she made no secret of the fact that the fount of passion thanks to having been rather violently tapped at one period didnt flow quite so freely as of yore she proposed moreover as well as expected to cease feeling she freely admitted that of old she had been a little mad and now she pretended to be perfectly sane  i judge more than i used to she said to isabel but it seems to me one has earned the right one cant judge till ones forty before that were too eager too hard too cruel and in addition much too ignorant im sorry for you it will be a long time before youre forty but every gains a loss of some kind i often think that after forty one cant really feel the freshness the quickness have certainly gone youll keep them longer than most people it will be a great satisfaction to me to see you some years hence i want to see what life makes of you one things certainit cant spoil you it may pull you about horribly but i defy it to break you up  isabel received this assurance as a young soldier still panting from a slight skirmish in which he has come off with honour might receive a pat on the shoulder from his colonel like such a recognition of merit it seemed to come with authority how could the lightest word do less on the part of a person who was prepared to say of almost everything isabel told her oh ive been in that my dear it passes like everything else on many of her interlocutors madame merle might have produced an irritating effect it was disconcertingly difficult to surprise her but isabel though by no means incapable of desiring to be effective had not at present this impulse she was too sincere too interested in her judicious companion and then moreover madame merle never said such things in the tone of triumph or of boastfulness they dropped from her like cold confessions  a period of bad weather had settled upon gardencourt the days grew shorter and there was an end to the pretty teaparties on the lawn but our young woman had long indoor conversations with her fellow visitor and in spite of the rain the two ladies often sallied forth for a walk equipped with the defensive apparatus which the english climate and the english genius have between them brought to such perfection madame merle liked almost everything including the english rain theres always a little of it and never too much at once she said and it never wets you and it always smells good she declared that in england the pleasures of smell were greatthat in this inimitable island there was a certain mixture of fog and beer and soot which however odd it might sound was the national aroma and was most agreeable to the nostril and she used to lift the sleeve of her british overcoat and bury her nose in it inhaling the clear fine scent of the wool poor ralph touchett as soon as the autumn had begun to define itself became almost a prisoner in bad weather he was unable to step out of the house and he used sometimes to stand at one of the windows with his hands in his pockets and from a countenance halfrueful halfcritical watch isabel and madame merle as they walked down the avenue under a pair of umbrellas the roads about gardencourt were so firm even in the worst weather that the two ladies always came back with a healthy glow in their cheeks looking at the soles of their neat stout boots and declaring that their walk had done them inexpressible good before luncheon always madame merle was engaged isabel admired and envied her rigid possession of her morning our heroine had always passed for a person of resources and had taken a certain pride in being one but she wandered as by the wrong side of the wall of a private garden round the enclosed talents accomplishments aptitudes of madame merle she found herself desiring to emulate them and in twenty such ways this lady presented herself as a model i should like awfully to be so isabel secretly exclaimed more than once as one after another of her friends fine aspects caught the light and before long she knew that she had learned a lesson from a high authority it took no great time indeed for her to feel herself as the phrase is under an influence whats the harm she wondered so long as its a good one the more ones under a good influence the better the only thing is to see our steps as we take themto understand them as we go that no doubt i shall always do i neednt be afraid of becoming too pliable isnt it my fault that im not pliable enough it is said that imitation is the sincerest flattery and if isabel was sometimes moved to gape at her friend aspiringly and despairingly it was not so much because she desired herself to shine as because she wished to hold up the lamp for madame merle she liked her extremely but was even more dazzled than attracted she sometimes asked herself what henrietta stackpole would say to her thinking so much of this perverted product of their common soil and had a conviction that it would be severely judged henrietta would not at all subscribe to madame merle for reasons she could not have defined this truth came home to the girl on the other hand she was equally sure that should the occasion offer her new friend would strike off some happy view of her old madame merle was too humorous too observant not to do justice to henrietta and on becoming acquainted with her would probably give the measure of a tact which miss stackpole couldnt hope to emulate she appeared to have in her experience a touchstone for everything and somewhere in the capacious pocket of her genial memory she would find the key to henriettas value thats the great thing isabel solemnly pondered thats the supreme good fortune to be in a better position for appreciating people than they are for appreciating you and she added that such when one considered it was simply the essence of the aristocratic situation in this light if in none other one should aim at the aristocratic situation  i may not count over all the links in the chain which led isabel to think of madame merles situation as aristocratica view of it never expressed in any reference made to it by that lady herself she had known great things and great people but she had never played a great part she was one of the small ones of the earth she had not been born to honours she knew the world too well to nourish fatuous illusions on the article of her own place in it she had encountered many of the fortunate few and was perfectly aware of those points at which their fortune differed from hers but if by her informed measure she was no figure for a high scene she had yet to isabels imagination a sort of greatness to be so cultivated and civilised so wise and so easy and still make so light of itthat was really to be a great lady especially when one so carried and presented ones self it was as if somehow she had all society under contribution and all the arts and graces it practisedor was the effect rather that of charming uses found for her even from a distance subtle service rendered by her to a clamorous world wherever she might be after breakfast she wrote a succession of letters as those arriving for her appeared innumerable her correspondence was a source of surprise to isabel when they sometimes walked together to the village postoffice to deposit madame merles offering to the mail she knew more people as she told isabel than she knew what to do with and something was always turning up to be written about of painting she was devotedly fond and made no more of brushing in a sketch than of pulling off her gloves at gardencourt she was perpetually taking advantage of an hours sunshine to go out with a campstool and a box of watercolours that she was a brave musician we have already perceived and it was evidence of the fact that when she seated herself at the piano as she always did in the evening her listeners resigned themselves without a murmur to losing the grace of her talk isabel since she had known her felt ashamed of her own facility which she now looked upon as basely inferior and indeed though she had been thought rather a prodigy at home the loss to society when in taking her place upon the musicstool she turned her back to the room was usually deemed greater than the gain when madame merle was neither writing nor painting nor touching the piano she was usually employed upon wonderful tasks of rich embroidery cushions curtains decorations for the chimneypiece an art in which her bold free invention was as noted as the agility of her needle she was never idle for when engaged in none of the ways i have mentioned she was either reading she appeared to isabel to read everything important or walking out or playing patience with the cards or talking with her fellow inmates and with all this she had always the social quality was never rudely absent and yet never too seated she laid down her pastimes as easily as she took them up she worked and talked at the same time and appeared to impute scant worth to anything she did she gave away her sketches and tapestries she rose from the piano or remained there according to the convenience of her auditors which she always unerringly divined she was in short the most comfortable profitable amenable person to live with if for isabel she had a fault it was that she was not natural by which the girl meant not that she was either affected or pretentious since from these vulgar vices no woman could have been more exempt but that her nature had been too much overlaid by custom and her angles too much rubbed away she had become too flexible too useful was too ripe and too final she was in a word too perfectly the social animal that man and woman are supposed to have been intended to be and she had rid herself of every remnant of that tonic wildness which we may assume to have belonged even to the most amiable persons in the ages before countryhouse life was the fashion isabel found it difficult to think of her in any detachment or privacy she existed only in her relations direct or indirect with her fellow mortals one might wonder what commerce she could possibly hold with her own spirit one always ended however by feeling that a charming surface doesnt necessarily prove one superficial this was an illusion in which in ones youth one had but just escaped being nourished madame merle was not superficialnot she she was deep and her nature spoke none the less in her behaviour because it spoke a conventional tongue whats language at all but a convention said isabel she has the good taste not to pretend like some people ive met to express herself by original signs  im afraid youve suffered much she once found occasion to say to her friend in response to some allusion that had appeared to reach far  what makes you think that madame merle asked with the amused smile of a person seated at a game of guesses i hope i havent too much the droop of the misunderstood  no but you sometimes say things that i think people who have always been happy wouldnt have found out  i havent always been happy said madame merle smiling still but with a mock gravity as if she were telling a child a secret such a wonderful thing  but isabel rose to the irony a great many people give me the impression of never having for a moment felt anything  its very true there are many more iron pots certainly than porcelain but you may depend on it that every one bears some mark even the hardest iron pots have a little bruise a little hole somewhere i flatter myself that im rather stout but if i must tell you the truth ive been shockingly chipped and cracked i do very well for service yet because ive been cleverly mended and i try to remain in the cupboardthe quiet dusky cupboard where theres an odour of stale spicesas much as i can but when ive to come out and into a strong lightthen my dear im a horror  i know not whether it was on this occasion or on some other that the conversation had taken the turn i have just indicated she said to isabel that she would some day a tale unfold isabel assured her she should delight to listen to one and reminded her more than once of this engagement madame merle however begged repeatedly for a respite and at last frankly told her young companion that they must wait till they knew each other better this would be sure to happen a long friendship so visibly lay before them isabel assented but at the same time enquired if she mightnt be trustedif she appeared capable of a betrayal of confidence  its not that im afraid of your repeating what i say her fellow visitor answered im afraid on the contrary of your taking it too much to yourself youd judge me too harshly youre of the cruel age she preferred for the present to talk to isabel of isabel and exhibited the greatest interest in our heroines history sentiments opinions prospects she made her chatter and listened to her chatter with infinite good nature this flattered and quickened the girl who was struck with all the distinguished people her friend had known and with her having lived as mrs touchett said in the best company in europe isabel thought the better of herself for enjoying the favour of a person who had so large a field of comparison and it was perhaps partly to gratify the sense of profiting by comparison that she often appealed to these stores of reminiscence madame merle had been a dweller in many lands and had social ties in a dozen different countries i dont pretend to be educated she would say but i think i know my europe and she spoke one day of going to sweden to stay with an old friend and another of proceeding to malta to follow up a new acquaintance with england where she had often dwelt she was thoroughly familiar and for isabels benefit threw a great deal of light upon the customs of the country and the character of the people who after all as she was fond of saying were the most convenient in the world to live with  you mustnt think it strange her remaining here at such a time as this when mr touchetts passing away that gentlemans wife remarked to her niece she is incapable of a mistake shes the most tactful woman i know its a favour to me that she stays shes putting off a lot of visits at great houses said mrs touchett who never forgot that when she herself was in england her social value sank two or three degrees in the scale she has her pick of places shes not in want of a shelter but ive asked her to put in this time because i wish you to know her i think it will be a good thing for you serena merle hasnt a fault  if i didnt already like her very much that description might alarm me isabel returned  shes never the least little bit off ive brought you out here and i wish to do the best for you your sister lily told me she hoped i would give you plenty of opportunities i give you one in putting you in relation with madame merle shes one of the most brilliant women in europe  i like her better than i like your description of her isabel persisted in saying  do you flatter yourself that youll ever feel her open to criticism i hope youll let me know when you do  that will be cruelto you said isabel  you neednt mind me you wont discover a fault in her  perhaps not but i dare say i shant miss it  she knows absolutely everything on earth there is to know said mrs touchett  isabel after this observed to their companion that she hoped she knew mrs touchett considered she hadnt a speck on her perfection on which im obliged to you madame merle replied but im afraid your aunt imagines or at least alludes to no aberrations that the clockface doesnt register  so that you mean youve a wild side thats unknown to her  ah no i fear my darkest sides are my tamest i mean that having no faults for your aunt means that ones never late for dinnerthat is for her dinner i was not late by the way the other day when you came back from london the clock was just at eight when i came into the drawingroom it was the rest of you that were before the time it means that one answers a letter the day one gets it and that when one comes to stay with her one doesnt bring too much luggage and is careful not to be taken ill for mrs touchett those things constitute virtue its a blessing to be able to reduce it to its elements  madame merles own conversation it will be perceived was enriched with bold free touches of criticism which even when they had a restrictive effect never struck isabel as illnatured it couldnt occur to the girl for instance that mrs touchetts accomplished guest was abusing her and this for very good reasons in the first place isabel rose eagerly to the sense of her shades in the second madame merle implied that there was a great deal more to say and it was clear in the third that for a person to speak to one without ceremony of ones near relations was an agreeable sign of that persons intimacy with ones self these signs of deep communion multiplied as the days elapsed and there was none of which isabel was more sensible than of her companions preference for making miss archer herself a topic though she referred frequently to the incidents of her own career she never lingered upon them she was as little of a gross egotist as she was of a flat gossip  im old and stale and faded she said more than once im of no more interest than last weeks newspaper youre young and fresh and of today youve the great thingyouve actuality i once had itwe all have it for an hour you however will have it for longer let us talk about you then you can say nothing i shall not care to hear its a sign that im growing oldthat i like to talk with younger people i think its a very pretty compensation if we cant have youth within us we can have it outside and i really think we see it and feel it better that way of course we must be in sympathy with itthat i shall always be i dont know that i shall ever be illnatured with old peoplei hope not there are certainly some old people i adore but i shall never be anything but abject with the young they touch me and appeal to me too much i give you carte blanche then you can even be impertinent if you like i shall let it pass and horribly spoil you i speak as if i were a hundred years old you say well i am if you please i was born before the french revolution ah my dear je viens de loin i belong to the old old world but its not of that i want to talk i want to talk about the new you must tell me more about america you never tell me enough here ive been since i was brought here as a helpless child and its ridiculous or rather its scandalous how little i know about that splendid dreadful funny countrysurely the greatest and drollest of them all there are a great many of us like that in these parts and i must say i think were a wretched set of people you should live in your own land whatever it may be you have your natural place there if were not good americans were certainly poor europeans weve no natural place here were mere parasites crawling over the surface we havent our feet in the soil at least one can know it and not have illusions a woman perhaps can get on a woman it seems to me has no natural place anywhere wherever she finds herself she has to remain on the surface and more or less to crawl you protest my dear youre horrified you declare youll never crawl its very true that i dont see you crawling you stand more upright than a good many poor creatures very good on the whole i dont think youll crawl but the men the americans je vous demande un peu what do they make of it over here i dont envy them trying to arrange themselves look at poor ralph touchett what sort of a figure do you call that fortunately he has a consumption i say fortunately because it gives him something to do his consumptions his carriere its a kind of position you can say oh mr touchett he takes care of his lungs he knows a great deal about climates but without that who would he be what would he represent mr ralph touchett an american who lives in europe that signifies absolutely nothingits impossible anything should signify less hes very cultivated they say he has a very pretty collection of old snuffboxes the collection is all thats wanted to make it pitiful im tired of the sound of the word i think its grotesque with the poor old father its different he has his identity and its rather a massive one he represents a great financial house and that in our day is as good as anything else for an american at any rate that will do very well but i persist in thinking your cousin very lucky to have a chronic malady so long as he doesnt die of it its much better than the snuffboxes if he werent ill you say hed do somethinghed take his fathers place in the house my poor child i doubt it i dont think hes at all fond of the house however you know him better than i though i used to know him rather well and he may have the benefit of the doubt the worst case i think is a friend of mine a countryman of ours who lives in italy where he also was brought before he knew better and who is one of the most delightful men i know some day you must know him ill bring you together and then youll see what i mean hes gilbert osmondhe lives in italy thats all one can say about him or make of him hes exceedingly clever a man made to be distinguished but as i tell you you exhaust the description when you say hes mr osmond who lives tout betement in italy no career no name no position no fortune no past no future no anything oh yes he paints if you pleasepaints in watercolours like me only better than i his paintings pretty bad on the whole im rather glad of that fortunately hes very indolent so indolent that it amounts to a sort of position he can say oh i do nothing im too deadly lazy you can do nothing today unless you get up at five oclock in the morning in that way he becomes a sort of exception you feel he might do something if hed only rise early he never speaks of his painting to people at large hes too clever for that but he has a little girla dear little girl he does speak of her hes devoted to her and if it were a career to be an excellent father hed be very distinguished but im afraid thats no better than the snuffboxes perhaps not even so good tell me what they do in america pursued madame merle who it must be observed parenthetically did not deliver herself all at once of these reflexions which are presented in a cluster for the convenience of the reader she talked of florence where mr osmond lived and where mrs touchett occupied a medieval palace she talked of rome where she herself had a little piedaterre with some rather good old damask she talked of places of people and even as the phrase is of subjects and from time to time she talked of their kind old host and of the prospect of his recovery from the first she had thought this prospect small and isabel had been struck with the positive discriminating competent way in which she took the measure of his remainder of life one evening she announced definitely that he wouldnt live  sir matthew hope told me so as plainly as was proper she said standing there near the fire before dinner he makes himself very agreeable the great doctor i dont mean his saying that has anything to do with it but he says such things with great tact i had told him i felt ill at my ease staying here at such a time it seemed to me so indiscreetit wasnt as if i could nurse you must remain you must remain he answered your office will come later wasnt that a very delicate way of saying both that poor mr touchett would go and that i might be of some use as a consoler in fact however i shall not be of the slightest use your aunt will console herself she and she alone knows just how much consolation shell require it would be a very delicate matter for another person to undertake to administer the dose with your cousin it will be different hell miss his father immensely but i should never presume to condole with mr ralph were not on those terms madame merle had alluded more than once to some undefined incongruity in her relations with ralph touchett so isabel took this occasion of asking her if they were not good friends  perfectly but he doesnt like me  what have you done to him  nothing whatever but one has no need of a reason for that  for not liking you i think one has need of a very good reason  youre very kind be sure you have one ready for the day you begin  begin to dislike you i shall never begin  i hope not because if you do youll never end thats the way with your cousin he doesnt get over it its an antipathy of natureif i can call it that when its all on his side ive nothing whatever against him and dont bear him the least little grudge for not doing me justice justice is all i want however one feels that hes a gentleman and would never say anything underhand about one cartes sur table madame merle subjoined in a moment im not afraid of him  i hope not indeed said isabel who added something about his being the kindest creature living she remembered however that on her first asking him about madame merle he had answered her in a manner which this lady might have thought injurious without being explicit there was something between them isabel said to herself but she said nothing more than this if it were something of importance it should inspire respect if it were not it was not worth her curiosity with all her love of knowledge she had a natural shrinking from raising curtains and looking into unlighted corners the love of knowledge coexisted in her mind with the finest capacity for ignorance  but madame merle sometimes said things that startled her made her raise her clear eyebrows at the time and think of the words afterwards id give a great deal to be your age again she broke out once with a bitterness which though diluted in her customary amplitude of ease was imperfectly disguised by it if i could only begin againif i could have my life before me  your lifes before you yet isabel answered gently for she was vaguely awestruck  no the best parts gone and gone for nothing  surely not for nothing said isabel  why notwhat have i got neither husband nor child nor fortune nor position nor the traces of a beauty that i never had  you have many friends dear lady  im not so sure cried madame merle  ah youre wrong you have memories graces talents  but madame merle interrupted her what have my talents brought me nothing but the need of using them still to get through the hours the years to cheat myself with some pretence of movement of unconsciousness as for my graces and memories the less said about them the better youll be my friend till you find a better use for your friendship  it will be for you to see that i dont then said isabel  yes i would make an effort to keep you and her companion looked at her gravely when i say i should like to be your age i mean with your qualitiesfrank generous sincere like you in that case i should have made something better of my life  what should you have liked to do that youve not done  madame merle took a sheet of musicshe was seated at the piano and had abruptly wheeled about on the stool when she first spokeand mechanically turned the leaves im very ambitious she at last replied  and your ambitions have not been satisfied they must have been great  they were great i should make myself ridiculous by talking of them  isabel wondered what they could have beenwhether madame merle had aspired to wear a crown i dont know what your idea of success may be but you seem to me to have been successful to me indeed youre a vivid image of success  madame merle tossed away the music with a smile whats your idea of success  you evidently think it must be a very tame one its to see some dream of ones youth come true  ah madame merle exclaimed that ive never seen but my dreams were so greatso preposterous heaven forgive me im dreaming now and she turned back to the piano and began grandly to play on the morrow she said to isabel that her definition of success had been very pretty yet frightfully sad measured in that way who had ever succeeded the dreams of ones youth why they were enchanting they were divine who had ever seen such things come to pass  i myselfa few of them isabel ventured to answer  already they must have been dreams of yesterday  i began to dream very young isabel smiled  ah if you mean the aspirations of your childhoodthat of having a pink sash and a doll that could close her eyes  no i dont mean that  or a young man with a fine moustache going down on his knees to you  no nor that either isabel declared with still more emphasis  madame merle appeared to note this eagerness i suspect thats what you do mean weve all had the young man with the moustache hes the inevitable young man he doesnt count  isabel was silent a little but then spoke with extreme and characteristic inconsequence why shouldnt he count there are young men and young men  and yours was a paragonis that what you mean asked her friend with a laugh if youve had the identical young man you dreamed of then that was success and i congratulate you with all my heart only in that case why didnt you fly with him to his castle in the apennines  he has no castle in the apennines  what has he an ugly brick house in fortieth street dont tell me that i refuse to recognise that as an ideal  i dont care anything about his house said isabel  thats very crude of you when youve lived as long as i youll see that every human being has his shell and that you must take the shell into account by the shell i mean the whole envelope of circumstances theres no such thing as an isolated man or woman were each of us made up of some cluster of appurtenances what shall we call our self where does it begin where does it end it overflows into everything that belongs to usand then it flows back again i know a large part of myself is in the clothes i choose to wear ive a great respect for things ones selffor other peopleis ones expression of ones self and ones house ones furniture ones garments the books one reads the company one keepsthese things are all expressive  this was very metaphysical not more so however than several observations madame merle had already made isabel was fond of metaphysics but was unable to accompany her friend into this bold analysis of the human personality i dont agree with you i think just the other way i dont know whether i succeed in expressing myself but i know that nothing else expresses me nothing that belongs to me is any measure of me everythings on the contrary a limit a barrier and a perfectly arbitrary one certainly the clothes which as you say i choose to wear dont express me and heaven forbid they should  you dress very well madame merle lightly interposed  possibly but i dont care to be judged by that my clothes may express the dressmaker but they dont express me to begin with its not my own choice that i wear them theyre imposed upon me by society  should you prefer to go without them madame merle enquired in a tone which virtually terminated the discussion  i am bound to confess though it may cast some discredit on the sketch i have given of the youthful loyalty practised by our heroine toward this accomplished woman that isabel had said nothing whatever to her about lord warburton and had been equally reticent on the subject of caspar goodwood she had not however concealed the fact that she had had opportunities of marrying and had even let her friend know of how advantageous a kind they had been lord warburton had left lockleigh and was gone to scotland taking his sisters with him and though he had written to ralph more than once to ask about mr touchetts health the girl was not liable to the embarrassment of such enquiries as had he still been in the neighbourhood he would probably have felt bound to make in person he had excellent ways but she felt sure that if he had come to gardencourt he would have seen madame merle and that if he had seen her he would have liked her and betrayed to her that he was in love with her young friend it so happened that during this ladys previous visits to gardencourteach of them much shorter than the presenthe had either not been at lockleigh or had not called at mr touchetts therefore though she knew him by name as the great man of that county she had no cause to suspect him as a suitor of mrs touchetts freshlyimported niece  youve plenty of time she had said to isabel in return for the mutilated confidences which our young woman made her and which didnt pretend to be perfect though we have seen that at moments the girl had compunctions at having said so much im glad youve done nothing yetthat you have it still to do its a very good thing for a girl to have refused a few good offersso long of course as they are not the best shes likely to have pardon me if my tone seems horribly corrupt one must take the worldly view sometimes only dont keep on refusing for the sake of refusing its a pleasant exercise of power but acceptings after all an exercise of power as well theres always the danger of refusing once too often it was not the one i fell intoi didnt refuse often enough youre an exquisite creature and i should like to see you married to a prime minister but speaking strictly you know youre not what is technically called a parti youre extremely goodlooking and extremely clever in yourself youre quite exceptional you appear to have the vaguest ideas about your earthly possessions but from what i can make out youre not embarrassed with an income i wish you had a little money  i wish i had said isabel simply apparently forgetting for the moment that her poverty had been a venial fault for two gallant gentlemen  in spite of sir matthew hopes benevolent recommendation madame merle did not remain to the end as the issue of poor mr touchetts malady had now come frankly to be designated she was under pledges to other people which had at last to be redeemed and she left gardencourt with the understanding that she should in any event see mrs touchett there again or else in town before quitting england her parting with isabel was even more like the beginning of a friendship than their meeting had been im going to six places in succession but i shall see no one i like so well as you theyll all be old friends however one doesnt make new friends at my age ive made a great exception for you you must remember that and must think as well of me as possible you must reward me by believing in me  by way of answer isabel kissed her and though some women kiss with facility there are kisses and kisses and this embrace was satisfactory to madame merle our young lady after this was much alone she saw her aunt and cousin only at meals and discovered that of the hours during which mrs touchett was invisible only a minor portion was now devoted to nursing her husband she spent the rest in her own apartments to which access was not allowed even to her niece apparently occupied there with mysterious and inscrutable exercises at table she was grave and silent but her solemnity was not an attitudeisabel could see it was a conviction she wondered if her aunt repented of having taken her own way so much but there was no visible evidence of thisno tears no sighs no exaggeration of a zeal always to its own sense adequate mrs touchett seemed simply to feel the need of thinking things over and summing them up she had a little moral accountbookwith columns unerringly ruled and a sharp steel claspwhich she kept with exemplary neatness uttered reflection had with her ever at any rate a practical ring if i had foreseen this id not have proposed your coming abroad now she said to isabel after madame merle had left the house id have waited and sent for you next year  so that perhaps i should never have known my uncle its a great happiness to me to have come now  thats very well but it was not that you might know your uncle that i brought you to europe a perfectly veracious speech but as isabel thought not as perfectly timed she had leisure to think of this and other matters she took a solitary walk every day and spent vague hours in turning over books in the library among the subjects that engaged her attention were the adventures of her friend miss stackpole with whom she was in regular correspondence isabel liked her friends private epistolary style better than her public that is she felt her public letters would have been excellent if they had not been printed henriettas career however was not so successful as might have been wished even in the interest of her private felicity that view of the inner life of great britain which she was so eager to take appeared to dance before her like an ignis fatuus the invitation from lady pensil for mysterious reasons had never arrived and poor mr bantling himself with all his friendly ingenuity had been unable to explain so grave a dereliction on the part of a missive that had obviously been sent he had evidently taken henriettas affairs much to heart and believed that he owed her a setoff to this illusory visit to bedfordshire he says he should think i would go to the continent henrietta wrote and as he thinks of going there himself i suppose his advice is sincere he wants to know why i dont take a view of french life and its a fact that i want very much to see the new republic mr bantling doesnt care much about the republic but he thinks of going over to paris anyway i must say hes quite as attentive as i could wish and at least i shall have seen one polite englishman i keep telling mr bantling that he ought to have been an american and you should see how that pleases him whenever i say so he always breaks out with the same exclamationah but really come now a few days later she wrote that she had decided to go to paris at the end of the week and that mr banding had promised to see her offperhaps even would go as far as dover with her she would wait in paris till isabel should arrive henrietta added speaking quite as if isabel were to start on her continental journey alone and making no allusion to mrs touchett bearing in mind his interest in their late companion our heroine communicated several passages from this correspondence to ralph who followed with an emotion akin to suspense the career of the representative of the interviewer  it seems to me shes doing very well he said going over to paris with an exlancer if she wants something to write about she has only to describe that episode  its not conventional certainly isabel answered but if you mean thatas far as henrietta is concernedits not perfectly innocent youre very much mistaken youll never understand henrietta  pardon me i understand her perfectly i didnt at all at first but now ive the point of view im afraid however that bantling hasnt he may have some surprises oh i understand henrietta as well as if i had made her  isabel was by no means sure of this but she abstained from expressing further doubt for she was disposed in these days to extend a great charity to her cousin one afternoon less than a week after madame merles departure she was seated in the library with a volume to which her attention was not fastened she had placed herself in a deep windowbench from which she looked out into the dull damp park and as the library stood at right angles to the entrancefront of the house she could see the doctors brougham which had been waiting for the last two hours before the door she was struck with his remaining so long but at last she saw him appear in the portico stand a moment slowly drawing on his gloves and looking at the knees of his horse and then get into the vehicle and roll away isabel kept her place for half an hour there was a great stillness in the house it was so great that when she at last heard a soft slow step on the deep carpet of the room she was almost startled by the sound she turned quickly away from the window and saw ralph touchett standing there with his hands still in his pockets but with a face absolutely void of its usual latent smile she got up and her movement and glance were a question  its all over said ralph  do you mean that my uncle and isabel stopped  my dear father died an hour ago  ah my poor ralph she gently wailed putting out her two hands to him    chapter xx  some fortnight after this madame merle drove up in a hansom cab to the house in winchester square as she descended from her vehicle she observed suspended between the diningroom windows a large neat wooden tablet on whose fresh black ground were inscribed in white paint the wordsthis noble freehold mansion to be sold with the name of the agent to whom application should be made they certainly lose no time said the visitor as after sounding the big brass knocker she waited to be admitted its a practical country and within the house as she ascended to the drawingroom she perceived numerous signs of abdication pictures removed from the walls and placed upon sofas windows undraped and floors laid bare mrs touchett presently received her and intimated in a few words that condolences might be taken for granted  i know what youre going to sayhe was a very good man but i know it better than any one because i gave him more chance to show it in that i think i was a good wife mrs touchett added that at the end her husband apparently recognised this fact he has treated me most liberally she said i wont say more liberally than i expected because i didnt expect you know that as a general thing i dont expect but he chose i presume to recognise the fact that though i lived much abroad and mingledyou may say freelyin foreign life i never exhibited the smallest preference for any one else  for any one but yourself madame merle mentally observed but the reflexion was perfectly inaudible  i never sacrificed my husband to another mrs touchett continued with her stout curtness  oh no thought madame merle you never did anything for another  there was a certain cynicism in these mute comments which demands an explanation the more so as they are not in accord either with the viewsomewhat superficial perhapsthat we have hitherto enjoyed of madame merles character or with the literal facts of mrs touchetts history the more so too as madame merle had a wellfounded conviction that her friends last remark was not in the least to be construed as a sidethrust at herself the truth is that the moment she had crossed the threshold she received an impression that mr touchetts death had had subtle consequences and that these consequences had been profitable to a little circle of persons among whom she was not numbered of course it was an event which would naturally have consequences her imagination had more than once rested upon this fact during her stay at gardencourt but it had been one thing to foresee such a matter mentally and another to stand among its massive records the idea of a distribution of propertyshe would almost have said of spoilsjust now pressed upon her senses and irritated her with a sense of exclusion i am far from wishing to picture her as one of the hungry mouths or envious hearts of the general herd but we have already learned of her having desires that had never been satisfied if she had been questioned she would of course have admittedwith a fine proud smilethat she had not the faintest claim to a share in mr touchetts relics there was never anything in the world between us she would have said there was never that poor manwith a fillip of her thumb and her third finger i hasten to add moreover that if she couldnt at the present moment keep from quite perversely yearning she was careful not to betray herself she had after all as much sympathy for mrs touchetts gains as for her losses  he has left me this house the newlymade widow said but of course i shall not live in it ive a much better one in florence the will was opened only three days since but ive already offered the house for sale ive also a share in the bank but i dont yet understand if im obliged to leave it there if not i shall certainly take it out ralph of course has gardencourt but im not sure that hell have means to keep up the place hes naturally left very well off but his father has given away an immense deal of money there are bequests to a string of third cousins in vermont ralph however is very fond of gardencourt and would be quite capable of living therein summerwith a maidofallwork and a gardeners boy theres one remarkable clause in my husbands will mrs touchett added he has left my niece a fortune  a fortune madame merle softly repeated  isabel steps into something like seventy thousand pounds madame merles hands were clasped in her lap at this she raised them still clasped and held them a moment against her bosom while her eyes a little dilated fixed themselves on those of her friend ah she cried the clever creature  mrs touchett gave her a quick look what do you mean by that  for an instant madame merles colour rose and she dropped her eyes it certainly is clever to achieve such resultswithout an effort  there assuredly was no effort dont call it an achievement  madame merle was seldom guilty of the awkwardness of retracting what she had said her wisdom was shown rather in maintaining it and placing it in a favourable light my dear friend isabel would certainly not have had seventy thousand pounds left her if she had not been the most charming girl in the world her charm includes great cleverness  she never dreamed im sure of my husbands doing anything for her and i never dreamed of it either for he never spoke to me of his intention mrs touchett said she had no claim upon him whatever it was no great recommendation to him that she was my niece whatever she achieved she achieved unconsciously  ah rejoined madame merle those are the greatest strokes mrs touchett reserved her opinion the girls fortunate i dont deny that but for the present shes simply stupefied  do you mean that she doesnt know what to do with the money  that i think she has hardly considered she doesnt know what to think about the matter at all it has been as if a big gun were suddenly fired off behind her shes feeling herself to see if she be hurt its but three days since she received a visit from the principal executor who came in person very gallantly to notify her he told me afterwards that when he had made his little speech she suddenly burst into tears the moneys to remain in the affairs of the bank and shes to draw the interest  madame merle shook her head with a wise and now quite benignant smile how very delicious after she has done that two or three times shell get used to it then after a silence what does your son think of it she abruptly asked  he left england before the will was readused up by his fatigue and anxiety and hurrying off to the south hes on his way to the riviera and ive not yet heard from him but its not likely hell ever object to anything done by his father  didnt you say his own share had been cut down  only at his wish i know that he urged his father to do something for the people in america hes not in the least addicted to looking after number one  it depends upon whom he regards as number one said madame merle and she remained thoughtful a moment her eyes bent on the floor  am i not to see your happy niece she asked at last as she raised them  you may see her but youll not be struck with her being happy she has looked as solemn these three days as a cimabue madonna and mrs touchett rang for a servant  isabel came in shortly after the footman had been sent to call her and madame merle thought as she appeared that mrs touchetts comparison had its force the girl was pale and gravean effect not mitigated by her deeper mourning but the smile of her brightest moments came into her face as she saw madame merle who went forward laid her hand on our heroines shoulder and after looking at her a moment kissed her as if she were returning the kiss she had received from her at gardencourt this was the only allusion the visitor in her great good taste made for the present to her young friends inheritance  mrs touchett had no purpose of awaiting in london the sale of her house after selecting from among its furniture the objects she wished to transport to her other abode she left the rest of its contents to be disposed of by the auctioneer and took her departure for the continent she was of course accompanied on this journey by her niece who now had plenty of leisure to measure and weigh and otherwise handle the windfall on which madame merle had covertly congratulated her isabel thought very often of the fact of her accession of means looking at it in a dozen different lights but we shall not now attempt to follow her train of thought or to explain exactly why her new consciousness was at first oppressive this failure to rise to immediate joy was indeed but brief the girl presently made up her mind that to be rich was a virtue because it was to be able to do and that to do could only be sweet it was the graceful contrary of the stupid side of weaknessespecially the feminine variety to be weak was for a delicate young person rather graceful but after all as isabel said to herself there was a larger grace than that just now it is true there was not much to doonce she had sent off a cheque to lily and another to poor edith but she was thankful for the quiet months which her mourning robes and her aunts fresh widowhood compelled them to spend together the acquisition of power made her serious she scrutinised her power with a kind of tender ferocity but was not eager to exercise it she began to do so during a stay of some weeks which she eventually made with her aunt in paris though in ways that will inevitably present themselves as trivial they were the ways most naturally imposed in a city in which the shops are the admiration of the world and that were prescribed unreservedly by the guidance of mrs touchett who took a rigidly practical view of the transformation of her niece from a poor girl to a rich one now that youre a young woman of fortune you must know how to play the parti mean to play it well she said to isabel once for all and she added that the girls first duty was to have everything handsome you dont know how to take care of your things but you must learn she went on this was isabels second duty isabel submitted but for the present her imagination was not kindled she longed for opportunities but these were not the opportunities she meant  mrs touchett rarely changed her plans and having intended before her husbands death to spend a part of the winter in paris saw no reason to deprive herselfstill less to deprive her companionof this advantage though they would live in great retirement she might still present her niece informally to the little circle of her fellow countrymen dwelling upon the skirts of the champs elysees with many of these amiable colonists mrs touchett was intimate she shared their expatriation their convictions their pastimes their ennui isabel saw them arrive with a good deal of assiduity at her aunts hotel and pronounced on them with a trenchancy doubtless to be accounted for by the temporary exaltation of her sense of human duty she made up her mind that their lives were though luxurious inane and incurred some disfavour by expressing this view on bright sunday afternoons when the american absentees were engaged in calling on each other though her listeners passed for people kept exemplarily genial by their cooks and dressmakers two or three of them thought her cleverness which was generally admitted inferior to that of the new theatrical pieces you all live here this way but what does it lead to she was pleased to ask it doesnt seem to lead to anything and i should think youd get very tired of it  mrs touchett thought the question worthy of henrietta stackpole the two ladies had found henrietta in paris and isabel constantly saw her so that mrs touchett had some reason for saying to herself that if her niece were not clever enough to originate almost anything she might be suspected of having borrowed that style of remark from her journalistic friend the first occasion on which isabel had spoken was that of a visit paid by the two ladies to mrs luce an old friend of mrs touchetts and the only person in paris she now went to see mrs luce had been living in paris since the days of louis philippe she used to say jocosely that she was one of the generation of 1830a joke of which the point was not always taken when it failed mrs luce used to explainoh yes im one of the romantics her french had never become quite perfect she was always at home on sunday afternoons and surrounded by sympathetic compatriots usually the same in fact she was at home at all times and reproduced with wondrous truth in her wellcushioned little corner of the brilliant city the domestic tone of her native baltimore this reduced mr luce her worthy husband a tall lean grizzled wellbrushed gentleman who wore a gold eyeglass and carried his hat a little too much on the back of his head to mere platonic praise of the distractions of paristhey were his great wordsince you would never have guessed from what cares he escaped to them one of them was that he went every day to the american bankers where he found a postoffice that was almost as sociable and colloquial an institution as in an american country town he passed an hour in fine weather in a chair in the champs elysees and he dined uncommonly well at his own table seated above a waxed floor which it was mrs luces happiness to believe had a finer polish than any other in the french capital occasionally he dined with a friend or two at the cafe anglais where his talent for ordering a dinner was a source of felicity to his companions and an object of admiration even to the headwaiter of the establishment these were his only known pastimes but they had beguiled his hours for upwards of half a century and they doubtless justified his frequent declaration that there was no place like paris in no other place on these terms could mr luce flatter himself that he was enjoying life there was nothing like paris but it must be confessed that mr luce thought less highly of this scene of his dissipations than in earlier days in the list of his resources his political reflections should not be omitted for they were doubtless the animating principle of many hours that superficially seemed vacant like many of his fellow colonists mr luce was a highor rather a deepconservative and gave no countenance to the government lately established in france he had no faith in its duration and would assure you from year to year that its end was close at hand they want to be kept down sir to be kept down nothing but the strong handthe iron heelwill do for them he would frequently say of the french people and his ideal of a fine showy clever rule was that of the superseded empire paris is much less attractive than in the days of the emperor he knew how to make a city pleasant mr luce had often remarked to mrs touchett who was quite of his own way of thinking and wished to know what one had crossed that odious atlantic for but to get away from republics  why madam sitting in the champs elysees opposite to the palace of industry ive seen the courtcarriages from the tuileries pass up and down as many as seven times a day i remember one occasion when they went as high as nine what do you see now its no use talking the styles all gone napoleon knew what the french people want and therell be a dark cloud over paris our paris till they get the empire back again  among mrs luces visitors on sunday afternoons was a young man with whom isabel had had a good deal of conversation and whom she found full of valuable knowledge mr edward rosierned rosier as he was calledwas native to new york and had been brought up in paris living there under the eye of his father who as it happened had been an early and intimate friend of the late mr archer edward rosier remembered isabel as a little girl it had been his father who came to the rescue of the small archers at the inn at neufchatel he was travelling that way with the boy and had stopped at the hotel by chance after their bonne had gone off with the russian prince and when mr archers whereabouts remained for some days a mystery isabel remembered perfectly the neat little male child whose hair smelt of a delicious cosmetic and who had a bonne all his own warranted to lose sight of him under no provocation isabel took a walk with the pair beside the lake and thought little edward as pretty as an angela comparison by no means conventional in her mind for she had a very definite conception of a type of features which she supposed to be angelic and which her new friend perfectly illustrated a small pink face surmounted by a blue velvet bonnet and set off by a stiff embroidered collar had become the countenance of her childish dreams and she had firmly believed for some time afterwards that the heavenly hosts conversed among themselves in a queer little dialect of frenchenglish expressing the properest sentiments as when edward told her that he was defended by his bonne to go near the edge of the lake and that one must always obey to ones bonne ned rosiers english had improved at least it exhibited in a less degree the french variation his father was dead and his bonne dismissed but the young man still conformed to the spirit of their teachinghe never went to the edge of the lake there was still something agreeable to the nostrils about him and something not offensive to nobler organs he was a very gentle and gracious youth with what are called cultivated tastesan acquaintance with old china with good wine with the bindings of books with the almanach de gotha with the best shops the best hotels the hours of railwaytrains he could order a dinner almost as well as mr luce and it was probable that as his experience accumulated he would be a worthy successor to that gentleman whose rather grim politics he also advocated in a soft and innocent voice he had some charming rooms in paris decorated with old spanish altarlace the envy of his female friends who declared that his chimneypiece was better draped than the high shoulders of many a duchess he usually however spent a part of every winter at pau and had once passed a couple of months in the united states  he took a great interest in isabel and remembered perfectly the walk at neufchatel when she would persist in going so near the edge he seemed to recognise this same tendency in the subversive enquiry that i quoted a moment ago and set himself to answer our heroines question with greater urbanity than it perhaps deserved what does it lead to miss archer why paris leads everywhere you cant go anywhere unless you come here first every one that comes to europe has got to pass through you dont mean it in that sense so much you mean what good it does you well how can you penetrate futurity how can you tell what lies ahead if its a pleasant road i dont care where it leads i like the road miss archer i like the dear old asphalte you cant get tired of ityou cant if you try you think you would but you wouldnt theres always something new and fresh take the hotel drouot now they sometimes have three and four sales a week where can you get such things as you can here in spite of all they say i maintain theyre cheaper too if you know the right places i know plenty of places but i keep them to myself ill tell you if you like as a particular favour only you mustnt tell any one else dont you go anywhere without asking me first i want you to promise me that as a general thing avoid the boulevards theres very little to be done on the boulevards speaking conscientiouslysans blaguei dont believe any one knows paris better than i you and mrs touchett must come and breakfast with me some day and ill show you my things je ne vous dis que ca there has been a great deal of talk about london of late its the fashion to cry up london but theres nothing in ityou cant do anything in london no louis quinzenothing of the first empire nothing but their eternal queen anne its good for ones bedroom queen annefor ones washingroom but it isnt proper for a salon do i spend my life at the auctioneers mr rosier pursued in answer to another question of isabels oh no i havent the means i wish i had you think im a mere trifler i can tell by the expression of your faceyouve got a wonderfully expressive face i hope you dont mind my saying that i mean it as a kind of warning you think i ought to do something and so do i so long as you leave it vague but when you come to the point you see you have to stop i cant go home and be a shopkeeper you think im very well fitted ah miss archer you overrate me i can buy very well but i cant sell you should see when i sometimes try to get rid of my things it takes much more ability to make other people buy than to buy yourself when i think how clever they must be the people who make me buy ah no i couldnt be a shopkeeper i cant be a doctor its a repulsive business i cant be a clergyman i havent got convictions and then i cant pronounce the names right in the bible theyre very difficult in the old testament particularly i cant be a lawyer i dont understandhow do you call itthe american procedure is there anything else theres nothing for a gentleman in america i should like to be a diplomatist but american diplomacythats not for gentlemen either im sure if you had seen the last min  henrietta stackpole who was often with her friend when mr rosier coming to pay his compliments late in the afternoon expressed himself after the fashion i have sketched usually interrupted the young man at this point and read him a lecture on the duties of the american citizen she thought him most unnatural he was worse than poor ralph touchett henrietta however was at this time more than ever addicted to fine criticism for her conscience had been freshly alarmed as regards isabel she had not congratulated this young lady on her augmentations and begged to be excused from doing so  if mr touchett had consulted me about leaving you the money she frankly asserted id have said to him never  i see isabel had answered you think it will prove a curse in disguise perhaps it will  leave it to some one you care less forthats what i should have said  to yourself for instance isabel suggested jocosely and then do you really believe it will ruin me she asked in quite another tone  i hope it wont ruin you but it will certainly confirm your dangerous tendencies  do you mean the love of luxuryof extravagance  no no said henrietta i mean your exposure on the moral side i approve of luxury i think we ought to be as elegant as possible look at the luxury of our western cities ive seen nothing over here to compare with it i hope youll never become grossly sensual but im not afraid of that the peril for you is that you live too much in the world of your own dreams youre not enough in contact with realitywith the toiling striving suffering i may even say sinning world that surrounds you youre too fastidious youve too many graceful illusions your newlyacquired thousands will shut you up more and more to the society of a few selfish and heartless people who will be interested in keeping them up  isabels eyes expanded as she gazed at this lurid scene what are my illusions she asked i try so hard not to have any  well said henrietta you think you can lead a romantic life that you can live by pleasing yourself and pleasing others youll find youre mistaken whatever life you lead you must put your soul in itto make any sort of success of it and from the moment you do that it ceases to be romance i assure you it becomes grim reality and you cant always please yourself you must sometimes please other people that i admit youre very ready to do but theres another thing thats still more importantyou must often displease others you must always be ready for thatyou must never shrink from it that doesnt suit you at allyoure too fond of admiration you like to be thought well of you think we can escape disagreeable duties by taking romantic viewsthats your great illusion my dear but we cant you must be prepared on many occasions in life to please no one at allnot even yourself  isabel shook her head sadly she looked troubled and frightened this for you henrietta she said must be one of those occasions  it was certainly true that miss stackpole during her visit to paris which had been professionally more remunerative than her english sojourn had not been living in the world of dreams mr bantling who had now returned to england was her companion for the first four weeks of her stay and about mr bantling there was nothing dreamy isabel learned from her friend that the two had led a life of great personal intimacy and that this had been a peculiar advantage to henrietta owing to the gentlemans remarkable knowledge of paris he had explained everything shown her everything been her constant guide and interpreter they had breakfasted together dined together gone to the theatre together supped together really in a manner quite lived together he was a true friend henrietta more than once assured our heroine and she had never supposed that she could like any englishman so well isabel could not have told you why but she found something that ministered to mirth in the alliance the correspondent of the interviewer had struck with lady pensils brother her amusement moreover subsisted in face of the fact that she thought it a credit to each of them isabel couldnt rid herself of a suspicion that they were playing somehow at crosspurposesthat the simplicity of each had been entrapped but this simplicity was on either side none the less honourable it was as graceful on henriettas part to believe that mr bantling took an interest in the diffusion of lively journalism and in consolidating the position of ladycorrespondents as it was on the part of his companion to suppose that the cause of the interviewera periodical of which he never formed a very definite conceptionwas if subtly analysed a task to which mr bantling felt himself quite equal but the cause of miss stackpoles need of demonstrative affection each of these groping celibates supplied at any rate a want of which the other was impatiently conscious mr bantling who was of rather a slow and a discursive habit relished a prompt keen positive woman who charmed him by the influence of a shining challenging eye and a kind of bandbox freshness and who kindled a perception of raciness in a mind to which the usual fare of life seemed unsalted henrietta on the other hand enjoyed the society of a gentleman who appeared somehow in his way made by expensive roundabout almost quaint processes for her use and whose leisured state though generally indefensible was a decided boon to a breathless mate and who was furnished with an easy traditional though by no means exhaustive answer to almost any social or practical question that could come up she often found mr bantlings answers very convenient and in the press of catching the american post would largely and showily address them to publicity it was to be feared that she was indeed drifting toward those abysses of sophistication as to which isabel wishing for a goodhumoured retort had warned her there might be danger in store for isabel but it was scarcely to be hoped that miss stackpole on her side would find permanent rest in any adoption of the views of a class pledged to all the old abuses isabel continued to warn her goodhumouredly lady pensils obliging brother was sometimes on our heroines lips an object of irreverent and facetious allusion nothing however could exceed henriettas amiability on this point she used to abound in the sense of isabels irony and to enumerate with elation the hours she had spent with this perfect man of the worlda term that had ceased to make with her as previously for opprobrium then a few moments later she would forget that they had been talking jocosely and would mention with impulsive earnestness some expedition she had enjoyed in his company she would say oh i know all about versailles i went there with mr bantling i was bound to see it thoroughlyi warned him when we went out there that i was thorough so we spent three days at the hotel and wandered all over the place it was lovely weathera kind of indian summer only not so good we just lived in that park oh yes you cant tell me anything about versailles henrietta appeared to have made arrangements to meet her gallant friend during the spring in italy    chapter xxi  mrs touchett before arriving in paris had fixed the day for her departure and by the middle of february had begun to travel southward she interrupted her journey to pay a visit to her son who at san remo on the italian shore of the mediterranean had been spending a dull bright winter beneath a slowmoving white umbrella isabel went with her aunt as a matter of course though mrs touchett with homely customary logic had laid before her a pair of alternatives  now of course youre completely your own mistress and are as free as the bird on the bough i dont mean you were not so before but youre at present on a different footingproperty erects a kind of barrier you can do a great many things if youre rich which would be severely criticised if you were poor you can go and come you can travel alone you can have your own establishment i mean of course if youll take a companionsome decayed gentlewoman with a darned cashmere and dyed hair who paints on velvet you dont think youd like that of course you can do as you please i only want you to understand how much youre at liberty you might take miss stackpole as your dame de compagnie shed keep people off very well i think however that its a great deal better you should remain with me in spite of there being no obligation its better for several reasons quite apart from your liking it i shouldnt think youd like it but i recommend you to make the sacrifice of course whatever novelty there may have been at first in my society has quite passed away and you see me as i ama dull obstinate narrowminded old woman  i dont think youre at all dull isabel had replied to this  but you do think im obstinate and narrowminded i told you so said mrs touchett with much elation at being justified  isabel remained for the present with her aunt because in spite of eccentric impulses she had a great regard for what was usually deemed decent and a young gentlewoman without visible relations had always struck her as a flower without foliage it was true that mrs touchetts conversation had never again appeared so brilliant as that first afternoon in albany when she sat in her damp waterproof and sketched the opportunities that europe would offer to a young person of taste this however was in a great measure the girls own fault she had got a glimpse of her aunts experience and her imagination constantly anticipated the judgements and emotions of a woman who had very little of the same faculty apart from this mrs touchett had a great merit she was as honest as a pair of compasses there was a comfort in her stiffness and firmness you knew exactly where to find her and were never liable to chance encounters and concussions on her own ground she was perfectly present but was never overinquisitive as regards the territory of her neighbour isabel came at last to have a kind of undemonstrable pity for her there seemed something so dreary in the condition of a person whose nature had as it were so little surfaceoffered so limited a face to the accretions of human contact nothing tender nothing sympathetic had ever had a chance to fasten upon itno windsown blossom no familiar softening moss her offered her passive extent in other words was about that of a knifeedge isabel had reason to believe none the less that as she advanced in life she made more of those concessions to the sense of something obscurely distinct from conveniencemore of them than she independently exacted she was learning to sacrifice consistency to considerations of that inferior order for which the excuse must be found in the particular case it was not to the credit of her absolute rectitude that she should have gone the longest way round to florence in order to spend a few weeks with her invalid son since in former years it had been one of her most definite convictions that when ralph wished to see her he was at liberty to remember that palazzo crescentini contained a large apartment known as the quarter of the signorino  i want to ask you something isabel said to this young man the day after her arrival at san remosomething ive thought more than once of asking you by letter but that ive hesitated on the whole to write about face to face nevertheless my question seems easy enough did you know your father intended to leave me so much money  ralph stretched his legs a little further than usual and gazed a little more fixedly at the mediterranean  what does it matter my dear isabel whether i knew my father was very obstinate  so said the girl you did know  yes he told me we even talked it over a little what did he do it for asked isabel abruptly why as a kind of compliment  a compliment on what  on your so beautifully existing  he liked me too much she presently declared  thats a way we all have  if i believed that i should be very unhappy fortunately i dont believe it i want to be treated with justice i want nothing but that  very good but you must remember that justice to a lovely being is after all a florid sort of sentiment  im not a lovely being how can you say that at the very moment when im asking such odious questions i must seem to you delicate  you seem to me troubled said ralph  i am troubled  about what  for a moment she answered nothing then she broke out do you think it good for me suddenly to be made so rich henrietta doesnt  oh hang henrietta said ralph coarsely if you ask me im delighted at it  is that why your father did itfor your amusement  i differ with miss stackpole ralph went on more gravely i think it very good for you to have means  isabel looked at him with serious eyes i wonder whether you know whats good for meor whether you care  if i know depend upon it i care shall i tell you what it is not to torment yourself  not to torment you i suppose you mean  you cant do that im proof take things more easily dont ask yourself so much whether this or that is good for you dont question your conscience so muchit will get out of tune like a strummed piano keep it for great occasions dont try so much to form your characterits like trying to pull open a tight tender young rose live as you like best and your character will take care of itself most things are good for you the exceptions are very rare and a comfortable incomes not one of them ralph paused smiling isabel had listened quickly youve too much power of thoughtabove all too much conscience ralph added its out of all reason the number of things you think wrong put back your watch diet your fever spread your wings rise above the ground its never wrong to do that  she had listened eagerly as i say and it was her nature to understand quickly i wonder if you appreciate what you say if you do you take a great responsibility  you frighten me a little but i think im right said ralph persisting in cheer  all the same what you say is very true isabel pursued you could say nothing more true im absorbed in myselfi look at life too much as a doctors prescription why indeed should we perpetually be thinking whether things are good for us as if we were patients lying in a hospital why should i be so afraid of not doing right as if it mattered to the world whether i do right or wrong  youre a capital person to advise said ralph you take the wind out of my sails  she looked at him as if she had not heard himthough she was following out the train of reflexion which he himself had kindled i try to care more about the world than about myselfbut i always come back to myself its because im afraid she stopped her voice had trembled a little yes im afraid i cant tell you a large fortune means freedom and im afraid of that its such a fine thing and one should make such a good use of it if one shouldnt one would be ashamed and one must keep thinking its a constant effort im not sure its not a greater happiness to be powerless  for weak people ive no doubt its a greater happiness for weak people the effort not to be contemptible must be great  and how do you know im not weak isabel asked  ah ralph answered with a flush that the girl noticed if you are im awfully sold  the charm of the mediterranean coast only deepened for our heroine on acquaintance for it was the threshold of italy the gate of admirations italy as yet imperfectly seen and felt stretched before her as a land of promise a land in which a love of the beautiful might be comforted by endless knowledge whenever she strolled upon the shore with her cousinand she was the companion of his daily walkshe looked across the sea with longing eyes to where she knew that genoa lay she was glad to pause however on the edge of this larger adventure there was such a thrill even in the preliminary hovering it affected her moreover as a peaceful interlude as a hush of the drum and fife in a career which she had little warrant as yet for regarding as agitated but which nevertheless she was constantly picturing to herself by the light of her hopes her fears her fancies her ambitions her predilections and which reflected these subjective accidents in a manner sufficiently dramatic madame merle had predicted to mrs touchett that after their young friend had put her hand into her pocket half a dozen times she would be reconciled to the idea that it had been filled by a munificent uncle and the event justified as it had so often justified before that ladys perspicacity ralph touchett had praised his cousin for being morally inflammable that is for being quick to take a hint that was meant as good advice his advice had perhaps helped the matter she had at any rate before leaving san remo grown used to feeling rich the consciousness in question found a proper place in rather a dense little group of ideas that she had about herself and often it was by no means the least agreeable it took perpetually for granted a thousand good intentions she lost herself in a maze of visions the fine things to be done by a rich independent generous girl who took a large human view of occasions and obligations were sublime in the mass her fortune therefore became to her mind a part of her better self it gave her importance gave her even to her own imagination a certain ideal beauty what it did for her in the imagination of others is another affair and on this point we must also touch in time the visions i have just spoken of were mixed with other debates isabel liked better to think of the future than of the past but at times as she listened to the murmur of the mediterranean waves her glance took a backward flight it rested upon two figures which in spite of increasing distance were still sufficiently salient they were recognisable without difficulty as those of caspar goodwood and lord warburton it was strange how quickly these images of energy had fallen into the background of our young ladys life it was in her disposition at all times to lose faith in the reality of absent things she could summon back her faith in case of need with an effort but the effort was often painful even when the reality had been pleasant the past was apt to look dead and its revival rather to show the livid light of a judgementday the girl moreover was not prone to take for granted that she herself lived in the mind of othersshe had not the fatuity to believe she left indelible traces she was capable of being wounded by the discovery that she had been forgotten but of all liberties the one she herself found sweetest was the liberty to forget she had not given her last shilling sentimentally speaking either to caspar goodwood or to lord warburton and yet couldnt but feel them appreciably in debt to her she had of course reminded herself that she was to hear from mr goodwood again but this was not to be for another year and a half and in that time a great many things might happen she had indeed failed to say to herself that her american suitor might find some other girl more comfortable to woo because though it was certain many other girls would prove so she had not the smallest belief that this merit would attract him but she reflected that she herself might know the humiliation of change might really for that matter come to the end of the things that were not caspar even though there appeared so many of them and find rest in those very elements of his presence which struck her now as impediments to the finer respiration it was conceivable that these impediments should some day prove a sort of blessing in disguisea clear and quiet harbour enclosed by a brave granite breakwater but that day could only come in its order and she couldnt wait for it with folded hands that lord warburton should continue to cherish her image seemed to her more than a noble humility or an enlightened pride ought to wish to reckon with she had so definitely undertaken to preserve no record of what had passed between them that a corresponding effort on his own part would be eminently just this was not as it may seem merely a theory tinged with sarcasm isabel candidly believed that his lordship would in the usual phrase get over his disappointment he had been deeply affectedthis she believed and she was still capable of deriving pleasure from the belief but it was absurd that a man both so intelligent and so honourably dealt with should cultivate a scar out of proportion to any wound englishmen liked moreover to be comfortable said isabel and there could be little comfort for lord warburton in the long run in brooding over a selfsufficient american girl who had been but a casual acquaintance she flattered herself that should she hear from one day to another that he had married some young woman of his own country who had done more to deserve him she should receive the news without a pang even of surprise it would have proved that he believed she was firmwhich was what she wished to seem to him that alone was grateful to her pride    chapter xxii  on one of the first days of may some six months after old mr touchetts death a small group that might have been described by a painter as composing well was gathered in one of the many rooms of an ancient villa crowning an olivemuffled hill outside of the roman gate of florence the villa was a long rather blanklooking structure with the farprojecting roof which tuscany loves and which on the hills that encircle florence when considered from a distance makes so harmonious a rectangle with the straight dark definite cypresses that usually rise in groups of three or four beside it the house had a front upon a little grassy empty rural piazza which occupied a part of the hilltop and this front pierced with a few windows in irregular relations and furnished with a stone bench lengthily adjusted to the base of the structure and useful as a loungingplace to one or two persons wearing more or less of that air of undervalued merit which in italy for some reason or other always gracefully invests any one who confidently assumes a perfectly passive attitudethis antique solid weatherworn yet imposing front had a somewhat incommunicative character it was the mask not the face of the house it had heavy lids but no eyes the house in reality looked another waylooked off behind into splendid openness and the range of the afternoon light in that quarter the villa overhung the slope of its hill and the long valley of the arno hazy with italian colour it had a narrow garden in the manner of a terrace productive chiefly of tangles of wild roses and other old stone benches mossy and sunwarmed the parapet of the terrace was just the height to lean upon and beneath it the ground declined into the vagueness of olivecrops and vineyards it is not however with the outside of the place that we are concerned on this bright morning of ripened spring its tenants had reason to prefer the shady side of the wall the windows of the groundfloor as you saw them from the piazza were in their noble proportions extremely architectural but their function seemed less to offer communication with the world than to defy the world to look in they were massively crossbarred and placed at such a height that curiosity even on tiptoe expired before it reached them in an apartment lighted by a row of three of these jealous aperturesone of the several distinct apartments into which the villa was divided and which were mainly occupied by foreigners of random race long resident in florencea gentleman was seated in company with a young girl and two good sisters from a religious house the room was however less sombre than our indications may have represented for it had a wide high door which now stood open into the tangled garden behind and the tall iron lattices admitted on occasion more than enough of the italian sunshine it was moreover a seat of ease indeed of luxury telling of arrangements subtly studied and refinements frankly proclaimed and containing a variety of those faded hangings of damask and tapestry those chests and cabinets of carved and timepolished oak those angular specimens of pictorial art in frames as pedantically primitive those perverselooking relics of medieval brass and pottery of which italy has long been the not quite exhausted storehouse these things kept terms with articles of modern furniture in which large allowance had been made for a lounging generation it was to be noticed that all the chairs were deep and well padded and that much space was occupied by a writingtable of which the ingenious perfection bore the stamp of london and the nineteenth century there were books in profusion and magazines and newspapers and a few small odd elaborate pictures chiefly in watercolour one of these productions stood on a drawingroom easel before which at the moment we begin to be concerned with her the young girl i have mentioned had placed herself she was looking at the picture in silence  silenceabsolute silencehad not fallen upon her companions but their talk had an appearance of embarrassed continuity the two good sisters had not settled themselves in their respective chairs their attitude expressed a final reserve and their faces showed the glaze of prudence they were plain ample mildfeatured women with a kind of businesslike modesty to which the impersonal aspect of their stiffened linen and of the serge that draped them as if nailed on frames gave an advantage one of them a person of a certain age in spectacles with a fresh complexion and a full cheek had a more discriminating manner than her colleague as well as the responsibility of their errand which apparently related to the young girl this object of interest wore her hatan ornament of extreme simplicity and not at variance with her plain muslin gown too short for her years though it must already have been let out the gentleman who might have been supposed to be entertaining the two nuns was perhaps conscious of the difficulties of his function it being in its way as arduous to converse with the very meek as with the very mighty at the same time he was clearly much occupied with their quiet charge and while she turned her back to him his eyes rested gravely on her slim small figure he was a man of forty with a high but wellshaped head on which the hair still dense but prematurely grizzled had been cropped close he had a fine narrow extremely modelled and composed face of which the only fault was just this effect of its running a trifle too much to points an appearance to which the shape of the beard contributed not a little this beard cut in the manner of the portraits of the sixteenth century and surmounted by a fair moustache of which the ends had a romantic upward flourish gave its wearer a foreign traditionary look and suggested that he was a gentleman who studied style his conscious curious eyes however eyes at once vague and penetrating intelligent and hard expressive of the observer as well as of the dreamer would have assured you that he studied it only within wellchosen limits and that in so far as he sought it he found it you would have been much at a loss to determine his original clime and country he had none of the superficial signs that usually render the answer to this question an insipidly easy one if he had english blood in his veins it had probably received some french or italian commixture but he suggested fine gold coin as he was no stamp nor emblem of the common mintage that provides for general circulation he was the elegant complicated medal struck off for a special occasion he had a light lean rather languidlooking figure and was apparently neither tall nor short he was dressed as a man dresses who takes little other trouble about it than to have no vulgar things  well my dear what do you think of it he asked of the young girl he used the italian tongue and used it with perfect ease but this would not have convinced you he was italian  the child turned her head earnestly to one side and the other its very pretty papa did you make it yourself  certainly i made it dont you think im clever  yes papa very clever i also have learned to make pictures and she turned round and showed a small fair face painted with a fixed and intensely sweet smile  you should have brought me a specimen of your powers  ive brought a great many theyre in my trunk  she draws veryvery carefully the elder of the nuns remarked speaking in french  im glad to hear it is it you who have instructed her  happily no said the good sister blushing a little ce nest pas ma partie i teach nothing i leave that to those who are wiser weve an excellent drawingmaster mrmrwhat is his name she asked of her companion  her companion looked about at the carpet its a german name she said in italian as if it needed to be translated  yes the other went on hes a german and weve had him many years  the young girl who was not heeding the conversation had wandered away to the open door of the large room and stood looking into the garden and you my sister are french said the gentleman  yes sir the visitor gently replied i speak to the pupils in my own tongue i know no other but we have sisters of other countriesenglish german irish they all speak their proper language  the gentleman gave a smile has my daughter been under the care of one of the irish ladies and then as he saw that his visitors suspected a joke though failing to understand it youre very complete he instantly added  oh yes were complete weve everything and everythings of the best  we have gymnastics the italian sister ventured to remark but not dangerous  i hope not is that your branch a question which provoked much candid hilarity on the part of the two ladies on the subsidence of which their entertainer glancing at his daughter remarked that she had grown  yes but i think she has finished shell remainnot big said the french sister  im not sorry i prefer women like booksvery good and not too long but i know the gentleman said no particular reason why my child should be short  the nun gave a temperate shrug as if to intimate that such things might be beyond our knowledge shes in very good health thats the best thing  yes she looks sound and the young girls father watched her a moment what do you see in the garden he asked in french  i see many flowers she replied in a sweet small voice and with an accent as good as his own  yes but not many good ones however such as they are go out and gather some for ces dames  the child turned to him with her smile heightened by pleasure may i truly  ah when i tell you said her father  the girl glanced at the elder of the nuns may i truly ma mere  obey monsieur your father my child said the sister blushing again  the child satisfied with this authorisation descended from the threshold and was presently lost to sight you dont spoil them said her father gaily  for everything they must ask leave thats our system leave is freely granted but they must ask it  oh i dont quarrel with your system ive no doubt its excellent i sent you my daughter to see what youd make of her i had faith  one must have faith the sister blandly rejoined gazing through her spectacles  well has my faith been rewarded what have you made of her  the sister dropped her eyes a moment a good christian monsieur  her host dropped his eyes as well but it was probable that the movement had in each case a different spring yes and what else  he watched the lady from the convent probably thinking she would say that a good christian was everything but for all her simplicity she was not so crude as that a charming young ladya real little womana daughter in whom you will have nothing but contentment  she seems to me very gentille said the father shes really pretty  shes perfect she has no faults  she never had any as a child and im glad you have given her none  we love her too much said the spectacled sister with dignity  and as for faults how can we give what we have not le couvent nest pas comme le monde monsieur shes our daughter as you may say weve had her since she was so small  of all those we shall lose this year shes the one we shall miss most the younger woman murmured deferentially  ah yes we shall talk long of her said the other we shall hold her up to the new ones and at this the good sister appeared to find her spectacles dim while her companion after fumbling a moment presently drew forth a pockethandkerchief of durable texture  its not certain youll lose her nothings settled yet their host rejoined quickly not as if to anticipate their tears but in the tone of a man saying what was most agreeable to himself we should be very happy to believe that fifteen is very young to leave us  oh exclaimed the gentleman with more vivacity than he had yet used it is not i who wish to take her away i wish you could keep her always  ah monsieur said the elder sister smiling and getting up good as she is shes made for the world le monde y gagnera  if all the good people were hidden away in convents how would the world get on her companion softly enquired rising also  this was a question of a wider bearing than the good woman apparently supposed and the lady in spectacles took a harmonising view by saying comfortably fortunately there are good people everywhere  if youre going there will be two less here her host remarked gallantly  for this extravagant sally his simple visitors had no answer and they simply looked at each other in decent deprecation but their confusion was speedily covered by the return of the young girl with two large bunches of rosesone of them all white the other red  i give you your choice mamman catherine said the child its only the colour thats different mamman justine there are just as many roses in one bunch as in the other  the two sisters turned to each other smiling and hesitating with which will you take and no its for you to choose  ill take the red thank you said catherine in the spectacles im so red myself theyll comfort us on our way back to rome  ah they wont last cried the young girl i wish i could give you something that would last  youve given us a good memory of yourself my daughter that will last  i wish nuns could wear pretty things i would give you my blue beads the child went on  and do you go back to rome tonight her father enquired  yes we take the train again weve so much to do labas  are you not tired  we are never tired  ah my sister sometimes murmured the junior votaress  not today at any rate we have rested too well here que dieu vows garde ma fine  their host while they exchanged kisses with his daughter went forward to open the door through which they were to pass but as he did so he gave a slight exclamation and stood looking beyond the door opened into a vaulted antechamber as high as a chapel and paved with red tiles and into this antechamber a lady had just been admitted by a servant a lad in shabby livery who was now ushering her toward the apartment in which our friends were grouped the gentleman at the door after dropping his exclamation remained silent in silence too the lady advanced he gave her no further audible greeting and offered her no hand but stood aside to let her pass into the saloon at the threshold she hesitated is there any one she asked  some one you may see  she went in and found herself confronted with the two nuns and their pupil who was coming forward between them with a hand in the arm of each at the sight of the new visitor they all paused and the lady who had also stopped stood looking at them the young girl gave a little soft cry ah madame merle  the visitor had been slightly startled but her manner the next instant was none the less gracious yes its madame merle come to welcome you home and she held out two hands to the girl who immediately came up to her presenting her forehead to be kissed madame merle saluted this portion of her charming little person and then stood smiling at the two nuns they acknowledged her smile with a decent obeisance but permitted themselves no direct scrutiny of this imposing brilliant woman who seemed to bring in with her something of the radiance of the outer world these ladies have brought my daughter home and now they return to the convent the gentleman explained  ah you go back to rome ive lately come from there its very lovely now said madame merle  the good sisters standing with their hands folded into their sleeves accepted this statement uncritically and the master of the house asked his new visitor how long it was since she had left rome she came to see me at the convent said the young girl before the lady addressed had time to reply  ive been more than once pansy madame merle declared am i not your great friend in rome  i remember the last time best said pansy because you told me i should come away  did you tell her that the childs father asked  i hardly remember i told her what i thought would please her ive been in florence a week i hoped you would come to see me  i should have done so if i had known you were there one doesnt know such things by inspirationthough i suppose one ought you had better sit down  these two speeches were made in a particular tone of voicea tone halflowered and carefully quiet but as from habit rather than from any definite need madame merle looked about her choosing her seat youre going to the door with these women let me of course not interrupt the ceremony je vous salue mesdames she added in french to the nuns as if to dismiss them  this ladys a great friend of ours you will have seen her at the convent said their entertainer weve much faith in her judgement and shell help me to decide whether my daughter shall return to you at the end of the holidays  i hope youll decide in our favour madame the sister in spectacles ventured to remark  thats mr osmonds pleasantry i decide nothing said madame merle but also as in pleasantry i believe youve a very good school but miss osmonds friends must remember that shes very naturally meant for the world  thats what ive told monsieur sister catherine answered its precisely to fit her for the world she murmured glancing at pansy who stood at a little distance attentive to madame merles elegant apparel  do you hear that pansy youre very naturally meant for the world said pansys father  the child fixed him an instant with her pure young eyes am i not meant for you papa  papa gave a quick light laugh that doesnt prevent it im of the world pansy  kindly permit us to retire said sister catherine be good and wise and happy in any case my daughter  i shall certainly come back and see you pansy returned recommencing her embraces which were presently interrupted by madame merle  stay with me dear child she said while your father takes the good ladies to the door  pansy stared disappointed yet not protesting she was evidently impregnated with the idea of submission which was due to any one who took the tone of authority and she was a passive spectator of the operation of her fate may i not see mamman catherine get into the carriage she nevertheless asked very gently  it would please me better if youd remain with me said madame merle while mr osmond and his companions who had bowed low again to the other visitor passed into the antechamber  oh yes ill stay pansy answered and she stood near madame merle surrendering her little hand which this lady took she stared out of the window her eyes had filled with tears  im glad theyve taught you to obey said madame merle thats what good little girls should do  oh yes i obey very well cried pansy with soft eagerness almost with boastfulness as if she had been speaking of her pianoplaying and then she gave a faint just audible sigh  madame merle holding her hand drew it across her own fine palm and looked at it the gaze was critical but it found nothing to deprecate the childs small hand was delicate and fair i hope they always see that you wear gloves she said in a moment little girls usually dislike them  i used to dislike them but i like them now the child made answer  very good ill make you a present of a dozen  i thank you very much what colours will they be pansy demanded with interest  madame merle meditated useful colours  but very pretty  are you very fond of pretty things  yes butbut not too fond said pansy with a trace of asceticism  well they wont be too pretty madame merle returned with a laugh she took the childs other hand and drew her nearer after which looking at her a moment shall you miss mother catherine she went on  yeswhen i think of her  try then not to think of her perhaps some day added madame merle youll have another mother  i dont think thats necessary pansy said repeating her little soft conciliatory sigh i had more than thirty mothers at the convent  her fathers step sounded again in the antechamber and madame merle got up releasing the child mr osmond came in and closed the door then without looking at madame merle he pushed one or two chairs back into their places his visitor waited a moment for him to speak watching him as he moved about then at last she said i hoped youd have come to rome i thought it possible youd have wished yourself to fetch pansy away  that was a natural supposition but im afraid its not the first time ive acted in defiance of your calculations  yes said madame merle i think you very perverse  mr osmond busied himself for a moment in the roomthere was plenty of space in it to move aboutin the fashion of a man mechanically seeking pretexts for not giving an attention which may be embarrassing presently however he had exhausted his pretexts there was nothing left for himunless he took up a bookbut to stand with his hands behind him looking at pansy why didnt you come and see the last of mamman catherine he asked of her abruptly in french  pansy hesitated a moment glancing at madame merle i asked her to stay with me said this lady who had seated herself again in another place  ah that was better osmond conceded with which he dropped into a chair and sat looking at madame merle bent forward a little his elbows on the edge of the arms and his hands interlocked  shes going to give me some gloves said pansy  you neednt tell that to every one my dear madame merle observed  youre very kind to her said osmond shes supposed to have everything she needs  i should think she had had enough of the nuns  if were going to discuss that matter she had better go out of the room  let her stay said madame merle well talk of something else  if you like i wont listen pansy suggested with an appearance of candour which imposed conviction  you may listen charming child because you wont understand her father replied the child sat down deferentially near the open door within sight of the garden into which she directed her innocent wistful eyes and mr osmond went on irrelevantly addressing himself to his other companion youre looking particularly well  i think i always look the same said madame merle  you always are the same you dont vary youre a wonderful woman  yes i think i am  you sometimes change your mind however you told me on your return from england that you wouldnt leave rome again for the present  im pleased that you remember so well what i say that was my intention but ive come to florence to meet some friends who have lately arrived and as to whose movements i was at that time uncertain  that reasons characteristic youre always doing something for your friends  madame merle smiled straight at her host its less characteristic than your comment upon it which is perfectly insincere i dont however make a crime of that she added because if you dont believe what you say theres no reason why you should i dont ruin myself for my friends i dont deserve your praise i care greatly for myself  exactly but yourself includes so many other selvesso much of every one else and of everything i never knew a person whose life touched so many other lives  what do you call ones life asked madame merle ones appearance ones movements ones engagements ones society  i call your life your ambitions said osmond  madame merle looked a moment at pansy i wonder if she understands that she murmured  you see she cant stay with us and pansys father gave rather a joyless smile go into the garden mignonne and pluck a flower or two for madame merle he went on in french  thats just what i wanted to do pansy exclaimed rising with promptness and noiselessly departing her father followed her to the open door stood a moment watching her and then came back but remained standing or rather strolling to and fro as if to cultivate a sense of freedom which in another attitude might be wanting  my ambitions are principally for you said madame merle looking up at him with a certain courage  that comes back to what i say im part of your lifei and a thousand others youre not selfishi cant admit that if you were selfish what should i be what epithet would properly describe me  youre indolent for me thats your worst fault  im afraid its really my best  you dont care said madame merle gravely  no i dont think i care much what sort of a fault do you call that my indolence at any rate was one of the reasons i didnt go to rome but it was only one of them  its not of importanceto me at leastthat you didnt go though i should have been glad to see you im glad youre not in rome nowwhich you might be would probably be if you had gone there a month ago theres something i should like you to do at present in florence  please remember my indolence said osmond  i do remember it but i beg you to forget it in that way youll have both the virtue and the reward this is not a great labour and it may prove a real interest how long is it since you made a new acquaintance  i dont think ive made any since i made yours  its time then you should make another theres a friend of mine i want you to know  mr osmond in his walk had gone back to the open door again and was looking at his daughter as she moved about in the intense sunshine what good will it do me he asked with a sort of genial crudity  madame merle waited it will amuse you there was nothing crude in this rejoinder it had been thoroughly well considered  if you say that you know i believe it said osmond coming toward her there are some points in which my confidence in you is complete im perfectly aware for instance that you know good society from bad  society is all bad  pardon me that isntthe knowledge i impute to youa common sort of wisdom youve gained it in the right wayexperimentally youve compared an immense number of more or less impossible people with each other  well i invite you to profit by my knowledge  to profit are you very sure that i shall  its what i hope it will depend on yourself if i could only induce you to make an effort  ah there you are i knew something tiresome was coming what in the worldthats likely to turn up hereis worth an effort  madame merle flushed as with a wounded intention dont be foolish osmond no one knows better than you what is worth an effort havent i seen you in old days  i recognise some things but theyre none of them probable in this poor life  its the effort that makes them probable said madame merle  theres something in that who then is your friend  the person i came to florence to see shes a niece of mrs touchett whom youll not have forgotten  a niece the word niece suggests youth and ignorance i see what youre coming to  yes shes youngtwentythree years old shes a great friend of mine i met her for the first time in england several months ago and we struck up a grand alliance i like her immensely and i do what i dont do every dayi admire her youll do the same  not if i can help it  precisely but you wont be able to help it  is she beautiful clever rich splendid universally intelligent and unprecedentedly virtuous its only on those conditions that i care to make her acquaintance you know i asked you some time ago never to speak to me of a creature who shouldnt correspond to that description i know plenty of dingy people i dont want to know any more  miss archer isnt dingy shes as bright as the morning she corresponds to your description its for that i wish you to know her she fills all your requirements  more or less of course  no quite literally shes beautiful accomplished generous and for an american wellborn shes also very clever and very amiable and she has a handsome fortune  mr osmond listened to this in silence appearing to turn it over in his mind with his eyes on his informant what do you want to do with her he asked at last  what you see put her in your way  isnt she meant for something better than that  i dont pretend to know what people are meant for said madame merle i only know what i can do with them  im sorry for miss archer osmond declared  madame merle got up if thats a beginning of interest in her i take note of it  the two stood there face to face she settled her mantilla looking down at it as she did so youre looking very well osmond repeated still less relevantly than before you have some idea youre never so well as when youve got an idea theyre always becoming to you  in the manner and tone of these two persons on first meeting at any juncture and especially when they met in the presence of others was something indirect and circumspect as if they had approached each other obliquely and addressed each other by implication the effect of each appeared to be to intensify to an appreciable degree the selfconsciousness of the other madame merle of course carried off any embarrassment better than her friend but even madame merle had not on this occasion the form she would have liked to havethe perfect selfpossession she would have wished to wear for her host the point to be made is however that at a certain moment the element between them whatever it was always levelled itself and left them more closely face to face than either ever was with any one else this was what had happened now they stood there knowing each other well and each on the whole willing to accept the satisfaction of knowing as a compensation for the inconveniencewhatever it might beof being known i wish very much you were not so heartless madame merle quietly said it has always been against you and it will be against you now  im not so heartless as you think every now and then something touches meas for instance your saying just now that your ambitions are for me i dont understand it i dont see how or why they should be but it touches me all the same  youll probably understand it even less as time goes on there are some things youll never understand theres no particular need you should  you after all are the most remarkable of women said osmond you have more in you than almost any one i dont see why you think mrs touchetts niece should matter very much to me whenwhen but he paused a moment  when i myself have mattered so little  that of course is not what i meant to say when ive known and appreciated such a woman as you  isabel archers better than i said madame merle  her companion gave a laugh how little you must think of her to say that  do you suppose im capable of jealousy please answer me that  with regard to me no on the whole i dont  come and see me then two days hence im staying at mrs touchettspalazzo crescentiniand the girl will be there  why didnt you ask me that at first simply without speaking of the girl said osmond you could have had her there at any rate  madame merle looked at him in the manner of a woman whom no question he could ever put would find unprepared do you wish to know why because ive spoken of you to her  osmond frowned and turned away id rather not know that then in a moment he pointed out the easel supporting the little watercolour drawing have you seen whats theremy last  madame merle drew near and considered is it the venetian alpsone of your last years sketches  yesbut how you guess everything  she looked a moment longer then turned away you know i dont care for your drawings  i know it yet im always surprised at it theyre really so much better than most peoples  that may very well be but as the only thing you dowell its so little i should have liked you to do so many other things those were my ambitions  yes youve told me many timesthings that were impossible  things that were impossible said madame merle and then in quite a different tone in itself your little pictures very good she looked about the roomat the old cabinets pictures tapestries surfaces of faded silk your rooms at least are perfect im struck with that afresh whenever i come back i know none better anywhere you understand this sort of thing as nobody anywhere does youve such adorable taste  im sick of my adorable taste said gilbert osmond  you must nevertheless let miss archer come and see it ive told her about it  i dont object to showing my thingswhen people are not idiots  you do it delightfully as cicerone of your museum you appear to particular advantage  mr osmond in return for this compliment simply looked at once colder and more attentive did you say she was rich  she has seventy thousand pounds  en ecus bien comptes  theres no doubt whatever about her fortune ive seen it as i may say  satisfactory womani mean you and if i go to see her shall i see the mother  the mother she has nonenor father either  the aunt thenwhom did you saymrs touchett i can easily keep her out of the way  i dont object to her said osmond i rather like mrs touchett she has a sort of oldfashioned character thats passing awaya vivid identity but that long jackanapes the sonis he about the place  hes there but he wont trouble you  hes a good deal of a donkey  i think youre mistaken hes a very clever man but hes not fond of being about when im there because he doesnt like me  what could he be more asinine than that did you say she has looks osmond went on  yes but i wont say it again lest you should be disappointed in them come and make a beginning thats all i ask of you  a beginning of what  madame merle was silent a little i want you of course to marry her  the beginning of the end well ill see for myself have you told her that  for what do you take me shes not so coarse a piece of machinerynor am i  really said osmond after some meditation i dont understand your ambitions  i think youll understand this one after youve seen miss archer suspend your judgement madame merle as she spoke had drawn near the open door of the garden where she stood a moment looking out pansy has really grown pretty she presently added  so it seemed to me  but she has had enough of the convent  i dont know said osmond i like what theyve made of her its very charming  thats not the convent its the childs nature  its the combination i think shes as pure as a pearl  why doesnt she come back with my flowers then madame merle asked shes not in a hurry  well go and get them  she doesnt like me the visitor murmured as she raised her parasol and they passed into the garden    chapter xxiii  madame merle who had come to florence on mrs touchetts arrival at the invitation of this ladymrs touchett offering her for a month the hospitality of palazzo crescentinithe judicious madame merle spoke to isabel afresh about gilbert osmond and expressed the hope she might know him making however no such point of the matter as we have seen her do in recommending the girl herself to mr osmonds attention the reason of this was perhaps that isabel offered no resistance whatever to madame merles proposal in italy as in england the lady had a multitude of friends both among the natives of the country and its heterogeneous visitors she had mentioned to isabel most of the people the girl would find it well to meetof course she said isabel could know whomever in the wide world she wouldand had placed mr osmond near the top of the list he was an old friend of her own she had known him these dozen years he was one of the cleverest and most agreeable menwell in europe simply he was altogether above the respectable average quite another affair he wasnt a professional charmerfar from it and the effect he produced depended a good deal on the state of his nerves and his spirits when not in the right mood he could fall as low as any one saved only by his looking at such hours rather like a demoralised prince in exile but if he cared or was interested or rightly challengedjust exactly rightly it had to bethen one felt his cleverness and his distinction those qualities didnt depend in him as in so many people on his not committing or exposing himself he had his perversitieswhich indeed isabel would find to be the case with all the men really worth knowingand didnt cause his light to shine equally for all persons madame merle however thought she could undertake that for isabel he would be brilliant he was easily bored too easily and dull people always put him out but a quick and cultivated girl like isabel would give him a stimulus which was too absent from his life at any rate he was a person not to miss one shouldnt attempt to live in italy without making a friend of gilbert osmond who knew more about the country than any one except two or three german professors and if they had more knowledge than he it was he who had most perception and tastebeing artistic through and through isabel remembered that her friend had spoken of him during their plunge at gardencourt into the deeps of talk and wondered a little what was the nature of the tie binding these superior spirits she felt that madame merles ties always somehow had histories and such an impression was part of the interest created by this inordinate woman as regards her relations with mr osmond however she hinted at nothing but a longestablished calm friendship isabel said she should be happy to know a person who had enjoyed so high a confidence for so many years you ought to see a great many men madame merle remarked you ought to see as many as possible so as to get used to them  used to them isabel repeated with that solemn stare which sometimes seemed to proclaim her deficient in the sense of comedy why im not afraid of themim as used to them as the cook to the butcherboys  used to them i mean so as to despise them thats what one comes to with most of them youll pick out for your society the few whom you dont despise  this was a note of cynicism that madame merle didnt often allow herself to sound but isabel was not alarmed for she had never supposed that as one saw more of the world the sentiment of respect became the most active of ones emotions it was excited none the less by the beautiful city of florence which pleased her not less than madame merle had promised and if her unassisted perception had not been able to gauge its charms she had clever companions as priests to the mystery she wasin no want indeed of esthetic illumination for ralph found it a joy that renewed his own early passion to act as cicerone to his eager young kinswoman madame merle remained at home she had seen the treasures of florence again and again and had always something else to do but she talked of all things with remarkable vividness of memoryshe recalled the righthand corner of the large perugino and the position of the hands of the saint elizabeth in the picture next to it she had her opinions as to the character of many famous works of art differing often from ralph with great sharpness and defending her interpretations with as much ingenuity as goodhumour isabel listened to the discussions taking place between the two with a sense that she might derive much benefit from them and that they were among the advantages she couldnt have enjoyed for instance in albany in the clear may mornings before the formal breakfastthis repast at mrs touchetts was served at twelve oclockshe wandered with her cousin through the narrow and sombre florentine streets resting a while in the thicker dusk of some historic church or the vaulted chambers of some dispeopled convent she went to the galleries and palaces she looked at the pictures and statues that had hitherto been great names to her and exchanged for a knowledge which was sometimes a limitation a presentiment which proved usually to have been a blank she performed all those acts of mental prostration in which on a first visit to italy youth and enthusiasm so freely indulge she felt her heart beat in the presence of immortal genius and knew the sweetness of rising tears in eyes to which faded fresco and darkened marble grew dim but the return every day was even pleasanter than the going forth the return into the wide monumental court of the great house in which mrs touchett many years before had established herself and into the high cool rooms where the carven rafters and pompous frescoes of the sixteenth century looked down on the familiar commodities of the age of advertisement mrs touchett inhabited an historic building in a narrow street whose very name recalled the strife of medieval factions and found compensation for the darkness of her frontage in the modicity of her rent and the brightness of a garden where nature itself looked as archaic as the rugged architecture of the palace and which cleared and scented the rooms in regular use to live in such a place was for isabel to hold to her ear all day a shell of the sea of the past this vague eternal rumour kept her imagination awake  gilbert osmond came to see madame merle who presented him to the young lady lurking at the other side of the room isabel took on this occasion little part in the talk she scarcely even smiled when the others turned to her invitingly she sat there as if she had been at the play and had paid even a large sum for her place mrs touchett was not present and these two had it for the effect of brilliancy all their own way they talked of the florentine the roman the cosmopolite world and might have been distinguished performers figuring for a charity it all had the rich readiness that would have come from rehearsal madame merle appealed to her as if she had been on the stage but she could ignore any learnt cue without spoiling the scenethough of course she thus put dreadfully in the wrong the friend who had told mr osmond she could be depended on this was no matter for once even if more had been involved she could have made no attempt to shine there was something in the visitor that checked her and held her in suspensemade it more important she should get an impression of him than that she should produce one herself besides she had little skill in producing an impression which she knew to be expected nothing could be happier in general than to seem dazzling but she had a perverse unwillingness to glitter by arrangement mr osmond to do him justice had a wellbred air of expecting nothing a quiet ease that covered everything even the first show of his own wit this was the more grateful as his face his head was sensitive he was not handsome but he was fine as fine as one of the drawings in the long gallery above the bridge of the uffizi and his very voice was finethe more strangely that with its clearness it yet somehow wasnt sweet this had had really to do with making her abstain from interference his utterance was the vibration of glass and if she had put out her finger she might have changed the pitch and spoiled the concert yet before he went she had to speak  madame merle he said consents to come up to my hilltop some day next week and drink tea in my garden it would give me much pleasure if you would come with her its thought rather prettytheres what they call a general view my daughter too would be so glador rather for shes too young to have strong emotions i should be so gladso very glad and mr osmond paused with a slight air of embarrassment leaving his sentence unfinished i should be so happy if you could know my daughter he went on a moment afterwards  isabel replied that she should be delighted to see miss osmond and that if madame merle would show her the way to the hilltop she should be very grateful upon this assurance the visitor took his leave after which isabel fully expected her friend would scold her for having been so stupid but to her surprise that lady who indeed never fell into the mere matterofcourse said to her in a few moments  you were charming my dear you were just as one would have wished you youre never disappointing  a rebuke might possibly have been irritating though it is much more probable that isabel would have taken it in good part but strange to say the words that madame merle actually used caused her the first feeling of displeasure she had known this ally to excite thats more than i intended she answered coldly im under no obligation that i know of to charm mr osmond  madame merle perceptibly flushed but we know it was not her habit to retract my dear child i didnt speak for him poor man i spoke for yourself its not of course a question as to his liking you it matters little whether he likes you or not but i thought you liked him  i did said isabel honestly but i dont see what that matters either  everything that concerns you matters to me madame merle returned with her weary nobleness especially when at the same time another old friends concerned  whatever isabels obligations may have been to mr osmond it must be admitted that she found them sufficient to lead her to put to ralph sundry questions about him she thought ralphs judgements distorted by his trials but she flattered herself she had learned to make allowance for that  do i know him said her cousin oh yes i know him not well but on the whole enough ive never cultivated his society and he apparently has never found mine indispensable to his happiness who is he what is he hes a vague unexplained american who has been living these thirty years or less in italy why do i call him unexplained only as a cover for my ignorance i dont know his antecedents his family his origin for all i do know he may be a prince in disguise he rather looks like one by the waylike a prince who has abdicated in a fit of fastidiousness and has been in a state of disgust ever since he used to live in rome but of late years he has taken up his abode here i remember hearing him say that rome has grown vulgar he has a great dread of vulgarity thats his special line he hasnt any other that i know of he lives on his income which i suspect of not being vulgarly large hes a poor but honest gentleman thats what he calls himself he married young and lost his wife and i believe he has a daughter he also has a sister whos married to some small count or other of these parts i remember meeting her of old shes nicer than he i should think but rather impossible i remember there used to be some stories about her i dont think i recommend you to know her but why dont you ask madame merle about these people she knows them all much better than i  i ask you because i want your opinion as well as hers said isabel  a fig for my opinion if you fall in love with mr osmond what will you care for that  not much probably but meanwhile it has a certain importance the more information one has about ones dangers the better  i dont agree to thatit may make them dangers we know too much about people in these days we hear too much our ears our minds our mouths are stuffed with personalities dont mind anything any one tells you about any one else judge everyone and everything for yourself  thats what i try to do said isabel but when you do that people call you conceited  youre not to mind themthats precisely my argument not to mind what they say about yourself any more than what they say about your friend or your enemy  isabel considered i think youre right but there are some things i cant help minding for instance when my friends attacked or when i myself am praised  of course youre always at liberty to judge the critic judge people as critics however ralph added and youll condemn them all  i shall see mr osmond for myself said isabel ive promised to pay him a visit  to pay him a visit  to go and see his view his pictures his daughteri dont know exactly what madame merles to take me she tells me a great many ladies call on him  ah with madame merle you may go anywhere de confiance said ralph she knows none but the best people  isabel said no more about mr osmond but she presently remarked to her cousin that she was not satisfied with his tone about madame merle it seems to me you insinuate things about her i dont know what you mean but if youve any grounds for disliking her i think you should either mention them frankly or else say nothing at all  ralph however resented this charge with more apparent earnestness than he commonly used i speak of madame merle exactly as i speak to her with an even exaggerated respect  exaggerated precisely thats what i complain of  i do so because madame merles merits are exaggerated  by whom pray by me if so i do her a poor service  no no by herself  ah i protest isabel earnestly cried if ever there was a woman who made small claims  you put your finger on it ralph interrupted her modestys exaggerated she has no business with small claimsshe has a perfect right to make large ones  her merits are large then you contradict yourself  her merits are immense said ralph shes indescribably blameless a pathless desert of virtue the only woman i know who never gives one a chance  a chance for what  well say to call her a fool shes the only woman i know who has but that one little fault  isabel turned away with impatience i dont understand you youre too paradoxical for my plain mind  let me explain when i say she exaggerates i dont mean it in the vulgar sensethat she boasts overstates gives too fine an account of herself i mean literally that she pushes the search for perfection too farthat her merits are in themselves overstrained shes too good too kind too clever too learned too accomplished too everything shes too complete in a word i confess to you that she acts on my nerves and that i feel about her a good deal as that intensely human athenian felt about aristides the just  isabel looked hard at her cousin but the mocking spirit if it lurked in his words failed on this occasion to peep from his face do you wish madame merle to be banished  by no means shes much too good company i delight in madame merle said ralph touchett simply  youre very odious sir isabel exclaimed and then she asked him if he knew anything that was not to the honour of her brilliant friend  nothing whatever dont you see thats just what i mean on the character of every one else you may find some little black speck if i were to take half an hour to it some day ive no doubt i should be able to find one on yours for my own of course im spotted like a leopard but on madame merles nothing nothing nothing  thats just what i think said isabel with a toss of her head that is why i like her so much  shes a capital person for you to know since you wish to see the world you couldnt have a better guide  i suppose you mean by that that shes worldly  worldly no said ralph shes the great round world itself  it had certainly not as isabel for the moment took it into her head to believe been a refinement of malice in him to say that he delighted in madame merle ralph touchett took his refreshment wherever he could find it and he would not have forgiven himself if he had been left wholly unbeguiled by such a mistress of the social art there are deeplying sympathies and antipathies and it may have been that in spite of the administered justice she enjoyed at his hands her absence from his mothers house would not have made life barren to him but ralph touchett had learned more or less inscrutably to attend and there could have been nothing so sustained to attend to as the general performance of madame merle he tasted her in sips he let her stand with an opportuneness she herself could not have surpassed there were moments when he felt almost sorry for her and these oddly enough were the moments when his kindness was least demonstrative he was sure she had been yearningly ambitious and that what she had visibly accomplished was far below her secret measure she had got herself into perfect training but had won none of the prizes she was always plain madame merle the widow of a swiss negociant with a small income and a large acquaintance who stayed with people a great deal and was almost as universally liked as some new volume of smooth twaddle the contrast between this position and any one of some halfdozen others that he supposed to have at various moments engaged her hope had an element of the tragical his mother thought he got on beautifully with their genial guest to mrs touchetts sense two persons who dealt so largely in tooingenious theories of conductthat is of their ownwould have much in common he had given due consideration to isabels intimacy with her eminent friend having long since made up his mind that he could not without opposition keep his cousin to himself and he made the best of it as he had done of worse things he believed it would take care of itself it wouldnt last forever neither of these two superior persons knew the other as well as she supposed and when each had made an important discovery or two there would be if not a rupture at least a relaxation meanwhile he was quite willing to admit that the conversation of the elder lady was an advantage to the younger who had a great deal to learn and would doubtless learn it better from madame merle than from some other instructors of the young it was not probable that isabel would be injured     chapter xxiv  it would certainly have been hard to see what injury could arise to her from the visit she presently paid to mr osmonds hilltop nothing could have been more charming than this occasiona soft afternoon in the full maturity of the tuscan spring the companions drove out of the roman gate beneath the enormous blank superstructure which crowns the fine clear arch of that portal and makes it nakedly impressive and wound between highwalled lanes into which the wealth of blossoming orchards overdrooped and flung a fragrance until they reached the small superurban piazza of crooked shape where the long brown wall of the villa occupied in part by mr osmond formed a principal or at least a very imposing object isabel went with her friend through a wide high court where a clear shadow rested below and a pair of lightarched galleries facing each other above caught the upper sunshine upon their slim columns and the flowering plants in which they were dressed there was something grave and strong in the place it looked somehow as if once you were in you would need an act of energy to get out for isabel however there was of course as yet no thought of getting out but only of advancing mr osmond met her in the cold antechamberit was cold even in the month of mayand ushered her with her conductress into the apartment to which we have already been introduced madame merle was in front and while isabel lingered a little talking with him she went forward familiarly and greeted two persons who were seated in the saloon one of these was little pansy on whom she bestowed a kiss the other was a lady whom mr osmond indicated to isabel as his sister the countess gemini and thats my little girl he said who has just come out of her convent  pansy had on a scant white dress and her fair hair was neatly arranged in a net she wore her small shoes tied sandalfashion about her ankles she made isabel a little conventual curtsey and then came to be kissed the countess gemini simply nodded without getting up isabel could see she was a woman of high fashion she was thin and dark and not at all pretty having features that suggested some tropical birda long beaklike nose small quicklymoving eyes and a mouth and chin that receded extremely her expression however thanks to various intensities of emphasis and wonder of horror and joy was not inhuman and as regards her appearance it was plain she understood herself and made the most of her points her attire voluminous and delicate bristling with elegance had the look of shimmering plumage and her attitudes were as light and sudden as those of a creature who perched upon twigs she had a great deal of manner isabel who had never known any one with so much manner immediately classed her as the most affected of women she remembered that ralph had not recommended her as an acquaintance but she was ready to acknowledge that to a casual view the countess gemini revealed no depths her demonstrations suggested the violent waving of some flag of general trucewhite silk with fluttering streamers  youll believe im glad to see you when i tell you its only because i knew you were to be here that i came myself i dont come and see my brotheri make him come and see me this hill of his is impossiblei dont see what possesses him really osmond youll be the ruin of my horses some day and if it hurts them youll have to give me another pair i heard them wheezing today i assure you i did its very disagreeable to hear ones horses wheezing when ones sitting in the carriage it sounds too as if they werent what they should be but ive always had good horses whatever else i may have lacked ive always managed that my husband doesnt know much but i think he knows a horse in general italians dont but my husband goes in according to his poor light for everything english my horses are englishso its all the greater pity they should be ruined i must tell you she went on directly addressing isabel that osmond doesnt often invite me i dont think he likes to have me it was quite my own idea coming today i like to see new people and im sure youre very new but dont sit there that chairs not what it looks there are some very good seats here but there are also some horrors  these remarks were delivered with a series of little jerks and pecks of roulades of shrillness and in an accent that was as some fond recall of good english or rather of good american in adversity  i dont like to have you my dear said her brother im sure youre invaluable  i dont see any horrors anywhere isabel returned looking about her everything seems to me beautiful and precious  ive a few good things mr osmond allowed indeed ive nothing very bad but ive not what i should have liked  he stood there a little awkwardly smiling and glancing about his manner was an odd mixture of the detached and the involved he seemed to hint that nothing but the right values was of any consequence isabel made a rapid induction perfect simplicity was not the badge of his family even the little girl from the convent who in her prim white dress with her small submissive face and her hands locked before her stood there as if she were about to partake of her first communion even mr osmonds diminutive daughter had a kind of finish that was not entirely artless  youd have liked a few things from the uffzi and the pittithats what youd have liked said madame merle  poor osmond with his old curtains and crucifixes the countess gemini exclaimed she appeared to call her brother only by his familyname her ejaculation had no particular object she smiled at isabel as she made it and looked at her from head to foot  her brother had not heard her he seemed to be thinking what he could say to isabel wont you have some teayou must be very tired he at last bethought himself of remarking  no indeed im not tired what have i done to tire me isabel felt a certain need of being very direct of pretending to nothing there was something in the air in her general impression of thingsshe could hardly have said what it wasthat deprived her of all disposition to put herself forward the place the occasion the combination of people signified more than lay on the surface she would try to understandshe would not simply utter graceful platitudes poor isabel was doubtless not aware that many women would have uttered graceful platitudes to cover the working of their observation it must be confessed that her pride was a trifle alarmed a man she had heard spoken of in terms that excited interest and who was evidently capable of distinguishing himself had invited her a young lady not lavish of her favours to come to his house now that she had done so the burden of the entertainment rested naturally on his wit isabel was not rendered less observant and for the moment we judge she was not rendered more indulgent by perceiving that mr osmond carried his burden less complacently than might have been expected what a fool i was to have let myself so needlessly in she could fancy his exclaiming to himself  youll be tired when you go home if he shows you all his bibelots and gives you a lecture on each said the countess gemini  im not afraid of that but if im tired i shall at least have learned something  very little i suspect but my sisters dreadfully afraid of learning anything said mr osmond  oh i confess to that i dont want to know anything morei know too much already the more you know the more unhappy you are  you should not undervalue knowledge before pansy who has not finished her education madame merle interposed with a smile pansy will never know any harm said the childs father pansys a little conventflower  oh the convents the convents cried the countess with a flutter of her ruffles speak to me of the convents you may learn anything there im a conventflower myself i dont pretend to be good but the nuns do dont you see what i mean she went on appealing to isabel  isabel was not sure she saw and she answered that she was very bad at following arguments the countess then declared that she herself detested arguments but that this was her brothers tastehe would always discuss for me she said one should like a thing or one shouldnt one cant like everything of course but one shouldnt attempt to reason it outyou never know where it may lead you there are some very good feelings that may have bad reasons dont you know and then there are very bad feelings sometimes that have good reasons dont you see what i mean i dont care anything about reasons but i know what i like  ah thats the great thing said isabel smiling and suspecting that her acquaintance with this lightly flitting personage would not lead to intellectual repose if the countess objected to argument isabel at this moment had as little taste for it and she put out her hand to pansy with a pleasant sense that such a gesture committed her to nothing that would admit of a divergence of views gilbert osmond apparently took a rather hopeless view of his sisters tone he turned the conversation to another topic he presently sat down on the other side of his daughter who had shyly brushed isabels fingers with her own but he ended by drawing her out of her chair and making her stand between his knees leaning against him while he passed his arm round her slimness the child fixed her eyes on isabel with a still disinterested gaze which seemed void of an intention yet conscious of an attraction mr osmond talked of many things madame merle had said he could be agreeable when he chose and today after a little he appeared not only to have chosen but to have determined madame merle and the countess gemini sat a little apart conversing in the effortless manner of persons who knew each other well enough to take their ease but every now and then isabel heard the countess at something said by her companion plunge into the latters lucidity as a poodle splashes after a thrown stick it was as if madame merle were seeing how far she would go mr osmond talked of florence of italy of the pleasure of living in that country and of the abatements to the pleasure there were both satisfactions and drawbacks the drawbacks were numerous strangers were too apt to see such a world as all romantic it met the case soothingly for the human for the social failureby which he meant the people who couldnt realise as they said on their sensibility they could keep it about them there in their poverty without ridicule as you might keep an heirloom or an inconvenient entailed place that brought you in nothing thus there were advantages in living in the country which contained the greatest sum of beauty certain impressions you could get only there others favourable to life you never got and you got some that were very bad but from time to time you got one of a quality that made up for everything italy all the same had spoiled a great many people he was even fatuous enough to believe at times that he himself might have been a better man if he had spent less of his life there it made one idle and dilettantish and secondrate it had no discipline for the character didnt cultivate in you otherwise expressed the successful social and other cheek that flourished in paris and london were sweetly provincial said mr osmond and im perfectly aware that i myself am as rusty as a key that has no lock to fit it it polishes me up a little to talk with younot that i venture to pretend i can turn that very complicated lock i suspect your intellect of being but youll be going away before ive seen you three times and i shall perhaps never see you after that thats what it is to live in a country that people come to when theyre disagreeable here its bad enough when theyre agreeable its still worse as soon as you like them theyre off again ive been deceived too often ive ceased to form attachments to permit myself to feel attractions you mean to stayto settle that would be really comfortable ah yes your aunts a sort of guarantee i believe she may be depended on oh shes an old florentine i mean literally an old one not a modern outsider shes a contemporary of the medici she must have been present at the burning of savonarola and im not sure she didnt throw a handful of chips into the flame her face is very much like some faces in the early pictures little dry definite faces that must have had a good deal of expression but almost always the same one indeed i can show you her portrait in a fresco of ghirlandaios i hope you dont object to my speaking that way of your aunt eh ive an idea you dont perhaps you think thats even worse i assure you theres no want of respect in it to either of you you know im a particular admirer of mrs touchett  while isabels host exerted himself to entertain her in this somewhat confidential fashion she looked occasionally at madame merle who met her eyes with an inattentive smile in which on this occasion there was no infelicitous intimation that our heroine appeared to advantage madame merle eventually proposed to the countess gemini that they should go into the garden and the countess rising and shaking out her feathers began to rustle toward the door poor miss archer she exclaimed surveying the other group with expressive compassion she has been brought quite into the family  miss archer can certainly have nothing but sympathy for a family to which you belong mr osmond answered with a laugh which though it had something of a mocking ring had also a finer patience  i dont know what you mean by that im sure shell see no harm in me but what you tell her im better than he says miss archer the countess went on im only rather an idiot and a bore is that all he has said ah then you keep him in goodhumour has he opened on one of his favourite subjects i give you notice that there are two or three that he treats a fond in that case you had better take off your bonnet  i dont think i know what mr osmonds favourite subjects are said isabel who had risen to her feet  the countess assumed for an instant an attitude of intense meditation pressing one of her hands with the fingertips gathered together to her forehead ill tell you in a moment ones machiavelli the others vittoria colonna the next is metastasio  ah with me said madame merle passing her arm into the countess geminis as if to guide her course to the garden mr osmonds never so historical  oh you the countess answered as they moved away you yourself are machiavelliyou yourself are vittoria colonna  we shall hear next that poor madame merle is metastasio gilbert osmond resignedly sighed  isabel had got up on the assumption that they too were to go into the garden but her host stood there with no apparent inclination to leave the room his hands in the pockets of his jacket and his daughter who had now locked her arm into one of his own clinging to him and looking up while her eyes moved from his own face to isabels isabel waited with a certain unuttered contentedness to have her movements directed she liked mr osmonds talk his company she had what always gave her a very private thrill the consciousness of a new relation through the open doors of the great room she saw madame merle and the countess stroll across the fine grass of the garden then she turned and her eyes wandered over the things scattered about her the understanding had been that mr osmond should show her his treasures his pictures and cabinets all looked like treasures isabel after a moment went toward one of the pictures to see it better but just as she had done so he said to her abruptly miss archer what do you think of my sister  she faced him with some surprise ah dont ask me thative seen your sister too little  yes youve seen her very little but you must have observed that there is not a great deal of her to see what do you think of our family tone he went on with his cool smile i should like to know how it strikes a fresh unprejudiced mind i know what youre going to sayyouve had almost no observation of it of course this is only a glimpse but just take notice in future if you have a chance i sometimes think weve got into a rather bad way living off here among things and people not our own without responsibilities or attachments with nothing to hold us together or keep us up marrying foreigners forming artificial tastes playing tricks with our natural mission let me add though that i say that much more for myself than for my sister shes a very honest ladymore so than she seems shes rather unhappy and as shes not of a serious turn she doesnt tend to show it tragically she shows it comically instead she has got a horrid husband though im not sure she makes the best of him of course however a horrid husbands an awkward thing madame merle gives her excellent advice but its a good deal like giving a child a dictionary to learn a language with he can look out the words but he cant put them together my sister needs a grammar but unfortunately shes not grammatical pardon my troubling you with these details my sister was very right in saying youve been taken into the family let me take down that picture you want more light  he took down the picture carried it toward the window related some curious facts about it she looked at the other works of art and he gave her such further information as might appear most acceptable to a young lady making a call on a summer afternoon his pictures his medallions and tapestries were interesting but after a while isabel felt the owner much more so and independently of them thickly as they seemed to overhang him he resembled no one she had ever seen most of the people she knew might be divided into groups of half a dozen specimens there were one or two exceptions to this she could think for instance of no group that would contain her aunt lydia there were other people who were relatively speaking originaloriginal as one might say by courtesy such as mr goodwood as her cousin ralph as henrietta stackpole as lord warburton as madame merle but in essentials when one came to look at them these individuals belonged to types already present to her mind her mind contained no class offering a natural place to mr osmondhe was a specimen apart it was not that she recognised all these truths at the hour but they were falling into order before her for the moment she only said to herself that this new relation would perhaps prove her very most distinguished madame merle had had that note of rarity but what quite other power it immediately gained when sounded by a man it was not so much what he said and did but rather what he withheld that marked him for her as by one of those signs of the highly curious that he was showing her on the underside of old plates and in the corner of sixteenthcentury drawings he indulged in no striking deflections from common usage he was an original without being an eccentric she had never met a person of so fine a grain the peculiarity was physical to begin with and it extended to impalpabilities his dense delicate hair his overdrawn retouched features his clear complexion ripe without being coarse the very evenness of the growth of his beard and that light smooth slenderness of structure which made the movement of a single one of his fingers produce the effect of an expressive gesturethese personal points struck our sensitive young woman as signs of quality of intensity somehow as promises of interest he was certainly fastidious and critical he was probably irritable his sensibility had governed himpossibly governed him too much it had made him impatient of vulgar troubles and had led him to live by himself in a sorted sifted arranged world thinking about art and beauty and history he had consulted his taste in everythinghis taste alone perhaps as a sick man consciously incurable consults at last only his lawyer that was what made him so different from every one else ralph had something of this same quality this appearance of thinking that life was a matter of connoisseurship but in ralph it was an anomaly a kind of humorous excrescence whereas in mr osmond it was the keynote and everything was in harmony with it she was certainly far from understanding him completely his meaning was not at all times obvious it was hard to see what he meant for instance by speaking of his provincial sidewhich was exactly the side she would have taken him most to lack was it a harmless paradox intended to puzzle her or was it the last refinement of high culture she trusted she should learn in time it would be very interesting to learn if it was provincial to have that harmony what then was the finish of the capital and she could put this question in spite of so feeling her host a shy personage since such shyness as histhe shyness of ticklish nerves and fine perceptionswas perfectly consistent with the best breeding indeed it was almost a proof of standards and touchstones other than the vulgar he must be so sure the vulgar would be first on the ground he wasnt a man of easy assurance who chatted and gossiped with the fluency of a superficial nature he was critical of himself as well as of others and exacting a good deal of others to think them agreeable probably took a rather ironical view of what he himself offered a proof into the bargain that he was not grossly conceited if he had not been shy he wouldnt have effected that gradual subtle successful conversion of it to which she owed both what pleased her in him and what mystified her if he had suddenly asked her what she thought of the countess gemini that was doubtless a proof that he was interested in her it could scarcely be as a help to knowledge of his own sister that he should be so interested showed an enquiring mind but it was a little singular he should sacrifice his fraternal feeling to his curiosity this was the most eccentric thing he had done  there were two other rooms beyond the one in which she had been received equally full of romantic objects and in these apartments isabel spent a quarter of an hour everything was in the last degree curious and precious and mr osmond continued to be the kindest of ciceroni as he led her from one fine piece to another and still held his little girl by the hand his kindness almost surprised our young friend who wondered why he should take so much trouble for her and she was oppressed at last with the accumulation of beauty and knowledge to which she found herself introduced there was enough for the present she had ceased to attend to what he said she listened to him with attentive eyes but was not thinking of what he told her he probably thought her quicker cleverer in every way more prepared than she was madame merle would have pleasantly exaggerated which was a pity because in the end he would be sure to find out and then perhaps even her real intelligence wouldnt reconcile him to his mistake a part of isabels fatigue came from the effort to appear as intelligent as she believed madame merle had described her and from the fear very unusual with her of exposingnot her ignorance for that she cared comparatively littlebut her possible grossness of perception it would have annoyed her to express a liking for something he in his superior enlightenment would think she oughtnt to like or to pass by something at which the truly initiated mind would arrest itself she had no wish to fall into that grotesquenessin which she had seen women and it was a warning serenely yet ignobly flounder she was very careful therefore as to what she said as to what she noticed or failed to notice more careful than she had ever been before  they came back into the first of the rooms where the tea had been served but as the two other ladies were still on the terrace and as isabel had not yet been made acquainted with the view the paramount distinction of the place mr osmond directed her steps into the garden without more delay madame merle and the countess had had chairs brought out and as the afternoon was lovely the countess proposed they should take their tea in the open air pansy therefore was sent to bid the servant bring out the preparations the sun had got low the golden light took a deeper tone and on the mountains and the plain that stretched beneath them the masses of purple shadow glowed as richly as the places that were still exposed the scene had an extraordinary charm the air was almost solemnly still and the large expanse of the landscape with its gardenlike culture and nobleness of outline its teeming valley and delicatelyfretted hills its peculiarly humanlooking touches of habitation lay there in splendid harmony and classic grace you seem so well pleased that i think you can be trusted to come back osmond said as he led his companion to one of the angles of the terrace  i shall certainly come back she returned in spite of what you say about its being bad to live in italy what was that you said about ones natural mission i wonder if i should forsake my natural mission if i were to settle in florence  a womans natural mission is to be where shes most appreciated  the points to find out where that is  very trueshe often wastes a great deal of time in the enquiry people ought to make it very plain to her  such a matter would have to be made very plain to me smiled isabel  im glad at any rate to hear you talk of settling madame merle had given me an idea that you were of a rather roving disposition i thought she spoke of your having some plan of going round the world  im rather ashamed of my plans i make a new one every day  i dont see why you should be ashamed its the greatest of pleasures  it seems frivolous i think said isabel one ought to choose something very deliberately and be faithful to that  by that rule then ive not been frivolous  have you never made plans  yes i made one years ago and im acting on it today  it must have been a very pleasant one isabel permitted herself to observe  it was very simple it was to be as quiet as possible  as quiet the girl repeated  not to worrynot to strive nor struggle to resign myself to be content with little he spoke these sentences slowly with short pauses between and his intelligent regard was fixed on his visitors with the conscious air of a man who has brought himself to confess something  do you call that simple she asked with mild irony  yes because its negative  has your life been negative  call it affirmative if you like only it has affirmed my indifference mind you not my natural indifferencei had none but my studied my wilful renunciation  she scarcely understood him it seemed a question whether he were joking or not why should a man who struck her as having a great fund of reserve suddenly bring himself to be so confidential this was his affair however and his confidences were interesting i dont see why you should have renounced she said in a moment  because i could do nothing i had no prospects i was poor and i was not a man of genius i had no talents even i took my measure early in life i was simply the most fastidious young gentleman living there were two or three people in the world i enviedthe emperor of russia for instance and the sultan of turkey there were even moments when i envied the pope of romefor the consideration he enjoys i should have been delighted to be considered to that extent but since that couldnt be i didnt care for anything less and i made up my mind not to go in for honours the leanest gentleman can always consider himself and fortunately i was though lean a gentleman i could do nothing in italyi couldnt even be an italian patriot to do that i should have had to get out of the country and i was too fond of it to leave it to say nothing of my being too well satisfied with it on the whole as it then was to wish it altered so ive passed a great many years here on that quiet plan i spoke of ive not been at all unhappy i dont mean to say ive cared for nothing but the things ive cared for have been definitelimited the events of my life have been absolutely unperceived by any one save myself getting an old silver crucifix at a bargain ive never bought anything dear of course or discovering as i once did a sketch by correggio on a panel daubed over by some inspired idiot  this would have been rather a dry account of mr osmonds career if isabel had fully believed it but her imagination supplied the human element which she was sure had not been wanting his life had been mingled with other lives more than he admitted naturally she couldnt expect him to enter into this for the present she abstained from provoking further revelations to intimate that he had not told her everything would be more familiar and less considerate than she now desired to bewould in fact be uproariously vulgar he had certainly told her quite enough it was her present inclination however to express a measured sympathy for the success with which he had preserved his independence thats a very pleasant life she said to renounce everything but correggio  oh ive made in my way a good thing of it dont imagine im whining about it its ones own fault if one isnt happy  this was large she kept down to something smaller have you lived here always  no not always i lived a long time at naples and many years in rome but ive been here a good while perhaps i shall have to change however to do something else ive no longer myself to think of my daughters growing up and may very possibly not care so much for the correggios and crucifixes as i i shall have to do whats best for pansy  yes do that said isabel shes such a dear little girl  ah cried gilbert osmond beautifully shes a little saint of heaven she is my great happiness    chapter xxv  while this sufficiently intimate colloquy prolonged for some time after we cease to follow it went forward madame merle and her companion breaking a silence of some duration had begun to exchange remarks they were sitting in an attitude of unexpressed expectancy an attitude especially marked on the part of the countess gemini who being of a more nervous temperament than her friend practised with less success the art of disguising impatience what these ladies were waiting for would not have been apparent and was perhaps not very definite to their own minds madame merle waited for osmond to release their young friend from her teteatete and the countess waited because madame merle did the countess moreover by waiting found the time ripe for one of her pretty perversities she might have desired for some minutes to place it her brother wandered with isabel to the end of the garden to which point her eyes followed them  my dear she then observed to her companion youll excuse me if i dont congratulate you  very willingly for i dont in the least know why you should  havent you a little plan that you think rather well of and the countess nodded at the sequestered couple  madame merles eyes took the same direction then she looked serenely at her neighbour you know i never understand you very well she smiled  no one can understand better than you when you wish i see that just now you dont wish  you say things to me that no one else does said madame merle gravely yet without bitterness  you mean things you dont like doesnt osmond sometimes say such things  what your brother says has a point  yes a poisoned one sometimes if you mean that im not so clever as he you mustnt think i shall suffer from your sense of our difference but it will be much better that you should understand me  why so asked madame merle to what will it conduce  if i dont approve of your plan you ought to know it in order to appreciate the danger of my interfering with it  madame merle looked as if she were ready to admit that there might be something in this but in a moment she said quietly you think me more calculating than i am  its not your calculating i think ill of its your calculating wrong youve done so in this case  you must have made extensive calculations yourself to discover that  no ive not had time ive seen the girl but this once said the countess and the conviction has suddenly come to me i like her very much  so do i madame merle mentioned  youve a strange way of showing it  surely ive given her the advantage of making your acquaintance  that indeed piped the countess is perhaps the best thing that could happen to her  madame merle said nothing for some time the countesss manner was odious was really low but it was an old story and with her eyes upon the violet slope of monte morello she gave herself up to reflection my dear lady she finally resumed i advise you not to agitate yourself the matter you allude to concerns three persons much stronger of purpose than yourself  three persons you and osmond of course but is miss archer also very strong of purpose  quite as much so as we  ah then said the countess radiantly if i convince her its her interest to resist you shell do so successfully  resist us why do you express yourself so coarsely shes not exposed to compulsion or deception  im not sure of that youre capable of anything you and osmond i dont mean osmond by himself and i dont mean you by yourself but together youre dangerouslike some chemical combination  you had better leave us alone then smiled madame merle  i dont mean to touch youbut i shall talk to that girl  my poor amy madame merle murmured i dont see what has got into your head  i take an interest in herthats what has got into my head i like her  madame merle hesitated a moment i dont think she likes you  the countesss bright little eyes expanded and her face was set in a grimace ah you are dangerouseven by yourself  if you want her to like you dont abuse your brother to her said madame merle  i dont suppose you pretend she has fallen in love with him in two interviews  madame merle looked a moment at isabel and at the master of the house he was leaning against the parapet facing her his arms folded and she at present was evidently not lost in the mere impersonal view persistently as she gazed at it as madame merle watched her she lowered her eyes she was listening possibly with a certain embarrassment while she pressed the point of her parasol into the path madame merle rose from her chair yes i think so she pronounced  the shabby footboy summoned by pansyhe might tarnished as to livery and quaint as to type have issued from some stray sketch of oldtime manners been put in by the brush of a longhi or a goyahad come out with a small table and placed it on the grass and then had gone back and fetched the teatray after which he had again disappeared to return with a couple of chairs pansy had watched these proceedings with the deepest interest standing with her small hands folded together upon the front of her scanty frock but she had not presumed to offer assistance when the teatable had been arranged however she gently approached her aunt  do you think papa would object to my making the tea  the countess looked at her with a deliberately critical gaze and without answering her question my poor niece she said is that your best frock  ah no pansy answered its just a little toilette for common occasions  do you call it a common occasion when i come to see youto say nothing of madame merle and the pretty lady yonder  pansy reflected a moment turning gravely from one of the persons mentioned to the other then her face broke into its perfect smile i have a pretty dress but even that ones very simple why should i expose it beside your beautiful things  because its the prettiest you have for me you must always wear the prettiest please put it on the next time it seems to me they dont dress you so well as they might  the child sparingly stroked down her antiquated skirt its a good little dress to make teadont you think dont you believe papa would allow me  impossible for me to say my child said the countess for me your fathers ideas are unfathomable madame merle understands them better ask her  madame merle smiled with her usual grace its a weighty questionlet me think it seems to me it would please your father to see a careful little daughter making his tea its the proper duty of the daughter of the housewhen she grows up  so it seems to me madame merle pansy cried you shall see how well ill make it a spoonful for each and she began to busy herself at the table  two spoonfuls for me said the countess who with madame merle remained for some moments watching her listen to me pansy the countess resumed at last i should like to know what you think of your visitor  ah shes not mineshes papas pansy objected  miss archer came to see you as well said madame merle  im very happy to hear that she has been very polite to me  do you like her then the countess asked  shes charmingcharming pansy repeated in her little neat conversational tone she pleases me thoroughly  and how do you think she pleases your father  ah really countess murmured madame merle dissuasively go and call them to tea she went on to the child  youll see if they dont like it pansy declared and departed to summon the others who had still lingered at the end of the terrace  if miss archers to become her mother its surely interesting to know if the child likes her said the countess  if your brother marries again it wont be for pansys sake madame merle replied shell soon be sixteen and after that shell begin to need a husband rather than a stepmother  and will you provide the husband as well  i shall certainly take an interest in her marrying fortunately i imagine youll do the same  indeed i shant cried the countess why should i of all women set such a price on a husband  you didnt marry fortunately thats what im speaking of when i say a husband i mean a good one  there are no good ones osmond wont be a good one  madame merle closed her eyes a moment youre irritated just now i dont know why she presently said i dont think youll really object either to your brothers or to your nieces marrying when the time comes for them to do so and as regards pansy im confident that we shall some day have the pleasure of looking for a husband for her together your large acquaintance will be a great help  yes im irritated the countess answered you often irritate me your own coolness is fabulous youre a strange woman  its much better that we should always act together madame merle went on  do you mean that as a threat asked the countess rising madame merle shook her head as for quiet amusement no indeed youve not my coolness  isabel and mr osmond were now slowly coming toward them and isabel had taken pansy by the hand do you pretend to believe hed make her happy the countess demanded  if he should marry miss archer i suppose hed behave like a gentleman  the countess jerked herself into a succession of attitudes do you mean as most gentlemen behave that would be much to be thankful for of course osmonds a gentleman his own sister neednt be reminded of that but does he think he can marry any girl he happens to pick out osmonds a gentleman of course but i must say ive never no no never seen any one of osmonds pretensions what theyre all founded on is more than i can say im his own sister i might be supposed to know who is he if you please what has he ever done if there had been anything particularly grand in his originif he were made of some superior clayi presume i should have got some inkling of it if there had been any great honours or splendours in the family i should certainly have made the most of them they would have been quite in my line but theres nothing nothing nothing ones parents were charming people of course but so were yours ive no doubt every ones a charming person nowadays even im a charming person dont laugh it has literally been said as for osmond he has always appeared to believe that hes descended from the gods  you may say what you please said madame merle who had listened to this quick outbreak none the less attentively we may believe because her eye wandered away from the speaker and her hands busied themselves with adjusting the knots of ribbon on her dress you osmonds are a fine raceyour blood must flow from some very pure source your brother like an intelligent man has had the conviction of it if he has not had the proofs youre modest about it but you yourself are extremely distinguished what do you say about your niece the childs a little princess nevertheless madame merle added it wont be an easy matter for osmond to marry miss archer yet he can try  i hope shell refuse him it will take him down a little  we mustnt forget that he is one of the cleverest of men  ive heard you say that before but i havent yet discovered what he has done  what he has done he has done nothing that has had to be undone and he has known how to wait  to wait for miss archers money how much of it is there  thats not what i mean said madame merle miss archer has seventy thousand pounds  well its a pity shes so charming the countess declared to be sacrificed any girl would do she neednt be superior  if she werent superior your brother would never look at her he must have the best  yes returned the countess as they went forward a little to meet the others hes very hard to satisfy that makes me tremble for her happiness    chapter xxvi  gilbert osmond came to see isabel again that is he came to palazzo crescentini he had other friends there as well and to mrs touchett and madame merle he was always impartially civil but the former of these ladies noted the fact that in the course of a fortnight he called five times and compared it with another fact that she found no difficulty in remembering two visits a year had hitherto constituted his regular tribute to mrs touchetts worth and she had never observed him select for such visits those moments of almost periodical recurrence when madame merle was under her roof it was not for madame merle that he came these two were old friends and he never put himself out for her he was not fond of ralphralph had told her soand it was not supposable that mr osmond had suddenly taken a fancy to her son ralph was imperturbableralph had a kind of loosefitting urbanity that wrapped him about like an illmade overcoat but of which he never divested himself he thought mr osmond very good company and was willing at any time to look at him in the light of hospitality but he didnt flatter himself that the desire to repair a past injustice was the motive of their visitors calls he read the situation more clearly isabel was the attraction and in all conscience a sufficient one osmond was a critic a student of the exquisite and it was natural he should be curious of so rare an apparition so when his mother observed to him that it was plain what mr osmond was thinking of ralph replied that he was quite of her opinion mrs touchett had from far back found a place on her scant list for this gentleman though wondering dimly by what art and what processso negative and so wise as they werehe had everywhere effectively imposed himself as he had never been an importunate visitor he had had no chance to be offensive and he was recommended to her by his appearance of being as well able to do without her as she was to do without hima quality that always oddly enough affected her as providing ground for a relation with her it gave her no satisfaction however to think that he had taken it into his head to marry her niece such an alliance on isabels part would have an air of almost morbid perversity mrs touchett easily remembered that the girl had refused an english peer and that a young lady with whom lord warburton had not successfully wrestled should content herself with an obscure american dilettante a middleaged widower with an uncanny child and an ambiguous income this answered to nothing in mrs touchetts conception of success she took it will be observed not the sentimental but the political view of matrimonya view which has always had much to recommend it i trust she wont have the folly to listen to him she said to her son to which ralph replied that isabels listening was one thing and isabels answering quite another he knew she had listened to several parties as his father would have said but had made them listen in return and he found much entertainment in the idea that in these few months of his knowing her he should observe a fresh suitor at her gate she had wanted to see life and fortune was serving her to her taste a succession of fine gentlemen going down on their knees to her would do as well as anything else ralph looked forward to a fourth a fifth a tenth besieger he had no conviction she would stop at a third she would keep the gate ajar and open a parley she would certainly not allow number three to come in he expressed this view somewhat after this fashion to his mother who looked at him as if he had been dancing a jig he had such a fanciful pictorial way of saying things that he might as well address her in the deafmutes alphabet  i dont think i know what you mean she said you use too many figures of speech i could never understand allegories the two words in the language i most respect are yes and no if isabel wants to marry mr osmond shell do so in spite of all your comparisons let her alone to find a fine one herself for anything she undertakes i know very little about the young man in america i dont think she spends much of her time in thinking of him and i suspect he has got tired of waiting for her theres nothing in life to prevent her marrying mr osmond if she only looks at him in a certain way thats all very well no one approves more than i of ones pleasing ones self but she takes her pleasure in such odd things shes capable of marrying mr osmond for the beauty of his opinions or for his autograph of michael angelo she wants to be disinterested as if she were the only person whos in danger of not being so will he be so disinterested when he has the spending of her money that was her idea before your fathers death and it has acquired new charms for her since she ought to marry some one of whose disinterestedness she shall herself be sure and there would be no such proof of that as his having a fortune of his own  my dear mother im not afraid ralph answered shes making fools of us all shell please herself of course but shell do so by studying human nature at close quarters and yet retaining her liberty she has started on an exploring expedition and i dont think shell change her course at the outset at a signal from gilbert osmond she may have slackened speed for an hour but before we know it shell be steaming away again excuse another metaphor  mrs touchett excused it perhaps but was not so much reassured as to withhold from madame merle the expression of her fears you who know everything she said you must know this whether that curious creatures really making love to my niece  gilbert osmond madame merle widened her clear eyes and with a full intelligence heaven help us she exclaimed thats an idea  hadnt it occurred to you  you make me feel an idiot but i confess it hadnt i wonder she added if it has occurred to isabel  oh i shall now ask her said mrs touchett  madame merle reflected dont put it into her head the thing would be to ask mr osmond  i cant do that said mrs touchett i wont have him enquire of meas he perfectly may with that air of his given isabels situationwhat business it is of mine  ill ask him myself madame merle bravely declared  but what businessfor himis it of yours  its being none whatever is just why i can afford to speak its so much less my business than any ones else that he can put me off with anything he chooses but it will be by the way he does this that i shall know  pray let me hear then said mrs touchett of the fruits of your penetration if i cant speak to him however at least i can speak to isabel  her companion sounded at this the note of warning dont be too quick with her dont inflame her imagination  i never did anything in life to any ones imagination but im always sure of her doing somethingwell not of my kind  no you wouldnt like this madame merle observed without the point of interrogation  why in the world should i pray mr osmond has nothing the least solid to offer  again madame merle was silent while her thoughtful smile drew up her mouth even more charmingly than usual toward the left corner let us distinguish gilbert osmonds certainly not the first comer hes a man who in favourable conditions might very well make a great impression he has made a great impression to my knowledge more than once  dont tell me about his probably quite coldblooded loveaffairs theyre nothing to me mrs touchett cried what you says precisely why i wish he would cease his visits he has nothing in the world that i know of but a dozen or two of early masters and a more or less pert little daughter  the early masters are now worth a good deal of money said madame merle and the daughters a very young and very innocent and very harmless person  in other words shes an insipid little chit is that what you mean having no fortune she cant hope to marry as they marry here so that isabel will have to furnish her either with a maintenance or with a dowry  isabel probably wouldnt object to being kind to her i think she likes the poor child  another reason then for mr osmonds stopping at home otherwise a week hence we shall have my niece arriving at the conviction that her mission in lifes to prove that a stepmother may sacrifice herselfand that to prove it she must first become one  she would make a charming stepmother smiled madame merle but i quite agree with you that she had better not decide upon her mission too hastily changing the form of ones missions almost as difficult as changing the shape of ones nose there they are each in the middle of ones face and ones characterone has to begin too far back but ill investigate and report to you  all this went on quite over isabels head she had no suspicions that her relations with mr osmond were being discussed madame merle had said nothing to put her on her guard she alluded no more pointedly to him than to the other gentlemen of florence native and foreign who now arrived in considerable numbers to pay their respects to miss archers aunt isabel thought him interestingshe came back to that she liked so to think of him she had carried away an image from her visit to his hilltop which her subsequent knowledge of him did nothing to efface and which put on for her a particular harmony with other supposed and divined things histories within histories the image of a quiet clever sensitive distinguished man strolling on a mossgrown terrace above the sweet val darno and holding by the hand a little girl whose belllike clearness gave a new grace to childhood the picture had no flourishes but she liked its lowness of tone and the atmosphere of summer twilight that pervaded it it spoke of the kind of personal issue that touched her most nearly of the choice between objects subjects contactswhat might she call themof a thin and those of a rich association of a lonely studious life in a lovely land of an old sorrow that sometimes ached today of a feeling of pride that was perhaps exaggerated but that had an element of nobleness of a care for beauty and perfection so natural and so cultivated together that the career appeared to stretch beneath it in the disposed vistas and with the ranges of steps and terraces and fountains of a formal italian gardenallowing only for arid places freshened by the natural dews of a quaint halfanxious halfhelpless fatherhood at palazzo crescentini mr osmonds manner remained the same diffident at firstoh selfconscious beyond doubt and full of the effort visible only to a sympathetic eye to overcome this disadvantage an effort which usually resulted in a great deal of easy lively very positive rather aggressive always suggestive talk mr osmonds talk was not injured by the indication of an eagerness to shine isabel found no difficulty in believing that a person was sincere who had so many of the signs of strong convictionas for instance an explicit and graceful appreciation of anything that might be said on his own side of the question said perhaps by miss archer in especial what continued to please this young woman was that while he talked so for amusement he didnt talk as she had heard people for effect he uttered his ideas as if odd as they often appeared he were used to them and had lived with them old polished knobs and heads and handles of precious substance that could be fitted if necessary to new walkingsticksnot switches plucked in destitution from the common tree and then too elegantly waved about one day he brought his small daughter with him and she rejoiced to renew acquaintance with the child who as she presented her forehead to be kissed by every member of the circle reminded her vividly of an ingenue in a french play isabel had never seen a little person of this pattern american girls were very differentdifferent too were the maidens of england pansy was so formed and finished for her tiny place in the world and yet in imagination as one could see so innocent and infantine she sat on the sofa by isabel she wore a small grenadine mantle and a pair of the useful gloves that madame merle had given herlittle grey gloves with a single button she was like a sheet of blank paperthe ideal jeune fille of foreign fiction isabel hoped that so fair and smooth a page would be covered with an edifying text  the countess gemini also came to call upon her but the countess was quite another affair she was by no means a blank sheet she had been written over in a variety of hands and mrs touchett who felt by no means honoured by her visit pronounced that a number of unmistakeable blots were to be seen upon her surface the countess gave rise indeed to some discussion between the mistress of the house and the visitor from rome in which madame merle who was not such a fool as to irritate people by always agreeing with them availed herself felicitously enough of that large licence of dissent which her hostess permitted as freely as she practised it mrs touchett had declared it a piece of audacity that this highly compromised character should have presented herself at such a time of day at the door of a house in which she was esteemed so little as she must long have known herself to be at palazzo crescentini isabel had been made acquainted with the estimate prevailing under that roof it represented mr osmonds sister as a lady who had so mismanaged her improprieties that they had ceased to hang together at allwhich was at the least what one asked of such mattersand had become the mere floating fragments of a wrecked renown incommoding social circulation she had been married by her mothera more administrative person with an appreciation of foreign titles which the daughter to do her justice had probably by this time thrown offto an italian nobleman who had perhaps given her some excuse for attempting to quench the consciousness of outrage the countess however had consoled herself outrageously and the list of her excuses had now lost itself in the labyrinth of her adventures mrs touchett had never consented to receive her though the countess had made overtures of old florence was not an austere city but as mrs touchett said she had to draw the line somewhere  madame merle defended the luckless lady with a great deal of zeal and wit she couldnt see why mrs touchett should make a scapegoat of a woman who had really done no harm who had only done good in the wrong way one must certainly draw the line but while one was about it one should draw it straight it was a very crooked chalkmark that would exclude the countess gemini in that case mrs touchett had better shut up her house this perhaps would be the best course so long as she remained in florence one must be fair and not make arbitrary differences the countess had doubtless been imprudent she had not been so clever as other women she was a good creature not clever at all but since when had that been a ground of exclusion from the best society for ever so long now one had heard nothing about her and there could be no better proof of her having renounced the error of her ways than her desire to become a member of mrs touchetts circle isabel could contribute nothing to this interesting dispute not even a patient attention she contented herself with having given a friendly welcome to the unfortunate lady who whatever her defects had at least the merit of being mr osmonds sister as she liked the brother isabel thought it proper to try and like the sister in spite of the growing complexity of things she was still capable of these primitive sequences she had not received the happiest impression of the countess on meeting her at the villa but was thankful for an opportunity to repair the accident had not mr osmond remarked that she was a respectable person to have proceeded from gilbert osmond this was a crude proposition but madame merle bestowed upon it a certain improving polish she told isabel more about the poor countess than mr osmond had done and related the history of her marriage and its consequences the count was a member of an ancient tuscan family but of such small estate that he had been glad to accept amy osmond in spite of the questionable beauty which had yet not hampered her career with the modest dowry her mother was able to offera sum about equivalent to that which had already formed her brothers share of their patrimony count gemini since then however had inherited money and now they were well enough off as italians went though amy was horribly extravagant the count was a lowlived brute he had given his wife every pretext she had no children she had lost three within a year of their birth her mother who had bristled with pretensions to elegant learning and published descriptive poems and corresponded on italian subjects with the english weekly journals her mother had died three years after the countesss marriage the father lost in the grey american dawn of the situation but reputed originally rich and wild having died much earlier one could see this in gilbert osmond madame merle heldsee that he had been brought up by a woman though to do him justice one would suppose it had been by a more sensible woman than the american corinne as mrs osmond had liked to be called she had brought her children to italy after her husbands death and mrs touchett remembered her during the year that followed her arrival she thought her a horrible snob but this was an irregularity of judgement on mrs touchetts part for she like mrs osmond approved of political marriages the countess was very good company and not really the featherhead she seemed all one had to do with her was to observe the simple condition of not believing a word she said madame merle had always made the best of her for her brothers sake he appreciated any kindness shown to amy because if it had to be confessed for him he rather felt she let down their common name naturally he couldnt like her style her shrillness her egotism her violations of taste and above all of truth she acted badly on his nerves she was not his sort of woman what was his sort of woman oh the very opposite of the countess a woman to whom the truth should be habitually sacred isabel was unable to estimate the number of times her visitor had in half an hour profaned it the countess indeed had given her an impression of rather silly sincerity she had talked almost exclusively about herself how much she should like to know miss archer how thankful she should be for a real friend how base the people in florence were how tired she was of the place how much she should like to live somewhere elsein paris in london in washington how impossible it was to get anything nice to wear in italy except a little old lace how dear the world was growing everywhere what a life of suffering and privation she had led madame merle listened with interest to isabels account of this passage but she had not needed it to feel exempt from anxiety on the whole she was not afraid of the countess and she could afford to do what was altogether bestnot to appear so  isabel had meanwhile another visitor whom it was not even behind her back so easy a matter to patronise henrietta stackpole who had left paris after mrs touchetts departure for san remo and had worked her way down as she said through the cities of north italy reached the banks of the arno about the middle of may madame merle surveyed her with a single glance took her in from head to foot and after a pang of despair determined to endure her she determined indeed to delight in her she mightnt be inhaled as a rose but she might be grasped as a nettle madame merle genially squeezed her into insignificance and isabel felt that in foreseeing this liberality she had done justice to her friends intelligence henriettas arrival had been announced by mr bantling who coming down from nice while she was at venice and expecting to find her in florence which she had not yet reached called at palazzo crescentini to express his disappointment henriettas own advent occurred two days later and produced in mr bantling an emotion amply accounted for by the fact that he had not seen her since the termination of the episode at versailles the humorous view of his situation was generally taken but it was uttered only by ralph touchett who in the privacy of his own apartment when bantling smoked a cigar there indulged in goodness knew what strong comedy on the subject of the alljudging one and her british backer this gentleman took the joke in perfectly good part and candidly confessed that he regarded the affair as a positive intellectual adventure he liked miss stackpole extremely he thought she had a wonderful head on her shoulders and found great comfort in the society of a woman who was not perpetually thinking about what would be said and how what she did how what they didand they had done thingswould look miss stackpole never cared how anything looked and if she didnt care pray why should he but his curiosity had been roused he wanted awfully to see if she ever would care he was prepared to go as far as shehe didnt see why he should break down first  henrietta showed no signs of breaking down her prospects had brightened on her leaving england and she was now in the full enjoyment of her copious resources she had indeed been obliged to sacrifice her hopes with regard to the inner life the social question on the continent bristled with difficulties even more numerous than those she had encountered in england but on the continent there was the outer life which was palpable and visible at every turn and more easily convertible to literary uses than the customs of those opaque islanders out of doors in foreign lands as she ingeniously remarked one seemed to see the right side of the tapestry out of doors in england one seemed to see the wrong side which gave one no notion of the figure the admission costs her historian a pang but henrietta despairing of more occult things was now paying much attention to the outer life she had been studying it for two months at venice from which city she sent to the interviewer a conscientious account of the gondolas the piazza the bridge of sighs the pigeons and the young boatman who chanted tasso the interviewer was perhaps disappointed but henrietta was at least seeing europe her present purpose was to get down to rome before the malaria should come onshe apparently supposed that it began on a fixed day and with this design she was to spend at present but few days in florence mr bantling was to go with her to rome and she pointed out to isabel that as he had been there before as he was a military man and as he had had a classical educationhe had been bred at eton where they study nothing but latin and whytemelville said miss stackpolehe would be a most useful companion in the city of the caesars at this juncture ralph had the happy idea of proposing to isabel that she also under his own escort should make a pilgrimage to rome she expected to pass a portion of the next winter therethat was very well but meantime there was no harm in surveying the field there were ten days left of the beautiful month of maythe most precious month of all to the true romelover isabel would become a romelover that was a foregone conclusion she was provided with a trusty companion of her own sex whose society thanks to the fact of other calls on this ladys attention would probably not be oppressive madame merle would remain with mrs touchett she had left rome for the summer and wouldnt care to return she professed herself delighted to be left at peace in florence she had locked up her apartment and sent her cook home to palestrina she urged isabel however to assent to ralphs proposal and assured her that a good introduction to rome was not a thing to be despised isabel in truth needed no urging and the party of four arranged its little journey mrs touchett on this occasion had resigned herself to the absence of a duenna we have seen that she now inclined to the belief that her niece should stand alone one of isabels preparations consisted of her seeing gilbert osmond before she started and mentioning her intention to him  i should like to be in rome with you he commented i should like to see you on that wonderful ground  she scarcely faltered you might come then  but youll have a lot of people with you  ah isabel admitted of course i shall not be alone  for a moment he said nothing more youll like it he went on at last theyve spoiled it but youll rave about it  ought i to dislike it because poor old dearthe niobe of nations you knowit has been spoiled she asked  no i think not it has been spoiled so often he smiled if i were to go what should i do with my little girl  cant you leave her at the villa  i dont know that i like thatthough theres a very good old woman who looks after her i cant afford a governess  bring her with you then said isabel promptly  mr osmond looked grave she has been in rome all winter at her convent and shes too young to make journeys of pleasure  you dont like bringing her forward isabel enquired  no i think young girls should be kept out of the world  i was brought up on a different system  you oh with you it succeeded because youyou were exceptional  i dont see why said isabel who however was not sure there was not some truth in the speech  mr osmond didnt explain he simply went on if i thought it would make her resemble you to join a social group in rome id take her there tomorrow  dont make her resemble me said isabel keep her like herself  i might send her to my sister mr osmond observed he had almost the air of asking advice he seemed to like to talk over his domestic matters with miss archer  yes she concurred i think that wouldnt do much towards making her resemble me  after she had left florence gilbert osmond met madame merle at the countess geminis there were other people present the countesss drawingroom was usually well filled and the talk had been general but after a while osmond left his place and came and sat on an ottoman halfbehind halfbeside madame merles chair she wants me to go to rome with her he remarked in a low voice  to go with her  to be there while shes there she proposed it  i suppose you mean that you proposed it and she assented  of course i gave her a chance but shes encouragingshes very encouraging  i rejoice to hear itbut dont cry victory too soon of course youll go to rome  ah said osmond it makes one work this idea of yours  dont pretend you dont enjoy ityoure very ungrateful youve not been so well occupied these many years  the way you take its beautiful said osmond i ought to be grateful for that  not too much so however madame merle answered she talked with her usual smile leaning back in her chair and looking round the room youve made a very good impression and ive seen for myself that youve received one youve not come to mrs touchetts seven times to oblige me  the girls not disagreeable osmond quietly conceded  madame merle dropped her eye on him a moment during which her lips closed with a certain firmness is that all you can find to say about that fine creature  all isnt it enough of how many people have you heard me say more  she made no answer to this but still presented her talkative grace to the room youre unfathomable she murmured at last im frightened at the abyss into which i shall have cast her  he took it almost gaily you cant draw backyouve gone too far  very good but you must do the rest yourself  i shall do it said gilbert osmond  madame merle remained silent and he changed his place again but when she rose to go he also took leave mrs touchetts victoria was awaiting her guest in the court and after he had helped his friend into it he stood there detaining her youre very indiscreet she said rather wearily you shouldnt have moved when i did  he had taken off his hat he passed his hand over his forehead i always forget im out of the habit  youre quite unfathomable she repeated glancing up at the windows of the house a modern structure in the new part of the town  he paid no heed to this remark but spoke in his own sense shes really very charming ive scarcely known any one more graceful  it does me good to hear you say that the better you like her the better for me  i like her very much shes all you described her and into the bargain capable i feel of great devotion she has only one fault  whats that  too many ideas  i warned you she was clever  fortunately theyre very bad ones said osmond  why is that fortunate  dame if they must be sacrificed  madame merle leaned back looking straight before her then she spoke to the coachman but her friend again detained her if i go to rome what shall i do with pansy  ill go and see her said madame merle    chapter xxvii  i may not attempt to report in its fulness our young womans response to the deep appeal of rome to analyse her feelings as she trod the pavement of the forum or to number her pulsations as she crossed the threshold of saint peters it is enough to say that her impression was such as might have been expected of a person of her freshness and her eagerness she had always been fond of history and here was history in the stones of the street and the atoms of the sunshine she had an imagination that kindled at the mention of great deeds and wherever she turned some great deed had been acted these things strongly moved her but moved her all inwardly it seemed to her companions that she talked less than usual and ralph touchett when he appeared to be looking listlessly and awkwardly over her head was really dropping on her an intensity of observation by her own measure she was very happy she would even have been willing to take these hours for the happiest she was ever to know the sense of the terrible human past was heavy to her but that of something altogether contemporary would suddenly give it wings that it could wave in the blue her consciousness was so mixed that she scarcely knew where the different parts of it would lead her and she went about in a repressed ecstasy of contemplation seeing often in the things she looked at a great deal more than was there and yet not seeing many of the items enumerated in her murray rome as ralph said confessed to the psychological moment the herd of reechoing tourists had departed and most of the solemn places had relapsed into solemnity the sky was a blaze of blue and the plash of the fountains in their mossy niches had lost its chill and doubled its music on the corners of the warm bright streets one stumbled on bundles of flowers our friends had gone one afternoonit was the third of their stayto look at the latest excavations in the forum these labours having been for some time previous largely extended they had descended from the modern street to the level of the sacred way along which they wandered with a reverence of step which was not the same on the part of each henrietta stackpole was struck with the fact that ancient rome had been paved a good deal like new york and even found an analogy between the deep chariotruts traceable in the antique street and the overjangled iron grooves which express the intensity of american life the sun had begun to sink the air was a golden haze and the long shadows of broken column and vague pedestal leaned across the field of ruin henrietta wandered away with mr bantling whom it was apparently delightful to her to hear speak of julius caesar as a cheeky old boy and ralph addressed such elucidations as he was prepared to offer to the attentive ear of our heroine one of the humble archeologists who hover about the place had put himself at the disposal of the two and repeated his lesson with a fluency which the decline of the season had done nothing to impair a process of digging was on view in a remote corner of the forum and he presently remarked that if it should please the signori to go and watch it a little they might see something of interest the proposal commended itself more to ralph than to isabel weary with much wandering so that she admonished her companion to satisfy his curiosity while she patiently awaited his return the hour and the place were much to her tasteshe should enjoy being briefly alone ralph accordingly went off with the cicerone while isabel sat down on a prostrate column near the foundations of the capitol she wanted a short solitude but she was not long to enjoy it keen as was her interest in the rugged relics of the roman past that lay scattered about her and in which the corrosion of centuries had still left so much of individual life her thoughts after resting a while on these things had wandered by a concatenation of stages it might require some subtlety to trace to regions and objects charged with a more active appeal from the roman past to isabel archers future was a long stride but her imagination had taken it in a single flight and now hovered in slow circles over the nearer and richer field she was so absorbed in her thoughts as she bent her eyes upon a row of cracked but not dislocated slabs covering the ground at her feet that she had not heard the sound of approaching footsteps before a shadow was thrown across the line of her vision she looked up and saw a gentlemana gentleman who was not ralph come back to say that the excavations were a bore this personage was startled as she was startled he stood there baring his head to her perceptibly pale surprise  lord warburton isabel exclaimed as she rose  i had no idea it was you i turned that corner and came upon you  she looked about her to explain im alone but my companions have just left me my cousins gone to look at the work over there  ah yes i see and lord warburtons eyes wandered vaguely in the direction she had indicated he stood firmly before her now he had recovered his balance and seemed to wish to show it though very kindly dont let me disturb you he went on looking at her dejected pillar im afraid youre tired  yes im rather tired she hesitated a moment but sat down again dont let me interrupt you she added  oh dear im quite alone ive nothing on earth to do i had no idea you were in rome ive just come from the east im only passing through  youve been making a long journey said isabel who had learned from ralph that lord warburton was absent from england  yes i came abroad for six monthssoon after i saw you last ive been in turkey and asia minor i came the other day from athens he managed not to be awkward but he wasnt easy and after a longer look at the girl he came down to nature do you wish me to leave you or will you let me stay a little  she took it all humanely i dont wish you to leave me lord warburton im very glad to see you  thank you for saying that may i sit down  the fluted shaft on which she had taken her seat would have afforded a restingplace to several persons and there was plenty of room even for a highlydeveloped englishman this fine specimen of that great class seated himself near our young lady and in the course of five minutes he had asked her several questions taken rather at random and to which as he put some of them twice over he apparently somewhat missed catching the answer had given her too some information about himself which was not wasted upon her calmer feminine sense he repeated more than once that he had not expected to meet her and it was evident that the encounter touched him in a way that would have made preparation advisable he began abruptly to pass from the impunity of things to their solemnity and from their being delightful to their being impossible he was splendidly sunburnt even his multitudinous beard had been burnished by the fire of asia he was dressed in the loosefitting heterogeneous garments in which the english traveller in foreign lands is wont to consult his comfort and affirm his nationality and with his pleasant steady eyes his bronzed complexion fresh beneath its seasoning his manly figure his minimising manner and his general air of being a gentleman and an explorer he was such a representative of the british race as need not in any clime have been disavowed by those who have a kindness for it isabel noted these things and was glad she had always liked him he had kept evidently in spite of shocks every one of his meritsproperties these partaking of the essence of great decent houses as one might put it resembling their innermost fixtures and ornaments not subject to vulgar shifting and removable only by some whole breakup they talked of the matters naturally in order her uncles death ralphs state of health the way she had passed her winter her visit to rome her return to florence her plans for the summer the hotel she was staying at and then of lord warburtons own adventures movements intentions impressions and present domicile at last there was a silence and it said so much more than either had said that it scarce needed his final words ive written to you several times  written to me ive never had your letters  i never sent them i burned them up  ah laughed isabel it was better that you should do that than i  i thought you wouldnt care for them he went on with a simplicity that touched her it seemed to me that after all i had no right to trouble you with letters  i should have been very glad to have news of you you know how i hoped thatthat but she stopped there would be such a flatness in the utterance of her thought  i know what youre going to say you hoped we should always remain good friends this formula as lord warburton uttered it was certainly flat enough but then he was interested in making it appear so  she found herself reduced simply to please dont talk of all that a speech which hardly struck her as improvement on the other  its a small consolation to allow me her companion exclaimed with force  i cant pretend to console you said the girl who all still as she sat there threw herself back with a sort of inward triumph on the answer that had satisfied him so little six months before he was pleasant he was powerful he was gallant there was no better man than he but her answer remained  its very well you dont try to console me it wouldnt be in your power she heard him say through the medium of her strange elation  i hoped we should meet again because i had no fear you would attempt to make me feel i had wronged you but when you do thatthe pains greater than the pleasure and she got up with a small conscious majesty looking for her companions  i dont want to make you feel that of course i cant say that i only just want you to know one or two thingsin fairness to myself as it were i wont return to the subject again i felt very strongly what i expressed to you last year i couldnt think of anything else i tried to forgetenergetically systematically i tried to take an interest in somebody else i tell you this because i want you to know i did my duty i didnt succeed it was for the same purpose i went abroadas far away as possible they say travelling distracts the mind but it didnt distract mine ive thought of you perpetually ever since i last saw you im exactly the same i love you just as much and everything i said to you then is just as true this instant at which i speak to you shows me again exactly how to my great misfortune you just insuperably charm me therei cant say less i dont mean however to insist its only for a moment i may add that when i came upon you a few minutes since without the smallest idea of seeing you i was upon my honour in the very act of wishing i knew where you were he had recovered his selfcontrol and while he spoke it became complete he might have been addressing a small committeemaking all quietly and clearly a statement of importance aided by an occasional look at a paper of notes concealed in his hat which he had not again put on and the committee assuredly would have felt the point proved  ive often thought of you lord warburton isabel answered you may be sure i shall always do that and she added in a tone of which she tried to keep up the kindness and keep down the meaning theres no harm in that on either side  they walked along together and she was prompt to ask about his sisters and request him to let them know she had done so he made for the moment no further reference to their great question but dipped again into shallower and safer waters but he wished to know when she was to leave rome and on her mentioning the limit of her stay declared he was glad it was still so distant  why do you say that if you yourself are only passing through she enquired with some anxiety  ah when i said i was passing through i didnt mean that one would treat rome as if it were clapham junction to pass through rome is to stop a week or two  say frankly that you mean to stay as long as i do  his flushed smile for a little seemed to sound her you wont like that youre afraid youll see too much of me  it doesnt matter what i like i certainly cant expect you to leave this delightful place on my account but i confess im afraid of you  afraid ill begin again i promise to be very careful  they had gradually stopped and they stood a moment face to face poor lord warburton she said with a compassion intended to be good for both of them  poor lord warburton indeed but ill be careful  you may be unhappy but you shall not make me so that i cant allow  if i believed i could make you unhappy i think i should try it at this she walked in advance and he also proceeded ill never say a word to displease you  very good if you do our friendships at an end  perhaps some dayafter a whileyoull give me leave  give you leave to make me unhappy  he hesitated to tell you again but he checked himself ill keep it down ill keep it down always  ralph touchett had been joined in his visit to the excavation by miss stackpole and her attendant and these three now emerged from among the mounds of earth and stone collected round the aperture and came into sight of isabel and her companion poor ralph hailed his friend with joy qualified by wonder and henrietta exclaimed in a high voice gracious theres that lord ralph and his english neighbour greeted with the austerity with which after long separations english neighbours greet and miss stackpole rested her large intellectual gaze upon the sunburnt traveller but she soon established her relation to the crisis i dont suppose you remember me sir  indeed i do remember you said lord warburton i asked you to come and see me and you never came  i dont go everywhere im asked miss stackpole answered coldly  ah well i wont ask you again laughed the master of lockleigh  if you do ill go so be sure  lord warburton for all his hilarity seemed sure enough mr bantling had stood by without claiming a recognition but he now took occasion to nod to his lordship who answered him with a friendly oh you here bantling and a handshake  well said henrietta i didnt know you knew him  i guess you dont know every one i know mr bantling rejoined facetiously  i thought that when an englishman knew a lord he always told you  ah im afraid bantling was ashamed of me lord warburton laughed again isabel took pleasure in that note she gave a small sigh of relief as they kept their course homeward  the next day was sunday she spent her morning over two long lettersone to her sister lily the other to madame merle but in neither of these epistles did she mention the fact that a rejected suitor had threatened her with another appeal of a sunday afternoon all good romans and the best romans are often the northern barbarians follow the custom of going to vespers at saint peters and it had been agreed among our friends that they would drive together to the great church after lunch an hour before the carriage came lord warburton presented himself at the hotel de paris and paid a visit to the two ladies ralph touchett and mr bantling having gone out together the visitor seemed to have wished to give isabel a proof of his intention to keep the promise made her the evening before he was both discreet and franknot even dumbly importunate or remotely intense he thus left her to judge what a mere good friend he could be he talked about his travels about persia about turkey and when miss stackpole asked him whether it would pay for her to visit those countries assured her they offered a great field to female enterprise isabel did him justice but she wondered what his purpose was and what he expected to gain even by proving the superior strain of his sincerity if he expected to melt her by showing what a good fellow he was he might spare himself the trouble she knew the superior strain of everything about him and nothing he could now do was required to light the view moreover his being in rome at all affected her as a complication of the wrong sortshe liked so complications of the right nevertheless when on bringing his call to a close he said he too should be at saint peters and should look out for her and her friends she was obliged to reply that he must follow his convenience  in the church as she strolled over its tesselated acres he was the first person she encountered she had not been one of the superior tourists who are disappointed in saint peters and find it smaller than its fame the first time she passed beneath the huge leathern curtain that strains and bangs at the entrance the first time she found herself beneath the fararching dome and saw the light drizzle down through the air thickened with incense and with the reflections of marble and gilt of mosaic and bronze her conception of greatness rose and dizzily rose after this it never lacked space to soar she gazed and wondered like a child or a peasant she paid her silent tribute to the seated sublime lord warburton walked beside her and talked of saint sophia of constantinople she feared for instance that he would end by calling attention to his exemplary conduct the service had not yet begun but at saint peters there is much to observe and as there is something almost profane in the vastness of the place which seems meant as much for physical as for spiritual exercise the different figures and groups the mingled worshippers and spectators may follow their various intentions without conflict or scandal in that splendid immensity individual indiscretion carries but a short distance isabel and her companions however were guilty of none for though henrietta was obliged in candour to declare that michael angelos dome suffered by comparison with that of the capitol at washington she addressed her protest chiefly to mr bantlings ear and reserved it in its more accentuated form for the columns of the interviewer isabel made the circuit of the church with his lordship and as they drew near the choir on the left of the entrance the voices of the popes singers were borne to them over the heads of the large number of persons clustered outside the doors they paused a while on the skirts of this crowd composed in equal measure of roman cockneys and inquisitive strangers and while they stood there the sacred concert went forward ralph with henrietta and mr bantling was apparently within where isabel looking beyond the dense group in front of her saw the afternoon light silvered by clouds of incense that seemed to mingle with the splendid chant slope through the embossed recesses of high windows after a while the singing stopped and then lord warburton seemed disposed to move off with her isabel could only accompany him whereupon she found herself confronted with gilbert osmond who appeared to have been standing at a short distance behind her he now approached with all the formshe appeared to have multiplied them on this occasion to suit the place  so you decided to come she said as she put out her hand  yes i came last night and called this afternoon at your hotel they told me you had come here and i looked about for you  the others are inside she decided to say  i didnt come for the others he promptly returned  she looked away lord warburton was watching them perhaps he had heard this suddenly she remembered it to be just what he had said to her the morning he came to gardencourt to ask her to marry him mr osmonds words had brought the colour to her cheek and this reminiscence had not the effect of dispelling it she repaired any betrayal by mentioning to each companion the name of the other and fortunately at this moment mr bantling emerged from the choir cleaving the crowd with british valour and followed by miss stackpole and ralph touchett i say fortunately but this is perhaps a superficial view of the matter since on perceiving the gentleman from florence ralph touchett appeared to take the case as not committing him to joy he didnt hang back however from civility and presently observed to isabel with due benevolence that she would soon have all her friends about her miss stackpole had met mr osmond in florence but she had already found occasion to say to isabel that she liked him no better than her other admirersthan mr touchett and lord warburton and even than little mr rosier in paris i dont know what its in you she had been pleased to remark but for a nice girl you do attract the most unnatural people mr goodwoods the only one ive any respect for and hes just the one you dont appreciate  whats your opinion of saint peters mr osmond was meanwhile enquiring of our young lady  its very large and very bright she contented herself with replying  its too large it makes one feel like an atom  isnt that the right way to feel in the greatest of human temples she asked with rather a liking for her phrase  i suppose its the right way to feel everywhere when one is nobody but i like it in a church as little as anywhere else  you ought indeed to be a pope isabel exclaimed remembering something he had referred to in florence  ah i should have enjoyed that said gilbert osmond  lord warburton meanwhile had joined ralph touchett and the two strolled away together whos the fellow speaking to miss archer his lordship demanded  his names gilbert osmondhe lives in florence ralph said  what is he besides  nothing at all oh yes hes an american but one forgets thathes so little of one  has he known miss archer long  three or four weeks  does she like him  shes trying to find out  and will she  find out ralph asked  will she like him  do you mean will she accept him  yes said lord warburton after an instant i suppose thats what i horribly mean  perhaps not if one does nothing to prevent it ralph replied  his lordship stared a moment but apprehended then we must be perfectly quiet  as quiet as the grave and only on the chance ralph added  the chance she may  the chance she may not  lord warburton took this at first in silence but he spoke again is he awfully clever  awfully said ralph  his companion thought and what else  what more do you want ralph groaned  do you mean what more does she  ralph took him by the arm to turn him they had to rejoin the others she wants nothing that we can give her  ah well if she wont have you said his lordship handsomely as they went
