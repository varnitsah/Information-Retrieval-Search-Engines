69723444	the new revelation   by  arthur conan doyle    dedication  to all the brave men and women humble or learned who have the moral courage during seventy years to face ridicule or worldly disadvantage in order to testify to an allimportant truth  march 1918     preface  many more philosophic minds than mine have thought over the religious side of this subject and many more scientific brains have turned their attention to its phenomenal aspect  so far as i know however there has been no former attempt to show the exact relation of the one to the other  i feel that if i should succeed in making this a little more clear i shall have helped in what i regard as far the most important question with which the human race is concerned  a celebrated psychic mrs piper uttered in the year 1899 words which were recorded by dr hodgson at the time  she was speaking in trance upon the future of spiritual religion and she said  in the next century this will be astonishingly perceptible to the minds of men  i will also make a statement which you will surely see verified  before the clear revelation of spirit communication there will be a terrible war in different parts of the world  the entire world must be purified and cleansed before mortal can see through his spiritual vision his friends on this side and it will take just this line of action to bring about a state of perfection  friend kindly think of this  we have had the terrible war in different parts of the world  the second half remains to be fulfilled  a c d   1918     contents  chapter     i  the search

revelation     chapter i  the search   the subject of psychical research is one upon which i have thought more and about which i have been slower to form my opinion than upon any other subject whatever  every now and then as one jogs along through life some small incident happens which very forcibly brings home the fact that time passes and that first youth and then middle age are slipping away  such a one occurred the other day  there is a column in that excellent little paper light which is devoted to what was recorded on the corresponding date a generationthat is thirty yearsago  as i read over this column recently i had quite a start as i saw my own name and read the reprint of a letter which i had written in 1887 detailing some interesting spiritual experience which had occurred in a seance thus it is manifest that my interest in the subject is of some standing and also since it is only within the last year or two that i have finally declared myself to be satisfied with the evidence that i have not been hasty in forming my opinion  if i set down some of my experiences and difficulties my readers will not i hope think it egotistical upon my part but will realise that it is the most graphic way in which to sketch out the points which are likely to occur to any other inquirer  when i have passed over this ground it will be possible to get on to something more general and impersonal in its nature  when i had finished my medical education in 1882 i found myself like many young medical men a convinced materialist as regards our personal destiny  i had never ceased to be an earnest theist because it seemed to me that napoleons question to the atheistic professors on the starry night as he voyaged to egypt who was it gentlemen who made these stars has never been answered  to say that the universe was made by immutable laws only put the question one degree further back as to who made the laws  i did not of course believe in an anthropomorphic god but i believed then as i believe now in an intelligent force behind all the operations of naturea force so infinitely complex and great that my finite brain could get no further than its existence  right and wrong i saw also as great obvious facts which needed no divine revelation  but when it came to a question of our little personalities surviving death it seemed to me that the whole analogy of nature was against it  when the candle burns out the light disappears  when the electric cell is shattered the current stops  when the body dissolves there is an end of the matter  each man in his egotism may feel that he ought to survive but let him look we will say at the average loaferof high or low degreewould anyone contend that there was any obvious reason why that personality should carry on  it seemed to be a delusion and i was convinced that death did indeed end all though i saw no reason why that should affect our duty towards humanity during our transitory existence  this was my frame of mind when spiritual phenomena first came before my notice  i had always regarded the subject as the greatest nonsense upon earth and i had read of the conviction of fraudulent mediums and wondered how any sane man could believe such things  i met some friends however who were interested in the matter and i sat with them at some tablemoving seances  we got connected messages  i am afraid the only result that they had on my mind was that i regarded these friends with some suspicion  they were long messages very often spelled out by tilts and it was quite impossible that they came by chance  someone then was moving the table  i thought it was they they probably thought that i did it  i was puzzled and worried over it for they were not people whom i could imagine as cheatingand yet i could not see how the messages could come except by conscious pressure  about this timeit would be in 1886i came across a book called the reminiscences of judge edmunds  he was a judge of the us high courts and a man of high standing  the book gave an account of how his wife had died and how he had been able for many years to keep in touch with her  all sorts of details were given  i read the book with interest and absolute scepticism  it seemed to me an example of how a hard practical man might have a weak side to his brain a sort of reaction as it were against those plain facts of life with which he had to deal  where was this spirit of which he talked  suppose a man had an accident and cracked his skull his whole character would change and a high nature might become a low one with alcohol or opium or many other drugs one could apparently quite change a mans spirit  the spirit then depended upon matter  these were the arguments which i used in those days  i did not realise that it was not the spirit that was changed in such cases but the body through which the spirit worked just as it would be no argument against the existence of a musician if you tampered with his violin so that only discordant notes could come through  i was sufficiently interested to continue to read such literature as came in my way  i was amazed to find what a number of great menmen whose names were to the fore in sciencethoroughly believed that spirit was independent of matter and could survive it  when i regarded spiritualism as a vulgar delusion of the uneducated i could afford to look down upon it but when it was endorsed by men like crookes whom i knew to be the most rising british chemist by wallace who was the rival of darwin and by flammarion the best known of astronomers i could not afford to dismiss it it was all very well to throw down the books of these men which contained their mature conclusions and careful investigations and to say well he has one weak spot in his brain but a man has to be very selfsatisfied if the day does not come when he wonders if the weak spot is not in his own brain  for some time i was sustained in my scepticism by the consideration that many famous men such as darwin himself huxley tyndall and herbert spencer derided this new branch of knowledge but when i learned that their derision had reached such a point that they would not even examine it and that spencer had declared in so many words that he had decided against it on a priori grounds while huxley had said that it did not interest him i was bound to admit that however great they were in science their action in this respect was most unscientific and dogmatic while the action of those who studied the phenomena and tried to find out the laws that governed them was following the true path which has given us all human advance and knowledge  so far i had got in my reasoning so my sceptical position was not so solid as before  it was somewhat reinforced however by my own experiences  it is to be remembered that i was working without a medium which is like an astronomer working without a telescope  i have no psychical powers myself and those who worked with me had little more among us we could just muster enough of the magnetic force or whatever you will call it to get the table movements with their suspicious and often stupid messages  i still have notes of those sittings and copies of some at least of the messages  they were not always absolutely stupid  for example i find that on one occasion on my asking some test question such as how many coins i had in my pocket the table spelt out  we are here to educate and to elevate not to guess riddles  and then the religious frame of mind not the critical is what we wish to inculcate now no one could say that that was a puerile message on the other hand i was always haunted by the fear of involuntary pressure from the hands of the sitters then there came an incident which puzzled and disgusted me very much  we had very good conditions one evening and an amount of movement which seemed quite independent of our pressure  long and detailed messages came through which purported to be from a spirit who gave his name and said he was a commercial traveller who bad lost his life in a recent fire at a theatre at exeter  all the details were exact and he implored us to write to his family who lived he said at a place called slattenmere in cumberland  i did so but my letter came back appropriately enough through the dead letter office  to this day i do not know whether we were deceived or whether there was some mistake in the name of the place but there are the facts and i was so disgusted that for some time my interest in the whole subject waned  it was one thing to study a subject but when the subject began to play elaborate practical jokes it seemed time to call a halt  if there is such a place as slattenmere in the world i should even now be glad to know it  i was in practice in southsea at this time and dwelling there was general drayson a man of very remarkable character and one of the pioneers of spiritualism in this country  to him i went with my difficulties and he listened to them very patiently he made light of my criticism of the foolish nature of many of these messages and of the absolute falseness of some  you have not got the fundamental truth into your head said he  that truth is that every spirit in the flesh passes over to the next world exactly as it is with no change whatever  this world is full of weak or foolish people  so is the next  you need not mix with them any more than you do in this world one chooses ones companions  but suppose a man in this world who had lived in his house alone and never mixed with his fellows was at last to put his head out of the window to see what sort of place it was what would happen  some naughty boy would probably say something rude  anyhow he would see nothing of the wisdom or greatness of the world  he would draw his head in thinking it was a very poor place that is just what you have done  in a mixed seance with no definite aim you have thrust your head into the next world and you have met some naughty boys  go forward and try to reach something better that was general draysons explanation and though it did not satisfy me at the time i think now that it was a rough approximation to the truth  these were my first steps in spiritualism  i was still a sceptic but at least i was an inquirer and when i heard some oldfashioned critic saying that there was nothing to explain and that it was all fraud or that a conjuror was needed to show it up i knew at least that that was all nonsense  it is true that my own evidence up to then was not enough to convince me but my reading which was continuous showed me how deeply other men had gone into it and i recognised that the testimony was so strong that no other religious movement in the world could put forward anything to compare with it that did not prove it to be true but at least it proved that it must be treated with respect and could not be brushed aside  take a single incident of what wallace has truly called a modern miracle  i choose it because it is the most incredible  i allude to the assertion that d d homewho by the way was not as is usually supposed a paid adventurer but was the nephew of the earl of homethe assertion i say that he floated out of one window and into another at the height of seventy feet above the ground  i could not believe it  and yet when i knew that the fact was attested by three eyewitnesses who were lord dunraven lord lindsay and captain wynne all men of honour and repute who were willing afterwards to take their oath upon it i could not but admit that the evidence for this was more direct than for any of those faroff events which the whole world has agreed to accept as true  i still continued during these years to hold table seances which sometimes gave no results sometimes trivial ones and sometimes rather surprising ones  i have still the notes of these sittings and i extract here the results of one which were definite and which were so unlike any conceptions which i held of life beyond the grave that they amused rather than edified me at the time  i find now however that they agree very closely with the revelations in raymond and in other later accounts so that i view them with different eyes  i am aware that all these accounts of life beyond the grave differ in detaili suppose any of our accounts of the present life would differ in detailbut in the main there is a very great resemblance which in this instance was very far from the conception either of myself or of either of the two ladies who made up the circle  two communicators sent messages the first of whom spelt out as a name dorothy postlethwaite a name unknown to any of us she said she died at melbourne five years before at the age of sixteen that she was now happy that she had work to do and that she had been at the same school as one of the ladies  on my asking that lady to raise her hands and give a succession of names the table tilted at the correct name of the head mistress of the school  this seemed in the nature of a test she went on to say that the sphere she inhabited was all round the earth that she knew about the planets that mars was inhabited by a race more advanced than us and that the canals were artificial there was no bodily pain in her sphere but there could be mental anxiety they were governed they took nourishment she had been a catholic and was still a catholic but had not fared better than the protestants there were buddhists and mohammedans in her sphere but all fared alike she had never seen christ and knew no more about him than on earth but believed in his influence spirits prayed and they died in their new sphere before entering another they had pleasuresmusic was among them  it was a place of light and of laughter she added that they had no rich or poor and that the general conditions were far happier than on earth  this lady bade us goodnight and immediately the table was seized by a much more robust influence which dashed it about very violently  in answer to my questions it claimed to be the spirit of one whom i will call dodd who was a famous cricketer and with whom i had some serious conversation in cairo before he went up the nile where he met his death in the dongolese expedition  we have now i may remark come to the year 1896 in my experiences  dodd was not known to either lady  i began to ask him questions exactly as if he were seated before me and he sent his answers back with great speed and decision  the answers were often quite opposed to what i expected so that i could not believe that i was influencing them  he said that he was happy that he did not wish to return to earth he had been a freethinker but had not suffered in the next life for that reason  prayer however was a good thing as keeping us in touch with the spiritual world  if he had prayed more he would have been higher in the spirit world  this i may remark seemed rather in conflict with his assertion that he had not suffered through being a freethinker and yet of course many men neglect prayer who are not freethinkers  his death was painless  he remembered the death of polwhele a young officer who died before him  when he dodd died he had found people to welcome him but polwhele had not been among them  he had work to do  he was aware of the fall of dongola but had not been present in spirit at the banquet at cairo afterwards  he knew more than he did in life  he remembered our conversation in cairo duration of life in the next sphere was shorter than on earth  he had not seen general gordon nor any other famous spirit  spirits lived in families and in communities  married people did not necessarily meet again but those who loved each other did meet again  i have given this synopsis of a communication to show the kind of thing we gotthough this was a very favourable specimen both for length and for coherence it shows that it is not just to say as many critics say that nothing but folly comes through  there was no folly here unless we call everything folly which does not agree with preconceived ideas  on the other hand what proof was there that these statements were true  i could see no such proof and they simply left me bewildered  now with a larger experience in which i find that the same sort of information has come to very many people independently in many lands i think that the agreement of the witnesses does as in all cases of evidence constitute some argument for their truth  at the time i could not fit such a conception of the future world into my own scheme of philosophy and i merely noted it and passed on  i continued to read many books upon the subject and to appreciate more and more what a cloud of witnesses existed and how careful their observations had been this impressed my mind very much more than the limited phenomena which came within the reach of our circle  then or afterwards i read a book by monsieur jacolliot upon occult phenomena in india jacolliot was chief judge of the french colony of crandenagur with a very judicial mind but rather biassedsic against spiritualism  he conducted a series of experiments with native fakirs who gave him their confidence because he was a sympathetic man and spoke their language  he describes the pains he took to eliminate fraud  to cut a long story short he found among them every phenomenon of advanced european mediumship everything which home for example had ever done  he got levitation of the body the handling of fire movement of articles at a distance rapid growth of plants raising of tables  their explanation of these phenomena was that they were done by the pitris or spirits and their only difference in procedure from ours seemed to be that they made more use of direct evocation  they claimed that these powers were handed down from time immemorial and traced back to the chaldees  all this impressed me very much as here independently we had exactly the same results without any question of american frauds or modern vulgarity which were so often raised against similar phenomena in europe  my mind was also influenced about this time by the report of the dialectical society although this report had been presented as far back as 1869  it is a very cogent paper and though it was received with a chorus of ridicule by the ignorant and materialistic papers of those days it was a document of great value  the society was formed by a number of people of good standing and open mind to enquire into the physical phenomena of spiritualism  a full account of their experiences and of their elaborate precautions against fraud are given after reading the evidence one fails to see how they could have come to any other conclusion than the one attained namely that the phenomena were undoubtedly genuine and that they pointed to laws and forces which had not been explored by science  it is a most singular fact that if the verdict had been against spiritualism it would certainly have been hailed as the death blow of the movement whereas being an endorsement of the phenomena it met with nothing by ridicule this has been the fate of a number of inquiries since those conducted locally at hydesville in 1848 or that which followed when professor hare of philadelphia like saint paul started forth to oppose but was forced to yield to the truth  about 1891 i had joined the psychical research society and had the advantage of reading all their reports  the world owes a great deal to the unwearied diligence of the society and to its sobriety of statement though i will admit that the latter makes one impatient at times and one feels that in their desire to avoid sensationalism they discourage the world from knowing and using the splendid work which they are doing  their semiscientific terminology also chokes off the ordinary reader and one might say sometimes after reading their articles what an american trapper in the rocky mountains said to me about some university man whom he had been escorting for the season he was that clever he said that you could not understand what he said  but in spite of these little peculiarities all of us who have wanted light in the darkness have found it by the methodical nevertiring work of the society  its influence was one of the powers which now helped me to shape my thoughts  there was another however which made a deep impression upon me  up to now i had read all the wonderful experiences of great experimenters but i had never come across any effort upon their part to build up some system which would cover and contain them all now i read that monumental book myers human personality a great root book from which a whole tree of knowledge will grow  in this book myers was unable to get any formula which covered all the phenomena called spiritual but in discussing that action of mind upon mind which he has himself called telepathy he completely proved his point and he worked it out so thoroughly with so many examples that save for those who were wilfully blind to the evidence it took its place henceforth as a scientific fact  but this was an enormous advance  if mind could act upon mind at a distance then there were some human powers which were quite different to matter as we had always understood it  the ground was cut from under the feet of the materialist and my old position had been destroyed  i had said that the flame could not exist when the candle was gone  but here was the flame a long way off the candle acting upon its own  the analogy was clearly a false analogy  if the mind the spirit the intelligence of man could operate at a distance from the body then it was a thing to that extent separate from the body  why then should it not exist on its own when the body was destroyed  not only did impressions come from a distance in the case of those who were just dead but the same evidence proved that actual appearances of the dead person came with them showing that the impressions were carried by something which was exactly like the body and yet acted independently and survived the death of the body the chain of evidence between the simplest cases of thoughtreading at one end and the actual manifestation of the spirit independently of the body at the other was one unbroken chain each phase leading to the other and this fact seemed to me to bring the first signs of systematic science and order into what had been a mere collection of bewildering and more or less unrelated facts  about this time i had an interesting experience for i was one of three delegates sent by the psychical society to sit up in a haunted house it was one of these poltergeist cases where noises and foolish tricks had gone on for some years very much like the classical case of john wesleys family at epworth in 1726 or the case of the fox family at hydesville near rochester in 1848 which was the startingpoint of modern spiritualism  nothing sensational came of our journey and yet it was not entirely barren  on the first night nothing occurred  on the second there were tremendous noises sounds like someone beating a table with a stick  we had of course taken every precaution and we could not explain the noises but at the same time we could not swear that some ingenious practical joke had not been played upon us there the matter ended for the time  some years afterwards however i met a member of the family who occupied the house and he told me that after our visit the bones of a child evidently long buried had been dug up in the garden  you must admit that this was very remarkable  haunted houses are rare and houses with buried human beings in their gardens are also we will hope rare  that they should have both united in one house is surely some argument for the truth of the phenomena  it is interesting to remember that in the case of the fox family there was also some word of human bones and evidence of murder being found in the cellar though an actual crime was never established i have little doubt that if the wesley family could have got upon speaking terms with their persecutor they would also have come upon some motive for the persecution  it almost seems as if a life cut suddenly and violently short had some store of unspent vitality which could still manifest itself in a strange mischievous fashion  later i had another singular personal experience of this sort which i may describe at the end of this argument1  1  vide appendix iii   from this period until the time of the war i continued in the leisure hours of a very busy life to devote attention to this subject  i had experience of one series of seances with very amazing results including several materializations seen in dim light as the medium was detected in trickery shortly afterwards i wiped these off entirely as evidence  at the same time i think that the presumption is very clear that in the case of some mediums like eusapia palladino they may be guilty of trickery when their powers fail them and yet at other times have very genuine gifts  mediumship in its lowest forms is a purely physical gift with no relation to morality and in many cases it is intermittent and cannot be controlled at will  eusapia was at least twice convicted of very clumsy and foolish fraud whereas she several times sustained long examinations under every possible test condition at the hands of scientific committees which contained some of the best names of france italy and england  however i personally prefer to cut my experience with a discredited medium out of my record and i think that all physical phenomena produced in the dark must necessarily lose much of their value unless they are accompanied by evidential messages as well  it is the custom of our critics to assume that if you cut out the mediums who got into trouble you would have to cut out nearly all your evidence  that is not so at all  up to the time of this incident i had never sat with a professional medium at all and yet i had certainly accumulated some evidence  the greatest medium of all mr d d home showed his phenomena in broad daylight and was ready to submit to every test and no charge of trickery was ever substantiated against him  so it was with many others  it is only fair to state in addition that when a public medium is a fair mark for notoriety hunters for amateur detectives and for sensational reporters and when he is dealing with obscure elusive phenomena and has to defend himself before juries and judges who as a rule know nothing about the conditions which influence the phenomena it would be wonderful if a man could get through without an occasional scandal  at the same time the whole system of paying by results which is practically the present system since if a medium never gets results he would soon get no payments is a vicious one  it is only when the professional medium can be guaranteed an annuity which will be independent of results that we can eliminate the strong temptation to substitute pretended phenomena when the real ones are wanting  i have now traced my own evolution of thought up to the time of the war  i can claim i hope that it was deliberate and showed no traces of that credulity with which our opponents charge us  it was too deliberate for i was culpably slow in throwing any small influence i may possess into the scale of truth  i might have drifted on for my whole life as a psychical researcher showing a sympathetic but more or less dilettante attitude towards the whole subject as if we were arguing about some impersonal thing such as the existence of atlantis or the baconian controversy  but the war came and when the war came it brought earnestness into all our souls and made us look more closely at our own beliefs and reassess their values in the presence of an agonized world hearing every day of the deaths of the flower of our race in the first promise of their unfulfilled youth seeing around one the wives and mothers who had no clear conception whither their loved ones had gone to i seemed suddenly to see that this subject with which i had so long dallied was not merely a study of a force outside the rules of science but that it was really something tremendous a breaking down of the walls between two worlds a direct undeniable message from beyond a call of hope and of guidance to the human race at the time of its deepest affliction  the objective side of it ceased to interest for having made up ones mind that it was true there was an end of the matter  the religious side of it was clearly of infinitely greater importance  the telephone bell is in itself a very childish affair but it may be the signal for a very vital message  it seemed that all these phenomena large and small had been the telephone bells which senseless in themselves had signalled to the human race rouse yourselves  stand by  be at attention  here are signs for you  they will lead up to the message which god wishes to send  it was the message not the signs which really counted  a new revelation seemed to be in the course of delivery to the human race though how far it was still in what may be called the johnthebaptist stage and how far some greater fulness and clearness might be expected hereafter was more than any man can say  my point is that the physical phenomena which have been proved up to the hilt for all who care to examine the evidence are really of no account and that their real value consists in the fact that they support and give objective reality to an immense body of knowledge which must deeply modify our previous religious views and must when properly understood and digested make religion a very real thing no longer a matter of faith but a matter of actual experience and fact  it is to this side of the question that i will now turn but i must add to my previous remarks about personal experience that since the war i have had some very exceptional opportunities of confirming all the views which i had already formed as to the truth of the general facts upon which my views are founded  these opportunities came through the fact that a lady who lived with us a miss l s developed the power of automatic writing  of all forms of mediumship this seems to me to be the one which should be tested most rigidly as it lends itself very easily not so much to deception as to selfdeception which is a more subtle and dangerous thing  is the lady herself writing or is there as she avers a power that controls her even as the chronicler of the jews in the bible averred that he was controlled  in the case of l s there is no denying that some messages proved to be not trueespecially in the matter of time they were quite unreliable  but on the other hand the numbers which did come true were far beyond what any guessing or coincidence could account for  thus when the lusitania was sunk and the morning papers here announced that so far as known there was no loss of life the medium at once wrote  it is terrible terribleand will have a great influence on the war since it was the first strong impulse which turned america towards the war the message was true in both respects  again she foretold the arrival of an important telegram upon a certain day and even gave the name of the deliverer of ita most unlikely person  altogether no one could doubt the reality of her inspiration though the lapses were notable  it was like getting a good message through a very imperfect telephone  one other incident of the early war days stands out in my memory  a lady in whom i was interested had died in a provincial town  she was a chronic invalid and morphia was found by her bedside  there was an inquest with an open verdict  eight days later i went to have a sitting with mr vout peters  after giving me a good deal which was vague and irrelevant he suddenly said there is a lady here  she is leaning upon an older woman  she keeps saying morphia  three times she has said it  her mind was clouded  she did not mean it morphia  those were almost his exact words telepathy was out of the question for i had entirely other thoughts in my mind at the time and was expecting no such message  apart from personal experiences this movement must gain great additional solidity from the wonderful literature which has sprung up around it during the last few years  if no other spiritual books were in existence than five which have appeared in the last year or soi allude to professor lodges raymond arthur hills psychical investigations professor crawfords reality of psychical phenomena professor barretts threshold of the unseen and gerald balfours ear of dionysiusthose five alone would in my opinion be sufficient to establish the facts for any reasonable enquirer  before going into this question of a new religious revelation how it is reached and what it consists of i would say a word upon one other subject  there have always been two lines of attack by our opponents the one is that our facts are not true  this i have dealt with  the other is that we are upon forbidden ground and should come off it and leave it alone  as i started from a position of comparative materialism this objection has never had any meaning for me but to others i would submit one or two considerations  the chief is that god has given us no power at all which is under no circumstances to be used  the fact that we possess it is in itself proof that it is our bounden duty to study and to develop it  it is true that this like every other power may be abused if we lose our general sense of proportion and of reason  but i repeat that its mere possession is a strong reason why it is lawful and binding that it be used  it must also be remembered that this cry of illicit knowledge backed by more or less appropriate texts has been used against every advance of human knowledge it was used against the new astronomy and galileo had actually to recant  it was used against galvani and electricity it was used against darwin who would certainly have been burned had he lived a few centuries before  it was even used against simpsons use of chloroform in childbirth on the ground that the bible declared in pain shall ye bring them forth surely a plea which has been made so often and so often abandoned cannot be regarded very seriously  to those however to whom the theological aspect is still a stumbling block i would recommend the reading of two short books each of them by clergymen the one is the rev fielding oulds is spiritualism of the devil purchasable for twopence the other is the rev arthur chambers our self after death  i can also recommend the rev charles tweedales writings upon the subject  i may add that when i first began to make public my own views one of the first letters of sympathy which i received was from the late archdeacon wilberforce  there are some theologians who are not only opposed to such a cult but who go the length of saying that the phenomena and messages come from fiends who personate our dead or pretend to be heavenly teachers it is difficult to think that those who hold this view have ever had any personal experience of the consoling and uplifting effect of such communications upon the recipient  ruskin has left it on record that his conviction of a future life came from spiritualism though he somewhat ungratefully and illogically added that having got that he wished to have no more to do with it  there are many howeverquorum pars parva suwho without any reserve can declare that they were turned from materialism to a belief in future life with all that that implies by the study of this subject  if this be the devils work one can only say that the devil seems to be a very bungling workman and to get results very far from what he might be expected to desire     chapter ii  the revelation   i can now turn with some relief to a more impersonal view of this great subject  allusion has been made to a body of fresh doctrine  whence does this come  it comes in the main through automatic writing where the hand of the human medium is controlled either by an alleged dead human being as in the case of miss julia ames or by an alleged higher teacher as in that of mr stainton moses  these written communications are supplemented by a vast number of trance utterances and by the verbal messages of spirits given through the lips of mediums sometimes it has even come by direct voices as in the numerous cases detailed by admiral usborne moore in his book the voices  occasionally it has come through the family circle and tabletilting as for example in the two cases i have previously detailed within my own experience  sometimes as in a case recorded by mrs de morgan it has come through the hand of a child  now of course we are at once confronted with the obvious objectionhow do we know that these messages are really from beyond how do we know that the medium is not consciously writing or if that be improbable that he or she is unconsciously writing them by his or her own higher self  this is a perfectly just criticism and it is one which we must rigorously apply in every case since if the whole world is to become full of minor prophets each of them stating their own views of the religious state with no proof save their own assertion we should indeed be back in the dark ages of implicit faith  the answer must be that we require signs which we can test before we accept assertions which we cannot test  in old days they demanded a sign from a prophet and it was a perfectly reasonable request and still holds good  if a person comes to me with an account of life in some further world and has no credentials save his own assertion i would rather have it in my wastepaperbasket than on my study table  life is too short to weigh the merits of such productions  but if as in the case of stainton moses with his spirit teachings the doctrines which are said to come from beyond are accompanied with a great number of abnormal giftsand stainton moses was one of the greatest mediums in all ways that england has ever producedthen i look upon the matter in a more serious light  again if miss julia ames can tell mr stead things in her own earth life of which he could not have cognisance and if those things are shown when tested to be true then one is more inclined to think that those things which cannot be tested are true also  or once again if raymond can tell us of a photograph no copy of which had reached england and which proved to be exactly as he described it and if he can give us through the lips of strangers all sorts of details of his home life which his own relatives had to verify before they found them to be true is it unreasonable to suppose that he is fairly accurate in his description of his own experiences and state of life at the very moment at which he is communicating  or when mr arthur hill receives messages from folk of whom he never heard and afterwards verifies that they are true in every detail is it not a fair inference that they are speaking truths also when they give any light upon their present condition  the cases are manifold and i mention only a few of them but my point is that the whole of this system from the lowest physical phenomenon of a tablerap up to the most inspired utterance of a prophet is one complete whole each attached to the next one and that when the humbler end of that chain was placed in the hand of humanity it was in order that they might by diligence and reason feel their way up it until they reached the revelation which waited in the end  do not sneer at the humble beginnings the heaving table or the flying tambourine however much such phenomena may have been abused or simulated but remember that a falling apple taught us gravity a boiling kettle brought us the steam engine and the twitching leg of a frog opened up the train of thought and experiment which gave us electricity so the lowly manifestations of hydesville have ripened into results which have engaged the finest group of intellects in this country during the last twenty years and which are destined in my opinion to bring about far the greatest development of human experience which the world has ever seen  it has been asserted by men for whose opinion i have a deep regardnotably by sir william barrattthat psychical research is quite distinct from religion  certainly it is so in the sense that a man might be a very good psychical researcher but a very bad man  but the results of psychical research the deductions which we may draw and the lessons we may learn teach us of the continued life of the soul of the nature of that life and of how it is influenced by our conduct here  if this is distinct from religion i must confess that i do not understand the distinction to me it is religionthe very essence of it  but that does not mean that it will necessarily crystallise into a new religion  personally i trust that it will not do so  surely we are disunited enough already  rather would i see it the great unifying force the one provable thing connected with every religion christian or nonchristian forming the common solid basis upon which each raises if it must needs raise that separate system which appeals to the varied types of mind  the southern races will always demand what is less austere than the north the west will always be more critical than the east  one cannot shape all to a level conformity  but if the broad premises which are guaranteed by this teaching from beyond are accepted then the human race has made a great stride towards religious peace and unity  the question which faces us then is how will this influence bear upon the older organised religions and philosophies which have influenced the actions of men  the answer is that to only one of these religions or philosophies is this new revelation absolutely fatal  that is to materialism  i do not say this in any spirit of hostility to materialists who so far as they are an organized body are i think as earnest and moral as any other class  but the fact is manifest that if spirit can live without matter then the foundation of materialism is gone and the whole scheme of thought crashes to the ground  as to other creeds it must be admitted that an acceptance of the teaching brought to us from beyond would deeply modify conventional christianity  but these modifications would be rather in the direction of explanation and development than of contradiction  it would set right grave misunderstandings which have always offended the reason of every thoughtful man but it would also confirm and make absolutely certain the fact of life after death the base of all religion  it would confirm the unhappy results of sin though it would show that those results are never absolutely permanent  it would confirm the existence of higher beings whom we have called angels and of an everascending hierarchy above us in which the christ spirit finds its place culminating in heights of the infinite with which we associate the idea of allpower or of god  it would confirm the idea of heaven and of a temporary penal state which corresponds to purgatory rather than to hell  thus this new revelation on some of the most vital points is not destructive of the beliefs and it should be hailed by really earnest men of all creeds as a most powerful ally rather than a dangerous devilbegotten enemy  on the other hand let us turn to the points in which christianity must be modified by this new revelation  first of all i would say this which must be obvious to many however much they deplore it christianity must change or must perish  that is the law of lifethat things must adapt themselves or perish christianity has deferred the change very long she has deferred it until her churches are half empty until women are her chief supporters and until both the learned part of the community on one side and the poorest class on the other both in town and country are largely alienated from her  let us try and trace the reason for this it is apparent in all sects and comes therefore from some deep common cause  people are alienated because they frankly do not believe the facts as presented to them to be true their reason and their sense of justice are equally offended  one can see no justice in a vicarious sacrifice nor in the god who could be placated by such means  above all many cannot understand such expressions as the redemption from sin cleansed by the blood of the lamb and so forth  so long as there was any question of the fall of man there was at least some sort of explanation of such phrases but when it became certain that man had never fallenwhen with ever fuller knowledge we could trace our ancestral course down through the caveman and the driftman back to that shadowy and faroff time when the manlike ape slowly evolved into the apelike manlooking back on all this vast succession of life we knew that it had always been rising from step to step  never was there any evidence of a fall  but if there were no fall then what became of the atonement of the redemption of original sin of a large part of christian mystical philosophy  even if it were as reasonable in itself as it is actually unreasonable it would still be quite divorced from the facts  again too much seemed to be made of christs death  it is no uncommon thing to die for an idea every religion has equally had its martyrs men die continually for their convictions  thousands of our lads are doing it at this instant in france  therefore the death of christ beautiful as it is in the gospel narrative has seemed to assume an undue importance as though it were an isolated phenomenon for a man to die in pursuit of a reform  in my opinion far too much stress has been laid upon christs death and far too little upon his life  that was where the true grandeur and the true lesson lay  it was a life which even in those limited records shows us no trait which is not beautifula life full of easy tolerance for others of kindly charity of broadminded moderation of gentle courage always progressive and open to new ideas and yet never bitter to those ideas which he was really supplanting though he did occasionally lose his temper with their more bigoted and narrow supporters especially one loves his readiness to get at the spirit of religion sweeping aside the texts and the forms never had anyone such a robust common sense or such a sympathy for weakness  it was this most wonderful and uncommon life and not his death which is the true centre of the christian religion  now let us look at the light which we get from the spirit guides upon this question of christianity opinion is not absolutely uniform yonder any more than it is here but reading a number of messages upon this subject they amount to this  there are many higher spirits with our departed  they vary in degree  call them angels and you are in touch with old religious thought  high above all these is the greatest spirit of whom they have cognizancenot god since god is so infinite that he is not within their kenbut one who is nearer god and to that extent represents god  this is the christ spirit  his special care is the earth he came down upon it at a time of great earthly depravitya time when the world was almost as wicked as it is now in order to give the people the lesson of an ideal life  then he returned to his own high station having left an example which is still occasionally followed  that is the story of christ as spirits have described it there is nothing here of atonement or redemption  but there is a perfectly feasible and reasonable scheme which i for one could readily believe  if such a view of christianity were generally accepted and if it were enforced by assurance and demonstration from the new revelation which is coming to us from the other side then we should have a creed which might unite the churches which might be reconciled to science which might defy all attacks and which might carry the christian faith on for an indefinite period  reason and faith would at last be reconciled a nightmare would be lifted from our minds and spiritual peace would prevail  i do not see such results coming as a sudden conquest or a violent revolution  rather will it come as a peaceful penetration as some crude ideas such as the eternal hell idea have already gently faded away within our own lifetime  it is however when the human soul is ploughed and harrowed by suffering that the seeds of truth may be planted and so some future spiritual harvest will surely rise from the days in which we live  when i read the new testament with the knowledge which i have of spiritualism i am left with a deep conviction that the teaching of christ was in many most important respects lost by the early church and has not come down to us  all these allusions to a conquest over death have as it seems to me little meaning in the present christian philosophy whereas for those who have seen however dimly through the veil and touched however slightly the outstretched hands beyond death has indeed been conquered  when we read so many references to the phenomena with which we are familiar the levitations the tongues of fire the rushing wind the spiritual gifts the working of wonders we feel that the central fact of all the continuity of life and the communication with the dead was most certainly known  our attention is arrested by such a saying as  here he worked no wonders because the people were wanting in faith  is this not absolutely in accordance with psychic law as we know it  or when christ on being touched by the sick woman said  who has touched me  much virtue has passed out of me  could he say more clearly what a healing medium would say now save that he would use the word power instead of virtue or when we read try the spirits whether they be of god is it not the very advice which would now be given to a novice approaching a seance  it is too large a question for me to do more than indicate but i believe that this subject which the more rigid christian churches now attack so bitterly is really the central teaching of christianity itself  to those who would read more upon this line of thought i strongly recommend dr abraham wallaces jesus of nazareth if this valuable little work is not out of print  he demonstrates in it most convincingly that christs miracles were all within the powers of psychic law as we now understand it and were on the exact lines of such law even in small details  two examples have already been given  many are worked out in that pamphlet  one which convinced me as a truth was the thesis that the story of the materialization of the two prophets upon the mountain was extraordinarily accurate when judged by psychic law  there is the fact that peter james and john who formed the psychic circle when the dead was restored to life and were presumably the most helpful of the group were taken  then there is the choice of the high pure air of the mountain the drowsiness of the attendant mediums the transfiguring the shining robes the cloud the words  let us make three tabernacles with its alternate reading  let us make three booths or cabinets the ideal way of condensing power and producing materializationsall these make a very consistent theory of the nature of the proceedings  for the rest the list of gifts which st paul gives as being necessary for the christian disciple is simply the list of gifts of a very powerful medium including prophecy healing causing miracles or physical phenomena clairvoyance and other powers i corinth xii 8 11  the early christian church was saturated with spiritualism and they seem to have paid no attention to those old testament prohibitions which were meant to keep these powers only for the use and profit of the priesthood     chapter iii  the coming life   now leaving this large and possibly contentious subject of the modifications which such new revelations must produce in christianity let us try to follow what occurs to man after death  the evidence on this point is fairly full and consistent  messages from the dead have been received in many lands at various times mixed up with a good deal about this world which we could verify  when messages come thus it is only fair i think to suppose that if what we can test is true then what we cannot test is true also  when in addition we find a very great uniformity in the messages and an agreement as to details which are not at all in accordance with any preexisting scheme of thought then i think the presumption of truth is very strong  it is difficult to think that some fifteen or twenty messages from various sources of which i have personal notes all agree and yet are all wrong nor is it easy to suppose that spirits can tell the truth about our world but untruth about their own  i received lately in the same week two accounts of life in the next world one received through the hand of the near relative of a high dignitary of the church while the other came through the wife of a working mechanician in scotland  neither could have been aware of the existence of the other and yet the two accounts are so alike as to be practically the same2  2  vide appendix ii   the message upon these points seems to me to be infinitely reassuring whether we regard our own fate or that of our friends  the departed all agree that passing is usually both easy and painless and followed by an enormous reaction of peace and ease  the individual finds himself in a spirit body which is the exact counterpart of his old one save that all disease weakness or deformity has passed from it this body is standing or floating beside the old body and conscious both of it and of the surrounding people  at this moment the dead man is nearer to matter than he will ever be again and hence it is that at that moment the greater part of those cases occur where his thoughts having turned to someone in the distance the spirit body went with the thoughts and was manifest to the person  out of some 250 cases carefully examined by mr gurney 134 of such apparitions were actually at this moment of dissolution when one could imagine that the new spirit body was possibly so far material as to be more visible to a sympathetic human eye than it would later become  these cases however are very rare in comparison with the total number of deaths  in most cases i imagine that the dead man is too preoccupied with his own amazing experience to have much thought for others he soon finds to his surprise that though he endeavours to communicate with those whom he sees his ethereal voice and his ethereal touch are equally unable to make any impression upon those human organs which are only attuned to coarser stimuli  it is a fair subject for speculation whether a fuller knowledge of those light rays which we know to exist on either side of the spectrum or of those sounds which we can prove by the vibrations of a diaphragm to exist although they are too high for mortal ear may not bring us some further psychical knowledge  setting that aside however let us follow the fortunes of the departing spirit  he is presently aware that there are others in the room besides those who were there in life and among these others who seem to him as substantial as the living there appear familiar faces and he finds his hand grasped or his lips kissed by those whom he had loved and lost  then in their company and with the help and guidance of some more radiant being who has stood by and waited for the newcomer he drifts to his own surprise through all solid obstacles and out upon his new life  this is a definite statement and this is the story told by one after the other with a consistency which impels belief  it is already very different from any old theology  the spirit is not a glorified angel or goblin damned but it is simply the person himself containing all his strength and weakness his wisdom and his folly exactly as he has retained his personal appearance  we can well believe that the most frivolous and foolish would be awed into decency by so tremendous an experience but impressions soon become blunted the old nature may soon reassert itself in new surroundings and the frivolous still survive as our seance rooms can testify  and now before entering upon his new life the new spirit has a period of sleep which varies in its length sometimes hardly existing at all at others extending for weeks or months  raymond said that his lasted for six days  that was the period also in a case of which i had some personal evidence  mr myers on the other hand said that he had a very prolonged period of unconsciousness  i could imagine that the length is regulated by the amount of trouble or mental preoccupation of this life the longer rest giving the better means of wiping this out probably the little child would need no such interval at all  this of course is pure speculation but there is a considerable consensus of opinion as to the existence of a period of oblivion after the first impression of the new life and before entering upon its duties  having wakened from this sleep the spirit is weak as the child is weak after earth birth  soon however strength returns and the new life begins  this leads us to the consideration of heaven and hell hell i may say drops out altogether as it has long dropped out of the thoughts of every reasonable man  this odious conception so blasphemous in its view of the creator arose from the exaggerations of oriental phrases and may perhaps have been of service in a coarse age where men were frightened by fires as wild beasts are seared by the travellers  hell as a permanent place does not exist  but the idea of punishment of purifying chastisement in fact of purgatory is justified by the reports from the other side  without such punishment there could be no justice in the universe for how impossible it would be to imagine that the fate of a rasputin is the same as that of a father damien  the punishment is very certain and very serious though in its less severe forms it only consists in the fact that the grosser souls are in lower spheres with a knowledge that their own deeds have placed them there but also with the hope that expiation and the help of those above them will educate them and bring them level with the others in this saving process the higher spirits find part of their employment  miss julia ames in her beautiful posthumous book says in memorable words  the greatest joy of heaven is emptying hell  setting aside those probationary spheres which should perhaps rather be looked upon as a hospital for weakly souls than as a penal community the reports from the other world are all agreed as to the pleasant conditions of life in the beyond  they agree that like goes to like that all who love or who have interests in common are united that life is full of interest and of occupation and that they would by no means desire to return  all of this is surely tidings of great joy and i repeat that it is not a vague faith or hope but that it is supported by all the laws of evidence which agree that where many independent witnesses give a similar account that account has a claim to be considered a true one  if it were an account of glorified souls purged instantly from all human weakness and of a constant ecstasy of adoration round the throne of the all powerful it might well be suspected as being the mere reflection of that popular theology which all the mediums had equally received in their youth  it is however very different to any preexisting system  it is also supported as i have already pointed out not merely by the consistency of the accounts but by the fact that the accounts are the ultimate product of a long series of phenomena all of which have been attested as true by those who have carefully examined them  in connection with the general subject of life after death people may say we have got this knowledge already through faith  but faith however beautiful in the individual has always in collective bodies been a very twoedged quality  all would be well if every faith were alike and the intuitions of the human race were constant  we know that it is not so  faith means to say that you entirely believe a thing which you cannot prove  one man says  my faith is this  another says  my faith is that neither can prove it so they wrangle for ever either mentally or in the old days physically  if one is stronger than the other he is inclined to persecute him just to twist him round to the true faith  because philip the seconds faith was strong and clear he quite logically killed a hundred thousand lowlanders in the hope that their fellow countrymen would be turned to the allimportant truth  now if it were recognised that it is by no means virtuous to claim what you could not prove we should then be driven to observe facts to reason from them and perhaps reach common agreement  that is why this psychical movement appears so valuable its feet are on something more solid than texts or traditions or intuitions  it is religion from the double point of view of both worlds up to date instead of the ancient traditions of one world  we cannot look upon this coming world as a tidy dutch garden of a place which is so exact that it can easily be described  it is probable that those messengers who come back to us are all more or less in one state of development and represent the same wave of life as it recedes from our shores communications usually come from those who have not long passed over and tend to grow fainter as one would expect  it is instructive in this respect to notice that christs reappearances to his disciples or to paul are said to have been within a very few years of his death and that there is no claim among the early christians to have seen him later  the cases of spirits who give good proof of authenticity and yet have passed some time are not common  there is in mr dawson rogers life a very good case of a spirit who called himself manton and claimed to have been born at lawrence lydiard and buried at stoke newington in 1677 it was clearly shown afterwards that there was such a man and that he was oliver cromwells chaplain  so far as my own reading goes this is the oldest spirit who is on record as returning and generally they are quite recent  hence one gets all ones views from the one generation as it were and we cannot take them as final but only as partial  how spirits may see things in a different light as they progress in the other world is shown by miss julia ames who was deeply impressed at first by the necessity of forming a bureau of communication but admitted after fifteen years that not one spirit in a million among the main body upon the further side ever wanted to communicate with us at all since their own loved ones had come over she had been misled by the fact that when she first passed over everyone she met was newly arrived like herself  thus the account we give may be partial but still such as it is it is very consistent and of extraordinary interest since it refers to our own destiny and that of those we love  all agree that life beyond is for a limited period after which they pass on to yet other phases but apparently there is more communication between these phases than there is between us and spiritland  the lower cannot ascend but the higher can descend at will  the life has a close analogy to that of this world at it its best  it is preeminently a life of the mind as this is of the body  preoccupations of food money lust pain etc are of the body and are gone  music the arts intellectual and spiritual knowledge and progress have increased  the people are clothed as one would expect since there is no reason why modesty should disappear with our new forms  these new forms are the absolute reproduction of the old ones at their best the young growing up and the old reverting until all come to the normal  people live in communities as one would expect if like attracts like and the male spirit still finds his true mate though there is no sexuality in the grosser sense and no childbirth  since connections still endure and those in the same state of development keep abreast one would expect that nations are still roughly divided from each other though language is no longer a bar since thought has become a medium of conversation  how close is the connection between kindred souls over there is shown by the way in which myers gurney and roden noel all friends and coworkers on earth sent messages together through mrs holland who knew none of them each message being characteristic to those who knew the men in lifeor the way in which professor verrall and professor butcher both famous greek scholars collaborated to produce the greek problem which has been analysed by mr gerald balfour in the ear of dionysius with the result that that excellent authority testified that the effect could have been attained by no other entities save only verrall and butcher  it may be remarked in passing that these and other examples show clearly either that the spirits have the use of an excellent reference library or else that they have memories which produce something like omniscience  no human memory could possibly carry all the exact quotations which occur in such communications as the ear of dionysius  these roughly speaking are the lines of the life beyond in its simplest expression for it is not all simple and we catch dim glimpses of endless circles below descending into gloom and endless circles above ascending into glory all improving all purposeful all intensely alive  all are agreed that no religion upon earth has any advantage over another but that character and refinement are everything  at the same time all are also in agreement that all religions which inculcate prayer and an upward glance rather than eyes for ever on the level are good  in this sense and in no otheras a help to spiritual lifeevery form may have a purpose for somebody  if to twirl a brass cylinder forces the thibetan to admit that there is something higher than his mountains and more precious than his yaks then to that extent it is good  we must not be censorious in such matters  there is one point which may be mentioned here which is at first startling and yet must commend itself to our reason when we reflect upon it  this is the constant assertion from the other side that the newly passed do not know that they are dead and that it is a long time sometimes a very long time before they can be made to understand it  all of them agree that this state of bewilderment is harmful and retarding to the spirit and that some knowledge of the actual truth upon this side is the only way to make sure of not being dazed upon the other  finding conditions entirely different from anything for which either scientific or religious teaching had prepared them it is no wonder that they look upon their new sensations as some strange dream and the more rigidly orthodox have been their views the more impossible do they find it to accept these new surroundings with all that they imply  for this reason as well as for many others this new revelation is a very needful thing for mankind  a smaller point of practical importance is that the aged should realise that it is still worth while to improve their minds for though they have no time to use their fresh knowledge in this world it will remain as part of their mental outfit in the next  as to the smaller details of this life beyond it is better perhaps not to treat them for the very good reason that they are small details we will learn them all soon for ourselves and it is only vain curiosity which leads us to ask for them now  one thing is clear there are higher intelligences over yonder to whom synthetic chemistry which not only makes the substance but moulds the form is a matter of absolute ease  we see them at work in the coarser media perceptible to our material senses in the seance room  if they can build up simulacra in the seance room how much may we expect them to do when they are working upon ethereal objects in that ether which is their own medium  it may be said generally that they can make something which is analogous to anything which exists upon earth  how they do it may well be a matter of guess and speculation among the less advanced spirits as the phenomena of modern science are a matter of guess and speculation to us if one of us were suddenly called up by the denizen of some subhuman world and were asked to explain exactly what gravity is or what magnetism is how helpless we should be  we may put ourselves in the position then of a young engineer soldier like raymond lodge who tries to give some theory of matter in the beyonda theory which is very likely contradicted by some other spirit who is also guessing at things above him  he may be right or he may be wrong but he is doing his best to say what he thinks as we should do in similar case  he believes that his transcendental chemists can make anything and that even such unspiritual matter as alcohol or tobacco could come within their powers and could still be craved for by unregenerate spirits  this has tickled the critics to such an extent that one would really think to read the comments that it was the only statement in a book which contains 400 closelyprinted pages  raymond may be right or wrong but the only thing which the incident proves to me is the unflinching courage and honesty of the man who chronicled it knowing well the handle that he was giving to his enemies  there are many who protest that this world which is described to us is too material for their liking  it is not as they would desire it well there are many things in this world which seem different from what we desire but they exist none the less  but when we come to examine this charge of materialism and try to construct some sort of system which would satisfy the idealists it becomes a very difficult task  are we to be mere wisps of gaseous happiness floating about in the air  that seems to be the idea  but if there is no body like our own and if there is no character like our own then say what you will we have become extinct  what is it to a mother if some impersonal glorified entity is shown to her  she will say that is not the son i losti want his yellow hair his quick smile his little moods that i know so well  that is what she wants that i believe is what she will have but she will not have them by any system which cuts us away from all that reminds us of matter and takes us to a vague region of floating emotions  there is an opposite school of critics which rather finds the difficulty in picturing a life which has keen perceptions robust emotions and a solid surrounding all constructed in so diaphanous a material  let us remember that everything depends upon its comparison with the things around it  if we could conceive of a world a thousand times denser heavier and duller than this world we can clearly see that to its inmates it would seem much the same as this since their strength and texture would be in proportion  if however these inmates came in contact with us they would look upon us as extraordinarily airy beings living in a strange light spiritual atmosphere  they would not remember that we also since our beings and our surroundings are in harmony and in proportion to each other feel and act exactly as they do  we have now to consider the case of yet another stratum of life which is as much above us as the leaden community would be below us  to us also it seems as if these people these spirits as we call them live the lives of vapour and of shadows  we do not recollect that there also everything is in proportion and in harmony so that the spirit scene or the spirit dwelling which might seem a mere dream thing to us is as actual to the spirit as are our own scenes or our own dwellings and that the spirit body is as real and tangible to another spirit as ours to our friends     chapter iv  problems and limitations   leaving for a moment the larger argument as to the lines of this revelation and the broad proofs of its validity there are some smaller points which have forced themselves upon my attention during the consideration of the subject  this home of our dead seems to be very near to usso near that we continually as they tell us visit them in our sleep much of that quiet resignation which we have all observed in people who have lost those whom they lovedpeople who would in our previous opinion have been driven mad by such lossis due to the fact that they have seen their dead and that although the switchoff is complete and they can recall nothing whatever of the spirit experience in sleep the soothing result of it is still carried on by the subconscious self  the switchoff is as i say complete but sometimes for some reason it is hung up for a fraction of a second and it is at such moments that the dreamer comes back from  his dream trailing clouds of glory  from this also come all those prophetic dreams many of which are well attested i have had a recent personal experience of one which has not yet perhaps entirely justified itself but is even now remarkable  upon april 4th of last year 1917 i awoke with a feeling that some communication had been made to me of which i had only carried back one word which was ringing in my head  that word was piave  to the best of my belief i had never heard the word before  as it sounded like the name of a place i went into my study the moment i had dressed and i looked up the index of my atlas  there was piave sure enough and i noted that it was a river in italy some forty miles behind the front line which at that time was victoriously advancing  i could imagine few more unlikely things than that the war should roll back to the piave and i could not think how any military event of consequence could arise there but none the less i was so impressed that i drew up a statement that some such event would occur there and i had it signed by my secretary and witnessed by my wife with the date april 4th attached  it is a matter of history how six months later the whole italian line fell back how it abandoned successive positions upon rivers and how it stuck upon this stream which was said by military critics to be strategically almost untenable  if nothing more should occur i write upon february 20th 1918 the reference to the name has been fully justified presuming that some friend in the beyond was forecasting the coming events of the war  i have still a hope however that more was meant and that some crowning victory of the allies at this spot may justify still further the strange way in which the name was conveyed to my mind  people may well cry out against this theory of sleep on the grounds that all the grotesque monstrous and objectionable dreams which plague us cannot possibly come from a high source  on this point i have a very definite theory which may perhaps be worthy of discussion  i consider that there are two forms of dreams and only two the experiences of the released spirit and the confused action of the lower faculties which remain in the body when the spirit is absent the former is rare and beautiful for the memory of it fails us  the latter are common and varied but usually fantastic or ignoble  by noting what is absent in the lower dreams one can tell what the missing qualities are and so judge what part of us goes to make up the spirit thus in these dreams humour is wanting since we see things which strike us afterwards as ludicrous and are not amused  the sense of proportion and of judgment and of aspiration is all gone  in short the higher is palpably gone and the lower the sense of fear of sensual impression of selfpreservation is functioning all the more vividly because it is relieved from the higher control  the limitations of the powers of spirits is a subject which is brought home to one in these studies people say if they exist why dont they do this or that  the answer usually is that they cant  they appear to have very fixed limitations like our own this seemed to be very clearly brought out in the crosscorrespondence experiments where several writing mediums were operating at a distance quite independently of each other and the object was to get agreement which was beyond the reach of coincidence the spirits seem to know exactly what they impress upon the minds of the living but they do not know how far they carry their instruction out  their touch with us is intermittent  thus in the crosscorrespondence experiments we continually have them asking did you get that or was it all right  sometimes they have partial cognisance of what is done as where myers says  i saw the circle but was not sure about the triangle  it is everywhere apparent that their spirits even the spirits of those who like myers and hodgson were in specially close touch with psychic subjects and knew all that could be done were in difficulties when they desired to get cognisance of a material thing such as a written document  only i should imagine by partly materialising themselves could they do so and they may not have had the power of selfmaterialization  this consideration throws some light upon the famous case so often used by our opponents where myers failed to give some word or phrase which had been left behind in a sealed box apparently he could not see this document from his present position and if his memory failed him he would be very likely to go wrong about it  many mistakes may i think be explained in this fashion  it has been asserted from the other side and the assertion seems to me reasonable that when they speak of their own conditions they are speaking of what they know and can readily and surely discuss but that when we insist as we must sometimes insist upon earthly tests it drags them back to another plane of things and puts them in a position which is far more difficult and liable to error  another point which is capable of being used against us is this  the spirits have the greatest difficulty in getting names through to us and it is this which makes many of their communications so vague and unsatisfactory  they will talk all round a thing and yet never get the name which would clinch the matter  there is an example of the point in a recent communication in light which describes how a young officer recently dead endeavoured to get a message through the direct voice method of mrs susannah harris to his father  he could not get his name through  he was able however to make it clear that his father was a member of the kildare street club in dublin  inquiry found the father and it was then learned that the father had already received an independent message in dublin to say that an inquiry was coming through from london  i do not know if the earth name is a merely ephemeral thing quite disconnected from the personality and perhaps the very first thing to be thrown aside  that is of course possible  or it may be that some law regulates our intercourse from the other side by which it shall not be too direct and shall leave something to our own intelligence  this idea that there is some law which makes an indirect speech more easy than a direct one is greatly borne out by the crosscorrespondences where circumlocution continually takes the place of assertion  thus in the st paul correspondence which is treated in the july pamphlet of the spr the idea of st paul was to be conveyed from one automatic writer to two others both of whom were at a distance one of them in india  dr hodgson was the spirit who professed to preside over this experiment  you would think that the simple words st paul occurring in the other scripts would be allsufficient  but no he proceeds to make all sorts of indirect allusions to talk all round st paul in each of the scripts and to make five quotations from st pauls writings  this is beyond coincidence and quite convincing but none the less it illustrates the curious way in which they go round instead of going straight  if one could imagine some wise angel on the other side saying now dont make it too easy for these people  make them use their own brains a little  they will become mere automatons if we do everything for themif we could imagine that it would just cover the case whatever the explanation it is a noteworthy fact  there is another point about spirit communications which is worth noting  this is their uncertainty wherever any time element comes in their estimate of time is almost invariably wrong  earth time is probably a different idea to spirit time and hence the confusion  we had the advantage as i have stated of the presence of a lady in our household who developed writing mediumship  she was in close touch with three brothers all of whom had been killed in the war  this lady conveying messages from her brothers was hardly ever entirely wrong upon facts and hardly ever right about time  there was one notable exception however which in itself is suggestive  although her prophecies as to public events were weeks or even months out she in one case foretold the arrival of a telegram from africa to the day now the telegram had already been sent but was delayed so that the inference seems to be that she could foretell a course of events which had actually been set in motion and calculate how long they would take to reach their end  on the other hand i am bound to admit that she confidently prophesied the escape of her fourth brother who was a prisoner in germany and that this was duly fulfilled on the whole i preserve an open mind upon the powers and limitations of prophecy  but apart from all these limitations we have unhappily to deal with absolute coldblooded lying on the part of wicked or mischievous intelligences everyone who has investigated the matter has i suppose met with examples of wilful deception which occasionally are mixed up with good and true communications  it was of such messages no doubt that the apostle wrote when he said  beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god  these words can only mean that the early christians not only practised spiritualism as we understand it but also that they were faced by the same difficulties  there is nothing more puzzling than the fact that one may get a long connected description with every detail given and that it may prove to be entirely a concoction  however we must bear in mind that if one case comes absolutely correct it atones for many failures just as if you had one telegram correct you would know that there was a line and a communicator however much they broke down afterwards  but it must be admitted that it is very discomposing and makes one sceptical of messages until they are tested  of a kin with these false influences are all the miltons who cannot scan and shelleys who cannot rhyme and shakespeares who cannot think and all the other absurd impersonations which make our cause ridiculous  they are i think deliberate frauds either from this side or from the other but to say that they invalidate the whole subject is as senseless as to invalidate our own world because we encounter some unpleasant people  one thing i can truly say and that is that in spite of false messages i have never in all these years known a blasphemous an unkind or an obscene message  such incidents must be of very exceptional nature  i think also that so far as allegations concerning insanity obsession and so forth go they are entirely imaginary  asylum statistics do not bear out such assertions and mediums live to as good an average age as anyone else  i think however that the cult of the seance may be very much overdone  when once you have convinced yourself of the truth of the phenomena the physical seance has done its work and the man or woman who spends his or her life in running from seance to seance is in danger of becoming a mere sensation hunter  here as in other cults the form is in danger of eclipsing the real thing and in pursuit of physical proofs one may forget that the real object of all these things is as i have tried to point out to give us assurance in the future and spiritual strength in the present to attain a due perception of the passing nature of matter and the allimportance of that which is immaterial  the conclusion then of my long search after truth is that in spite of occasional fraud which spiritualists deplore and in spite of wild imaginings which they discourage there remains a great solid core in this movement which is infinitely nearer to positive proof than any other religious development  with which i am acquainted  as i have shown it would appear to be a rediscovery rather than an absolutely new thing but the result in this material age is the same  the days are surely passing when the mature and considered opinions of such men as crookes wallace flammarion chas richet lodge barrett lombroso generals drayson and turner sergeant ballantyne w t stead judge edmunds admiral usborne moore the late archdeacon wilberforce and such a cloud of other witnesses can be dismissed with the empty all rot or nauseating drivel formulae  as mr arthur hill has well said we have reached a point where further proof is superfluous and where the weight of disproof lies upon those who deny the very people who clamour for proofs have as a rule never taken the trouble to examine the copious proofs which already exist  each seems to think that the whole subject should begin de novo because he has asked for information  the method of our opponents is to fasten upon the latest man who has stated the caseat the present instant it happens to be sir oliver lodgeand then to deal with him as if he had come forward with some new opinions which rested entirely upon his own assertion with no reference to the corroboration of so many independent workers before him  this is not an honest method of criticism for in every case the agreement of witnesses is the very root of conviction  but as a matter of fact there are many single witnesses upon whom this case could rest  if for example our only knowledge of unknown forces depended upon the researches of dr crawford of belfast who places his amateur medium in a weighing chair with her feet from the ground and has been able to register a difference of weight of many pounds corresponding with the physical phenomena produced a result which he has tested and recorded in a true scientific spirit of caution i do not see how it could be shaken  the phenomena are and have long been firmly established for every open mind  one feels that the stage of investigation is passed and that of religious construction is overdue  for are we to satisfy ourselves by observing phenomena with no attention to what the phenomena mean as a group of savages might stare at a wireless installation with no appreciation of the messages coming through it or are we resolutely to set ourselves to define these subtle and elusive utterances from beyond and to construct from them a religious scheme which will be founded upon human reason on this side and upon spirit inspiration upon the other  these phenomena have passed through the stage of being a parlour game they are now emerging from that of a debatable scientific novelty and they are or should be taking shape as the foundations of a definite system of religious thought in some ways confirmatory of ancient systems in some ways entirely new  the evidence upon which this system rests is so enormous that it would take a very considerable library to contain it and the witnesses are not shadowy people living in the dim past and inaccessible to our crossexamination but are our own contemporaries men of character and intellect whom all must respect  the situation may as it seems to me be summed up in a simple alternative  the one supposition is that there has been an outbreak of lunacy extending over two generations of mankind and two great continentsa lunacy which assails men or women who are otherwise eminently sane  the alternative supposition is that in recent years there has come to us from divine sources a new revelation which constitutes by far the greatest religious event since the death of christ for the reformation was a rearrangement of the old not a revelation of the new a revelation which alters the whole aspect of death and the fate of man  between these two suppositions there is no solid position theories of fraud or of delusion will not meet the evidence  it is absolute lunacy or it is a revolution in religious thought a revolution which gives us as byproducts an utter fearlessness of death and an immense consolation when those who are dear to us pass behind the veil  i should like to add a few practical words to those who know the truth of what i say  we have here an enormous new development the greatest in the history of mankind  how are we to use it  we are bound in honour i think to state our own belief especially to those who are in trouble  having stated it we should not force it but leave the rest to higher wisdom than our own  we wish to subvert no religion we wish only to bring back the materialmindedto take them out of their cramped valley and put them on the ridge whence they can breathe purer air and see other valleys and other ridges beyond religions are mostly petrified and decayed overgrown with forms and choked with mysteries  we can prove that there is no need for this  all that is essential is both very simple and very sure  the clear call for our help comes from those who have had a loss and who yearn to reestablish connection  this also can be overdone  if your boy were in australia you would not expect him to continually stop his work and write long letters at all seasons  having got in touch be moderate in your demands  do not be satisfied with any evidence short of the best but having got that you can it seems to me wait for that short period when we shall all be reunited  i am in touch at present with thirteen mothers who are in correspondence with their dead sons  in each case the husband where he is alive is agreed as to the evidence  in only one case so far as i know was the parent acquainted with psychic matters before the war  several of these cases have peculiarities of their own  in two of them the figures of the dead lads have appeared beside the mothers in a photograph  in one case the first message to the mother came through a stranger to whom the correct address of the mother was given  the communication afterwards became direct  in another case the method of sending messages was to give references to particular pages and lines of books in distant libraries the whole conveying a message  the procedure was to weed out all fear of telepathy verily there is no possible way by which a truth can be proved by which this truth has not been proved  how are you to act  there is the difficulty there are true men and there are frauds  you have to work warily  so far as professional mediums go you will not find it difficult to get recommendations even with the best you may draw entirely blank  the conditions are very elusive  and yet some get the result at once  we cannot lay down laws because the law works from the other side as well as this nearly every woman is an undeveloped medium  let her try her own powers of automatic writing  there again what is done must be done with every precaution against selfdeception and in a reverent and prayerful mood  but if you are earnest you will win through somehow for someone else is probably trying on the other side  some people discountenance communication upon the ground that it is hindering the advance of the departed  there is not a tittle of evidence for this the assertions of the spirits are entirely to the contrary and they declare that they are helped and strengthened by the touch with those whom they love  i know few more moving passages in their simple boyish eloquence than those in which raymond describes the feelings of the dead boys who want to get messages back to their people and find that ignorance and prejudice are a perpetual bar  it is hard to think your sons are dead but such a lot of people do think so  it is revolting to hear the boys tell you how no one speaks of them ever it hurts me through and through  above all read the literature of this subject  it has been far too much neglected not only by the material world but by believers  soak yourself with this grand truth  make yourself familiar with the overpowering evidence  get away from the phenomenal side and learn the lofty teaching from such beautiful books as after death or from stainton moses spirit teachings  there is a whole library of such literature of unequal value but of a high average broaden and spiritualize your thoughts  show the results in your lives unselfishness that is the keynote to progress  realise not as a belief or a faith but as a fact which is as tangible as the streets of london that we are moving on soon to another life that all will be very happy there and that the only possible way in which that happiness can be marred or deferred is by folly and selfishness in these few fleeting years  it must be repeated that while the new revelation may seem destructive to those who hold christian dogmas with extreme rigidity it has quite the opposite effect upon the mind which like so many modern minds had come to look upon the whole christian scheme as a huge delusion  it is shown clearly that the old revelation has so many resemblances defaced by time and mangled by mans mishandling and materialism but still denoting the same general scheme that undoubtedly both have come from the same source  the accepted ideas of life after death of higher and lower spirits of comparative happiness depending upon our own conduct of chastening by pain of guardian spirits of high teachers of an infinite central power of circles above circles approaching nearer to his presenceall of these conceptions appear once more and are confirmed by many witnesses  it is only the claims of infallibility and of monopoly the bigotry and pedantry of theologians and the manmade rituals which take the life out of the godgiven thoughtsit is only this which has defaced the truth  i cannot end this little book better than by using words more eloquent than any which i could write a splendid sample of english style as well as of english thought  they are from the pen of that considerable thinker and poet mr gerald massey and were written many years ago  spiritualism has been for me in common with many others such a lifting of the mental horizon and lettingin of the heavenssuch a formation of faith into facts that i can only compare life without it to sailing on board ship with hatches battened down and being kept a prisoner living by the light of a candle and then suddenly on some splendid starry night allowed to go on deck for the first time to see the stupendous mechanism of the heavens all aglow with the glory of god     supplementary documents   i the next phase of life  i have spoken in the text of the striking manner in which accounts of life in the next phase though derived from the most varied and independent sources are still in essential agreementan agreement which occasionally descends to small details  a variety is introduced by that fuller vision which can see and describe more than one plane but the accounts of that happy land to which the ordinary mortal may hope to aspire are very consistent  since i wrote the statement i have read three fresh independent descriptions which again confirm the point  one is the account given by a kings counsel in his recent book i heard a voice kegan paul which i recommended to inquirers though it has a strong roman catholic bias running through it which shows that our main lines of thought are persistent  a second is the little book the  light on the future giving the very interesting details of the beyond gathered by an earnest and reverent circle in dublin the other came in a private letter from mr hubert wales and is i think most instructive  mr wales is a cautious and rather sceptical inquirer who had put away his results with incredulity he had received them through his own automatic writing  on reading my account of the conditions described in the beyond he hunted up his own old script which had commended itself so little to him when he first produced it  he says after reading your article i was struck almost startled by the circumstance that the statements which had purported to be made to me regarding conditions after death coincidedi think almost to the smallest detailwith those you set out as the result of your collation of material obtained from a great number of sources  i cannot think there was anything in my antecedent reading to account for this coincidence  i had certainly read nothing you had published on the subject  i had purposely avoided raymond and books like it in order not to vitiate  my own results and the proceedings of the spr which i had read at that time do not touch as you know upon afterdeath conditions  at any rate i obtained at various times statements as my contemporary notes show to the effect that in this persisting state of existence they have bodies which though imperceptible by our senses are as solid to them as ours to us that these bodies are based on the general characteristics of our present bodies but beautified that they have no age no pain no rich and poor that they wear clothes and take nourishment that they do not sleep though they spoke of passing occasionally into a semiconscious state which they called lying asleepa condition it just occurs to me which seems to correspond roughly with the hypnoidal state that after a period which is usually shorter than the average lifetime here they pass to some further state of existence that people of similar thoughts tastes and feelings gravitate together that married couples do not necessarily reunite but that the love of man and woman  continues and is freed of elements which with us often militate against its perfect realization that immediately after death people pass into a semiconscious reststate lasting various periods that they are unable to experience bodily pain but are susceptible at times to some mental anxiety that a painful death is absolutely unknown that religious beliefs make no difference whatever in the afterstate and that their life altogether is intensely happy and no one having ever realised it could wish to return here  i got no reference to work by that word but much to the various interests that were said to occupy them  that is probably only another way of saying the same thing  work with us has come usually to mean work to live and that i was emphatically informed was not the case with themthat all the requirements of life were somehow mysteriously provided  neither did i get any reference to a definite temporary penal state but i gathered that people begin there at the point of intellectual and moral development where they leave off here and since their state of happiness was based mainly upon sympathy those who came over in a low moral condition failed at first for various lengths of time to have the capacity to appreciate and enjoy it    automatic writing  this form of mediumship gives the very highest results and yet in its very nature is liable to selfdeception  are we using our own hand or is an outside power directing it  it is only by the information received that we can tell and even then we have to make broad allowance for the action of our own subconscious knowledge  it is worth while perhaps to quote what appears to me to be a thoroughly criticproof case so that the inquirer may see how strong the evidence is that these messages are not selfevolved this case is quoted in mr arthur hills recent book man is a spirit cassell  co and is contributed by a gentleman who takes the name of captain james burton he is i understand the same medium amateur through whose communications the position of the buried ruins at glastonbury have recently been located a week after my fathers funeral i was writing a business letter when something seemed to intervene between my hand and the motor centres of my brain and the hand wrote at an amazing rate a letter signed with my fathers signature and purporting to come from him i was upset and my right side and arm became cold and numb for a year after this letters came frequently and always at unexpected times  i never knew what they contained until i examined them with a magnifyingglass they were microscopic  and they contained a vast amount of matter with which it was impossible for me to be acquainted     unknown to me my mother who was staying some sixty miles away lost her pet dog which my father had given her  the same night i had a letter from him condoling with her and stating that the dog was now with him  all things which love us and are necessary to our happiness in the world are with us here  a most sacred secret known to no one but my father and mother concerning a matter which occurred years before i was born was afterwards told me in the script with the comment  tell your mother this and she will know that it is i your father who am writing  my mother had been unable to accept the possibility up to now but when i told her this she collapsed and fainted  from that moment the letters became her greatest comfort for they were lovers during the forty years of their married life and his death almost broke her heart  as for myself i am as convinced that my father in his original personality still exists as if he were still in his study with the door shut  he is no more dead than he would be were he living in america  i have compared the diction and vocabulary of these letters with those employed in my own writingi am not unknown as a magazine contributorand i find no points of similarity between the two there is much further evidence in this case for which i refer the reader to the book itself    the cheriton dugout  i have mentioned in the text that i had some recent experience of a case where a poltergeist or mischievous spirit had been manifesting these entities appear to be of an undeveloped order and nearer to earth conditions than any others with which we are acquainted  this comparative materialism upon their part places them low in the scale of spirit and undesirable perhaps as communicants but it gives them a special value as calling attention to crude obvious phenomena and so arresting the human attention and forcing upon our notice that there are other forms of life within the universe  these borderland forces have attracted passing attention at several times and places in the past such cases as the wesley persecution at epworth the drummer of tedworth the bells of bealing etc startling the country for a timeeach of them being an impingement of unknown forces upon human life  then almost simultaneously came the hydesville case in america and the cideville disturbances in france which were so marked that they could not be overlooked  from them sprang the whole modern movement which reasoning upwards from small things to great from raw things to developed ones from phenomena to messages is destined to give religion the firmest basis upon which it has ever stood therefore humble and foolish as these manifestations may seem they have been the seed of large developments and are worthy of our respectful though critical attention  many such manifestations have appeared of recent years in various quarters of the world each of which is treated by the press in a more or less comic vein with a conviction apparently that the use of the word spook discredits the incident and brings discussion to an end it is remarkable that each is treated as an entirely isolated phenomenon and thus the ordinary reader gets no idea of the strength of the cumulative evidence  in this particular case of the cheriton dugout the facts are as follows  mr jaques a justice of the peace and a man of education and intelligence residing at embrook house cheriton near folkestone made a dugout just opposite to his residence as a protection against air raids the house was it may be remarked of great antiquity part of it being an old religious foundation of the 14th century  the dugout was constructed at the base of a small bluff and the sinking was through ordinary soft sandstone  the work was carried out by a local jobbing builder called rolfe assisted by a lad  soon after the inception of his task he was annoyed by his candle being continually blown out by jets of sand and by similar jets hitting up against his own face these phenomena he imagined to be due to some gaseous or electrical cause but they reached such a point that his work was seriously hampered and he complained to mr jaques who received the story with absolute incredulity  the persecution continued however and increased in intensity taking the form now of actual blows from moving material considerable objects such as stones and bits of brick flying past him and hitting the walls with a violent impact mr rolfe still searching for a physical explanation went to mr hesketh the municipal electrician of folkestone a man of high education and intelligence who went out to the scene of the affair and saw enough to convince himself that the phenomena were perfectly genuine and inexplicable by ordinary laws  a canadian soldier who was billeted upon mr rolfe heard an account of the happenings from his host and after announcing his conviction that the latter had bats in his belfry proceeded to the dugout where his experiences were so instant and so violent that he rushed out of the place in horror  the housekeeper at the hall also was a witness of the movement of bricks when no human hands touched them  mr jaques whose incredulity had gradually thawed before all this evidence went down to the dugout in the absence of everyone and was departing from it when five stones rapped up against the door from the inside  he reopened the door and saw them lying there upon the floor  sir william barrett had meanwhile come down but had seen nothing  his stay was a short one  i afterwards made four visits of about two hours each to the grotto but got nothing direct though i saw the new brickwork all chipped about by the blows which it had received  the forces appeared to have not the slightest interest in psychical research for they never played up to an investigator and yet their presence and action have been demonstrated to at least seven different observers and as i have said they left their traces behind them even to the extent of picking the flint stones out of the new cement which was to form the floor and arranging them in tidy little piles  the obvious explanation that the boy was an adept at mischief had to be set aside in view of the fact that the phenomena occurred in his absence  one extra man of science wandered on to the scene for a moment but as his explanation was that the movements occurred through the emanation of marshgas it did not advance matters much  the disturbances are still proceeding and i have had a letter this very morning february 21st 1918 with fuller and later details from mr hesketh the engineer  what is the real explanation of such a matter i can only say that i have advised mr jaques to dig into the bluff under which he is constructing his cellar  i made some investigation myself upon the top of it and convinced myself that the surface ground at that spot has at some time been disturbed to the depth of at least five feet  something has i should judge been buried at some date and it is probable that as in the case cited in the text there is a connection between this and the disturbances  it is very probable that mr rolfe is unknown to himself a physical medium and that when he was in the confined space of the cellar he turned it into a cabinet in which his magnetic powers could accumulate and be available for use  it chanced that there was on the spot some agency which chose to use them and hence the phenomena  when mr jaques went alone to the grotto the power left behind by mr rolfe who had been in it all morning was not yet exhausted and he was able to get some manifestations  so i read it but it is well not to be dogmatic on such matters  if there is systematic digging i should expect an epilogue to the story  whilst these proofs were in the press a second very marked case of a poltergeist came within my knowledge i cannot without breach of confidence reveal the details and the phenomena are still going on curiously enough it was because one of the sufferers from the invasion read some remarks of mine upon the cheriton dugout that this other case came to my knowledge for the lady wrote to me at once for advice and assistance  the place is remote and i have not yet been able to visit it but from the full accounts which i have now received it seems to present all the familiar features with the phenomenon of direct writing superadded  some specimens of this script have reached me two clergymen have endeavoured to mitigate the phenomena which are occasionally very violent but so far without result  it may be some consolation to any others who may be suffering from this strange infliction to know that in the many cases which have been carefully recorded there is none in which any physical harm has been inflicted upon man or beast
