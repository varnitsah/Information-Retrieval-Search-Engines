xxiv   conclusion     i  the fifteenth place   outside  dont be an idiot man i bagged it first  my dear chap ive been waiting here a month  when you fellows have quite finished rotting about in front of that bath dont let me detain you  anybody seen that sponge  well look herethis in a tone of compromiselets toss for it  all right odd man out  all of which being interpreted meant that the first match of the easter term had just come to an end and that those of the team who being day boys changed over at the pavilion instead of performing the operation at leisure and in comfort as did the members of houses were discussing the vital questionwho was to have first bath  the field sports committee at wrykynthat is at the school which stood some halfmile outside that town and took its name from itwere not lavish in their expenditure as regarded the changing accommodation in the pavilion letters appeared in every second number of the wrykinian some short others long some from members of the school others from old boys all protesting against the condition of the first second and third fifteen dressingrooms indignant would inquire acidly in half a page of small type if the editor happened to be aware that there was no hairbrush in the second room and only half a comb disgusted o w would remark that when he came down with the wandering zephyrs to play against the third fifteen the water supply had suddenly and mysteriously failed and the wzs had been obliged to go home as they were in a state of primeval grime and he thought that this was a very bad thing in a school of over six hundred boys though what the number of boys had to do with the fact that there was no water he omitted to explain the editor would express his regret in brackets and things would go on as before  there was only one bath in the first fifteen room and there were on the present occasion six claimants to it and each claimant was of the fixed opinion that whatever happened subsequently he was going to have it first finally on the suggestion of otway who had reduced tossing to a fine art a mystic game of tommy dodd was played otway having triumphantly obtained first innings the conversation reverted to the subject of the match  the easter term always opened with a scratch game against a mixed team of masters and old boys and the school usually won without any great exertion on this occasion the match had been rather more even than the average and the team had only just pulled the thing off by a couple of tries to a goal otway expressed an opinion that the school had played badly  why on earth dont you forwards let the ball out occasionally he asked otway was one of the first fifteen halves  they were so jolly heavy in the scrum said maurice one of the forwards and when we did let it out the outsides nearly always mucked it  well it wasnt the halves fault we always got it out to the centres  it wasnt the centres put in robinson they played awfully well trevor was ripping  trevor always is said otway i should think hes about the best captain weve had here for a long time hes certainly one of the best centres  best theres been since riversjones said clephane  riversjones was one of those players who mark an epoch he had been in the team fifteen years ago and had left wrykyn to captain cambridge and play three years in succession for wales the school regarded the standard set by him as one that did not admit of comparison however good a wrykyn centre threequarter might be the most he could hope to be considered was the best since riversjones since riversjones however covered fifteen years and to be looked on as the best centre the school could boast of during that time meant something for wrykyn knew how to play football  since it had been decided thus that the faults in the school attack did not lie with the halves forwards or centres it was more or less evident that they must be attributable to the wings and the search for the weak spot was even further narrowed down by the general verdict that clowes on the left wing had played well with a beautiful unanimity the six occupants of the first fifteen room came to the conclusion that the man who had let the team down that day had been the man on the rightrandbrown to wit of seymours  ill bet he doesnt stay in the first long said clephane who was now in the bath vice otway retired i suppose they had to try him as he was the senior wing threequarter of the second but hes no earthly good  he only got into the second because hes big was robinsons opinion a man whos big and strong can always get his second colours  even if hes a funk like randbrown said clephane did any of you chaps notice the way he let paget through that time he scored for them he simply didnt attempt to tackle him he could have brought him down like a shot if hed only gone for him paget was running straight along the touchline and hadnt any room to dodge i know trevor was jolly sick about it and then he let him through once before in just the same way in the first half only trevor got round and stopped him he was rank  missed every other pass too said otway  clephane summed up  he was rank he said again trevor wont keep him in the team long  i wish paget hadnt left said otway referring to the wing threequarter who by leaving unexpectedly at the end of the christmas term had let randbrown into the team his loss was likely to be felt up till christmas wrykyn had done well and paget had been their scoring man randbrown had occupied a similar position in the second fifteen he was big and speedy and in second fifteen matches these qualities make up for a great deal if a man scores one or two tries in nearly every match people are inclined to overlook in him such failings as timidity and clumsiness it is only when he comes to be tried in football of a higher class that he is seen through in the second fifteen the fact that randbrown was afraid to tackle his man had almost escaped notice but the habit would not do in first fifteen circles  all the same said clephane pursuing his subject if they dont play him i dont see who theyre going to get hes the best of the second threequarters as far as i can see  it was this very problem that was puzzling trevor as he walked off the field with paget and clowes when they had got into their blazers after the match clowes was in the same house as trevordonaldsonsand paget was staying there too he had been head of donaldsons up to christmas  it strikes me said paget the school havent got over the holidays yet i never saw such a lot of slackers you ought to have taken thirty points off the sort of team you had against you today  have you ever known the school play well on the second day of term asked clowes the forwards always play as if the whole thing bored them to death  it wasnt the forwards that mattered so much said trevor theyll shake down all right after a few matches a little running and passing will put them right  lets hope so paget observed or we might as well scratch to ripton at once theres a jolly sight too much of the mincepie and christmas pudding about their play at present there was a pause then paget brought out the question towards which he had been moving all the time  what do you think of randbrown he asked  it was pretty clear by the way he spoke what he thought of that player himself but in discussing with a football captain the capabilities of the various members of his team it is best to avoid a too positive statement one way or the other before one has heard his views on the subject and paget was one of those people who like to know the opinions of others before committing themselves  clowes on the other hand was in the habit of forming his views on his own account and expressing them if people agreed with them well and good it afforded strong presumptive evidence of their sanity if they disagreed it was unfortunate but he was not going to alter his opinions for that unless convinced at great length that they were unsound he summed things up and gave you the result you could take it or leave it as you preferred  i thought he was bad said clowes  bad exclaimed trevor he was a disgrace one can understand a chap having his offdays at any game but one doesnt expect a man in the wrykyn first to funk he mucked five out of every six passes i gave him too and the ball wasnt a bit slippery still i shouldnt mind that so much if he had only gone for his man properly it isnt being out of practice that makes you funk and even when he did have a try at you paget he always went high  that said clowes thoughtfully would seem to show that he was game  nobody so much as smiled nobody ever did smile at clowes essays in wit perhaps because of the solemn almost sad tone of voice in which he delivered them he was tall and dark and thin and had a pensive eye which encouraged the more soulful of his female relatives to entertain hopes that he would some day take orders  well said paget relieved at finding that he did not stand alone in his views on randbrowns performance i must say i thought he was awfully bad myself  i shall try somebody else next match said trevor itll be rather hard though the man one would naturally put in bryce left at christmas worse luck  bryce was the other wing threequarter of the second fifteen  isnt there anybody in the third asked paget  barry said clowes briefly  clowes thinks barrys good explained trevor  he is good said clowes i admit hes small but he can tackle  the question is would he be any good in the first a chap might do jolly well for the third and still not be worth trying for the first  i dont remember much about barry said paget except being collared by him when we played seymours last year in the final i certainly came away with a sort of impression that he could tackle i thought he marked me jolly well  there you are then said clowes a year ago barry could tackle paget theres no reason for supposing that hes fallen off since then weve seen that randbrown cant tackle paget ergo barry is better worth playing for the team than randbrown qed  all right then replied trevor there cant be any harm in trying him well have another scratch game on thursday will you be here then paget  oh yes im stopping till saturday  good man then we shall be able to see how he does against you i wish you hadnt left though by jove we should have had ripton on toast the same as last term  wrykyn played five schools but six school matches the school that they played twice in the season was ripton to win one ripton match meant that however many losses it might have sustained in the other matches the school had had at any rate a passable season to win two ripton matches in the same year was almost unheard of this year there had seemed every likelihood of it the match before christmas on the ripton ground had resulted in a win for wrykyn by two goals and a try to a try but the calculations of the school had been upset by the sudden departure of paget at the end of term and also of bryce who had hitherto been regarded as his understudy and in the first ripton match the two goals had both been scored by paget and both had been brilliant bits of individual play which a lesser man could not have carried through  the conclusion therefore at which the school reluctantly arrived was that their chances of winning the second match could not be judged by their previous success they would have to approach the easter term fixture from anothera nonpagetstandpoint in these circumstances it became a serious problem who was to get the fifteenth place whoever played in pagets stead against ripton would be certain if the match were won to receive his colours who then would fill the vacancy  randbrown of course said the crowd  but the experts as we have shown were of a different opinion     ii  the gold bat   trevor did not take long to resume a garb of civilisation he never wasted much time over anything he was gifted with a boundless energy which might possibly have made him unpopular had he not justified it by results the football of the school had never been in such a flourishing condition as it had attained to on his succeeding to the captaincy it was not only that the first fifteen was good the excellence of a first fifteen does not always depend on the captain but the games even down to the very humblest junior game had woken up one morningat the beginning of the previous termto find themselves much to their surprise organised going concerns like the immortal captain pott trevor was a terror to the shirker and the lubber and the resemblance was further increased by the fact that he was a toughish lot who was little but steel and indiarubber at first sight his appearance was not imposing paterfamilias who had heard his sons eulogies on trevors performances during the holidays and came down to watch the school play a match was generally rather disappointed on seeing five feet six where he had looked for at least six foot one and ten stone where he had expected thirteen but then what there was of trevor was as previously remarked steel and indiarubber and he certainly played football like a miniature stoddart it was characteristic of him that though this was the first match of the term his condition seemed to be as good as possible he had done all his own work on the field and most of randbrowns and apparently had not turned a hair he was one of those conscientious people who train in the holidays  when he had changed he went down the passage to clowes study clowes was in the position he frequently took up when the weather was goodwedged into his window in a sitting position one leg in the study the other hanging outside over space the indoor leg lacked a boot so that it was evident that its owner had at least had the energy to begin to change that he had given the thing up after that exhausted with the effort was what one naturally expected from clowes he would have made a splendid actor he was so good at resting  hurry up and dress said trevor i want you to come over to the baths  what on earth do you want over at the baths  i want to see ohara  oh yes i remember dexters are camping out there arent they i heard they were why is it  one of the dexter kids got measles in the last week of the holidays so they shunted all the beds and things across and the chaps went back there instead of to the house  in the winter term the baths were always boarded over and converted into a sort of extra gymnasium where you could go and box or fence when there was no room to do it in the real gymnasium socker and stumpcricket were also largely played there the floor being admirably suited to such games though the light was always rather tricky and prevented heavy scoring  i should think said clowes from what ive seen of dexters beauties that dexter would like them to camp out at the bottom of the baths all the year round it would be a happy release for him if they were all drowned and i suppose if he had to choose any one of them for a violent death hed pick ohara ohara must be a boon to a housemaster ive known chaps break rules when the spirit moved them but hes the only one ive met who breaks them all day long and well into the night simply for amusement ive often thought of writing to the spca about it i suppose you could call dexter an animal all right  oharas right enough really a man like dexter would make any fellow run amuck and then oharas an irishman to start with which makes a difference  there is usually one house in every school of the black sheep sort and if you go to the root of the matter you will generally find that the fault is with the master of that house a housemaster who enters into the life of his house coaches them in gamesif an athleteor if not an athlete watches the games umpiring at cricket and refereeing at football never finds much difficulty in keeping order it may be accepted as fact that the juniors of a house will never be orderly of their own free will but disturbances in the junior dayroom do not make the house undisciplined the prefects are the criterion if you find them joining in the general rags and even starting private ones on their own account then you may safely say that it is time the master of that house retired from the business and took to chickenfarming and that was the state of things in dexters it was the most lawless of the houses mr dexter belonged to a type of master almost unknown at a public schoolthe usher type in a private school he might have passed at wrykyn he was out of place to him the whole duty of a housemaster appeared to be to wage war against his house  when dexters won the final for the cricket cup in the summer term of two years back the match lasted four afternoonsfour solid afternoons of glorious upanddown cricket mr dexter did not see a single ball of that match bowled he was prowling in sequestered lanes and brokendown barns out of bounds on the offchance that he might catch some member of his house smoking there as if the whole of the house from the head to the smallest fag were not on the field watching days best bats collapse before hendersons bowling and moriarty hit up that marvellous and unexpected fiftythree at the end of the second innings  that sort of thing definitely stamps a master  what do you want to see ohara about asked clowes  hes got my little gold bat i lent it him in the holidays  a remark which needs a footnote the bat referred to was made of gold and was about an inch long by an eighth broad it had come into existence some ten years previously in the following manner the interhouse cricket cup at wrykyn had originally been a rather tarnished and unimpressive vessel whose only merit consisted in the fact that it was of silver ten years ago an old wrykinian suddenly reflecting that it would not be a bad idea to do something for the school in a small way hied him to the nearest jewellers and purchased another silver cup vast withal and cunningly decorated with filigree work and standing on a massive ebony plinth round which were little silver lozenges just big enough to hold the name of the winning house and the year of grace this he presented with his blessing to be competed for by the dozen houses that made up the school of wrykyn and it was formally established as the house cricket cup the question now arose what was to be done with the other cup the school house who happened to be the holders at the time suggested disinterestedly that it should become the property of the house which had won it last not so replied the field sports committee but far otherwise we will have it melted down in a fiery furnace and thereafter fashioned into eleven little silver bats and these little silver bats shall be the guerdon of the eleven members of the winning team to have and to hold for the space of one year unless by winning the cup twice in succession they gain the right of keeping the bat for yet another year how is that umpire and the authorities replied o men of infinite resource and sagacity verily is it a cold day when you get left behind forge ahead but when they had forged ahead behold it would not run to eleven little silver bats but only to ten little silver bats thereupon the headmaster a man liberal with his cash caused an eleventh little bat to be fashionedfor the captain of the winning team to have and to hold in the manner aforesaid and to single it out from the others it was wrought not of silver but of gold and so it came to pass that at the time of our story trevor was in possession of the little gold bat because donaldsons had won the cup in the previous summer and he had captained themand incidentally had scored seventyfive without a mistake  well im hanged if i would trust ohara with my bat said clowes referring to the silver ornament on his own watchchain hes probably pawned yours in the holidays why did you lend it to him  his people wanted to see it i know him at home you know they asked me to lunch the last day but one of the holidays and we got talking about the bat because of course if we hadnt beaten dexters in the final ohara would have had it himself so i sent it over next day with a note asking ohara to bring it back with him here  oh well theres a chance then seeing hes only had it so little time that he hasnt pawned it yet youd better rush off and get it back as soon as possible its no good waiting for me i shant be ready for weeks  wheres paget  teaing with donaldson at least he said he was going to  then i suppose i shall have to go alone i hate walking alone  if you hurry said clowes scanning the road from his post of vantage youll be able to go with your fascinating pal ruthven hes just gone out  trevor dashed downstairs in his energetic way and overtook the youth referred to  clowes brooded over them from above like a sorrowful and rather disgusted providence trevors liking for ruthven who was a donaldsonite like himself was one of the few points on which the two had any real disagreement clowes could not understand how any person in his senses could of his own free will make an intimate friend of ruthven  hullo trevor said ruthven  come over to the baths said trevor i want to see ohara about something or were you going somewhere else  i wasnt going anywhere in particular i never know what to do in termtime its deadly dull  trevor could never understand how any one could find termtime dull for his own part there always seemed too much to do in the time  you arent allowed to play games he said remembering something about a doctors certificate in the past  no said ruthven thank goodness he added  which remark silenced trevor to a person who thanked goodness that he was not allowed to play games he could find nothing to say but he ceased to wonder how it was that ruthven was dull  they proceeded to the baths together in silence ohara they were informed by a dexters fag who met them outside the door was not about  when he comes back said trevor tell him i want him to come to tea tomorrow directly after school and bring my bat dont forget  the fag promised to make a point of it     iii  the mayors statue   one of the rules that governed the life of donough ohara the lighthearted descendant of the oharas of castle taterfields co clare ireland was never refuse the offer of a free tea so on receiptper the dexters fag referred toof trevors invitation he scratched one engagement with his mathematical masternot wholly unconnected with the workingout of examples 200 to 206 in hall and knights algebra postponed another with his friend and ally moriarty of dexters who wished to box with him in the gymnasium and made his way at a leisurely pace towards donaldsons he was feeling particularly pleased with himself today for several reasons he had begun the day well by scoring brilliantly off mr dexter across the matutinal rasher and coffee in morning school he had been put on to translate the one passage which he happened to have preparedthe first ten lines in fact of the hundred which formed the mornings lesson and in the final hour of afternoon school which was devoted to french he had discovered and exploited with great success an entirely new and original form of ragging this he felt was the strenuous life this was living ones life as ones life should be lived  he met trevor at the gate as they were going in a carriage and pair dashed past its cargo consisted of two people the headmaster looking bored and a small dapper man with a very red face who looked excited and was talking volubly trevor and ohara raised their caps as the chariot swept by but the salute passed unnoticed the head appeared to be wrapped in thought  whats the old man doing in a carriage i wonder said trevor looking after them whos that with him  that said ohara is sir eustace briggs  whos sir eustace briggs  ohara explained in a rich brogue that sir eustace was mayor of wrykyn a keen politician and a hater of the irish nation judging by his letters and speeches  they went into trevors study clowes was occupying the window in his usual manner  hullo ohara he said there is an air of quiet satisfaction about you that seems to show that youve been ragging dexter have you  oh that was only this morning at breakfast the best rag was in french replied ohara who then proceeded to explain in detail the methods he had employed to embitter the existence of the hapless gallic exile with whom he had come in contact it was that gentlemans custom to sit on a certain desk while conducting the lesson this desk chanced to be oharas on the principle that a man may do what he likes with his own he had entered the room privily in the dinnerhour and removed the screws from his desk with the result that for the first halfhour of the lesson the class had been occupied in excavating m gandinois from the ruins that gentlemans first act on regaining his equilibrium had been to send ohara out of the room and ohara who had foreseen this emergency had spent a very pleasant halfhour in the passage with some mixed chocolates and a copy of mr hornungs amateur cracksman it was his notion of a cheerful and instructive french lesson  what were you talking about when you came in asked clowes whos been slanging ireland ohara  the man briggs  what are you going to do about it arent you going to take any steps  is it steps said ohara warmly and havent we  he stopped  well  ye know he said seriously ye mustnt let it go any further i shall get sacked if its found out an so will moriarty too  why asked trevor looking up from the teapot he was filling what on earth have you been doing  wouldnt it be rather a cheery idea suggested clowes if you began at the beginning  well ye see ohara began it was this way the first i heard of it was from dexter he was trying to score off me as usual an he said have ye seen the paper this morning ohara i said no i had not then he said ah he said ye should look at it theres something there that yell find interesting i said yes sir in me respectful way yes said he the irish members have been making their customary disturbances in the house why is it ohara he said that irishmen are always thrusting themselves forward and making disturbances for purposes of selfadvertisement why indeed sir said i not knowing what else to say and after that the conversation ceased  go on said clowes  after breakfast moriarty came to me with a paper and showed me what they had been saying about the irish there was a letter from the man briggs on the subject a very sensible and temperate letter from sir eustace briggs they called it but bedad if that was a temperate letter i should like to know what an intemperate one is well we read it through and moriarty said to me can we let this stay as it is and i said no we cant well said moriarty to me what are we to do about it i should like to tar and feather the man he said we cant do that i said but why not tar and feather his statue i said so we thought we would ye know where the statue is i suppose its in the recreation ground just across the river  i know the place said clowes go on this is ripping i always knew you were pretty mad but this sounds as if it were going to beat all previous records  have ye seen the baths this term continued ohara since they shifted dexters house into them the beds are in two long rows along each wall moriartys and mine are the last two at the end farthest from the door  just under the gallery said trevor i see  thats it well at halfpast ten sharp every night dexter sees that were all in locks the door and goes off to sleep at the old mans and we dont see him again till breakfast he turns the gas off from outside at halfpast seven the next morning smithsmith was one of the school portersunlocks the door and calls us and we go over to the hall to breakfast  well  well directly everybody was asleep last nightit wasnt till after one as there was a rag onmoriarty and i got up dressed and climbed up into the gallery ye know the gallery windows they open at the top an its rather hard to get out of them but we managed it and dropped on to the gravel outside  long drop said clowes  yes i hurt myself rather but it was in a good cause i dropped first and while i was on the ground moriarty came on top of me thats how i got hurt but it wasnt much and we cut across the grounds and over the fence and down to the river it was a fine night and not very dark and everything smelt ripping down by the river  dont get poetical said clowes stick to the point  we got into the boathouse  how asked the practical trevor for the boathouse was wont to be locked at one in the morning moriarty had a key that fitted explained ohara briefly we got in and launched a boata big tubput in the tar and a couple of brushestheres always tar in the boathouseand rowed across  wait a bit interrupted trevor you said tar and feathers where did you get the feathers  we used leaves they do just as well and there were heaps on the bank well when we landed we tied up the boat and bucked across to the recreation ground we got over the railingsbeastly spiky railingsand went over to the statue ye know where the statue stands its right in the middle of the place where everybody can see it moriarty got up first and i handed him the tar and a brush then i went up with the other brush and we began we did his face first it was too dark to see really well but i think we made a good job of it when we had put about as much tar on as we thought would do we took out the leaveswhich we were carrying in our pocketsand spread them on then we did the rest of him and after about half an hour when we thought wed done about enough we got into our boat again and came back  and what did you do till halfpast seven  we couldnt get back the way wed come so we slept in the boathouse  wellimhanged was trevors comment on the story  clowes roared with laughter ohara was a perpetual joy to him  as ohara was going trevor asked him for his gold bat  you havent lost it i hope he said  ohara felt in his pocket but brought his hand out at once and transferred it to another pocket a look of anxiety came over his face and was reflected in trevors  i could have sworn it was in that pocket he said  you havent lost it queried trevor again  he has said clowes confidently if you want to know where that bat is i should say youd find it somewhere between the baths and the statue at the foot of the statue for choice it seems to mecorrect me if i am wrongthat you have been and gone and done it me broth av a bhoy  ohara gave up the search  its gone he said man im most awfully sorry id sooner have lost a tenpound note  i dont see why you should lose either snapped trevor why the blazes cant you be more careful  ohara was too penitent for words clowes took it on himself to point out the bright side  theres nothing to get sick about really he said if the thing doesnt turn up though it probably will youll simply have to tell the old man that its lost hell have another made you wont be asked for it till just before sports day either so you will have plenty of time to find it  the challenge cups and also the bats had to be given to the authorities before the sports to be formally presented on sports day  oh i suppose itll be all right said trevor but i hope it wont be found anywhere near the statue  ohara said he hoped so too     iv  the leagues warning   the team to play in any match was always put upon the noticeboard at the foot of the stairs in the senior block a day before the date of the fixture both first and second fifteens had matches on the thursday of this week the second were playing a team brought down by an old wrykinian the first had a scratch game  when barry accompanied by mtodd who shared his study at seymours and rarely left him for two minutes on end passed by the noticeboard at the quarter to eleven interval it was to the second fifteen list that he turned his attention now that bryce had left he thought he might have a chance of getting into the second his only real rival he considered was crawford of the school house who was the other wing threequarter of the third fifteen the first name he saw on the list was crawfords it seemed to be written twice as large as any of the others and his own was nowhere to be seen the fact that he had half expected the calamity made things no better he had set his heart on playing for the second this term  then suddenly he noticed a remarkable phenomenon the other wing threequarter was randbrown if randbrown was playing for the second who was playing for the first  he looked at the list  come on he said hastily to mtodd he wanted to get away somewhere where his agitated condition would not be noticed he felt quite faint at the shock of seeing his name on the list of the first fifteen there it was however as large as life m barry separated from the rest by a thin red line but still there in his most optimistic moments he had never dreamed of this mtodd was reading slowly through the list of the second he did everything slowly except eating  come on said barry again  mtodd had after much deliberation arrived at a profound truth he turned to barry and imparted his discovery to him in the weighty manner of one who realises the importance of his words  look here he said your names not down here  i know come on  but that means youre not playing for the second  of course it does well if you arent coming im off  but look here  barry disappeared through the door after a moments pause mtodd followed him he came up with him on the senior gravel  whats up he inquired  nothing said barry  are you sick about not playing for the second  no  you are really come and have a bun  in the philosophy of mtodd it was indeed a deeprooted sorrow that could not be cured by the internal application of a new hot bun it had never failed in his own case  bun barry was quite shocked at the suggestion i cant afford to get myself out of condition with beastly buns  but if you arent playing  you ass im playing for the first now do you see  mtodd gaped his mind never worked very rapidly  what about randbrown then he said  randbrowns been chucked out cant you understand you are an idiot randbrowns playing for the second and im playing for the first  but youre  he stopped he had been going to point out that barrys tender yearshe was only sixteenand smallness would make it impossible for him to play with success for the first fifteen he refrained owing to a conviction that the remark would not be wholly judicious barry was touchy on the subject of his size and mtodd had suffered before now for commenting on it in a disparaging spirit  i tell you what well do after school said barry well have some running and passing itll do you a lot of good and i want to practise taking passes at full speed you can trot along at your ordinary pace and ill sprint up from behind  mtodd saw no objection to that trotting along at his ordinary pacefive miles an hourwould just suit him  then after that continued barry with a look of enthusiasm i want to practise passing back to my centre paget used to do it awfully well last term and i know trevor expects his wing to so ill buck along and you race up to take my pass see  this was not in mtodds line at all he proposed a slight alteration in the scheme  hadnt you better get somebody else he began  dont be a slack beast said barry you want exercise awfully badly  and as mtodd always did exactly as barry wished he gave in and spent from fourthirty to five that afternoon in the prescribed manner a suggestion on his part at five sharp that it wouldnt be a bad idea to go and have some tea was not favourably received by the enthusiastic threequarter who proposed to devote what time remained before lockup to practising dropkicking it was a painful alternative that faced mtodd his allegiance to barry demanded that he should consent to the scheme on the other hand his allegiance to afternoon teaequally strongcalled him back to the house where there was cake and also muffins in the end the question was solved by the appearance of drummond of seymours garbed in football things and also anxious to practise dropkicking so mtodd was dismissed to his tea with opprobrious epithets and barry and drummond settled down to a little serious and scientific work  making allowances for the inevitable attack of nerves that attends a first appearance in higher football circles than one is accustomed to barry did well against the scratch teamcertainly far better than randbrown had done his smallness was of course against him and on the only occasion on which he really got away paget overtook him and brought him down but then paget was exceptionally fast in the two most important branches of the game the taking of passes and tackling barry did well as far as pluck went he had enough for two and when the whistle blew for noside he had not let paget through once and trevor felt that his inclusion in the team had been justified there was another scratch game on the saturday barry played in it and did much better paget had gone away by an early train and the man he had to mark now was one of the masters who had been good in his time but was getting a trifle old for football barry scored twice and on one occasion by passing back to trevor after the manner of paget enabled the captain to run in and trevor like the captain in billy taylor werry much approved of what hed done barry began to be regarded in the school as a regular member of the fifteen the first of the fixturecard matches versus the town was due on the following saturday and it was generally expected that he would play mtodds devotion increased every day he even went to the length of taking long runs with him and if there was one thing in the world that mtodd loathed it was a long run  on the thursday before the match against the town clowes came chuckling to trevors study after preparation and asked him if he had heard the latest  have you ever heard of the league he said  trevor pondered  i dont think so he replied  how long have you been at the school  lets see itll be five years at the end of the summer term  ah then you wouldnt remember ive been here a couple of terms longer than you and the row about the league was in my first term  what was the row  oh only some chaps formed a sort of secret society in the place kind of vehmgericht you know if they got their knife into any one he usually got beans and could never find out where they came from at first as a matter of fact the thing was quite a philanthropical concern there used to be a good deal of bullying in the place thenat least in some of the housesand as the prefects couldnt or wouldnt stop it some fellows started this league  did it work  work by jove i should think it did chaps who previously couldnt get through the day without making some wretched kids life not worth living used to go about as nervous as cats looking over their shoulders every other second there was one man in particular a chap called leigh he was hauled out of bed one night blindfolded and ducked in a cold bath he was in the school house  why did the league bust up  well partly because the fellows left but chiefly because they didnt stick to the philanthropist idea if anybody did anything they didnt like they used to go for him at last they put their foot into it badly a chap called robinsonin this house by the wayoffended them in some way and one morning he was found tied up in the bath up to his neck in cold water apparently hed been there about an hour he got pneumonia and almost died and then the authorities began to get going robinson thought he had recognised the voice of one of the chapsi forget his name the chap was had up by the old man and gave the show away entirely about a dozen fellows were sacked clean off the reel since then the thing has been dropped  but what about it what were you going to say when you came in  why its been revived  rot  its a fact do you know mill a prefect in seymours  only by sight  i met him just now hes in a raving condition his studys been wrecked you never saw such a sight everything upside down or smashed he has been showing me the ruins  i believe mill is awfully barred in seymours said trevor anybody might have ragged his study  thats just what i thought hes just the sort of man the league used to go for  that doesnt prove that its been revived all the same objected trevor  no friend but this does mill found it tied to a chair  it was a small card it looked like an ordinary visiting card on it in neat print were the words with the compliments of the league  thats exactly the same sort of card as they used to use said clowes ive seen some of them what do you think of that  i think whoever has started the thing is a pretty averagesized idiot hes bound to get caught some time or other and then out he goes the old man wouldnt think twice about sacking a chap of that sort  a chap of that sort said clowes will take jolly good care he isnt caught but its rather sport isnt it  and he went off to his study  next day there was further evidence that the league was an actual going concern when trevor came down to breakfast he found a letter by his plate it was printed as the card had been it was signed the president of the league and the purport of it was that the league did not wish barry to continue to play for the first fifteen     v  mill receives visitors   trevors first idea was that somebody had sent the letter for a jokeclowes for choice  he sounded him on the subject after breakfast  did you send me that letter he inquired when clowes came into his study to borrow a sportsman  what letter did you send the team for tomorrow up to the sporter i wonder what sort of a lot the town are bringing  about not giving barry his footer colours  clowes was reading the paper  giving whom he asked  barry cant you listen  giving him what  footer colours  what about them  trevor sprang at the paper and tore it away from him after which he sat on the fragments  did you send me a letter about not giving barry his footer colours  clowes surveyed him with the air of a nurse to whom the family baby has just said some more than usually good thing  dont stop he said i could listen all day  trevor felt in his pocket for the note and flung it at him clowes picked it up and read it gravely  what are footer colours he asked  well said trevor its a pretty rotten sort of joke whoever sent it you havent said yet whether you did or not  what earthly reason should i have for sending it and i think youre making a mistake if you think this is meant as a joke  you dont really believe this league rot  you didnt see mills study after treatment i did anyhow how do you account for the card i showed you  but that sort of thing doesnt happen at school  well it has happened you see  who do you think did send the letter then  the president of the league  and who the dickens is the president of the league when hes at home  if i knew that i should tell mill and earn his blessing not that i want it  then i suppose snorted trevor youd suggest that on the strength of this letter id better leave barry out of the team  satirically in brackets commented clowes  its no good your jumping on me he added ive done nothing all i suggest is that youd better keep more or less of a lookout if this leagues anything like the old one youll find theyve all sorts of ways of getting at people they dont love i shouldnt like to come down for a bath some morning and find you already in possession tied up like robinson when they found robinson he was quite blue both as to the face and speech he didnt speak very clearly but what one could catch was well worth hearing i should advise you to sleep with a loaded revolver under your pillow  the first thing i shall do is find out who wrote this letter  i should said clowes encouragingly keep moving  in seymours house the mills study incident formed the only theme of conversation that morning previously the sudden elevation to the first fifteen of barry who was popular in the house at the expense of randbrown who was unpopular had given seymours something to talk about but the ragging of the study put this topic entirely in the shade the study was still on view in almost its original condition of disorder and all day comparative strangers flocked to see mill in his den in order to inspect things mill was a youth with few friends and it is probable that more of his fellowseymourites crossed the threshold of his study on the day after the occurrence than had visited him in the entire course of his school career brown would come in to borrow a knife would sweep the room with one comprehensive glance and depart to be followed at brief intervals by smith robinson and jones who came respectively to learn the right time to borrow a book and to ask him if he had seen a pencil anywhere towards the end of the day mill would seem to have wearied somewhat of the proceedings as was proved when master thomas renford aged fourteen who fagged for milton the head of the house burst in on the thin pretence that he had mistaken the study for that of his rightful master and gave vent to a prolonged whistle of surprise and satisfaction at the sight of the ruins on that occasion the incensed owner of the dismantled study taking a mean advantage of the fact that he was a prefect and so entitled to wield the rod produced a handy swaggerstick from an adjacent corner and inviting master renford to bend over gave him six of the best to remember him by which ceremony being concluded he kicked him out into the passage and renford went down to the junior dayroom to tell his friend harvey about it  gave me six the cad said he just because i had a look at his beastly study why shouldnt i look at his study if i like ive a jolly good mind to go up and have another squint  harvey warmly approved the scheme  no i dont think i will said renford with a yawn its such a fag going upstairs  yes isnt it said harvey  and hes such a beast too  yes isnt he said harvey  im jolly glad his study has been ragged continued the vindictive renford  its jolly exciting isnt it added harvey and i thought this term was going to be slow the easter term generally is  this remark seemed to suggest a train of thought to renford who made the following cryptic observation have you seen them today  to the ordinary person the words would have conveyed little meaning to harvey they appeared to teem with import  yes he said i saw them early this morning  were they all right  yes splendid  good said renford  barrys friend drummond was one of those who had visited the scene of the disaster early before mills energetic hand had repaired the damage done and his narrative was consequently in some demand  the place was in a frightful muck he said everything smashed except the table and ink all over the place whoever did it must have been fairly sick with him or hed never have taken the trouble to do it so thoroughly made a fair old hash of things didnt he bertie  bertie was the form in which the school elected to serve up the name of de bertini raoul de bertini was a french boy who had come to wrykyn in the previous term drummonds father had met his father in paris and drummond was supposed to be looking after bertie they shared a study together bertie could not speak much english and what he did speak was like mills furniture badly broken  pardon he said  doesnt matter said drummond it wasnt anything important i was only appealing to you for corroborative detail to give artistic verisimilitude to a bald and unconvincing narrative  bertie grinned politely he always grinned when he was not quite equal to the intellectual pressure of the conversation as a consequence of which he was generally like mrs fezziwig one vast substantial smile  i never liked mill much said barry but i think its rather bad luck on the man  once announced mtodd solemnly he kicked mefor making a row in the passage it was plain that the recollection rankled  barry would probably have pointed out what an excellent and praiseworthy act on mills part that had been when randbrown came in  prefects meeting he inquired or havent they made you a prefect yet mtodd  mtodd said they had not  nobody present liked randbrown and they looked at him rather inquiringly as if to ask what he had come for a friend may drop in for a chat an acquaintance must justify his intrusion  randbrown ignored the silent inquiry he seated himself on the table and dragged up a chair to rest his legs on  talking about mill of course he said  yes said drummond have you seen his study since it happened  yes  randbrown smiled as if the recollection amused him he was one of those people who do not look their best when they smile  playing for the first tomorrow barry  i dont know said barry shortly i havent seen the list  he objected to the introduction of the topic it is never pleasant to have to discuss games with the very man one has ousted from the team  drummond too seemed to feel that the situation was an embarrassing one for a few minutes later he got up to go over to the gymnasium  any of you chaps coming he asked  barry and mtodd thought they would and the three left the room  nothing like showing a man you dont want him eh bertie what do you think said randbrown  bertie grinned politely     vi  trevor remains firm   the most immediate effect of telling anybody not to do a thing is to make him do it in order to assert his independence trevors first act on receipt of the letter was to include barry in the team against the town it was what he would have done in any case but under the circumstances he felt a peculiar pleasure in doing it the incident also had the effect of recalling to his mind the fact that he had tried barry in the first instance on his own responsibility without consulting the committee the committee of the first fifteen consisted of the two old colours who came immediately after the captain on the list the powers of a committee varied according to the determination and truculence of the members of it on any definite and important step affecting the welfare of the fifteen the captain theoretically could not move without their approval but if the captain happened to be strongminded and the committee weak they were apt to be slightly out of it and the captain would develop a habit of consulting them a day or so after he had done a thing he would give a man his colours and inform the committee of it on the following afternoon when the thing was done and could not be repealed  trevor was accustomed to ask the advice of his lieutenants fairly frequently he never gave colours for instance off his own bat it seemed to him that it might be as well to learn what views milton and allardyce had on the subject of barry and after the town team had gone back across the river defeated by a goal and a try to nil he changed and went over to seymours to interview milton  milton was in an armchair watching renford brew tea his was one of the few studies in the school in which there was an armchair with the majority of his contemporaries it would only run to the portable kind that fold up  come and have some tea trevor said milton  thanks if theres any going  heaps is there anything to eat renford  the fag appealed to on this important point pondered darkly for a moment  there was some cake he said  thats all right interrupted milton cheerfully scratch the cake i ate it before the match isnt there anything else  milton had a healthy appetite  then there used to be some biscuits  biscuits are off i finished em yesterday look here young renford what youd better do is cut across to the shop and get some more cake and some more biscuits and tell em to put it down to me and dont be long  a miles better idea would be to send him over to donaldsons to fetch something from my study suggested trevor it isnt nearly so far and ive got heaps of stuff  ripping cut over to donaldsons young renford as a matter of fact he added confidentially when the emissary had vanished im not half sure that the other dodge would have worked they seem to think at the shop that ive had about enough things on tick lately i havent settled up for last term yet ive spent all ive got on this study what do you think of those photographs    trevor got up and inspected them they filled the mantelpiece and most of the wall above it they were exclusively theatrical photographs and of a variety to suit all tastes for the earnest student of the drama there was sir henry irving in the bells and mr martin harvey in the only way for the admirers of the merely beautiful there were messrs dan leno and herbert campbell  not bad said trevor beastly waste of money  waste of money milton was surprised and pained at the criticism why you must spend your money on something  rot i call it said trevor if you want to collect something why dont you collect something worth having  just then renford came back with the supplies  thanks said milton put em down does the billy boil young renford  renford asked for explanatory notes  youre a bit of an ass at times arent you said milton kindly what i meant was is the tea ready if it is you can scoot if it isnt buck up with it  a sound of bubbling and a rush of steam from the spout of the kettle proclaimed that the billy did boil renford extinguished the etna and left the room while milton murmuring vague formulae about one spoonful for each person and one for the pot got out of his chair with a groanfor the town match had been an energetic oneand began to prepare tea  what i really came round about began trevor  half a second i cant find the milk  he went to the door and shouted for renford on that overworked youths appearance the following dialogue took place  wheres the milk  what milk  my milk  there isnt any this in a tone not untinged with triumph as if the speaker realised that here was a distinct score to him  no milk  no  why not  you never had any  well just cut acrossno half a second what are you doing downstairs  having tea  then youve got milk  only a little this apprehensively  bring it up you can have what we leave  disgusted retirement of master renford  what i really came about said trevor again was business  colours inquired milton rummaging in the tin for biscuits with sugar on them good brand of biscuit you keep trevor  yes i think we might give alexander and parker their third  all right any others  barry his second do you think  rather he played a good game today hes an improvement on randbrown  glad you think so i was wondering whether it was the right thing to do chucking randbrown out after one trial like that but still if you think barrys better  streets better ive had heaps of chances of watching them and comparing them when theyve been playing for the house it isnt only that randbrown cant tackle and barry can barry takes his passes much better and doesnt lose his head when hes pressed  just what i thought said trevor then youd go on playing him for the first  rather hell get better every game youll see as he gets more used to playing in the first threequarter line and hes as keen as anything on getting into the team practises taking passes and that sort of thing every day  well hell get his colours if we lick ripton  we ought to lick them theyve lost one of their forwards clifford a redhaired chap who was good out of touch i dont know if you remember him  i suppose i ought to go and see allardyce about these colours now goodbye  there was running and passing on the monday for every one in the three teams trevor and clowes met mr seymour as they were returning mr seymour was the football master at wrykyn  i see youve given barry his second trevor  yes sir  i think youre wise to play him for the first he knows the game which is the great thing and he will improve with practice said mr seymour thus corroborating miltons words of the previous saturday  im glad seymour thinks barry good said trevor as they walked on i shall go on playing him now  found out who wrote that letter yet  trevor laughed  not yet he said  probably randbrown suggested clowes hes the man who would gain most by barrys not playing i hear he had a row with mill just before his study was ragged  everybody in seymours has had rows with mill some time or other said trevor  clowes stopped at the door of the junior dayroom to find his fag trevor went on upstairs in the passage he met ruthven  ruthven seemed excited  i say trevor he exclaimed have you seen your study  why whats the matter with it  youd better go and look     vii  with the compliments of the league   trevor went and looked  it was rather an interesting sight an earthquake or a cyclone might have made it a little more picturesque but not much more the general effect was not unlike that of an american saloon after a visit from mrs carrie nation with hatchet as in the case of mills study the only thing that did not seem to have suffered any great damage was the table everything else looked rather off colour the mantelpiece had been swept as bare as a bone and its contents littered the floor trevor dived among the debris and retrieved the latest addition to his art gallery the photograph of this years first fifteen it was a wreck the glass was broken and the photograph itself slashed with a knife till most of the faces were unrecognisable he picked up another treasure last years first eleven smashed glass again faces cut about with knife as before his collection of snapshots was torn into a thousand fragments though as mr jerome said of the papiermache trout there may only have been nine hundred he did not count them his bookshelf was empty the books had gone to swell the contents of the floor there was a shakespeare with its cover off pages twentytwo to thirtyone of vice versa had parted from the parent establishment and were lying by themselves near the door the rogues march lay just beyond them and the look of the cover suggested that somebody had either been biting it or jumping on it with heavy boots  there was other damage over the mantelpiece in happier days had hung a dozen sea gulls eggs threaded on a string the string was still there as good as new but of the eggs nothing was to be seen save a fine particoloured powderon the floor like everything else in the study and a good deal of ink had been upset in one place and another  trevor had been staring at the ruins for some time when he looked up to see clowes standing in the doorway  hullo said clowes been tidying up  trevor made a few hasty comments on the situation clowes listened approvingly  dont you think he went on eyeing the study with a critical air that youve got too many things on the floor and too few anywhere else and i should move some of those books on to the shelf if i were you  trevor breathed very hard  i should like to find the chap who did this he said softly  clowes advanced into the room and proceeded to pick up various misplaced articles of furniture in a helpful way  i thought so he said presently come and look here  tied to a chair exactly as it had been in the case of mill was a neat white card and on it were the words with the compliments of the league  what are you going to do about this asked clowes come into my room and talk it over  ill tidy this place up first said trevor he felt that the work would be a relief i dont want people to see this it mustnt get about im not going to have my study turned into a sort of sideshow like mills you go and change i shant be long  i will never desert mr micawber said clowes friend my place is by your side shut the door and lets get to work  ten minutes later the room had resumed a more or lessthough principally lessnormal appearance the books and chairs were back in their places the ink was sopped up the broken photographs were stacked in a neat pile in one corner with a rug over them the mantelpiece was still empty but as clowes pointed out it now merely looked as if trevor had been pawning some of his household gods there was no sign that a devastating secret society had raged through the study  then they adjourned to clowes study where trevor sank into clowes secondbest chairclowes by an adroit movement having appropriated the best onewith a sigh of enjoyment running and passing followed by the toil of furnitureshifting had made him feel quite tired  it doesnt look so bad now he said thinking of the room they had left by the way what did you do with that card  here it is want it  you can keep it i dont want it  thanks if this sort of things goes on i shall get quite a nice collection of these cards start an album some day  you know said trevor this is getting serious  it always does get serious when anything bad happens to ones self it always strikes one as rather funny when things happen to other people when mills study was wrecked i bet you regarded it as an amusing and original turn what do you think of the present effort  who on earth can have done it  the pres  oh dry up of course it was but who the blazes is he  nay children you have me there quoted clowes ill tell you one thing though you remember what i said about its probably being randbrown he cant have done this thats certain because he was out in the fields the whole time though i dont see who else could have anything to gain by barry not getting his colours  theres no reason to suspect him at all as far as i can see i dont know much about him bar the fact that he cant play footer for nuts but ive never heard anything against him have you  i scarcely know him myself he isnt liked in seymours i believe  well anyhow this cant be his work  thats what i said  for all we know the league may have got their knife into barry for some reason you said they used to get their knife into fellows in that way anyhow i mean to find out who ragged my room  it wouldnt be a bad idea said clowes                                       ohara came round to donaldsons before morning school next day to tell trevor that he had not yet succeeded in finding the lost bat he found trevor and clowes in the formers den trying to put a few finishing touches to the same  hullo an whats up with your study he inquired he was quick at noticing things trevor looked annoyed clowes asked the visitor if he did not think the study presented a neat and gentlemanly appearance  where are all your photographs trevor persisted the descendant of irish kings  its no good trying to conceal anything from the bhoy said clowes sit down oharamind that chair its rather wobblyand i will tell ye the story  can you keep a thing dark inquired trevor  ohara protested that tombs were not in it  well then do you remember what happened to mills study thats whats been going on here  ohara nearly fell off his chair with surprise that some philanthropist should rag mills study was only to be expected mill was one of the worst a worm without a saving grace but trevor captain of football in the first eleven the thing was unthinkable  but who he began  thats just what i want to know said trevor shortly he did not enjoy discussing the affair  how long have you been at wrykyn ohara said clowes  ohara made a rapid calculation his fingers twiddled in the air as he worked out the problem  six years he said at last leaning back exhausted with brain work  then you must remember the league  remember the league rather  well its been revived  ohara whistled  thisll liven the old place up he said ive often thought of reviving it meself an so has moriarty if its anything like the old league theres going to be a sort of donnybrook before its done with i wonder whos running it this time  we should like to know that if you find out you might tell us  i will  and dont tell anybody else said trevor this business has got to be kept quiet keep it dark about my study having been ragged  i wont tell a soul  not even moriarty  oh hang it man put in clowes you dont want to kill the poor bhoy surely you must let him tell one person  all right said trevor you can tell moriarty but nobody else mind  ohara promised that moriarty should receive the news exclusively  but why did the league go for ye  they happen to be down on me it doesnt matter why they are  i see said ohara oh he added about that bat the search is being vigorously prosecutedthats a newspaper quotation  times inquired clowes  wrykyn patriot said ohara pulling out a bundle of letters he inspected each envelope in turn and from the fifth extracted a newspaper cutting  read that he said  it was from the local paper and ran as follows  hooligan outragea painful sensation has been caused in the town by a deplorable ebullition of local hooliganism which has resulted in the wanton disfigurement of the splendid statue of sir eustace briggs which stands in the new recreation grounds our readers will recollect that the statue was erected to commemorate the return of sir eustace as member for the borough of wrykyn by an overwhelming majority at the last election last tuesday some youths of the town passing through the recreation grounds early in the morning noticed that the face and body of the statue were completely covered with leaves and some black substance which on examination proved to be tar they speedily lodged information at the police station everything seems to point to party spite as the motive for the outrage in view of the forthcoming election such an act is highly significant and will serve sufficiently to indicate the tactics employed by our opponents the search for the perpetrator or perpetrators of the dastardly act is being vigorously prosecuted and we learn with satisfaction that the police have already several clues  clues said clowes handing back the paper that means the bat that gas about our opponents is all a blind to put you off your guard you wait therell be more painful sensations before youve finished with this business  they cant have found the bat or why did they not say so observed ohara  guile said clowes pure guile if i were you i should escape while i could try callao theres no extradition there      on no petition      is extradition      allowed in callao  either of you chaps coming over to school     viii  ohara on the track   tuesday mornings at wrykyn were devotedup to the quarter to eleven intervalto the study of mathematics that is to say instead of going to their formrooms the various forms visited the outoftheway nooks and dens at the top of the buildings where the mathematical masters were wont to lurk and spent a pleasant two hours there playing round games or reading fiction under the desk mathematics being one of the few branches of school learning which are of any use in after life nobody ever dreamed of doing any work in that direction least of all ohara it was a theory of oharas that he came to school to enjoy himself to have done any work during a mathematics lesson would have struck him as a positive waste of time especially as he was in mr banks class mr banks was a master who simply cried out to be ragged everything he did and said seemed to invite the members of his class to amuse themselves and they amused themselves accordingly one of the advantages of being under him was that it was possible to predict to a nicety the moment when one would be sent out of the room this was found very convenient  oharas ally moriarty was accustomed to take his mathematics with mr morgan whose room was directly opposite mr banks with mr morgan it was not quite so easy to date ones expulsion from the room under ordinary circumstances and in the normal wear and tear of the mornings work but there was one particular action which could always be relied upon to produce the desired result  in one corner of the room stood a gigantic globe the problemhow did it get into the roomwas one that had exercised the minds of many generations of wrykinians it was much too big to have come through the door some thought that the block had been built round it others that it had been placed in the room in infancy and had since grown to refer the question to mr morgan would in six cases out of ten mean instant departure from the room but to make the event certain it was necessary to grasp the globe firmly and spin it round on its axis that always proved successful mr morgan would dash down from his dais address the offender in spirited terms and give him his marching orders at once and without further trouble  moriarty had arranged with ohara to set the globe rolling at ten sharp on this particular morning ohara would then so arrange matters with mr banks that they could meet in the passage at that hour when ohara wished to impart to his friend his information concerning the league  ohara promised to be at the trystingplace at the hour mentioned  he did not think there would be any difficulty about it the news that the league had been revived meant that there would be trouble in the very near future and the prospect of trouble was meat and drink to the irishman in ohara consequently he felt in particularly good form for mathematics as he interpreted the word he thought that he would have no difficulty whatever in keeping mr banks bright and amused the first step had to be to arouse in him an interest in life to bring him into a frame of mind which would induce him to look severely rather than leniently on the next offender this was effected as follows  it was mr banks practice to set his class sums to work out and after some threequarters of an hour had elapsed to pass round the form what he called solutions these were large sheets of paper on which he had worked out each sum in his neat handwriting to a happy ending when the head of the form to whom they were passed first had finished with them he would make a slight tear in one corner and having done so hand them on to his neighbour the neighbour before giving them to his neighbour would also tear them slightly in time they would return to their patentee and proprietor and it was then that things became exciting  who tore these solutions like this asked mr banks in the repressed voice of one who is determined that he will be calm  no answer the tattered solutions waved in the air  he turned to harringay the head of the form  harringay did you tear these solutions like this  indignant negative from harringay what he had done had been to make the small tear in the top lefthand corner if mr banks had asked did you make this small tear in the top lefthand corner of these solutions harringay would have scorned to deny the impeachment but to claim the credit for the whole work would he felt be an act of flat dishonesty and an injustice to his gifted collaborateurs  no sir said harringay  browne  yes sir  did you tear these solutions in this manner  no sir  and so on through the form  then harringay rose after the manner of the debater who is conscious that he is going to say the popular thing  sir he began  sit down harringay  harringay gracefully waved aside the absurd command  sir he said i think i am expressing the general consensus of opinion among myahemfellowstudents when i say that this class sincerely regrets the unfortunate state the solutions have managed to get themselves into  hear hear from a back bench  it is with  sit down harringay  it is with heartfelt  harringay if you do not sit down  as your ludship pleases this sotto voce  and harringay resumed his seat amidst applause ohara got up  as me frind who has just sat down was about to observe  sit down ohara the whole form will remain after the class  the unfortunate state the solutions have managed to get thimsilves into is sincerely regretted by this class sir i think i am ixprissing the general consensus of opinion among my fellowstudents whin i say that it is with heartfelt sorrow  ohara  yes sir  leave the room instantly  yes sir  from the tower across the gravel came the melodious sound of chimes the college clock was beginning to strike ten he had scarcely got into the passage and closed the door after him when a roar as of a bereaved spirit rang through the room opposite followed by a string of words the only intelligible one being the nounsubstantive globe and the next moment the door opened and moriarty came out the last stroke of ten was just booming from the clock  there was a large cupboard in the passage the top of which made a very comfortable seat they climbed on to this and began to talk business  an what was it ye wanted to tell me inquired moriarty  ohara related what he had learned from trevor that morning  an do ye know said moriarty when he had finished i half suspected when i heard that mills study had been ragged that it might be the league that had done it if ye remember it was what they enjoyed doing breaking up a mans happy home they did it frequently  but i cant understand them doing it to trevor at all  theyll do it to anybody they choose till theyre caught at it  if they are caught therell be a row  we must catch em said moriarty like ohara he revelled in the prospect of a disturbance ohara and he were going up to aldershot at the end of the term to try and bring back the light and middleweight medals respectively moriarty had won the lightweight in the previous year but by reason of putting on a stone since the competition was now no longer eligible for that class ohara had not been up before but the wrykyn instructor a good judge of pugilistic form was of opinion that he ought to stand an excellent chance as the prizefighter in rodney stone says when you get a good irishman you cant better em but theyre dreadful asty ohara was attending the gymnasium every night in order to learn to curb his dreadful astiness and acquire skill in its place  i wonder if trevor would be any good in a row said moriarty  he cant box said ohara but hed go on till he was killed entirely i say im getting rather tired of sitting here arent you lets go to the other end of the passage and have some cricket  so having unearthed a piece of wood from the debris at the top of the cupboard and rolled a handkerchief into a ball they adjourned  recalling the stirring events of six years back when the league had first been started ohara remembered that the members of that enterprising society had been wont to hold meetings in a secluded spot where it was unlikely that they would be disturbed it seemed to him that the first thing he ought to do if he wanted to make their nearer acquaintance now was to find their present rendezvous they must have one they would never run the risk involved in holding massmeetings in one anothers studies on the last occasion it had been an old quarry away out on the downs this had been proved by the nottobeshaken testimony of three schoolhouse fags who had wandered out one halfholiday with the unconcealed intention of finding the leagues place of meeting unfortunately for them they had found it they were going down the path that led to the quarry beforementioned when they were unexpectedly seized blindfolded and carried off an impromptu courtmartial was heldin whispersand the three explorers forthwith received the most spirited touchingup they had ever experienced afterwards they were released and returned to their house with their zeal for detection quite quenched the episode had created a good deal of excitement in the school at the time  on three successive afternoons ohara and moriarty scoured the downs and on each occasion they drew blank on the fourth day just before lockup ohara who had been to tea with gregson of days was going over to the gymnasium to keep a pugilistic appointment with moriarty when somebody ran swiftly past him in the direction of the boardinghouses it was almost dark for the days were still short and he did not recognise the runner but it puzzled him a little to think where he had sprung from ohara was walking quite close to the wall of the college buildings and the runner had passed between it and him and he had not heard his footsteps then he understood and his pulse quickened as he felt that he was on the track beneath the block was a large sort of cellarbasement it was used as a storeroom for chairs and was never opened except when prizeday or some similar event occurred when the chairs were needed it was supposed to be locked at other times but never was the door was just by the spot where he was standing as he stood there halfadozen other vague forms dashed past him in a knot one of them almost brushed against him for a moment he thought of stopping him but decided not to he could wait  on the following afternoon he slipped down into the basement soon after school it was as black as pitch in the cellar he took up a position near the door  it seemed hours before anything happened he was indeed almost giving up the thing as a bad job when a ray of light cut through the blackness in front of him and somebody slipped through the door the next moment a second form appeared dimly and then the light was shut off again  ohara could hear them groping their way past him he waited no longer it is difficult to tell where sound comes from in the dark he plunged forward at a venture his hand swinging round in a semicircle met something which felt like a shoulder he slipped his grasp down to the arm and clutched it with all the force at his disposal     ix  mainly about ferrets   ow exclaimed the captive with no uncertain voice let go you ass youre hurting  the voice was a treble voice this surprised ohara it looked very much as if he had put up the wrong bird from the dimensions of the arm which he was holding his prisoner seemed to be of tender years  let go harvey you idiot i shall kick  before the threat could be put into execution ohara who had been fumbling all this while in his pocket for a match found one loose and struck a light the features of the owner of the armhe was still holding itwere lit up for a moment  why its young renford he exclaimed what are you doing down here  renford however continued to pursue the topic of his arm and the effect that the vicelike grip of the irishman had had upon it  youve nearly broken it he said complainingly  im sorry i mistook you for somebody else whos that with you  its me said an ungrammatical voice  whos me  harvey  at this point a soft yellow light lit up the more immediate neighbourhood harvey had brought a bicycle lamp into action  thats more like it said renford look here ohara you wont split will you  im not an informer by profession thanks said ohara  oh i know its all right really but you cant be too careful because one isnt allowed down here and thered be a beastly row if it got out about our being down here  and they would be cobbed put in harvey  who are they asked ohara  ferrets like to have a look at them  ferrets  yes harvey brought back a couple at the beginning of term ripping little beasts we couldnt keep them in the house as theyd have got dropped on in a second so we had to think of somewhere else and thought why not keep them down here  why indeed said ohara do ye find they like it  oh they dont mind said harvey we feed em twice a day once before breakfastwe take it in turns to get up earlyand once directly after school and on halfholidays and sundays we take them out on to the downs  what for  why rabbits of course renford brought back a saloonpistol with him we keep it locked up in a boxdont tell any one  and what do ye do with the rabbits  we pot at them as they come out of the holes  yes but when ye hit em  oh said renford with some reluctance we havent exactly hit any yet  weve got jolly near though lots of times said harvey last saturday i swear i wasnt more than a quarter of an inch off one of them if it had been a decentsized rabbit i should have plugged it middle stump only it was a small one so i missed but come and see them we keep em right at the other end of the place in case anybody comes in  have you ever seen anybody down here asked ohara  once said renford halfadozen chaps came down here once while we were feeding the ferrets we waited till theyd got well in then we nipped out quietly they didnt see us  did you see who they were  no it was too dark here they are rummy old crib this isnt it look out for your shins on the chairs switch on the light harvey there arent they rippers quite tame too they know us quite well they know theyre going to be fed too hullo sir nigel this is sir nigel out of the white company you know dont let him nip your fingers this other ones sherlock holmes  catssss said ohara he had a sort of idea that that was the right thing to say to any animal that could chase and bite  renford was delighted to be able to show his ferrets off to so distinguished a visitor  what were you down here about inquired harvey when the little animals had had their meal and had retired once more into private life  ohara had expected this question but he did not quite know what answer to give perhaps on the whole he thought it would be best to tell them the real reason if he refused to explain their curiosity would be roused which would be fatal and to give any reason except the true one called for a display of impromptu invention of which he was not capable besides they would not be likely to give away his secret while he held this one of theirs connected with the ferrets he explained the situation briefly and swore them to silence on the subject  renfords comment was brief  by jove he observed  harvey went more deeply into the question  what makes you think they meet down here he asked  i saw some fellows cutting out of here last night and you say yeve seen them here too i dont see what object they could have down here if they werent the league holding a meeting i dont see what else a chap would be after  he might be keeping ferrets hazarded renford  the whole school doesnt keep ferrets said ohara youre unique in that way no it must be the league an i mean to wait here till they come  not all night asked harvey he had a great respect for ohara whose reputation in the school for outoftheway doings was considerable in the bright lexicon of ohara he believed there to be no such word as impossible  no said ohara but till lockup you two had better cut now  yes i think wed better said harvey  and dont ye breathe a word about this to a soula warning which extracted fervent promises of silence from both youths  this said harvey as they emerged on to the gravel is something like im jolly glad were in it    rather do you think ohara will catch them  he must if he waits down there long enough theyre certain to come again dont you wish youd been here when the league was on before  i should think i did race you over to the shop i want to get something before it shuts  right ho and they disappeared  ohara waited where he was till six struck from the clocktower followed by the sound of the bell as it rang for lockup then he picked his way carefully through the groves of chairs barking his shins now and then on their outturned legs and pushing open the door went out into the open air it felt very fresh and pleasant after the brand of atmosphere supplied in the vault he then ran over to the gymnasium to meet moriarty feeling a little disgusted at the lack of success that had attended his detective efforts up to the present so far he had nothing to show for his trouble except a good deal of dust on his clothes and a dirty collar but he was full of determination he could play a waiting game  it was a pity as it happened that ohara left the vault when he did five minutes after he had gone six shadowy forms made their way silently and in single file through the doorway of the vault which they closed carefully behind them the fact that it was after lockup was of small consequence a good deal of latitude in that way was allowed at wrykyn it was the custom to go out after the bell had sounded to visit the gymnasium in the winter and easter terms the gymnasium became a sort of social club people went there with a very small intention of doing gymnastics they went to lounge about talking to cronies in front of the two huge stoves which warmed the place occasionally as a concession to the look of the thing they would do an easy exercise or two on the horse or parallels but for the most part they preferred the role of spectator there was plenty to see in one corner ohara and moriarty would be sparring their nightly six rounds in two batches of three rounds each in another drummond who was going up to aldershot as a featherweight would be putting in a little practice with the instructor on the apparatus the members of the gymnastic six including the two experts who were to carry the school colours to aldershot in the spring would be performing their usual marvels it was worth dropping into the gymnasium of an evening in no other place in the school were so many sights to be seen  when you were surfeited with sightseeing you went off to your house and this was where the peculiar beauty of the gymnasium system came in you went up to any master who happened to be therethere was always one at leastand observed in suave accents please sir can i have a paper whereupon he taking a scrap of paper would write upon it j o jones or a b smith or c d robinson left gymnasium at suchandsuch a time and by presenting this to the menial who opened the door to you at your house you went in rejoicing and all was peace  now there was no mention on the paper of the hour at which you came to the gymnasiumonly of the hour at which you left consequently certain lawless spirits would range the neighbourhood after lockup and by putting in a quarter of an hour at the gymnasium before returning to their houses escape comment to this class belonged the shadowy forms previously mentioned  ohara had forgotten this custom with the result that he was not at the vault when they arrived moriarty to whom he confided between the rounds the substance of his evenings discoveries reminded him of it its no good watching before lockup he said after six is the time theyll come if they come at all  bedad yere right said ohara one of these nights well take a night off from boxing and go and watch  right said moriarty are ye ready to go on  yes im going to practise that left swing at the body this round the one fitzsimmons does and they put em up once more     x  being a chapter of accidents   on the evening following oharas adventure in the vaults barry and mtodd were in their study getting out the teathings most wrykinians brewed in the winter and easter terms when the days were short and lockup early in the summer term there were other things to donets which lasted till a quarter to seven when lockup was and the bathsand brewing practically ceased but just now it was at its height and every evening at a quarter past five there might be heard in the houses the sizzling of the succulent sausage and other rare delicacies as a rule one or two studies would club together to brew instead of preparing solitary banquets this was found both more convivial and more economical at seymours studies numbers five six and seven had always combined from time immemorial and barry on obtaining study six had carried on the tradition in study five were drummond and his friend de bertini in study seven which was a smaller room and only capable of holding one person with any comfort one james rupert leathertwigg that was his singular name as mr gilbert has it had taken up his abode the name of leathertwigg having proved at an early date in his career too great a mouthful for wrykyn he was known to his friends and acquaintances by the euphonious title of shoeblossom the charm about the genial shoeblossom was that you could never tell what he was going to do next all that you could rely on with any certainty was that it would be something which would have been better left undone  it was just five oclock when barry and mtodd started to get things ready they were not high enough up in the school to have fags so that they had to do this for themselves  barry was still in football clothes he had been out running and passing with the first fifteen mtodd whose idea of exercise was winding up a watch had been spending his time since school ceased in the study with a book he was in his ordinary clothes it was therefore fortunate that when he upset the kettle he nearly always did at some period of the evenings business the contents spread themselves over barry and not over himself football clothes will stand any amount of water whereas mtodds youths winter suiting at fortytwo shillings and sixpence might have been injured barry however did not look upon the episode in this philosophical light he spoke to him eloquently for a while and then sent him downstairs to fetch more water while he was away drummond and de bertini came in  hullo said drummond tea ready  not much replied barry bitterly not likely to be either at this rate wed just got the kettle going when that ass mtodd plunged against the table and upset the lot over my bags lucky the beastly stuff wasnt boiling im soaked  while we waitthe sausagesyesa good ideamtodd he is downstairsbut to wait no no let us shall we is it not so yes observed bertie lucidly  now construe said barry looking at the linguist with a bewildered expression it was a source of no little inconvenience to his friends that de bertini was so very fixed in his determination to speak english he was a trier all the way was de bertini you rarely caught him helping out his remarks with the language of his native land it was english or nothing with him to most of his circle it might as well have been zulu  drummond either through natural genius or because he spent more time with him was generally able to act as interpreter occasionally there would come a linguistic effort by which even he freely confessed himself baffled and then they would pass on unsatisfied but as a rule he was equal to the emergency he was so now  what bertie means he explained is that its no good us waiting for mtodd to come back he never could fill a kettle in less than ten minutes and even then hes certain to spill it coming upstairs and have to go back again lets get on with the sausages  the pan had just been placed on the fire when mtodd returned with the water he tripped over the mat as he entered and spilt about half a pint into one of his football boots which stood inside the door but the accident was comparatively trivial and excited no remark  i wonder where that slacker shoeblossom has got to said barry he never turns up in time to do any work he seems to regard himself as a beastly guest i wish we could finish the sausages before he comes it would be a sell for him  not much chance of that said drummond who was kneeling before the fire and keeping an excited eye on the spluttering pan you see hell come just as weve finished cooking them i believe the man waits outside with his ear to the keyhole hullo stand by with the plate theyll be done in half a jiffy  just as the last sausage was deposited in safety on the plate the door opened and shoeblossom looking as if he had not brushed his hair since early childhood sidled in with an attempt at an easy nonchalance which was rendered quite impossible by the hopeless state of his conscience  ah he said brewing i see can i be of any use  weve finished years ago said barry  ages ago said mtodd  a look of intense alarm appeared on shoeblossoms classical features  youve not finished really  weve finished cooking everything said drummond we havent begun tea yet now are you happy  shoeblossom was so happy that he felt he must do something to celebrate the occasion he felt like a successful general there must be something he could do to show that he regarded the situation with approval he looked round the study ha happy thoughtthe fryingpan that useful culinary instrument was lying in the fender still bearing its cargo of fat and beside ita sight to stir the blood and make the heart beat fasterwere the sausages piled up on their plate  shoeblossom stooped he seized the fryingpan he gave it one twirl in the air then before any one could stop him he had turned it upside down over the fire as has been already remarked you could never predict exactly what james rupert leathertwigg would be up to next  when anything goes out of the fryingpan into the fire it is usually productive of interesting byproducts the maxim applies to fat the fat was in the fire with a vengeance a great sheet of flame rushed out and up shoeblossom leaped back with a readiness highly creditable in one who was not a professional acrobat the covering of the mantelpiece caught fire the flames went roaring up the chimney  drummond cool while everything else was so hot without a word moved to the mantelpiece to beat out the fire with a football shirt bertie was talking rapidly to himself in french nobody could understand what he was saying which was possibly fortunate  by the time drummond had extinguished the mantelpiece barry had also done good work by knocking the fire into the grate with the poker mtodd who had been standing up till now in the far corner of the room gaping vaguely at things in general now came into action probably it was force of habit that suggested to him that the time had come to upset the kettle at any rate upset it he didmost of it over the glowing blazing mass in the grate the rest over barry one of the largest and most detestable smells the study had ever had to endure instantly assailed their nostrils the fire in the study was out now but in the chimney it still blazed merrily  go up on to the roof and heave water down said drummond the strategist you can get out from miltons dormitory window and take care not to chuck it down the wrong chimney  barry was starting for the door to carry out these excellent instructions when it flew open  pah what have you boys been doing what an abominable smell pah said a muffled voice it was mr seymour most of his face was concealed in a large handkerchief but by the look of his eyes which appeared above he did not seem pleased he took in the situation at a glance fires in the house were not rarities one facetious sportsman had once made a rule of setting the senior dayroom chimney on fire every term he had since left by request but fires still occurred  is the chimney on fire  yes sir said drummond  go and find herbert and tell him to take some water on to the roof and throw it down herbert was the boot and knife cleaner at seymours  barry went soon afterwards a splash of water in the grate announced that the intrepid herbert was hard at it another followed and another then there was a pause mr seymour thought he would look up to see if the fire was out he stooped and peered into the darkness and even as he gazed splash came the contents of the fourth pail together with some soot with which they had formed a travelling acquaintance on the way down mr seymour staggered back grimy and dripping there was dead silence in the study shoeblossoms face might have been seen working convulsively  the silence was broken by a hollow sepulchral voice with a strong cockney accent  did yer see any water come down then sir said the voice  shoeblossom collapsed into a chair and began to sob feebly                                       disgraceful  scandalous  get up leathertwigg  not to be trusted  babies  three hundred lines leathertwigg  abominable  surprised  ought to be ashamed of yourselves  double leathertwigg  not fit to have studies  atrocious   such were the main heads of mr seymours speech on the situation as he dabbed desperately at the soot on his face with his handkerchief shoeblossom stood and gurgled throughout not even the thought of six hundred lines could quench that dauntless spirit  finally perorated mr seymour as he was leaving the room as you are evidently not to be trusted with rooms of your own i forbid you to enter them till further notice it is disgraceful that such a thing should happen do you hear barry and you drummond you are not to enter your studies again till i give you leave move your books down to the senior dayroom tonight  and mr seymour stalked off to clean himself  anyhow said shoeblossom as his footsteps died away we saved the sausages  it is this indomitable gift of looking on the bright side that makes us englishmen what we are     xi  the housematches   it was something of a consolation to barry and his friendsat any rate to barry and drummondthat directly after they had been evicted from their study the housematches began except for the ripton match the housematches were the most important event of the easter term even the sports at the beginning of april were productive of less excitement there were twelve houses at wrykyn and they played on the knockingout system to be beaten once meant that a house was no longer eligible for the competition it could play friendlies as much as it liked but play it never so wisely it could not lift the cup thus it often happened that a weak house by fluking a victory over a strong rival found itself much to its surprise in the semifinal or sometimes even in the final this was rarer at football than at cricket for at football the better team generally wins  the favourites this year were donaldsons though some fancied seymours donaldsons had trevor whose leadership was worth almost more than his play in no other house was training so rigid you could tell a donaldsons man if he was in his houseteam at a glance if you saw a man eating oatmeal biscuits in the shop and eyeing wistfully the while the stacks of buns and pastry you could put him down as a donaldsonite without further evidence the captains of the other houses used to prescribe a certain amount of selfabnegation in the matter of food but trevor left his men barely enough to support lifeenough that is of the things that are really worth eating the consequence was that donaldsons would turn out for an important match all muscle and bone and on such occasions it was bad for those of their opponents who had been taking life more easily besides trevor they had clowes and had had bad luck in not having paget had paget stopped no other house could have looked at them but by his departure the strength of the team had become more nearly on a level with that of seymours  some even thought that seymours were the stronger milton was as good a forward as the school possessed besides him there were barry and randbrown on the wings drummond was a useful half and five of the pack had either first or second fifteen colours it was a team that would take some beating  trevor came to that conclusion early if we can beat seymours well lift the cup he said to clowes  well have to do all we know was clowes reply  they were watching seymours pile up an immense score against a scratch team got up by one of the masters the first round of the competition was over donaldsons had beaten templars seymours the school house templars were rather stronger than the school house and donaldsons had beaten them by a rather larger score than that which seymours had run up in their match but neither trevor nor clowes was inclined to draw any augury from this seymours had taken things easily after halftime donaldsons had kept going hard all through  that makes randbrowns fourth try said clowes as the wing threequarter of the second fifteen raced round and scored in the corner  yes this is the sort of game hes all right in the man whos marking him is no good barrys scored twice and both good tries too  oh theres no doubt which is the best man said clowes i only mentioned that it was randbrowns fourth as an item of interest  the game continued barry scored a third try  were drawn against applebys next round said trevor we can manage them all right  when is it  next thursday nomads match on saturday then ripton saturday week  whove seymours drawn  days itll be a good game too seymours ought to win but theyll have to play their best days have got some good men  fine scrum said clowes  yes quick in the open too which is always good business i wish theyd beat seymours  oh we ought to be all right whichever wins  applebys did not offer any very serious resistance to the donaldson attack they were outplayed at every point of the game and before halftime donaldsons had scored their thirty points it was a rule in all inschool matchesand a good rule toothat when one side led by thirty points the match stopped this prevented those massacres which do so much towards crushing all the football out of the members of the beaten team and it kept the winning team from getting slack by urging them on to score their thirty points before halftime there were some housesnotoriously slackwhich would go for a couple of seasons without ever playing the second half of a match  having polished off the men of appleby the donaldson team trooped off to the other game to see how seymours were getting on with days it was evidently an exciting match the first half had been played to the accompaniment of much shouting from the ropes though coming so early in the competition it was really the semifinal for whichever team won would be almost certain to get into the final the school had turned up in large numbers to watch  seymours looking tired of life said clowes that would seem as if his fellows werent doing well  whats been happening here asked trevor of an enthusiast in a seymours house cap whose face was crimson with yelling  one goal all replied the enthusiast huskily did you beat applebys  yes thirty points before halftime whos been doing the scoring here  milton got in for us he barged through out of touch weve been pressing the whole time barry got over once but he was held up hullo theyre beginning again buck up seymours  his voice cracking on the high note he took an immense slab of vanilla chocolate as a remedy for hoarseness  who scored for days asked clowes  strachan randbrown let him through from their twentyfive you never saw anything so rotten as randbrown he doesnt take his passes and strachan gets past him every time  is strachan playing on the wing  strachan was the first fifteen fullback  yes theyve put young bassett back instead of him seymours buck up seymours weell played there did you ever see anything like it he broke off disgustedly  the seymourite playing centre next to randbrown had run through to the back and passed out to his wing as a good centre should it was a perfect pass except that it came at his head instead of his chest nobody with any pretensions to decent play should have missed it randbrown however achieved that feat the ball struck his hands and bounded forward the referee blew his whistle for a scrum and a certain try was lost  from the scrum the seymours forwards broke away to the goalline where they were pulled up by bassett the next minute the defence had been pierced and drummond was lying on the ball a yard across the line the enthusiast standing by clowes expended the last relics of his voice in commemorating the fact that his side had the lead  drummondll be good next year said trevor and he made a mental note to tell allardyce who would succeed him in the command of the school football to keep an eye on the player in question  the triumph of the seymourites was not long lived milton failed to convert drummonds try from the dropout from the twentyfive line barry got the ball and punted into touch the throwout was not straight and a scrum was formed the ball came out to the days halves and went across to strachan randbrown hesitated and then made a futile spring at the first fifteen mans neck strachan handed him off easily and ran the seymours fullback who was a poor player failed to get across in time strachan ran round behind the posts the kick succeeded and days now led by two points  after this the game continued in days half five minutes before time was up drummond got the ball from a scrum nearly on the line passed it to barry on the wing instead of opening up the game by passing to his centres and barry slipped through in the corner this put seymours just one point ahead and there they stayed till the whistle blew for noside  milton walked over to the boardinghouses with clowes and trevor he was full of the match particularly of the iniquity of randbrown  i slanged him on the field he said its a thing i dont often do but what else can you do when a man plays like that he lost us three certain tries  when did you administer your rebuke inquired clowes  when he had let strachan through that second time in the second half i asked him why on earth he tried to play footer at all i told him a good kissinthering club was about his form it was rather cheap but i felt so frightfully sick about it its sickening to be let down like that when youve been pressing the whole time and ought to be scoring every other minute  what had he to say on the subject asked clowes  oh he gassed a bit until i told him id kick him if he said another word that shut him up  you ought to have kicked him you want all the kicking practice you can get i never saw anything feebler than that shot of yours after drummonds try  id like to see you take a kick like that it was nearly on the touchline still when we play you we shant need to convert any of our tries well get our thirty points without that perhaps youd like to scratch  as a matter of fact said clowes confidentially i am going to score seven tries against you off my own bat youll be sorry you ever turned out when weve finished with you     xii  news of the gold bat   shoeblossom sat disconsolately on the table in the senior dayroom he was not happy in exile brewing in the senior dayroom was a mere vulgar brawl lacking all the refining influences of the study you had to fight for a place at the fire and when you had got it twas not always easy to keep it and there was no privacy and the fellows were always bearfighting so that it was impossible to read a book quietly for ten consecutive minutes without some ass heaving a cushion at you or turning out the gas altogether shoeblossom yearned for the peace of his study and wished earnestly that mr seymour would withdraw the order of banishment it was the not being able to read that he objected to chiefly in place of brewing the exproprietors of studies five six and seven now made a practice of going to the school shop it was more expensive and not nearly so comfortablethere is a romance about a study brew which you can never get anywhere elsebut it served and it was not on this score that he grumbled most what he hated was having to live in a beargarden for shoeblossom was a man of moods give him two or three congenial spirits to back him up and he would lead the revels with the abandon of a mr bultitude after his return to his original form but he liked to choose his accomplices and the gay sparks of the senior dayroom did not appeal to him they were not intellectual enough in his lucid intervals he was accustomed to be almost abnormally solemn and respectable when not promoting some unholy rag shoeblossom resembled an elderly gentleman of studious habits he liked to sit in a comfortable chair and read a book it was the impossibility of doing this in the senior dayroom that led him to try and think of some other haven where he might rest had it been summer he would have taken some literature out on to the cricketfield or the downs and put in a little steady reading there with the aid of a bag of cherries but with the thermometer low that was impossible  he felt very lonely and dismal he was not a man with many friends in fact barry and the other three were almost the only members of the house with whom he was on speakingterms and of these four he saw very little drummond and barry were always out of doors or over at the gymnasium and as for mtodd and de bertini it was not worth while talking to the one and impossible to talk to the other no wonder shoeblossom felt dull once barry and drummond had taken him over to the gymnasium with them but this had bored him worse than ever they had been hard at it all the timefor unlike a good many of the school they went to the gymnasium for business not to loungeand he had had to sit about watching them and watching gymnastics was one of the things he most loathed since then he had refused to go  that night matters came to a head just as he had settled down to read somebody in flinging a cushion across the room brought down the gas apparatus with a run and before light was once more restored it was teatime after that there was preparation which lasted for two hours and by the time he had to go to bed he had not been able to read a single page of the enthralling work with which he was at present occupied  he had just got into bed when he was struck with a brilliant idea why waste the precious hours in sleep what was that saying of somebodys five hours for a wise man six for somebody elsehe forgot whomeight for a fool nine for an idiot or words to that effect five hours sleep would mean that he need not go to bed till half past two in the meanwhile he could be finding out exactly what the hero did do when he found out to his horror that it was his cousin jasper who had really killed the old gentleman in the wood the only question washow was he to do his reading prefects were allowed to work on after lights out in their dormitories by the aid of a candle but to the ordinary mortal this was forbidden  then he was struck with another brilliant idea it is a curious thing about ideas you do not get one for over a month and then there comes a rush of them all brilliant why he thought should he not go and read in his study with a dark lantern he had a dark lantern it was one of the things he had found lying about at home on the last day of the holidays and had brought with him to school it was his custom to go about the house just before the holidays ended snapping up unconsidered trifles which might or might not come in useful this term he had brought back a curious metal vase which looked indian but which had probably been made in birmingham the year before last two old coins of no mortal use to anybody in the world including himself and the dark lantern it was reposing now in the cupboard in his study nearest the window  he had brought his book up with him on coming to bed on the chance that he might have time to read a page or two if he woke up early he had always been doubtful about that man jasper for one thing he had been seen pawning the old gentlemans watch on the afternoon of the murder which was a suspicious circumstance and then he was not a nice character at all and just the sort of man who would be likely to murder old gentlemen in woods he waited till mr seymour had paid his nightly visithe went the round of the dormitories at about elevenand then he chuckled gently if mill the dormitory prefect was awake the chuckle would make him speak for mill was of a suspicious nature and believed that it was only his unintermitted vigilance which prevented the dormitory ragging all night  mill was awake  be quiet there he growled shut up that noise  shoeblossom felt that the time was not yet ripe for his departure half an hour later he tried again there was no rebuke to make certain he emitted a second chuckle replete with sinister meaning a slight snore came from the direction of mills bed shoeblossom crept out of the room and hurried to his study the door was not locked for mr seymour had relied on his commands being sufficient to keep the owner out of it he slipped in found and lit the dark lantern and settled down to read he read with feverish excitement the thing was you see that though claud trevelyan that was the hero knew jolly well that it was jasper who had done the murder the police didnt and as he claud was too noble to tell them he had himself been arrested on suspicion shoeblossom was skimming through the pages with starting eyes when suddenly his attention was taken from his book by a sound it was a footstep somebody was coming down the passage and under the door filtered a thin stream of light to snap the dark slide over the lantern and dart to the door so that if it opened he would be behind it was with him as mr claud trevelyan might have remarked the work of a moment he heard the door of study number five flung open and then the footsteps passed on and stopped opposite his own den the handle turned and the light of a candle flashed into the room to be extinguished instantly as the draught of the moving door caught it  shoeblossom heard his visitor utter an exclamation of annoyance and fumble in his pocket for matches he recognised the voice it was mr seymours the fact was that mr seymour had had the same experience as general stanley in the pirates of penzance      the man who finds his conscience ache       no peace at all enjoys     and as i lay in bed awake       i thought i heard a noise  whether mr seymours conscience ached or not cannot of course be discovered but he had certainly thought he heard a noise and he had come to investigate  the search for matches had so far proved fruitless shoeblossom stood and quaked behind the door the reek of hot tin from the dark lantern grew worse momentarily mr seymour sniffed several times until shoeblossom thought that he must be discovered then to his immense relief the master walked away shoeblossoms chance had come mr seymour had probably gone to get some matches to relight his candle it was far from likely that the episode was closed he would be back again presently if shoeblossom was going to escape he must do it now so he waited till the footsteps had passed away and then darted out in the direction of his dormitory  as he was passing miltons study a white figure glided out of it all that he had ever read or heard of spectres rushed into shoeblossoms petrified brain he wished he was safely in bed he wished he had never come out of it he wished he had led a better and nobler life he wished he had never been born  the figure passed quite close to him as he stood glued against the wall and he saw it disappear into the dormitory opposite his own of which rigby was prefect he blushed hotly at the thought of the fright he had been in it was only somebody playing the same game as himself  he jumped into bed and lay down having first plunged the lantern bodily into his jug to extinguish it its indignant hiss had scarcely died away when mr seymour appeared at the door it had occurred to mr seymour that he had smelt something very much out of the ordinary in shoeblossoms study a smell uncommonly like that of hot tin and a suspicion dawned on him that shoeblossom had been in there with a dark lantern he had come to the dormitory to confirm his suspicions but a glance showed him how unjust they had been there was shoeblossom fast asleep mr seymour therefore followed the excellent example of my lord tomnoddy on a celebrated occasion and went off to bed                                       it was the custom for the captain of football at wrykyn to select and publish the team for the ripton match a week before the day on which it was to be played on the evening after the nomads match trevor was sitting in his study writing out the names when there came a knock at the door and his fag entered with a letter  this has just come trevor he said  all right put it down  the fag left the room trevor picked up the letter the handwriting was strange to him the words had been printed then it flashed upon him that he had received a letter once before addressed in the same waythe letter from the league about barry was this too from that address he opened it  it was  he read it and gasped the worst had happened the gold bat was in the hands of the enemy     xiii  victim number three   with reference to our last communication ran the letterthe writer evidently believed in the commercial styleit may interest you to know that the bat you lost by the statue on the night of the 26th of january has come into our possession we observe that barry is still playing for the first fifteen  and will jolly well continue to muttered trevor crumpling the paper viciously into a ball  he went on writing the names for the ripton match the last name on the list was barrys  then he sat back in his chair and began to wrestle with this new development barry must play that was certain all the bluff in the world was not going to keep him from playing the best man at his disposal in the ripton match he himself did not count it was the school he had to think of this being so what was likely to happen though nothing was said on the point he felt certain that if he persisted in ignoring the league that bat would find its way somehowby devious routes possiblyto the headmaster or some one else in authority and then there would be questionsawkward questionsand things would begin to come out then a fresh point struck him which was that whatever might happen would affect not himself but ohara this made it rather more of a problem how to act personally he was one of those dogged characters who can put up with almost anything themselves if this had been his affair he would have gone on his way without hesitating evidently the writer of the letter was under the impression that he had been the hero or villain of the statue escapade  if everything came out it did not require any great effort of prophecy to predict what the result would be ohara would go promptly he would receive his marching orders within ten minutes of the discovery of what he had done he would be expelled twice over so to speak once for breaking out at nightone of the most heinous offences in the school codeand once for tarring the statue anything that gave the school a bad name in the town was a crime in the eyes of the powers and this was such a particularly flagrant case yes there was no doubt of that ohara would take the first train home without waiting to pack up trevor knew his people well and he could imagine their feelings when the prodigal strolled into their midstan old wrykinian malgre lui as the philosopher said of falling off a ladder it is not the falling that matters it is the sudden stopping at the other end it is not the being expelled that is so peculiarly objectionable it is the sudden homecoming with this gloomy vision before him trevor almost wavered but the thought that the selection of the team had nothing whatever to do with his personal feelings strengthened him he was simply a machine devised to select the fifteen best men in the school to meet ripton in his official capacity of football captain he was not supposed to have any feelings however he yielded in so far that he went to clowes to ask his opinion  clowes having heard everything and seen the letter unhesitatingly voted for the right course if fifty mad irishmen were to be expelled barry must play against ripton he was the best man and in he must go  thats what i thought said trevor its bad for ohara though  clowes remarked somewhat tritely that business was business  besides he went on youre assuming that the thing this letter hints at will really come off i dont think it will a man would have to be such an awful blackguard to go as low as that the least grain of decency in him would stop him i can imagine a man threatening to do it as a piece of bluffby the way the letter doesnt actually say anything of the sort though i suppose it hints at itbut i cant imagine anybody out of a melodrama doing it  you can never tell said trevor he felt that this was but an outside chance the forbearance of ones antagonist is but a poor thing to trust to at the best of times  are you going to tell ohara asked clowes  i dont see the good would you  no he cant do anything and it would only give him a bad time there are pleasanter things i should think than going on from day to day not knowing whether youre going to be sacked or not within the next twelve hours dont tell him  i wont and barry plays against ripton  certainly hes the best man  im going over to seymours now said trevor after a pause to see milton weve drawn seymours in the next round of the housematches i suppose you knew i want to get it over before the ripton match for several reasons about half the fifteen are playing on one side or the other and itll give them a good chance of getting fit running and passing is all right but a good hard games the thing for putting you into form and then i was thinking that as the side that loses whichever it is  seymours of course  hope so well theyre bound to be a bit sick at losing so theyll play up all the harder on saturday to console themselves for losing the cup  my word what strategy said clowes you think of everything when do you think of playing it then  wednesday struck me as a good day dont you think so  it would do splendidly itll be a good match for all practical purposes of course its the final if we beat seymours i dont think the others will trouble us much  there was just time to see milton before lockup trevor ran across to seymours and went up to his study  come in said milton in answer to his knock  trevor went in and stood surprised at the difference in the look of the place since the last time he had visited it the walls once covered with photographs were bare milton seated before the fire was ruefully contemplating what looked like a heap of waste cardboard  trevor recognised the symptoms he had had experience  you dont mean to say theyve been at you too he cried  miltons normally cheerful face was thunderous and gloomy  yes i was thinking what id like to do to the man who ragged it  its the league again i suppose  milton looked surprised  again he said where did you hear of the league this is the first time ive heard of its existence whatever it is what is the confounded thing and why on earth have they played the fool here whats the meaning of this bally rot  he exhibited one of the variety of cards of which trevor had already seen two specimens trevor explained briefly the style and nature of the league and mentioned that his study also had been wrecked  your study why what have they got against you  i dont know said trevor nothing was to be gained by speaking of the letters he had received  did they cut up your photographs  every one  i tell you what it is trevor old chap said milton with great solemnity theres a lunatic in the school thats what i make of it a lunatic whose form of madness is wrecking studies  but the same chap couldnt have done yours and mine it must have been a donaldsons fellow who did mine and one of your chaps who did yours and mills  mills by jove of course i never thought of that that was the league too i suppose  yes one of those cards was tied to a chair but clowes took it away before anybody saw it  milton returned to the details of the disaster  was there any ink spilt in your room  pints said trevor shortly the subject was painful  so there was here said milton mournfully gallons  there was silence for a while each pondering over his wrongs  gallons said milton again i was ass enough to keep a large pot full of it here and they used it all every drop you never saw such a sight  trevor said he had seen one similar spectacle  and my photographs you remember those photographs i showed you all ruined slit across with a knife some torn in half i wish i knew who did that  trevor said he wished so too  there was one of mrs patrick campbell milton continued in heartrending tones which was torn into sixteen pieces i counted them there they are on the mantelpiece and there was one of little tich here he almost broke down which was so covered with ink that for half an hour i couldnt recognise it fact  trevor nodded sympathetically  yes said milton soaked  there was another silence trevor felt it would be almost an outrage to discuss so prosaic a topic as the date of a housematch with one so broken up yet time was flying and lockup was drawing near  are you willing to play he began  i feel as if i could never play again interrupted milton youd hardly believe the amount of blottingpaper ive used today it must have been a lunatic dick old man  when milton called trevor dick it was a sign that he was moved when he called him dick old man it gave evidence of an internal upheaval without parallel  why who else but a lunatic would get up in the night to wreck another chaps study all this was done between eleven last night and seven this morning i turned in at eleven and when i came down here again at seven the place was a wreck it must have been a lunatic  how do you account for the printed card from the league  milton murmured something about madmens cunning and diverting suspicion and relapsed into silence trevor seized the opportunity to make the proposal he had come to make that donaldsons v seymours should be played on the following wednesday  milton agreed listlessly  just where youre standing he said i found a photograph of sir henry irving so slashed about that i thought at first it was huntley wright in san toy  start at twothirty sharp said trevor  i had seventeen of edna may continued the stricken seymourite monotonously in various attitudes all destroyed  on the first fifteen ground of course said trevor ill get aldridge to referee thatll suit you i suppose  all right anything you like just by the fireplace i found the remains of arthur roberts in hms irresponsible and part of seymour hicks under the table  trevor departed     xiv  the white figure   suppose said shoeblossom to barry as they were walking over to school on the morning following the day on which miltons study had passed through the hands of the league suppose you thought somebody had done something but you werent quite certain who but you knew it was some one what would you do  what on earth do you mean inquired barry  i was trying to make an ab case of it explained shoeblossom  whats an ab case  i dont know admitted shoeblossom frankly but it comes in a book of stevensons i think it must mean a sort of case where you call everyone a and b and dont tell their names  well go ahead  its about miltons study  what what about it  well you see the night it was ragged i was sitting in my study with a dark lantern  what  shoeblossom proceeded to relate the moving narrative of his nightwalking adventure he dwelt movingly on his state of mind when standing behind the door waiting for mr seymour to come in and find him he related with appropriate force the hairraising episode of the weird white figure and then he came to the conclusions he had since drawn in calmer moments from that apparitions movements  you see he said i saw it coming out of miltons study and that must have been about the time the study was ragged and it went into rigbys dorm so it must have been a chap in that dorm who did it  shoeblossom was quite clever at rare intervals even barry whose belief in his sanity was of the smallest was compelled to admit that here at any rate he was talking sense  what would you do asked shoeblossom  tell milton of course said barry  but hed give me beans for being out of the dorm after lightsout  this was a distinct point to be considered the attitude of barry towards milton was different from that of shoeblossom barry regarded himthrough having played with him in important matchesas a good sort of fellow who had always behaved decently to him leathertwigg on the other hand looked on him with undisguised apprehension as one in authority who would give him lines the first time he came into contact with him and cane him if he ever did it again he had a decided disinclination to see milton on any pretext whatever  suppose i tell him suggested barry  youll keep my name dark said shoeblossom alarmed  barry said he would make an ab case of it  after school he went to miltons study and found him still brooding over its departed glories  i say milton can i speak to you for a second  hullo barry come in  barry came in  i had fortythree photographs began milton without preamble all destroyed and ive no money to buy any more i had seventeen of edna may  barry feeling that he was expected to say something said by jove really  in various positions continued milton all ruined  not really said barry  there was one of little tich  but barry felt unequal to playing the part of chorus any longer it was all very thrilling but if milton was going to run through the entire list of his destroyed photographs life would be too short for conversation on any other topic  i say milton he said it was about that that i came im sorry  milton sat up  it wasnt you who did this was it  no no said barry hastily  oh i thought from your saying you were sorry  i was going to say i thought i could put you on the track of the chap who did do it  for the second time since the interview began milton sat up  go on he said  but im sorry i cant give you the name of the fellow who told me about it  that doesnt matter said milton tell me the name of the fellow who did it thatll satisfy me  im afraid i cant do that either  have you any idea what you can do asked milton satirically  i can tell you something which may put you on the right track  thatll do for a start well  well the chap who told meill call him a im going to make an ab case of itwas coming out of his study at about one oclock in the morning  what the deuce was he doing that for  because he wanted to go back to bed said barry  about time too well  as he was going past your study a white figure emerged  i should strongly advise you young barry said milton gravely not to try and rot me in any way youre a jolly good wing threequarters but you shouldnt presume on it id slay the old man himself if he rotted me about this business  barry was quite pained at this sceptical attitude in one whom he was going out of his way to assist  im not rotting he protested this is all quite true  well go on you were saying something about white figures emerging  not white figures a white figure corrected barry it came out of your study  and vanished through the wall  it went into rigbys dorm said barry sulkily it was maddening to have an exclusive bit of news treated in this way   did it by jove said milton interested at last are you sure the chap who told you wasnt pulling your leg who was it told you  i promised him not to say  out with it young barry  i wont said barry  you arent going to tell me  no  milton gave up the point with much cheerfulness he liked barry and he realised that he had no right to try and make him break his promise  thats all right he said thanks very much barry this may be useful  id tell you his name if i hadnt promised you know milton  it doesnt matter said milton its not important  oh there was one thing i forgot it was a biggish chap the fellow saw  how big my size  not quite so tall i should think he said he was about seymours size  thanks thats worth knowing thanks very much barry  when his visitor had gone milton proceeded to unearth one of the printed lists of the house which were used for purposes of rollcall he meant to find out who were in rigbys dormitory he put a tick against the names there were eighteen of them the next thing was to find out which of them was about the same height as mr seymour it was a somewhat vague description for the housemaster stood about five feet nine or eight and a good many of the dormitory were that height or near it at last after much brainwork he reduced the number of possibles to seven these seven were rigby himself linton randbrown griffith hunt kershaw and chapple rigby might be scratched off the list at once he was one of miltons greatest friends exeunt also griffith hunt and kershaw they were mild youths quite incapable of any deed of devilry there remained therefore chapple linton and randbrown chapple was a boy who was invariably late for breakfast the inference was that he was not likely to forego his sleep for the purpose of wrecking studies chapple might disappear from the list now there were only linton and randbrown to be considered his suspicions fell on randbrown linton was the last person he thought to do such a low thing he was a cheerful rollicking individual who was popular with everyone and seemed to like everyone he was not an orderly member of the house certainly and on several occasions milton had found it necessary to drop on him heavily for creating disturbances but he was not the sort that bears malice he took it all in the way of business and came up smiling after it was over no everything pointed to randbrown he and milton had never got on well together and quite recently they had quarrelled openly over the formers play in the days match randbrown must be the man but milton was sensible enough to feel that so far he had no real evidence whatever he must wait  on the following afternoon seymours turned out to play donaldsons  the game like most housematches was played with the utmost keenness both teams had good threequarters and they attacked in turn seymours had the best of it forward where milton was playing a great game but trevor in the centre was the best outside on the field and pulled up rush after rush by halftime neither side had scored  after halftime seymours playing downhill came away with a rush to the donaldsonites half and randbrown with one of the few decent runs he had made in good class football that term ran in on the left milton took the kick but failed and seymours led by three points for the next twenty minutes nothing more was scored then when five minutes more of play remained trevor gave clowes an easy opening and clowes sprinted between the posts the kick was an easy one and what sporting reporters term the major points were easily added  when there are five more minutes to play in an important housematch and one side has scored a goal and the other a try play is apt to become spirited both teams were doing all they knew the ball came out to barry on the right barrys abilities as a threequarter rested chiefly on the fact that he could dodge well this eellike attribute compensated for a certain lack of pace he was past the donaldsons threequarters in an instant and running for the line with only the back to pass and with clowes in hot pursuit another wriggle took him past the back but it also gave clowes time to catch him up clowes was a far faster runner and he got to him just as he reached the twentyfive line they came down together with a crash clowes on top and as they fell the whistle blew  noside said mr aldridge the master who was refereeing  clowes got up  all over he said jolly good game hullo whats up  for barry seemed to be in trouble  you might give us a hand up said the latter i believe ive twisted my beastly ankle or something     xv  a sprain and a vacant place   i say said clowes helping him up im awfully sorry did i do it how did it happen  barry was engaged in making various attempts at standing on the injured leg the process seemed to be painful  shall i get a stretcher or anything can you walk  if youd help me over to the house i could manage all right what a beastly nuisance it wasnt your fault a bit only you tackled me when i was just trying to swerve and my ankle was all twisted  drummond came up carrying barrys blazer and sweater  hullo barry he said whats up you arent crocked  something gone wrong with my ankle that my blazer thanks coming over to the house clowes was just going to help me over  clowes asked a donaldsons junior who was lurking near at hand to fetch his blazer and carry it over to the house and then made his way with drummond and the disabled barry to seymours having arrived at the senior dayroom they deposited the injured threequarter in a chair and sent mtodd who came in at the moment to fetch the doctor  dr oakes was a big man with a breezy manner the sort of doctor who hits you with the force of a sledgehammer in the small ribs and asks you if you felt anything then it was on this principle that he acted with regard to barrys ankle he seized it in both hands and gave it a wrench  did that hurt he inquired anxiously  barry turned white and replied that it did  dr oakes nodded wisely  ah hm just so myes ah  is it bad asked drummond awed by these mystic utterances  my dear boy replied the doctor breezily it is always bad when one twists ones ankle  how long will it do me out of footer asked barry  how long how long how long why fortnight fortnight said the doctor  then i shant be able to play next saturday  next saturday next saturday my dear boy if you can put your foot to the ground by next saturday you may take it as evidence that the age of miracles is not past next saturday indeed ha ha  it was not altogether his fault that he treated the matter with such brutal levity it was a long time since he had been at school and he could not quite realise what it meant to barry not to be able to play against ripton as for barry he felt that he had never loathed and detested any one so thoroughly as he loathed and detested dr oakes at that moment  i dont see where the joke comes in said clowes when he had gone i bar that man  hes a beast said drummond i cant understand why they let a tout like that be the school doctor  barry said nothing he was too sore for words  what dr oakes said to his wife that evening was over at the school my dear this afternoon this afternoon boy with a twisted ankle nice young fellow very much put out when i told him he could not play football for a fortnight but i chaffed him and cheered him up in no time i cheered him up in no time my dear  im sure you did dear said mrs oakes which shows how differently the same thing may strike different people barry certainly did not look as if he had been cheered up when clowes left the study and went over to tell trevor that he would have to find a substitute for his right wing threequarter against ripton  trevor had left the field without noticing barrys accident and he was tremendously pleased at the result of the game  good man he said when clowes came in you saved the match  and lost the ripton match probably said clowes gloomily  what do you mean  that last time i brought down barry i crocked him hes in his study now with a sprained ankle ive just come from there oakes has seen him and says he mustnt play for a fortnight  great scott said trevor blankly what on earth shall we do  why not move strachan up to the wing and put somebody else back instead of him strachan is a good wing  trevor shook his head  no theres nobody good enough to play back for the first we mustnt risk it  then i suppose it must be randbrown  i suppose so  he may do better than we think he played quite a decent game today that try he got wasnt half a bad one  hed be all right if he didnt funk but perhaps he wouldnt funk against ripton in a match like that anybody would play up ill ask milton and allardyce about it  i shouldnt go to milton today said clowes i fancy hell want a nights rest before hes fit to talk to he must be a bit sick about this match i know he expected seymours to win  he went out but came back almost immediately  i say he said theres one thing thats just occurred to me thisll please the league i mean this ankle business of barrys  the same idea had struck trevor it was certainly a respite but he regretted it for all that what he wanted was to beat ripton and barrys absence would weaken the team however it was good in its way and cleared the atmosphere for the time the league would hardly do anything with regard to the carrying out of their threat while barry was on the sicklist  next day having given him time to get over the bitterness of defeat in accordance with clowes thoughtful suggestion trevor called on milton and asked him what his opinion was on the subject of the inclusion of randbrown in the first fifteen in place of barry  hes the next best man he added in defence of the proposal  i suppose so said milton hed better play i suppose theres no one else  clowes thought it wouldnt be a bad idea to shove strachan on the wing and put somebody else back  who is there to put  jervis  not good enough no its better to be weakish on the wing than at back besides randbrown may do all right he played well against you  yes said trevor study looks a bit better now he added as he was going having looked round the room still a bit bare though  milton sighed it will never be what it was  fortythree theatrical photographs want some replacing of course said trevor but it isnt bad considering  hows yours  oh mines all right except for the absence of photographs  i say trevor  yes said trevor stopping at the door miltons voice had taken on the tone of one who is about to disclose dreadful secrets  would you like to know what i think  what  why im pretty nearly sure who it was that ragged my study  by jove what have you done to him  nothing as yet im not quite sure of my man  who is the man  randbrown  by jove clowes once said he thought randbrown must be the president of the league but then i dont see how you can account for my study being wrecked he was out on the field when it was done  why the league of course you dont suppose hes the only man in it there must be a lot of them  but what makes you think it was randbrown  milton told him the story of shoeblossom as barry had told it to him the only difference was that trevor listened without any of the scepticism which milton had displayed on hearing it he was getting excited it all fitted in so neatly if ever there was circumstantial evidence against a man here it was against randbrown take the two cases milton had quarrelled with him miltons study was wrecked with the compliments of the league trevor had turned him out of the first fifteen trevors study was wrecked with the compliments of the league as clowes had pointed out the man with the most obvious motive for not wishing barry to play for the school was randbrown it seemed a true bill  i shouldnt wonder if youre right he said but of course one cant do anything yet you want a lot more evidence anyhow we must play him against ripton i suppose which is his study ill go and tell him now  ten  trevor knocked at the door of study ten randbrown was sitting over the fire reading he jumped up when he saw that it was trevor who had come in and to his visitor it seemed that his face wore a guilty look  what do you want said randbrown  it was not the politest way of welcoming a visitor it increased trevors suspicions the man was afraid a great idea darted into his mind why not go straight to the point and have it out with him here and now he had the leagues letter about the bat in his pocket he would confront him with it and insist on searching the study there and then if randbrown were really as he suspected the writer of the letter the bat must be in this room somewhere search it now and he would have no time to hide it he pulled out the letter  i believe you wrote that he said  trevor was always direct  randbrown seemed to turn a little pale but his voice when he replied was quite steady  thats a lie he said  then perhaps said trevor you wouldnt object to proving it  how  by letting me search your study  you dont believe my word  why should i you dont believe mine  randbrown made no comment on this remark  was that what you came here for he asked  no said trevor as a matter of fact i came to tell you to turn out for running and passing with the first tomorrow afternoon youre playing against ripton on saturday  randbrowns attitude underwent a complete transformation at the news he became friendliness itself  all right he said i say im sorry i said what i did about lying i was rather sick that you should think i wrote that rot you showed me i hope you dont mind  not a bit do you mind my searching your study  for a moment randbrown looked vicious then he sat down with a laugh  go on he said i see you dont believe me here are the keys if you want them  trevor thanked him and took the keys he opened every drawer and examined the writingdesk the bat was in none of these places he looked in the cupboards no bat there  like to take up the carpet inquired randbrown  no thanks  search me if you like shall i turn out my pockets  yes please said trevor to his surprise he had not expected to be taken literally  randbrown emptied them but the bat was not there trevor turned to go  youve not looked inside the legs of the chairs yet said randbrown they may be hollow theres no knowing  it doesnt matter thanks said trevor sorry for troubling you dont forget tomorrow afternoon  and he went with the very unpleasant feeling that he had been badly scored off     xvi  the ripton match   it was a curious thing in connection with the matches between ripton and wrykyn that ripton always seemed to be the bigger team they always had a gigantic pack of forwards who looked capable of shoving a hole through one of the pyramids possibly they looked bigger to the wrykinians than they really were strangers always look big on the football field when you have grown accustomed to a persons appearance he does not look nearly so large milton for instance never struck anybody at wrykyn as being particularly big for a school forward and yet today he was the heaviest man on the field by a quarter of a stone but taken in the mass the ripton pack were far heavier than their rivals there was a legend current among the lower forms at wrykyn that fellows were allowed to stop on at ripton till they were twentyfive simply to play football this is scarcely likely to have been based on fact few lower form legends are  jevons the ripton captain through having played opposite trevor for three seasonshe was the ripton left centrethreequarterhad come to be quite an intimate of his trevor had gone down with milton and allardyce to meet the team at the station and conduct them up to the school  how have you been getting on since christmas asked jevons  pretty well weve lost paget i suppose you know  that was the fast man on the wing wasnt it  yes  well weve lost a man too  oh yes that redhaired forward i remember him  it ought to make us pretty even whats the ground like  bit greasy i should think we had some rain late last night  the ground was a bit greasy so was the ball when milton kicked off up the hill with what wind there was in his favour the outsides of both teams found it difficult to hold the ball jevons caught it on his twentyfive line and promptly handed it forward the first scrum was formed in the heart of the enemys country  a deep swelling roar from either touchline greeted the schools advantage a feature of a big match was always the shouting it rarely ceased throughout the whole course of the game the monotonous but impressive sound of five hundred voices all shouting the same word it was worth hearing sometimes the evenness of the noise would change to an excited crescendo as a school threequarter got off or the school back pulled up the attack with a fine piece of defence sometimes the shouting would give place to clapping when the school was being pressed and somebody had found touch with a long kick but mostly the man on the ropes roared steadily and without cessation and with the full force of his lungs the word wrykyn  the scrum was a long one for two minutes the forwards heaved and strained now one side now the other gaining a few inches the wrykyn pack were doing all they knew to heel but their opponents superior weight was telling ripton had got the ball and were keeping it their game was to break through with it and rush then suddenly one of their forwards kicked it on and just at that moment the opposition of the wrykyn pack gave way and the scrum broke up the ball came out on the wrykyn side and allardyce whipped it out to deacon who was playing half with him  balls out cried the ripton half who was taking the scrum break up its out  and his colleague on the left darted across to stop trevor who had taken deacons pass and was running through on the right  trevor ran splendidly he was a threequarter who took a lot of stopping when he once got away jevons and the ripton half met him almost simultaneously and each slackened his pace for the fraction of a second to allow the other to tackle as they hesitated trevor passed them he had long ago learned that to go hard when you have once started is the thing that pays  he could see that randbrown was racing up for the pass and as he reached the back he sent the ball to him waisthigh then the back got to him and he came down with a thud with a vision seen from the corner of his eye of the ball bounding forward out of the wing threequarters hands into touch randbrown had bungled the pass in the old familiar way and lost a certain try  the touchjudge ran up with his flag waving in the air but the referee had other views  knocked on inside he said scrum here  here was trevor saw with unspeakable disgust some three yards from the goalline randbrown had only had to take the pass and he must have scored  the ripton forwards were beginning to find their feet better now and they carried the scrum a truculentlooking warrior in one of those earguards which are tied on by strings underneath the chin and which add fifty per cent to the ferocity of a forwards appearance broke away with the ball at his feet and swept down the field with the rest of the pack at his heels trevor arrived too late to pull up the rush which had gone straight down the right touchline and it was not till strachan fell on the ball on the wrykyn twentyfive line that the danger ceased to threaten  even now the school were in a bad way the enemy were pressing keenly and a real piece of combination among their threequarters would only too probably end in a try fortunately for them allardyce and deacon were a better pair of halves than the couple they were marking also the ripton forwards heeled slowly and allardyce had generally got his man safely buried in the mud before he could pass  he was just getting round for the tenth time to bottle his opponent as before when he slipped when the ball came out he was on all fours and the ripton exponent finding to his great satisfaction that he had not been tackled whipped the ball out on the left where a wing threequarter hovered  this was the man randbrown was supposed to be marking and once again did barrys substitute prove of what stuff his tackling powers were made after his customary moment of hesitation he had at the riptonians neck the riptonian handed him off in a manner that recalled the palmy days of the old prize ringhanding off was always slightly vigorous in the ripton v wrykyn matchand dashed over the line in the extreme corner  there was anguish on the two touchlines trevor looked savage but made no comment the team lined up in silence  it takes a very good kick to convert a try from the touchline jevons kick was a long one but it fell short ripton led by a try to nothing  a few more scrums near the halfway line and a fine attempt at a dropped goal by the ripton back and it was halftime with the score unaltered  during the interval there were lemons an excellent thing is your lemon at halftime it cools the mouth quenches the thirst stimulates the desire to be at them again and improves the play  possibly the wrykyn team had been happier in their choice of lemons on this occasion for no sooner had the game been restarted than clowes ran the whole length of the field dodged through the threequarters punted over the backs head and scored a really brilliant try of the sort that paget had been fond of scoring in the previous term the man on the touchline brightened up wonderfully and began to try and calculate the probable score by the end of the game on the assumption that as a try had been scored in the first two minutes ten would be scored in the first twenty and so on  but the calculations were based on false premises after strachan had failed to convert and the game had been resumed with the score at one try all play settled down in the centre and neither side could pierce the others defence once jevons got off for ripton but trevor brought him down safely and once randbrown let his man through as before but strachan was there to meet him and the effort came to nothing for wrykyn no one did much except tackle the forwards were beaten by the heavier pack and seldom let the ball out allardyce intercepted a pass when about ten minutes of play remained and ran through to the back but the back who was a capable man and in his third season in the team laid him low scientifically before he could reach the line  altogether it looked as if the match were going to end in a draw the wrykyn defence with the exception of randbrown was too good to be penetrated while the ripton forwards by always getting the ball in the scrums kept them from attacking it was about five minutes from the end of the game when the ripton right centrethreequarter in trying to punt across to the wing miskicked and sent the ball straight into the hands of trevors colleague in the centre before his man could get round to him he had slipped through with trevor backing him up the back as a good back should seeing two men coming at him went for the man with the ball but by the time he had brought him down the ball was no longer where it had originally been trevor had got it and was running in between the posts  this time strachan put on the extra two points without difficulty  ripton played their hardest for the remaining minutes but without result the game ended with wrykyn a goal aheada goal and a try to a try for the second time in one season the ripton match had ended in a victorya thing it was very rarely in the habit of doing                                       the senior dayroom at seymours rejoiced considerably that night the air was dark with flying cushions and darker still occasionally when the usual humorist turned the gas out milton was out for he had gone to the dinner which followed the ripton match and the man in command of the house in his absence was mill and the senior dayroom had no respect whatever for mill  barry joined in the revels as well as his ankle would let him but he was not feeling happy the disappointment of being out of the first still weighed on him  at about eight when things were beginning to grow really lively and the noise seemed likely to crack the window at any moment the door was flung open and milton stalked in  whats all this row he inquired stop it at once  as a matter of fact the row had stoppeddirectly he came in  is barry here he asked  yes said that youth  congratulate you on your first barry weve just had a meeting and given you your colours trevor told me to tell you     xvii  the watchers in the vault   for the next three seconds you could have heard a cannonball drop and that was equivalent in the senior dayroom at seymours to a dead silence barry stood in the middle of the room leaning on the stick on which he supported life now that his ankle had been injured and turned red and white in regular rotation as the magnificence of the news came home to him  then the small voice of linton was heard  thatll be six d ill trouble you for young sammy said linton for he had betted an even sixpence with master samuel menzies that barry would get his first fifteen cap this term and barry had got it  a great shout went up from every corner of the room barry was one of the most popular members of the house and every one had been sorry for him when his sprained ankle had apparently put him out of the running for the last cap  good old barry said drummond delightedly barry thanked him in a dazed way  every one crowded in to shake his hand barry thanked then all in a dazed way  and then the senior dayroom in spite of the fact that milton had returned gave itself up to celebrating the occasion with one of the most deafening uproars that had ever been heard even in that factory of noise a babel of voices discussed the match of the afternoon each trying to outshout the other in one corner linton was beating wildly on a biscuittin with part of a broken chair shoeblossom was busy in the opposite corner executing an intricate stepdance on somebody elses box mtodd had got hold of the redhot poker and was burning his initials in huge letters on the seat of a chair every one in short was enjoying himself and it was not until an advanced hour that comparative quiet was restored it was a great evening for barry the best he had ever experienced  clowes did not learn the news till he saw it on the noticeboard on the following monday when he saw it he whistled softly  i see youve given barry his first he said to trevor when they met rather sensational  milton and allardyce both thought he deserved it if hed been playing instead of randbrown they wouldnt have scored at all probably and we should have got one more try  thats all right said clowes he deserves it right enough and im jolly glad youve given it him but things will begin to move now dont you think the league ought to have a word to say about the business itll be a facer for them  do you remember asked trevor saying that you thought it must be randbrown who wrote those letters  yes well  well milton had an idea that it was randbrown who ragged his study  what made him think that  trevor related the shoeblossom incident  clowes became quite excited  then randbrown must be the man he said why dont you go and tackle him probably hes got the bat in his study  its not in his study said trevor because i looked everywhere for it and got him to turn out his pockets too and yet ill swear he knows something about it one thing struck me as a bit suspicious i went straight into his study and showed him that last letterabout the bat you know and accused him of writing it now if he hadnt been in the business somehow he wouldnt have understood what was meant by their saying the bat you lost it might have been an ordinary cricketbat for all he knew but he offered to let me search the study it didnt strike me as rum till afterwards then it seemed fishy what do you think  clowes thought so too but admitted that he did not see of what use the suspicion was going to be whether randbrown knew anything about the affair or not it was quite certain that the bat was not with him  ohara meanwhile had decided that the time had come for him to resume his detective duties moriarty agreed with him and they resolved that that night they would patronise the vault instead of the gymnasium and take a holiday as far as their boxing was concerned there was plenty of time before the aldershot competition  lockup was still at six so at a quarter to that hour they slipped down into the vault and took up their position  a quarter of an hour passed the lockup bell sounded faintly moriarty began to grow tired  is it worth it he said an wouldnt they have come before if they meant to come  well give them another quarter of an hour said ohara after that  sh whispered moriarty  the door had opened they could see a figure dimly outlined in the semidarkness footsteps passed down into the vault and there came a sound as if the unknown had cannoned into a chair followed by a sharp intake of breath expressive of pain a scraping sound and a flash of light and part of the vault was lit by a candle ohara caught a glimpse of the unknowns face as he rose from lighting the candle but it was not enough to enable him to recognise him the candle was standing on a chair and the light it gave was too feeble to reach the face of any one not on a level with it  the unknown began to drag chairs out into the neighbourhood of the light ohara counted six  the sixth chair had scarcely been placed in position when the door opened again six other figures appeared in the opening one after the other and bolted into the vault like rabbits into a burrow the last of them closed the door after them  ohara nudged moriarty and moriarty nudged ohara but neither made a sound they were not likely to be seenthe blackness of the vault was too egyptian for thatbut they were so near to the chairs that the least whisper must have been heard not a word had proceeded from the occupants of the chairs so far if oharas suspicion was correct and this was really the league holding a meeting their methods were more secret than those of any other secret society in existence even the nihilists probably exchanged a few remarks from time to time when they met together to plot but these men of mystery never opened their lips it puzzled ohara  the light of the candle was obscured for a moment and a sound of puffing came from the darkness  ohara nudged moriarty again  smoking said the nudge  moriarty nudged ohara  smoking it is was the meaning of the movement  a strong smell of tobacco showed that the diagnosis had been a true one each of the figures in turn lit his pipe at the candle and sat back still in silence it could not have been very pleasant smoking in almost pitch darkness but it was breaking rules which was probably the main consideration that swayed the smokers they puffed away steadily till the two irishmen were wrapped about in invisible clouds  then a strange thing happened i know that i am infringing copyright in making that statement but it so exactly suits the occurrence that perhaps mr rider haggard will not object it was a strange thing that happened  a rasping voice shattered the silence  you boys down there said the voice come here immediately come here i say  it was the wellknown voice of mr robert dexter ohara and moriartys beloved housemaster  the two irishmen simultaneously clutched one another each afraid that the other would thinkfrom force of long habitthat the housemaster was speaking to him both stood where they were it was the men of mystery and tobacco that dexter was after they thought  but they were wrong what had brought dexter to the vault was the fact that he had seen two boys who looked uncommonly like ohara and moriarty go down the steps of the vault at a quarter to six he had been doing his usual afterlockup prowl on the junior gravel to intercept stragglers and he had been a witnessfrom a distance of fifty yards in a very bad lightof the descent into the vault he had remained on the gravel ever since in the hope of catching them as they came up but as they had not come up he had determined to make the first move himself he had not seen the six unknowns go down for the evening being chilly he had paced up and down and they had by a lucky accident chosen a moment when his back was turned  come up immediately he repeated  here a blast of tobaccosmoke rushed at him from the darkness the candle had been extinguished at the first alarm and he had not realisedthough he had suspected itthat smoking had been going on  a hurried whispering was in progress among the unknowns apparently they saw that the game was up for they picked their way towards the door  as each came up the steps and passed him mr dexter observed ha and appeared to make a note of his name the last of the six was just leaving him after this process had been completed when mr dexter called him back  that is not all he said suspiciously  yes sir said the last of the unknowns  neither of the irishmen recognised the voice its owner was a stranger to them  i tell you it is not snapped mr dexter you are concealing the truth from me ohara and moriarty are down theretwo boys in my own house i saw them go down there  they had nothing to do with us sir we saw nothing of them  i have no doubt said the housemaster that you imagine that you are doing a very chivalrous thing by trying to hide them but you will gain nothing by it you may go  he came to the top of the steps and it seemed as if he intended to plunge into the darkness in search of the suspects but probably realising the futility of such a course he changed his mind and delivered an ultimatum from the top step  ohara and moriarty  no reply  ohara and moriarty i know perfectly well that you are down there come up immediately  dignified silence from the vault  well i shall wait here till you do choose to come up you would be well advised to do so immediately i warn you you will not tire me out  he turned and the door slammed behind him  whatll we do whispered moriarty it was at last safe to whisper  wait said ohara im thinking  ohara thought for many minutes he thought in vain at last there came flooding back into his mind a memory of the days of his faghood it was after that that he had been groping all the time he remembered now once in those days there had been an unexpected function in the middle of term there were needed for that function certain chairs he could recall even now his furious disgust when he and a select body of fellow fags had been pounced upon by their formmaster and coerced into forming a line from the junior block to the cloisters for the purpose of handing chairs true his formmaster had stood gingerbeer after the event with princely liberality but the labour was of the sort that gallons of gingerbeer will not make pleasant but he ceased to regret the episode now he had been at the extreme end of the chairhandling chain he had stood in a passage in the junior block just by the door that led to the masters garden and whichhe rememberedwas never locked till late at night and while he stood there a pair of handsapparently without a bodyhad heaved up chair after chair through a black opening in the floor in other words a trapdoor connected with the vault in which he now was  he imparted these reminiscences of childhood to moriarty they set off to search for the missing door and after wanderings and barkings of shins too painful to relate they found it moriarty lit a match the light fell on the trapdoor and their last doubts were at an end the thing opened inwards the bolt was on their side not in the passage above them to shoot the bolt took them one second to climb into the passage one minute they stood at the side of the opening and dusted their clothes  bedad said moriarty suddenly  what  why how are we to shut it  this was a problem that wanted some solving eventually they managed it ohara leaning over and fishing for it while moriarty held his legs  as luck would have itand luck had stood by them well all throughthere was a bolt on top of the trapdoor as well as beneath it  supposing that had been shot said ohara as they fastened the door in its place  moriarty did not care to suppose anything so unpleasant  mr dexter was still prowling about on the junior gravel when the two irishmen ran round and across the senior gravel to the gymnasium here they put in a few minutes gentle sparring and then marched boldly up to mr day who happened to have looked in five minutes after their arrival and got their paper  what time did ohara and moriarty arrive at the gymnasium asked mr dexter of mr day next morning  ohara and moriarty really i cant remember i know they left at about a quarter to seven  that profound thinker mr tony weller was never so correct as in his views respecting the value of an alibi there are few better things in an emergency     xviii  ohara excels himself   it was renfords turn next morning to get up and feed the ferrets harvey had done it the day before  renford was not a youth who enjoyed early rising but in the cause of the ferrets he would have endured anything so at six punctually he slid out of bed dressed quietly so as not to disturb the rest of the dormitory and ran over to the vault to his utter amazement he found it locked such a thing had never been done before in the whole course of his experience he tugged at the handle but not an inch or a fraction of an inch would the door yield the policy of the open door had ceased to find favour in the eyes of the authorities  a feeling of blank despair seized upon him he thought of the dismay of the ferrets when they woke up and realised that there was no chance of breakfast for them and then they would gradually waste away and some day somebody would go down to the vault to fetch chairs and would come upon two mouldering skeletons and wonder what they had once been he almost wept at the vision so conjured up  there was nobody about perhaps he might break in somehow but then there was nothing to get to work with he could not kick the door down no he must give it up and the ferrets breakfasthour must be postponed possibly harvey might be able to think of something  fed em inquired harvey when they met at breakfast  no i couldnt  why on earth not you didnt oversleep yourself  renford poured his tale into his friends shocked ears  my hat said harvey when he had finished what on earth are we to do theyll starve  renford nodded mournfully  whatever made them go and lock the door he said  he seemed to think the authorities should have given him due notice of such an action  youre sure they have locked it it isnt only stuck or something  i lugged at the handle for hours but you can go and see for yourself if you like  harvey went and waiting till the coast was clear attached himself to the handle with a prehensile grasp and put his back into one strenuous tug it was even as renford had said the door was locked beyond possibility of doubt  renford and he went over to school that morning with long faces and a general air of acute depression it was perhaps fortunate for their purpose that they did for had their appearance been normal it might not have attracted oharas attention as it was the irishman meeting them on the junior gravel stopped and asked them what was wrong since the adventure in the vault he had felt an interest in renford and harvey  the two told their story in alternate sentences like the strophe and antistrophe of a greek chorus steichomuthics your greek scholar calls it i fancy ha yes just so  so ye cant get in because theyve locked the door an ye dont know what to do about it said ohara at the conclusion of the narrative  renford and harvey informed him in chorus that that was the state of the game up to present date  an ye want me to get them out for you  neither had dared to hope that he would go so far as this what they had looked for had been at the most a few thoughtful words of advice that such a masterstrategist as ohara should take up their cause was an unexampled piece of good luck  if you only would said harvey  we should be most awfully obliged said renford  very well said ohara  they thanked him profusely  ohara replied that it would be a privilege  he should be sorry he said to have anything happen to the ferrets  renford and harvey went on into school feeling more cheerful if the ferrets could be extracted from their present tight corner ohara was the man to do it  ohara had not made his offer of assistance in any spirit of doubt he was certain that he could do what he had promised for it had not escaped his memory that this was a tuesdayin other words a mathematics morning up to the quarter to eleven interval that meant as has been explained previously that while the rest of the school were in the formrooms he would be out in the passage if he cared to be there would be no witnesses to what he was going to do  but by that curious perversity of fate which is so often noticeable mr banks was in a peculiarly lamblike and longsuffering mood this morning actions for which ohara would on other days have been expelled from the room without hope of return today were greeted with a mild dont do that please ohara or even the ridiculously inadequate ohara it was perfectly disheartening ohara began to ask himself bitterly what was the use of ragging at all if this was how it was received and the moments were flying and his promise to renford and harvey still remained unfulfilled  he prepared for fresh efforts  so desperate was he that he even resorted to crude methods like the throwing of paper balls and the dropping of books and when your really scientific ragger sinks to this he is nearing the end of his tether ohara hated to be rude but there seemed no help for it  the striking of a quarter past ten improved his chances it had been privily agreed upon beforehand amongst the members of the class that at a quarter past ten every one was to sneeze simultaneously the noise startled mr banks considerably the angelic mood began to wear off a man may be longsuffering but he likes to draw the line somewhere  another exhibition like that he said sharply and the class stays in after school ohara  sir  silence  i said nothing sir really  boy you made a catlike noise with your mouth  what sort of noise sir  the form waited breathlessly this peculiarly insidious question had been invented for mathematical use by one sandys who had left at the end of the previous summer it was but rarely that the master increased the gaiety of nations by answering the question in the manner desired  mr banks off his guard fell into the trap  a noise like this he said curtly and to the delighted audience came the melodious sound of a miaou which put oharas effort completely in the shade and would have challenged comparison with the warcry of the stoutest mouser that ever trod a tile  a storm of imitations arose from all parts of the room mr banks turned pink and going straight to the root of the disturbance forthwith evicted ohara  ohara left with the satisfying feeling that his duty had been done  mr banks room was at the top of the middle block he ran softly down the stairs at his best pace it was not likely that the master would come out into the passage to see if he was still there but it might happen and it would be best to run as few risks as possible  he sprinted over to the junior block raised the trapdoor and jumped down he knew where the ferrets had been placed and had no difficulty in finding them in another minute he was in the passage again with the trapdoor bolted behind him  he now asked himselfwhat should he do with them he must find a safe place or his labours would have been in vain  behind the fivescourt he thought would be the spot nobody ever went there it meant a run of three hundred yards there and the same distance back and there was more than a chance that he might be seen by one of the powers in which case he might find it rather hard to explain what he was doing in the middle of the grounds with a couple of ferrets in his possession when the hands of the clock pointed to twenty minutes to eleven  but the odds were against his being seen he risked it  when the bell rang for the quarter to eleven interval the ferrets were in their new home happily discussing a piece of meatrenfords contribution held over from the mornings mealand ohara looking as if he had never left the passage for an instant was making his way through the departing mathematical class to apologise handsomely to mr banksas was his invariable customfor his disgraceful behaviour during the mornings lesson     xix  the mayors visit   school prefects at wrykyn did weekly essays for the headmaster those who had got their scholarships at the varsity or who were going up in the following year used to take their essays to him after school and read them to himan unpopular and nervedestroying practice akin to suicide trevor had got his scholarship in the previous november he was due at the headmasters private house at six oclock on the present tuesday he was looking forward to the ordeal not without apprehension the essay subject this week had been one mans meat is another mans poison and clowes whose idea of english essay was that it should be a medium for intempestive frivolity had insisted on his beginning with while i cannot conscientiously go so far as to say that one mans meat is another mans poison yet i am certainly of opinion that what is highly beneficial to one man may on the other hand to another man differently constituted be extremely deleterious and indeed absolutely fatal  trevor was not at all sure how the headmaster would take it but clowes had seemed so cut up at his suggestion that it had better be omitted that he had allowed it to stand  he was putting the final polish on this gem of english literature at halfpast five when milton came in  busy said milton  trevor said he would be through in a minute  milton took a chair and waited  trevor scratched out two words and substituted two others made a couple of picturesque blots and laying down his pen announced that he had finished  whats up he said  its about the league said milton  found out anything  not anything much but ive been making inquiries you remember i asked you to let me look at those letters of yours  trevor nodded this had happened on the sunday of that week  well i wanted to look at the postmarks  by jove i never thought of that  milton continued with the businesslike air of the detective who explains in the last chapter of the book how he did it  i found as i thought that both letters came from the same place  trevor pulled out the letters in question  so they do he said chesterton  do you know chesterton asked milton  only by name  its a small hamlet about two miles from here across the downs theres only one shop in the place which acts as postoffice and tobacconist and everything else i thought that if i went there and asked about those letters they might remember who it was that sent them if i showed them a photograph  by jove said trevor of course did you what happened  i went there yesterday afternoon i took about halfadozen photographs of various chaps including randbrown  but wait a bit if chestertons two miles off randbrown couldnt have sent the letters he wouldnt have the time after school he was on the grounds both the afternoons before i got the letters  i know said milton i didnt think of that at the time  well  one of the points about the chesterton postoffice is that theres no letterbox outside you have to go into the shop and hand anything you want to post across the counter i thought this was a tremendous score for me i thought they would be bound to remember who handed in the letters there cant be many at a place like that  did they remember  they remembered the letters being given in distinctly but as for knowing anything beyond that they were simply futile there was an old woman in the shop aged about three hundred and ten i should think i shouldnt say she had ever been very intelligent but now she simply gibbered i started off by laying out a shilling on some poisonouslooking sweets i gave the lot to a village kid when i got out i hope they didnt kill him then having scattered groundbait in that way i lugged out the photographs mentioned the letters and the date they had been sent and asked her to weigh in and identify the sender  did she  my dear chap she identified them all one after the other the first was one of clowes she was prepared to swear on oath that that was the chap who had sent the letters then i shot a photograph of you across the counter and doubts began to creep in she said she was certain it was one of those two laads but couldnt quite say which to keep her amused i fired in photograph number threeallardyces she identified that too at the end of ten minutes she was pretty sure that it was one of the sixthe other three were paget clephane and randbrownbut she was not going to bind herself down to any particular one as i had come to the end of my stock of photographs and was getting a bit sick of the game i got up to go when in came another ornament of chesterton from a room at the back of the shop he was quite a kid not more than a hundred and fifty at the outside so as a last chance i tackled him on the subject he looked at the photographs for about half an hour mumbling something about it not being thiccy un or that un or that ere tother un until i began to feel id had enough of it then it came out that the real chap who had sent the letters was a laad with light hair not so big as me  that doesnt help us much said trevor  and a prarper little gennlemun so all weve got to do is to look for some young duke of polished manners and exterior with a thatch of light hair  there are three hundred and sixtyseven fellows with light hair in the school said trevor calmly  thought it was three hundred and sixtyeight myself said milton but i may be wrong anyhow there you have the results of my investigations if you can make anything out of them youre welcome to it goodbye  half a second said trevor as he got up had the fellow a cap of any sort  no bareheaded you wouldnt expect him to give himself away by wearing a housecap  trevor went over to the headmasters revolving this discovery in his mind it was not much of a clue but the smallest clue is better than nothing to find out that the sender of the league letters had fair hair narrowed the search down a little it cleared the more ravenlocked members of the school at any rate besides by combining his information with miltons the search might be still further narrowed down he knew that the polite letterwriter must be either in seymours or in donaldsons the number of fairhaired youths in the two houses was not excessive indeed at the moment he could not recall any which rather complicated matters  he arrived at the headmasters door and knocked he was shown into a room at the side of the hall near the door the butler informed him that the headmaster was engaged at present trevor who knew the butler slightly through having constantly been to see the headmaster on business via the front door asked who was there  sir eustace briggs said the butler and disappeared in the direction of his lair beyond the green baize partition at the end of the hall  trevor went into the room which was a sort of spare study and sat down wondering what had brought the mayor of wrykyn to see the headmaster at this advanced hour  a quarter of an hour later the sound of voices broke in upon his peace the headmaster was coming down the hall with the intention of showing his visitor out the door of trevors room was ajar and he could hear distinctly what was being said he had no particular desire to play the eavesdropper but the part was forced upon him  sir eustace seemed excited  it is far from being my habit he was saying to make unnecessary complaints respecting the conduct of the lads under your care sir eustace briggs had a distaste for the shorter and more colloquial forms of speech he would have perished sooner than have substituted complain of your boys for the majestic formula he had used he spoke as if he enjoyed choosing his words he seemed to pause and think before each word unkind peoplewho were jealous of his distinguished careerused to say that he did this because he was afraid of dropping an aitch if he relaxed his vigilance  but continued he i am reluctantly forced to the unpleasant conclusion that the dastardly outrage to which both i and the press of the town have called your attention is to be attributed to one of the lads to whom i avehave this with a jerk referred  i will make a thorough inquiry sir eustace said the bass voice of the headmaster  i thank you said the mayor it would under the circumstances be nothing more i think than what is distinctly advisable the man samuel wapshott of whose narrative i have recently afforded you a brief synopsis stated in no uncertain terms that he found at the foot of the statue on which the dastardly outrage was perpetrated a diminutive ornament in shape like the bats that are used in the game of cricket this ornament he avers with what truth i know not was handed by him to a youth of an age coeval with that of the lads in the upper division of this school the youth claimed it as his property i was given to understand  a thorough inquiry shall be made sir eustace  i thank you  and then the door shut and the conversation ceased     xx  the finding of the bat   trevor waited till the headmaster had gone back to his library gave him five minutes to settle down and then went in  the headmaster looked up inquiringly  my essay sir said trevor  ah yes i had forgotten  trevor opened the notebook and began to read what he had written he finished the paragraph which owed its insertion to clowes and raced hurriedly on to the next to his surprise the flippancy passed unnoticed at any rate verbally as a rule the headmaster preferred that quotations from back numbers of punch should be kept out of the prefects english essays and he generally said as much but today he seemed strangely preoccupied a split infinitive in paragraph five which at other times would have made him sit up in his chair stiff with horror elicited no remark the same immunity was accorded to the insertion inspired by clowes as usual of a popular catch phrase in the last few lines trevor finished with the feeling that luck had favoured him nobly  yes said the headmaster seemingly roused by the silence following on the conclusion of the essay yes then after a long pause yes again  trevor said nothing but waited for further comment  yes said the headmaster once more i think that is a very fair essay very fair it wants a little moreernot quite so muchumyes  trevor made a note in his mind to effect these improvements in future essays and was getting up when the headmaster stopped him  dont go trevor i wish to speak to you  trevors first thought was perhaps naturally that the bat was going to be brought into discussion he was wondering helplessly how he was going to keep ohara and his midnight exploit out of the conversation when the headmaster resumed an unpleasant thing has happened trevor  now were coming to it thought trevor  it appears trevor that a considerable amount of smoking has been going on in the school  trevor breathed freely once more it was only going to be a mere conventional smoking row after all he listened with more enjoyment as the headmaster having stopped to turn down the wick of the readinglamp which stood on the table at his side and which had begun appropriately enough to smoke resumed his discourse  mr dexter  of course thought trevor if there ever was a row in the school dexter was bound to be at the bottom of it  mr dexter has just been in to see me he reported six boys he discovered them in the vault beneath the junior block two of them were boys in your house  trevor murmured something wordless to show that the story interested him  you knew nothing of this of course  no sir  no of course not it is difficult for the head of a house to know all that goes on in that house  was this his beastly sarcasm trevor asked himself but he came to the conclusion that it was not after all the head of a house is only human he cannot be expected to keep an eye on the private life of every member of his house  this must be stopped trevor there is no saying how widespread the practice has become or may become what i want you to do is to go straight back to your house and begin a complete search of the studies  tonight sir it seemed too late for such amusement  tonight but before you go to your house call at mr seymours and tell milton i should like to see him and trevor  yes sir  you will understand that i am leaving this matter to you to be dealt with by you i shall not require you to make any report to me but if you should find tobacco in any boys room you must punish him well trevor punish him well  this meant that the culprit must be touched up before the house assembled in the diningroom such an event did not often occur the last occasion had been in pagets first term as head of donaldsons when two of the senior dayroom had been discovered attempting to revive the ancient and dishonourable custom of bullying this time trevor foresaw would set up a record in all probability there might be any number of devotees of the weed and he meant to carry out his instructions to the full and make the criminals more unhappy than they had been since the day of their first cigar trevor hated the habit of smoking at school he was so intensely keen on the success of the house and the school at games that anything which tended to damage the wind and eye filled him with loathing that anybody should dare to smoke in a house which was going to play in the final for the house football cup made him rage internally and he proposed to make things bad and unrestful for such  to smoke at school is to insult the divine weed when you are obliged to smoke in odd corners fearing every moment that you will be discovered the whole meaning poetry romance of a pipe vanishes and you become like those lost beings who smoke when they are running to catch trains the boy who smokes at school is bound to come to a bad end he will degenerate gradually into a person that plays dominoes in the smokingrooms of abc shops with friends who wear bowler hats and frock coats  much of this philosophy trevor expounded to clowes in energetic language when he returned to donaldsons after calling at seymours to deliver the message for milton  clowes became quite animated at the prospect of a real row  we shall be able to see the skeletons in their cupboards he observed every man has a skeleton in his cupboard which follows him about wherever he goes which study shall we go to first  we said trevor  we repeated clowes firmly i am not going to be left out of this jaunt i need bracing upim not strong you knowand this is just the thing to do it besides youll want a bodyguard of some sort in case the infuriated occupant turns and rends you  i dont see what there is to enjoy in the business said trevor gloomily personally i bar this kind of thing by the time weve finished there wont be a chap in the house im on speaking terms with  except me dearest said clowes i will never desert you its of no use asking me for i will never do it mr micawber has his faults but i will never desert mr micawber  you can come if you like said trevor well take the studies in order i suppose we neednt look up the prefects  a prefect is above suspicion scratch the prefects  that brings us to dixon  dixon was a stout youth with spectacles who was popularly supposed to do twentytwo hours work a day it was believed that he put in two hours sleep from eleven to one and then got up and worked in his study till breakfast  he was working when clowes and trevor came in he dived head foremost into a huge liddell and scott as the door opened on hearing trevors voice he slowly emerged and a pair of round and spectacled eyes gazed blankly at the visitors trevor briefly explained his errand but the interview lost in solemnity owing to the fact that the bare notion of dixon storing tobacco in his room made clowes roar with laughter also dixon stolidly refused to understand what trevor was talking about and at the end of ten minutes finding it hopeless to try and explain the two went dixon with a hazy impression that he had been asked to join in some sort of round game and had refused the offer returned again to his liddell and scott and continued to wrestle with the somewhat obscure utterances of the chorus in aeschylus agamemnon the results of this fiasco on trevor and clowes were widely different trevor it depressed horribly it made him feel savage clowes on the other hand regarded the whole affair in a spirit of rollicking farce and refused to see that this was a serious matter in which the honour of the house was involved  the next study was ruthvens this fact somewhat toned down the exuberances of clowess demeanour when one particularly dislikes a person one has a curious objection to seeming in good spirits in his presence one feels that he may take it as a sort of compliment to himself or at any rate contribute grins of his own which would be hateful clowes was as grave as trevor when they entered the study  ruthvens study was like himself overdressed and rather futile it ran to little china ornaments in a good deal of profusion it was more like a drawingroom than a school study  sorry to disturb you ruthven said trevor  oh come in said ruthven in a tired voice please shut the door there is a draught do you want anything  weve got to have a look round said clowes  cant you see everything there is  ruthven hated clowes as much as clowes hated him  trevor cut into the conversation again  its like this ruthven he said im awfully sorry but the old mans just told me to search the studies in case any of the fellows have got baccy  ruthven jumped up pale with consternation  you cant i wont have you disturbing my study  this is rot said trevor shortly ive got to its no good making it more unpleasant for me than it is  but ive no tobacco i swear i havent  then why mind us searching said clowes affably  come on ruthven said trevor chuck us over the keys you might as well  i wont  dont be an ass man  we have here observed clowes in his sad solemn way a stout and serviceable poker he stooped as he spoke to pick it up  leave that poker alone cried ruthven  clowes straightened himself  ill swop it for your keys he said  dont be a fool  very well then we will now crack our first crib  ruthven sprang forward but clowes handing him off in football fashion with his left hand with his right dashed the poker against the lock of the drawer of the table by which he stood  the lock broke with a sharp crack it was not built with an eye to such onslaught  neat for a first shot said clowes complacently now for the umustaphas and shag  but as he looked into the drawer he uttered a sudden cry of excitement he drew something out and tossed it over to trevor  catch trevor he said quietly something thatll interest you  trevor caught it neatly in one hand and stood staring at it as if he had never seen anything like it before and yet he hadoften for what he had caught was a little golden bat about an inch long by an eighth of an inch wide     xxi  the league revealed   what do you think of that said clowes  trevor said nothing he could not quite grasp the situation it was not only that he had got the idea so firmly into his head that it was randbrown who had sent the letters and appropriated the bat even supposing he had not suspected randbrown he would never have dreamed of suspecting ruthven they had been friends not very close friendstrevors keenness for games and ruthvens dislike of them prevented thatbut a good deal more than acquaintances he was so constituted that he could not grasp the frame of mind required for such an action as ruthvens it was something absolutely abnormal  clowes was equally surprised but for a different reason it was not so much the enormity of ruthvens proceedings that took him aback he believed him with that cheerful intolerance which a certain type of mind affects capable of anything what surprised him was the fact that ruthven had had the ingenuity and even the daring to conduct a campaign of this description cribbing in examinations he would have thought the limit of his crimes something backboneless and underhand of that kind would not have surprised him in the least he would have said that it was just about what he had expected all along but that ruthven should blossom out suddenly as quite an ingenious and capable criminal in this way was a complete surprise  well perhaps youll make a remark he said turning to ruthven  ruthven looking very much like a passenger on a channel steamer who has just discovered that the motion of the vessel is affecting him unpleasantly had fallen into a chair when clowes handed him off he sat there with a look on his pasty face which was not good to see as silent as trevor it seemed that whatever conversation there was going to be would have to take the form of a soliloquy from clowes  clowes took a seat on the corner of the table  it seems to me ruthven he said that youd better say something at present theres a lot that wants explaining as this bat has been found lying in your drawer i suppose we may take it that youre the impolite letterwriter  ruthven found his voice at last  im not he cried i never wrote a line  now were getting at it said clowes i thought you couldnt have had it in you to carry this business through on your own apparently youve only been the sleeping partner in this show though i suppose it was you who ragged trevors study not much sleeping about that you took over the acting branch of the concern for that day only i expect was it you who ragged the study  ruthven stared into the fire but said nothing  must be polite you know ruthven and answer when youre spoken to was it you who ragged trevors study  yes said ruthven  thought so  why of course i met you just outside said trevor speaking for the first time you were the chap who told me what had happened  ruthven said nothing  the ragging of the study seems to have been all the active work he did remarked clowes  no said trevor he posted the letters whether he wrote them or not milton was telling meyou remember i told you no i didnt milton found out that the letters were posted by a small lighthaired fellow  thats him said clowes as regardless of grammar as the monks of rheims pointing with the poker at ruthvens immaculate locks well you ragged the study and posted the letters that was all your share am i right in thinking randbrown was the other partner  silence from ruthven  am i persisted clowes  you may think what you like i dont care  now were getting rude again complained clowes was randbrown in this  yes said ruthven  thought so and who else  no one  try again  i tell you there was no one else cant you believe a word a chap says  a word here and there perhaps said clowes as one making a concession but not many and this isnt one of them have another shot  ruthven relapsed into silence  all right then said clowes well accept that statement theres just a chance that it may be true and thats about all i think this isnt my affair at all really its yours trevor im only a spectator and campfollower its your business youll find me in my study and putting the poker carefully in its place clowes left the room he went into his study and tried to begin some work but the beauties of the second book of thucydides failed to appeal to him his mind was elsewhere he felt too excited with what had just happened to translate greek he pulled up a chair in front of the fire and gave himself up to speculating how trevor was getting on in the neighbouring study he was glad he had left him to finish the business if he had been in trevors place there was nothing he would so greatly have disliked as to have some onehowever familiar a friendinterfering in his wars and settling them for him left to himself clowes would probably have ended the interview by kicking ruthven into the nearest approach to pulp compatible with the laws relating to manslaughter he had an uneasy suspicion that trevor would let him down far too easily  the handle turned trevor came in and pulled up another chair in silence his face wore a look of disgust but there were no signs of combat upon him the toe of his boot was not worn and battered as clowes would have liked to have seen it evidently he had not chosen to adopt active and physical measures for the improvement of ruthvens moral wellbeing  well said clowes  my word what a hound breathed trevor half to himself  my sentiments to a hair said clowes approvingly but what have you done  i didnt do anything  i was afraid you wouldnt did he give any explanation what made him go in for the thing at all what earthly motive could he have for not wanting barry to get his colours bar the fact that randbrown didnt want him to and why should he do what randbrown told him i never even knew they were pals before today  he told me a good deal said trevor its one of the beastliest things i ever heard they neither of them come particularly well out of the business but randbrown comes worse out of it even than ruthven my word that man wants killing  thatll keep said clowes nodding whats the yarn  do you remember about a year ago a chap named patterson getting sacked  clowes nodded again he remembered the case well patterson had had gambling transactions with a wrykyn tradesman had been found out and had gone  you remember what a surprise it was to everybody it wasnt one of those cases where half the school suspects whats going on those cases always come out sooner or later but patterson nobody knew about  yes well  nobody said trevor except ruthven that is ruthven got to know somehow i believe he was a bit of a pal of pattersons at the time anyhowthey had a row and ruthven went to dexterpatterson was in dextersand sneaked dexter promised to keep his name out of the business and went straight to the old man and patterson got turfed out on the spot then somehow or other randbrown got to know about iti believe ruthven must have told him by accident some time or other after that he simply had to do everything randbrown wanted him to otherwise he said that he would tell the chaps about the patterson affair that put ruthven in a dead funk  of course said clowes i should imagine friend ruthven would have got rather a bad time of it but what made them think of starting the league it was a jolly smart idea randbrowns of course  yes i suppose hed heard about it and thought something might be made out of it if it were revived  and were ruthven and he the only two in it  ruthven swears they were and i shouldnt wonder if he wasnt telling the truth for once in his life you see everything the leagues done so far could have been done by him and randbrown without anybody elses help the only other studies that were ragged were mills and miltonsboth in seymours  yes said clowes  there was a pause clowes put another shovelful of coal on the fire  what are you going to do to ruthven  nothing  nothing hang it he doesnt deserve to get off like that he isnt as bad as randbrownquitebut hes pretty nearly as finished a little beast as you could find  finished is just the word said trevor hes going at the end of the week  going what sacked  yes the old mans been finding out things about him apparently and this smoking row has just added the finishingtouch to his discoveries hes particularly keen against smoking just now for some reason  but was ruthven in it  yes didnt i tell you he was one of the fellows dexter caught in the vault there were two in this house you remember  who was the other  that man dashwood has the study next to pagets old one hes going too  scarcely knew him what sort of a chap was he  outsider no good to the house in any way he wont be missed  and what are you going to do about randbrown  fight him of course what else could i do  but youre no match for him  well see  but you arent persisted clowes he can give you a stone easily and hes not a bad boxer either moriarty didnt beat him so very cheaply in the middleweight this year you wouldnt have a chance  trevor flared up  heavens man he cried do you think i dont know all that myself but what on earth would you have me do besides he may be a good boxer but hes got no pluck at all i might outstay him  hope so said clowes  but his tone was not hopeful     xxii  a dress rehearsal   some people in trevors place might have taken the earliest opportunity of confronting randbrown so as to settle the matter in hand without delay trevor thought of doing this but finally decided to let the matter rest for a day until he should have found out with some accuracy what chance he stood  after four oclock therefore on the next day having had tea in his study he went across to the baths in search of ohara he intended that before the evening was over the irishman should have imparted to him some of his skill with the hands he did not know that for a man absolutely unscientific with his fists there is nothing so fatal as to take a boxing lesson on the eve of battle a little knowledge is a dangerous thing he is apt to lose his recklessnesswhich might have stood by him wellin exchange for a little quite useless science he is neither one thing nor the other neither a natural fighter nor a skilful boxer  this point ohara endeavoured to press upon him as soon as he had explained why it was that he wanted coaching on this particular afternoon  the irishman was in the gymnasium punching the ball when trevor found him he generally put in a quarter of an hour with the punchingball every evening before moriarty turned up for the customary six rounds  want me to teach ye a few tricks he said whats that for  ive got a mill coming on soon explained trevor trying to make the statement as if it were the most ordinary thing in the world for a school prefect who was also captain of football head of a house and in the cricket eleven to be engaged for a fight in the near future  mill exclaimed ohara you an why  never mind why said trevor ill tell you afterwards perhaps shall i put on the gloves now  wait said ohara i must do my quarter of an hour with the ball before i begin teaching other people how to box have ye a watch  yes  then time me ill do four rounds of three minutes each with a minutes rest in between thats more than ill do at aldershot but itll get me fit ready  time said trevor  he watched ohara assailing the swinging ball with considerable envy why he wondered had he not gone in for boxing everybody ought to learn to box it was bound to come in useful some time or other take his own case he was very much afraidno afraid was not the right word for he was not that he was very much of opinion that randbrown was going to have a most enjoyable time when they met and the final housematch was to be played next monday if events turned out as he could not help feeling they were likely to turn out he would be too battered to play in that match donaldsons would probably win whether he played or not but it would be bitter to be laid up on such an occasion on the other hand he must go through with it he did not believe in letting other people take a hand in settling his private quarrels  but he wished he had learned to box if only he could hit that dancing jumping ball with a fifth of the skill that ohara was displaying his wiriness and pluck might see him through ohara finished his fourth round with his leathern opponent and sat down panting  pretty useful that commented trevor admiringly  ye should see moriarty gasped ohara  now will ye tell me why it is youre going to fight and with whom youre going to fight  very well its with randbrown  randbrown exclaimed ohara but me dearr man hell ate you  trevor gave a rather annoyed laugh i must say ive got a nice cheery comforting lot of friends he said thats just what clowes has been trying to explain to me  clowes is quite right said ohara seriously has the thing gone too far for ye to back out without climbing down of course he added  yes said trevor theres no question of my getting out of it i daresay i could in fact i know i could but im not going to  but me dearr man ye havent an earthly chance i assure ye ye havent ive seen randbrown with the gloves on that was last term hes not put them on since moriarty bate him in the middles so he may be out of practice but even then hed be a bad man to tackle hes big an hes strong an if hed only had the heart in him hed have been going up to aldershot instead of moriarty thats what hed be doing an you cant box at all never even had the gloves on  never i used to scrap when i was a kid though  thats no use said ohara decidedly but you havent said what it is that yeve got against randbrown what is it  i dont see why i shouldnt tell you youre in it as well in fact if it hadnt been for the bat turning up youd have been considerably more in it than i am  what cried ohara where did you find it was it in the grounds when was it you found it  whereupon trevor gave him a very full and exact account of what had happened he showed him the two letters from the league touched on miltons connection with the affair traced the gradual development of his suspicions and described with some approach to excitement the scene in ruthvens study and the explanations that had followed it  now do you wonder he concluded that i feel as if a few rounds with randbrown would do me good  ohara breathed hard  my word he said id like to see ye kill him  but said trevor as you and clowes have been pointing out to me if theres going to be a corpse itll be me however i mean to try now perhaps you wouldnt mind showing me a few tricks  take my advice said ohara and dont try any of that foolery  why i thought you were such a believer in science said trevor in surprise  so i am if youve enough of it but its the worst thing ye can do to learn a trick or two just before a fight if you dont know anything about the game already a tough rushing fighter is ten times as good as a man whos just begun to learn what he oughtnt to do  well what do you advise me to do then asked trevor impressed by the unwonted earnestness with which the irishman delivered this pugilistic homily which was a paraphrase of the views dinned into the ears of every novice by the school instructor  i must do something  the best thing ye can do said ohara thinking for a moment is to put on the gloves and have a round or two with me heres moriarty at last well get him to time us  as much explanation as was thought good for him having been given to the newcomer to account for trevors newlyacquired taste for things pugilistic moriarty took the watch with instructions to give them two minutes for the first round  go as hard as you can said ohara to trevor as they faced one another and hit as hard as you like it wont be any practice if you dont i shant mind being hit itll do me good for aldershot see  trevor said he saw  time said moriarty  trevor went in with a will he was a little shy at first of putting all his weight into his blows it was hard to forget that he felt friendly towards ohara but he speedily awoke to the fact that the irishman took his boxing very seriously and was quite a different person when he had the gloves on when he was so equipped the man opposite him ceased to be either friend or foe in a private way he was simply an opponent and every time he hit him was one point and when he entered the ring his only object in life for the next three minutes was to score points consequently trevor sparring lightly and in rather a futile manner at first was woken up by a stinging flush hit between the eyes after that he too forgot that he liked the man before him and rushed him in all directions there was no doubt as to who would have won if it had been a competition trevors guard was of the most rudimentary order and ohara got through when and how he liked but though he took a good deal he also gave a good deal and ohara confessed himself not altogether sorry when moriarty called time  man he said regretfully why ever did ye not take up boxing before yed have made a splendid middleweight  well have i a chance do you think inquired trevor  ye might do it with luck said ohara very doubtfully but he added im afraid yeve not much chance  and with this poor encouragement from his trainer and sparringpartner trevor was forced to be content     xxiii  what renford saw   the health of master harvey of seymours was so delicately constituted that it was an absolute necessity that he should consume one or more hot buns during the quarter of an hours interval which split up morning school he was tearing across the junior gravel towards the shop on the morning following trevors sparring practice with ohara when a melodious treble voice called his name it was renford he stopped to allow his friend to come up with him and then made as if to resume his way to the shop but renford proposed an amendment dont go to the shop he said i want to talk  well cant you talk in the shop  not what i want to tell you its private come for a stroll  harvey hesitated there were few things he enjoyed so much as exclusive items of school gossip scandal preferably but hot new buns were among those few things however he decided on this occasion to feed the mind at the expense of the body he accepted renfords invitation   what is it he asked as they made for the football field whats been happening  its frightfully exciting said renford  whats up  you mustnt tell any one  all right of course not  well then theres been a big fight and im one of the only chaps who know about it so far  a fight harvey became excited who between  renford paused before delivering his news to emphasise the importance of it  it was between ohara and randbrown he said at length  by jove said harvey then a suspicion crept into his mind  look here renford he said if youre trying to green me  im not you ass replied renford indignantly its perfectly true i saw it myself  by jove did you really where was it when did it come off was it a good one who won  it was the best one ive ever seen  did ohara beat him i hope he did oharas a jolly good sort  yes they had six rounds randbrown got knocked out in the middle of the sixth  what do you mean really knocked out or did he just chuck it  no he was really knocked out he was on the floor for quite a time by jove you should have seen it ohara was ripping in the sixth round he was all over him  tell us about it said harvey and renford told  id got up early he said to feed the ferrets and i was just cutting over to the fivescourts with their grub when just as i got across the senior gravel i saw ohara and moriarty standing waiting near the second court ohara knows all about the ferrets so i didnt try and cut or anything i went up and began talking to him i noticed he didnt look particularly keen on seeing me at first i asked him if he was going to play fives then he said no and told me what hed really come for he said he and randbrown had had a row and theyd agreed to have it out that morning in one of the fivescourts of course when i heard that i was all on to see it so i said id wait if he didnt mind he said he didnt care so long as i didnt tell everybody so i said i wouldnt tell anybody except you so he said all right then i could stop if i wanted to so that was how i saw it well after wed been waiting a few minutes randbrown came in sight with that beast merrett in our house whod come to second him it was just like one of those duels you read about you know then ohara said that as i was the only one there with a watchhe and randbrown were in footer clothes and merrett and moriarty hadnt got their tickers on themid better act as timekeeper so i said all right i would and we went to the second fivescourt its the biggest of them you know i stood outside on the bench looking through the wire netting over the door so as not to be in the way when they started scrapping ohara and randbrown took off their blazers and sweaters and chucked them to moriarty and merrett and then moriarty and merrett went and stood in two corners and ohara and randbrown walked into the middle and stood up to one another randbrown was miles the heaviestby a stone i should thinkand he was taller and had a longer reach but ohara looked much fitter randbrown looked rather flabby  i sang out time through the wire netting and they started off at once ohara offered to shake hands but randbrown wouldnt so they began without it  the first round was awfully fast they kept having long rallies all over the place ohara was a jolly sight quicker and randbrown didnt seem able to guard his hits at all but he hit frightfully hard himself great heavy slogs and ohara kept getting them in the face at last he got one bang in the mouth which knocked him down flat he was up again in a second and was starting to rush when i looked at the watch and found that id given them nearly half a minute too much already so i shouted time and made up my mind id keep more of an eye on the watch next round id got so jolly excited watching them that id forgot i was supposed to be keeping time for them they had only asked for a minute between the rounds but as id given them half a minute too long in the first round i chucked in a bit extra in the rest so that they were both pretty fit by the time i started them again  the second round was just like the first and so was the third ohara kept getting the worst of it he was knocked down three or four times more and once when hed rushed randbrown against one of the walls he hit out and missed and barked his knuckles jolly badly against the wall that was in the middle of the third round and randbrown had it all his own way for the rest of the roundfor about two minutes that is to say he hit ohara about all over the shop i was so jolly keen on oharas winning that i had half a mind to call time early so as to give him time to recover but i thought it would be a low thing to do so i gave them their full three minutes  directly they began the fourth round i noticed that things were going to change a bit ohara had given up his rushing game and was waiting for his man and when he came at him hed put in a hot counter nearly always at the body after a bit randbrown began to get cautious and wouldnt rush so the fourth round was the quietest there had been in the last minute they didnt hit each other at all they simply sparred for openings it was in the fifth round that ohara began to forge ahead about half way through he got in a ripper right in the wind which almost doubled randbrown up and then he started rushing again randbrown looked awfully bad at the end of the round round six was ripping i never saw two chaps go for each other so it was one long rally thenhow it happened i couldnt see they were so quickjust as they had been at it a minute and a half there was a crack and the next thing i saw was randbrown on the ground looking beastly he went down absolutely flat his heels and head touched the ground at the same time   i counted ten out loud in the professional way like they do at the national sporting club you know and then said ohara wins i felt an awful swell after about another halfminute randbrown was all right again and he got up and went back to the house with merrett and ohara and moriarty went off to dexters and i gave the ferrets their grub and cut back to breakfast  randbrown wasnt at breakfast said harvey  no he went to bed i wonder whatll happen think therell be a row about it  shouldnt think so said harvey they never do make rows about fights and neither of them is a prefect so i dont see what it matters if they do fight but i say  whats up  i wish said harvey his voice full of acute regret that it had been my turn to feed those ferrets  i dont said renford cheerfully i wouldnt have missed that mill for something hullo theres the bell wed better run  when trevor called at seymours that afternoon to see randbrown with a view to challenging him to deadly combat and found that ohara had been before him he ought to have felt relieved his actual feeling was one of acute annoyance it seemed to him that ohara had exceeded the limits of friendship it was all very well for him to take over the randbrown contract and settle it himself in order to save trevor from a very bad quarter of an hour but trevor was one of those people who object strongly to the interference of other people in their private business he sought out ohara and complained within two minutes oharas golden eloquence had soothed him and made him view the matter in quite a different light what ohara pointed out was that it was not trevors affair at all but his own who he asked had been likely to be damaged most by randbrowns manoeuvres in connection with the lost bat trevor was bound to admit that ohara was that person very well then said ohara then who had a better right to fight randbrown and trevor confessed that no one else had a better  then i suppose he said that i shall have to do nothing about it  thats it said ohara  itll be rather beastly meeting the man after this said trevor presently do you think he might possibly leave at the end of term  hes leaving at the end of the week said ohara he was one of the fellows dexter caught in the vault that evening you wont see much more of randbrown  ill try and put up with that said trevor  and so will i replied ohara and i shouldnt think milton would be so very grieved  no said trevor i tell you what will make him sick though and that is your having milled with randbrown its a job hed have liked to have taken on himself     xxiv  conclusion   into the story at this point comes the narrative of charles mereweather cook aged fourteen a dayboy  cook arrived at the school on the tenth of march at precisely nine oclock in a state of excitement  he said there was a row on in the town  crossexamined he said there was no end of a row on in the town  during morning school he explained further whispering his tale into the attentive ear of knight of the school house who sat next to him  what sort of a row knight wanted to know  cook deposed that he had been riding on his bicycle past the entrance to the recreation grounds on his way to school when his eye was attracted by the movements of a mass of men just inside the gate they appeared to be fighting witness did not stop to watch much as he would have liked to do so why not why because he was late already and would have had to scorch anyhow in order to get to school in time and he had been late the day before and was afraid that old appleby the master of the form would give him beans if he were late again wherefore he had no notion of what the men were fighting about but he betted that more would be heard about it why because from what he saw of it it seemed a jolly big thing there must have been quite three hundred men fighting knight satirically pile it on well quite a hundred anyhow fifty a side and fighting like anything he betted there would be something about it in the wrykyn patriot tomorrow he shouldnt wonder if somebody had been killed what were they scrapping about how should he know  here mr appleby who had been trying for the last five minutes to find out where the whispering noise came from at length traced it to its source and forthwith requested messrs cook and knight to do him two hundred lines adding that if he heard them talking again he would put them into the extra lesson silence reigned from that moment  next day while the form was wrestling with the moderately exciting account of caesars doings in gaul master cook produced from his pocket a newspaper cutting this having previously planted a forcible blow in his friends ribs with an elbow to attract the latters attention he handed to knight and in dumb show requested him to peruse the same which knight feeling no interest whatever in caesars doings in gaul and having in consequence a good deal of time on his hands proceeded to do the cutting was headed disgraceful fracas and was written in the elegant style that was always so marked a feature of the wrykyn patriot  we are sorry to have to report it ran another of those deplorable ebullitions of local hooliganism to which it has before now been our painful duty to refer yesterday the recreation grounds were made the scene of as brutal an exhibition of savagery as has ever marred the fair fame of this town our readers will remember how on a previous occasion when the fine statue of sir eustace briggs was found covered with tar we attributed the act to the malevolence of the radical section of the community events have proved that we were right yesterday a body of youths belonging to the rival party was discovered in the very act of repeating the offence a thick coating of tar had already been administered when several members of the rival faction appeared a free fight of a peculiarly violent nature immediately ensued with the result that before the police could interfere several of the combatants had received severe bruises fortunately the police then arrived on the scene and with great difficulty succeeded in putting a stop to the fracas several arrests were made  we have no desire to discourage legitimate party rivalry but we feel justified in strongly protesting against such dastardly tricks as those to which we have referred we can assure our opponents that they can gain nothing by such conduct  there was a good deal more to the effect that now was the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party and that the constituents of sir eustace briggs must look to it that they failed not in the hour of need and so on that was what the wrykyn patriot had to say on the subject  ohara managed to get hold of a copy of the paper and showed it to clowes and trevor  so now he said its all right ye see theyll never suspect it wasnt the same people that tarred the statue both times an yeve got the bat back so its all right ye see  the only thing thatll trouble you now said clowes will be your conscience  ohara intimated that he would try and put up with that  but isnt it a stroke of luck he said that they should have gone and tarred sir eustace again so soon after moriarty and i did it  clowes said gravely that it only showed the force of good example  yes they wouldnt have thought of it if it hadnt been for us chortled ohara i wonder now if theres anything else we could do to that statue he added meditatively  my good lunatic said clowes dont you think youve done almost enough for one term  well myes replied ohara thoughtfully perhaps we have i suppose                                       the term wore on donaldsons won the final housematch by a matter of twentysix points it was as they had expected one of the easiest games they had had to play in the competition bryants who were their opponents were not strong and had only managed to get into the final owing to their luck in drawing weak opponents for the trial heats the real final that had decided the ownership of the cup had been donaldsons v seymours  aldershot arrived and the sports drummond and ohara covered themselves with glory and brought home silver medals but moriarty to the disappointment of the school which had counted on his pulling off the middles met a strenuous gentleman from st pauls in the final and was prematurely outed in the first minute of the third round to him therefore there fell but a medal of bronze  it was on the sunday after the sports that trevors connection with the bat ceasedas far that is to say as concerned its unpleasant character as a piece of evidence that might be used to his disadvantage he had gone to supper with the headmaster accompanied by clowes and milton the headmaster nearly always invited a few of the house prefects to sunday supper during the term sir eustace briggs happened to be there he had withdrawn his insinuations concerning the part supposedly played by a member of the school in the matter of the tarred statue and the headmaster had sealed the entente cordiale by asking him to supper  an ordinary man might have considered it best to keep off the delicate subject not so sir eustace briggs he was on to it like glue he talked of little else throughout the whole course of the meal  my suspicions he boomed towards the conclusion of the feast which have i am rejoiced to say proved so entirely void of foundation and significance were aroused in the first instance as i mentioned before by the narrative of the man samuel wapshott  nobody present showed the slightest desire to learn what the man samuel wapshott had had to say for himself but sir eustace undismayed continued as if the whole table were hanging on his words  the man samuel wapshott he said distinctly asserted that a small gold ornament shaped like a bat was handed by him to a lad of age coeval with these lads here  the headmaster interposed he had evidently heard more than enough of the man samuel wapshott  he must have been mistaken he said briefly the bat which trevor is wearing on his watchchain at this moment is the only one of its kind that i know of you have never lost it trevor  trevor thought for a moment he had never lost it he replied diplomatically it has been in a drawer nearly all the term sir he said  a drawer hey remarked sir eustace briggs ah a very sensible place to keep it in my boy you could have no better place in my opinion  and trevor agreed with him with the mental reservation that it rather depended on whom the drawer belonged to
