lowers prices appendix i bibliographies appendix ii examination questions footnotes       preface   an experience of five years with mr mill’s treatise in the classroom not only convinced me of the great usefulness of what still remains one of the most lucid and systematic books yet published which cover the whole range of the study but i have also been convinced of the need of such additions as should give the results of later thinking without militating against the general tenor of mr mill’s system of such illustrations as should fit it better for american students by turning their attention to the application of principles in the facts around us of a bibliography which should make it easier to get at the writers of other schools who offer opposing views on controverted questions and of some attempts to lighten those parts of his work in which mr mill frightened away the reader by an appearance of too great abstractness and to render them if possible more easy of comprehension to the student who first approaches political economy through this author believing also that the omission of much that should properly be classed under the head of sociology or social philosophy would narrow the field to political economy alone and aid perhaps in clearer ideas i was led to reduce the two volumes into one with of course the additional hope that the smaller book would tempt some readers who might hesitate to attack his larger work in consonance with the above plan i have abridged mr mill’s treatise yet have always retained his own words although it should be said that they are not always his consecutive words everything in the larger type on the page is taken literally from mr mill and whenever it has been necessary to use a word to complete the sense it has been always inserted in square brackets all additional matter introduced by me has been printed in a smaller but distinctive type the reader can see at a glance which part of the page is mr mill’s and which my own  it has seemed necessary to make the most additions to the original treatise under the subjects of the wages question of wages of superintendence of socialism of cost of production of bimetallism of the paper money experiments in this country of international values of the future of the laboringclasses in which the chapter was entirely rewritten and of protection the treatment of land tenures has not been entirely omitted but it does not appear as a separate subject because it has at present less value as an elementary study for american students the chapters on land tenures the english currency discussion and much of book v on the influence of government have been simply omitted in one case i have changed the order of the chapters by inserting chap xv of book iii treating of a standard of value under the chapter treating of money and its functions in other respects the same order has been followed as in the original work  wherever it has seemed possible american illustrations have been inserted instead of english or continental ones  to interest the reader in home problems twentyfour charts have been scattered throughout the volume which bear upon our own conditions with the expectation also that the different methods of graphic representation here presented would lead students to apply them to other questions they are mainly such as i have employed in my classroom the use and preparation of such charts ought to be encouraged the earlier pages of the volume have been given up to a “sketch of the history of political economy” which aims to give the story of how we have arrived at our present knowledge of economic laws the student who has completed mill will then have a very considerable bibliography of the various schools and writers from which to select further reading and to select this reading so that it may not fall wholly within the range of one class of writers but for the time that mill is being first studied i have added a list of the most important books for consultation i have also collected in appendix i some brief bibliographies on the tariff on bimetallism and on american shipping which may be of use to those who may not have the means of inquiring for authorities and in appendix ii a number of questions and problems for the teacher’s use  in some cases i have omitted mr mill’s statement entirely and put in its stead a simpler form of the same exposition which i believed would be more easily grasped by a student of such cases the argument to show that demand for commodities is not demand for labor the doctrine of international values and the effect of the progress of society on wages profits and rent are examples whether i have succeeded or not must be left for the experience of the teacher to determine many small figures and diagrams have been used throughout the text in order to suggest the concrete means of getting a clear grasp of a principle  in conclusion i wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to several friends for assistance in the preparation of this volume among whom are professor charles f dunbar dr f w taussig dr a b hart and mr edward atkinson  j laurence laughlin

history of     political economy in english blanqui’s “histoire de l’économie     politique en europe” paris 1837 is disproportioned and     superficial and he labors under the disadvantage of not     understanding the english school of economists he studies to give     the history of economic facts rather than of economic laws the     book has been translated into english new york 1880      villeneuvebargemont in his “histoire de l’économie politique”     paris 1841 aims to oppose a “christian political economy” to     the “english” political economy and indulges in religious     discussions      travers twiss “view of the progress of political economy in     europe since the sixteenth century” london 1847 marked an     advance by treating the subject in the last four centuries and by     separating the history of principles from the history of facts it     is brief and only a sketch julius kautz has published in german     the best existing history “die geschichtliche entwickelung der     nationaloekonomie und ihrer literatur” vienna 1860 see     cossa “guide to the study of political economy” page 80 cossa     in his book has furnished a vast amount of information about     writers classified by epochs and countries and a valuable     discussion of the divisions of political economy by various     writers and its relation to other sciences it is a very     desirable little handbook mcculloch in his “introduction to the     wealth of nations” gives a brief sketch of the growth of economic     doctrine the editor begs to acknowledge his great indebtedness     for information to his colleague professor charles f dunbar of     harvard university   systematic study for an understanding of the laws of political economy is to be found no farther back than the sixteenth century the history of political economy is not the history of economic institutions any more than the history of mathematics is the history of every object possessing length breadth and thickness economic history is the story of the gradual evolution in the thought of men of an understanding of the laws which today constitute the science we are studying it is essentially modern1  aristotle2 and xenophon had some comprehension of the theory of money and plato3 had defined its functions with some accuracy the economic laws of the romans were all summed up in the idea of enriching the metropolis at the expense of the dependencies during the middle ages no systematic study was undertaken and the nature of economic laws was not even suspected  it is worth notice that the first glimmerings of political economy came to be seen through the discussions on money and the extraordinary movements of gold and silver about the time of charles v the young study was born accompanied by the revival of learning the reformation the discovery of america and the great fall in the value of gold and silver modern society was just beginning and had already brought manufactures into existence—woolens in england silks in france genoa and florence venice had become the great commercial city of the world the hanseatic league was carrying goods from the mediterranean to the baltic and the jews of lombardy had by that time brought into use the bill of exchange while the supply of the precious metals had been tolerably constant hitherto the steady increase of business brought about a fall of prices from the middle of the fourteenth to the end of the fifteenth century the purchasing power of money increased in the ratio of four to ten then into this situation came the great influx of gold and silver from the new world prices rose unequally the trading and manufacturing classes were flourishing while others were depressed in the sixteenth century the price of wheat tripled but wages only doubled the laboringclasses of england deteriorated while others were enriched producing profound social changes and the wellknown flood of pauperism together with the rise of the mercantile classes then new channels of trade were opened to the east and west of course men saw but dimly the operation of these economic causes although the books now began to hint at the right understanding of the movements and the true laws of money  even before this time however nicole orêsme bishop of lisieux died 1382 had written intelligently on money4 but about 1526 the astronomer copernicus gave a very good exposition of some of the functions of money but he as well as latimer5 while noticing the economic changes gave no correct explanation the seigneur de malestroit a councilor of the king of france however by his errors drew out jean bodin6 to say that the rise of prices was due to the abundance of money brought from america but he was in advance of his time as well as william stafford7 the author of the first english treatise on money which showed a perfect insight into the subject stafford distinctly grasped the idea that the high prices brought no loss to merchants great gain to those who held long leases and loss to those who did not buy and sell that in reality commodities were exchanged when money was passed from hand to hand  such was the situation8 which prefaced the first general system destined to be based on supposed economic considerations wrongly understood to be sure but vigorously carried out i refer to the wellknown mercantile system which overspread europe9 spain as the first receiver of american gold and silver attributed to it abnormal power and by heavy duties and prohibitions tried to keep the precious metals to herself this led to a general belief in the tenets of the mercantile system and its adoption by all europe 1 it was maintained that where gold and silver abounded there would be found no lack of the necessaries of life 2 therefore governments should do all in their power to secure an abundance of money noting that commerce and political power seemed to be in the hands of the states having the greatest quantity of money men wished mainly to create such a relation of exports and imports of goods as would bring about an importation of money the natural sequence of this was the policy of creating a favorable “balance of trade” by increasing exports and diminishing imports thus implying that the gain in international trade was not a mutual one the error consisted in supposing that a nation could sell without buying and in overlooking the instrumental character of money the errors even went so far as to create prohibitory legislation in the hope of shutting out imported goods and keeping the precious metals at home the system spread over europe so that france 1544 and england 1552 forbade the export of specie but with the more peaceful conditions at the end of the sixteenth century the expansion of commerce the value of money became steadier and prices advanced more slowly  italian writers were among the first to discuss the laws of money intelligently10 but a number of acute englishmen enriched the literature of the subject11 and it may be said that any modern study of political economy received its first definite impulse from england and france  the prohibition of the export of coin was embarrassing to the east india company and to merchants and mun tried to show that freedom of exportation would increase the amount of gold and silver in a country since the profits in foreign trade would bring back more than went out it probably was not clear to them however that the export of bullion to the east was advantageous because the commodities brought back in return were more valuable in england than the precious metals the purpose of the mercantilists was to increase the amount of gold and silver in the country mun with some penetration had even pointed out that too much money was an evil but in 1663 the english parliament removed the restriction on the exportation of coin the balanceoftrade heresy that exports should always exceed imports as if merchants would send out goods which when paid for in commodities should be returned in a form of less value than those sent out was the outcome of the mercantile system and it has continued in the minds of many men to this day the policy which aimed at securing a favorable balance of trade and the plan of protecting home industries had the same origin if all consumable goods were produced at home and none imported that would increase exports and bring more gold and silver into the country as all the countries of europe had adopted the mercantile theory after 1664 retaliatory and prohibitory tariffs were set up against each other by england france holland and germany then because it was seen that large sums were paid for carrying goods in order that no coin should be required to pay foreigners in any branch of industry navigation laws were enacted which required goods to be imported only in ships belonging to the importing nation these remnants of the mercantile system continue to this day in the shipping laws of this and other countries12  a natural consequence of the navigation acts and of the mercantile system was the socalled colonial policy by which the colonies were excluded from all trade except with the mothercountry a plantation like new england which produced commodities in competition with england was looked upon with disfavor for her enterprise and all this because of the fallacy at the foundation of the mercantile system that the gain in international trade is not mutual but that what one country gains another must lose13  an exposition of mercantilism would not be complete without a statement of the form it assumed in france under the guidance of colbert14 the great minister of louis xiv from 1661 to 1683 in order to create a favorable balance of trade he devoted himself to fostering home productions by attempts to abolish vexatious tolls and customs within the country and by an extraordinary system of supervision in manufacturing establishments which has been the stimulus to paternal government from which france has never since been able to free herself processes were borrowed from england germany and sweden and new establishments for making tapestries and silk goods sprang up even the sizes of fabrics were regulated by colbert and looms unsuitable for these sizes destroyed in 1671 wooldyers were given a code of detailed instructions as to the processes and materials that might be used long after french industry felt the difficulty of struggling with stereotyped processes his system however naturally resulted in a series of tariff measures in 1664 and 1667 moderate duties on the exportation of raw materials were first laid on followed by heavy customs imposed on the importation of foreign goods the shipment of coin was forbidden but colbert’s criterion of prosperity was the favorable balance of trade french agriculture was overlooked the tariff of 1667 was based on the theory that foreigners must of necessity buy french wines lace and wheat that the french could sell but not buy but the act of 1667 cut off the demand for french goods and portuguese wines came into the market england and holland retaliated and shut off the foreign markets from france the wine and wheat growers of the latter country were ruined and the rural population came to the verge of starvation colbert’s last years were full of misfortune and disappointment and a new illustration was given of the fallacy that the gain from international trade was not mutual  from this time economic principles began to be better apprehended it is to be noted that the first just observations arose from discussions upon money and thence upon international trade so far england has furnished the most acute writers now france became the scene of a new movement marshal vauban15 the great soldier and boisguillebert16 both began to emphasize the truth that wealth really consists not in money alone but in an abundance of commodities that countries which have plenty of gold and silver are not wealthier than others and that money is only a medium of exchange it was not however until 1750 that evidences of any real advance began to appear for law’s famous scheme 17161720 only served as a drag upon the growth of economic truth but in the middle of the eighteenth century an intellectual revival set in the “encyclopædia” was published montesquieu wrote his “l’Ésprit des lois” rousseau was beginning to write and voltaire was at the height of his power in this movement political economy had an important share and there resulted the first school of economists termed the physiocrats  the founder and leader of this new body of economic thinkers was françois quesnay17 a physician and favorite at the court of louis xv passing by his ethical basis of a natural order of society and natural rights of man his main doctrine in brief was that the cultivation of the soil was the only source of wealth that labor in other industries was sterile and that freedom of trade was a necessary condition of healthy distribution while known as the “economists” they were also called the “physiocrats”18 or the “agricultural school” quesnay and his followers distinguished between the creation of wealth which could only come from the soil and the union of these materials once created by labor in other occupations in the latter case the laborer did not in their theory produce wealth a natural consequence of this view appeared in a rule of taxation by which all the burdens of state expenditure were laid upon the landed proprietors alone since they alone received a surplus of wealth the famous net produit above their sustenance and expenses of production this position of course did not recognize the old mercantile theory that foreign commerce enriched a nation solely by increasing the quantity of money to a physiocrat the wealth of a community was increased not by money but by an abundant produce from its own soil in fact quesnay argued that the right of property included the right to dispose of it freely at home or abroad unrestricted by the state this doctrine was formulated in the familiar expression “laissez faire laissez passer”19 condorcet and condillac favored the new ideas the “economists” became the fashion in france and even included in their number joseph ii of austria the kings of spain poland sweden naples catharine of russia and the margrave of baden20 agriculture therefore received a great stimulus  quesnay had many vigorous supporters of whom the most conspicuous was the marquis de mirabeau21 father of him of the revolution and the culmination of their popularity was reached about 1764 a feeling that the true increase of wealth was not in a mere increase of money but in the products of the soil led them naturally into a reaction against mercantilism but also made them dogmatic and overbearing in their onesided system which did not recognize that labor in all industries created wealth as the mercantile system found a great minister in colbert to carry those opinions into effect on a national scale so the physiocrats found in turgot22 a minister under louis xvi who gave them a national field in which to try the doctrines of the new school benevolently devoted to bettering the condition of the people while intendant of limoges 1751 he was made comptrollergeneral of the finances by louis xvi in 1774 turgot had the ability to separate political economy from politics law and ethics his system of freeing industry from governmental interference resulted in abolishing many abuses securing a freer movement of grain and in lightening the taxation but the rigidity of national prejudices was too strong to allow him success he had little tact and raised many difficulties in his way the proposal to abolish the corvées compulsory repair of roads by the peasants and substitute a tax on land brought his king into a costly struggle 1776 and attempts to undermine turgot’s power were successful with his downfall ended the influence of the economists the last of them was dupont de nemours23 who saw a temporary popularity of the physiocrats in the early years of the french revolution when the constituent assembly threw the burden of taxes on land but the fire blazed up fitfully for a moment only to die away entirely  all this however was the slow preparation for a newer and greater movement in political economy than had yet been known and which laid the foundation of the modern study as it exists today the previous discussions on money and the prominence given to agriculture and economic considerations by the economists made possible the great achievements of adam smith and the english school a reaction in england against the mercantile system produced a complete revolution in political economy vigorous protests against mercantilism had appeared long before24 and the true functions of money had come to be rightly understood25 more than that many of the most important doctrines had been either discussed or been given to the public in print it is at least certain that hints of much that made so astonishing an effect in adam smith’s “wealth of nations” 1776 had been given to the world before the latter was written to what sources among the minor writers he was most indebted it is hard to say two at least deserve considerable attention david hume and richard cantillon the former published his “economic essays” in 1752 which contained what even now would be considered enlightened views on money interest balance of trade commerce and taxation and a personal friendship existed between hume and adam smith dating back as far as 1748 when the latter was lecturing in edinburgh on rhetoric the extent of cantillon’s acquirements and adam smith’s possible indebtedness to him have been but lately recognized in a recent study26 on cantillon the late professor jevons has pointed out that the former anticipated many of the doctrines later ascribed to adam smith malthus and ricardo certain it is that the author of the “wealth of nations” took the truth wherever he found it received substantial suggestions from various sources but after having devoted himself in a peculiarly successful way to collecting facts he wrought out of all he had gathered the first rounded system of political economy the world had yet known which pointed out that labor was at the basis of production not merely in agriculture as the french school would have it but in all industries and which battered down all the defenses of the mediæval mercantile system in a marked degree adam smith27 combined a logical precision and a power of generalizing results out of confused data with a practical and intuitive regard for facts which are absolutely necessary for great achievements in the science of political economy at glasgow 17511764 adam smith gave lectures on natural theology ethical philosophy jurisprudence and political economy believing that these subjects were complementary to each other  a connected and comprehensive grasp of principles was the great achievement of adam smith28 for although the “wealth of nations” was naturally not without faults it has been the basis of all subsequent discussion and advance in political economy in books i and ii his own system is elucidated while book iv contains his discussion of the agricultural school and the attacks on the mercantile system seeing distinctly that labor was the basis of all production not merely in agriculture he shows books i and ii that the wealth of a country depends on the skill with which its labor is applied and upon the proportion of productive to unproductive laborers the gains from division of labor are explained and money appears as a necessary instrument after society has reached such a division he is then led to discuss prices market price and value and since from the price a distribution takes place among the factors of production he is brought to wages profit and rent the functions of capital are explained in general the separation of fixed from circulating capital is made and he discusses the influence of capital on the distribution of productive and unproductive labor the accumulation of capital money paper money and interest he therefore gets a connected set of ideas on production distribution and exchange on questions of production not much advance has been made since his day and his rules of taxation are now classic he attacked vigorously the balanceoftrade theory and the unnatural diversion of industry in england by prohibitions bounties and the arbitrary colonial system in brief he held that a plan for the regulation of industry by the government was indefensible and that to direct private persons how to employ their capital was either hurtful or useless he taught that a country will be more prosperous if its neighbors are prosperous and that nations have no interest in injuring each other it was however but human that his work should have been somewhat defective29 a new period in the history of political economy however begins with adam smith as roscher says he stands in the center of economic history  new writers now appear who add gradually stone after stone to the good foundation already laid and raise the edifice to fairer proportions the first considerable addition comes from a contribution by a country clergyman thomas robert malthus30 in his “essay on the principles of population” 1798 against the view of pitt that “the man who had a large family was a benefactor to his country” malthus argued conclusively that “a perfectly happy and virtuous community by physical law is constrained to increase very rapidly by nature human food increases in a slow arithmetical ratio man himself increases in a quick geometrical ratio unless want and vice stop him” in his second edition 1803 besides the positive check of vice and want he gave more importance to the negative check of “selfrestraint moral and prudential” the whole theory was crudely stated at first and it raised the cry that such a doctrine was inconsistent with the belief in a benevolent creator in its essence the law of population is simply that a tendency and ability exist in mankind to increase its numbers faster than subsistence and that this result actually will happen unless checks retard it or new means of getting subsistence arise if an undue increase of population led to vice and misery in malthus’s theory he certainly is not to be charged with unchristian feelings if he urged a selfrestraint by which that evil result should be avoided malthus’s doctrines excited great discussion godwin says that by 1820 thirty or forty answers to the essay had been written and they have continued to appear the chief contributions have been by a h everett “new ideas on population” 1823 who believed that an increase of numbers increased productive power by m t sadler “law of population” 1830 who taught that human fertility varied inversely with numbers falling off with density of population by sir archibald alison “principles of population” 1840 who reasoned inductively that the material improvement of the human race is a proof that man can produce more than he consumes or that in the progress of society preventive checks necessarily arise by w r greg “enigmas of life” 1873 and by herbert spencer “westminster review” april 1852 and “principles of biology” part vi ch xii and xiii who worked out a physiological check in that with a mental development out of lower stages there comes an increased demand upon the nervous energy which causes a diminution of fertility since darwin’s studies it has been very generally admitted that it is the innate tendency of all organic life to increase until numbers press upon the limit of foodproduction not that population has always done so in every country31 malthus’s teachings resulted in the modern poorhouse system beginning with 1834 in england and they corrected some of the abuses of indiscriminate charity  while adam smith had formulated very correctly the laws of production in his way malthus was adding to the means by which a better knowledge of the principles of distribution was to be obtained and the next advance owing to the sharp discussions of the time on the corn laws was by a natural progress to the law of diminishing returns and rent an independent discovery of the law of rent is to be assigned to no less than four persons32 but for the full perception of its truth and its connection with other principles of political economy the credit has been rightly given to david ricardo33 next to adam smith without question the greatest economist of the english school curiously enough although adam smith was immersed in abstract speculations his “homely sagacity” led him to the most practical results but while ricardo was an experienced and successful man of business he it was above all others who established the abstract political economy in the sense of a body of scientific laws to which concrete phenomena in spite of temporary inconsistencies must in the end conform his work therefore supplemented that of adam smith and there are very few doctrines fully worked out today of which hints have not been found in ricardo’s wonderfully compact statements with no graces of exposition his writings seem dry but are notwithstanding mines of valuable suggestions  in the field of distribution and exchange ricardo made great additions malthus and west had shown that rent was not an element in cost of production but both malthus and ricardo seemed to have been familiar with the doctrine of rent long before the former published his book ricardo however saw into its connection with other parts of a system of distribution34 the malthusian doctrine of a pressure of population on subsistence naturally forced a recognition of the law of diminishing returns from land35 then as soon as different qualities of land were simultaneously cultivated the best necessarily gave larger returns than the poorest and the idea that the payment of rent was made for a superior instrument and in proportion to its superiority over the poorest instrument which society found necessary to use resulted in the law of rent ricardo moreover carried out this principle as it affected wages profits values and the fall of profits but did not give sufficient importance to the operation of forces in the form of improvements acting in opposition to the tendency toward lessened returns the theory of rent still holds its place although it has met with no little opposition36 a doctrine quite as important in its effects on free exchange was clearly established by ricardo under the name of the doctrine of “comparative cost” which is the reason for the existence of any and all international trade  the work of adam smith was soon known to other countries apart from translations a most lucid and attractive exposition was given to the french by j b say “traité d’économie politique” 1803 followed after lecturing in paris from 18151830 by a more complete treatise37 “cours complète d’économie politique” 1828 while not contributing much that was new say did a great service by popularizing previous results in a happy and lively style combined with good arrangement and many illustrations the theory that general demand and supply are identical is his most important contribution to the study although he translated ricardo’s book he did not grasp the fact that rent did not enter into price say’s work was later supplemented by an italian pellegrino rossi38 who in his “cours d’économie politique” 18431851 naturalized the doctrines of malthus and ricardo on french soil his work is of solid value and he and say have given rise to an active school of political economy in france in switzerland sismondi expounded adam smith’s results in his “de la richesse commerciale” 1803 but was soon led into a new position explained in his “nouveaux principes d’économie politique” 1819 this has made him the earliest and most distinguished of the humanitarian economists seeing the sufferings caused by readjustments of industries after the peace and the warehouses filled with unsold goods he thought the excess of production over the power of consumption was permanent and attacked division of labor laborsaving machinery and competition discoveries which would supersede labor he feared would continue and the abolition of patents together with the limitation of population39 was urged these arguments furnished excellent weapons to the socialistic agitators heinrich storch40 aimed to spread the views of adam smith41 in russia by his “cours d’économie politique” 1815 without further developing the theory of political economy he produced a book of exceptional merit by pointing out the application of the principles to russia particularly in regard to the effect of a progress of wealth on agriculture and manufactures to the natural steps by which a new country changes from agriculture to a manufacturing régime and to finance and currency with an account of russian depreciated paper since catharine ii  for the next advance we must again look to england passing by mcculloch42 and senior a gifted writer the legitimate successor of ricardo is john stuart mill43 his father james mill44 introduced him into a circle of able men of which bentham was the ablest although his father undoubtedly exercised the chief influence over his training while yet but twentythree in his first book “essays on some unsettled questions of political economy” 18291830 he gained a high position as an economist in one form or another all his additions to the study are to be found here in a matured condition the views on productive and unproductive consumption profits economic methods and especially his very clever investigation on international values were there presented his “logic” 1843 contains book vi a careful statement of the relation of political economy to other sciences and of the proper economic method to be adopted in investigations through his “principles of political economy” 1848 he has exercised a remarkable influence upon men in all lands not so much because of great originality since in truth he only put ricardo’s principles in better and more attractive form but chiefly by a method of systematic treatment more lucid and practical than had been hitherto reached by improving vastly beyond the dry treatises of his predecessors including ricardo who was concise and dull by infusing a human element into his aims and by illustrations and practical applications even yet however some parts of his book show the tendency to too great a fondness for abstract statement induced probably by a dislike to slighting his reasons due to his early training and by the limits of his book which obliged him to omit many possible illustrations with a deep sympathy for the laboringclasses he was tempted into the field of sociology in this book although he saw distinctly that political economy was but one of the sciences a knowledge of which was necessary to a legislator in reaching a decision upon social questions mill shows an advance beyond ricardo in this treatise by giving the study a more practical direction although it is usual to credit mill with originating the laws of international values yet they are but a development of ricardo’s doctrine of international trade and mill’s discussions of the progress of society toward the stationary state were also hinted at although obscurely by ricardo in the volumes of mr mill the subject is developed as symmetrically as a proof in geometry while he held strongly to free trade45 he gave little space to the subject in his book all in all his book yet remains the best systematic treatise in the english language although much has been done since his day46  he who has improved upon previous conceptions and been the only one to make any very important advance in the science since mill’s day is j e cairnes47 in his “leading principles of political economy newly expounded” 1874 scarcely any previous writer has equaled him in logical clearness originality insight into economic phenomena and lucidity of style he subjected value supply and demand cost of production and international trade to a rigid investigation which has given us actual additions to our knowledge of the study the wagesfund theory was reexamined and was stated in a new form although mr mill had given it up cairnes undoubtedly has given it its best statement his argument on free trade part iii chapter iv is the ablest and strongest to be found in modern writers this volume is however not a systematic treatise on all the principles of political economy but no student can properly pass by these great additions for the right understanding of the science his “logical method of political economy” 1875 is a clear and able statement of the process to be adopted in an economic investigation and is a book of exceptional merit and usefulness especially in view of the rising differences in the minds of economists as to method  a group of english writers of ability in this period have written in such a way as to win for them mention in connection with cairnes and mill professor w stanley jevons48 put himself in opposition to the methods of the men just mentioned and applied the mathematical process to political economy but without reaching new results his most serviceable work has been in the study of money which appears in an excellent form “the money and mechanism of exchange” 1875 and in an investigation which showed a fall of the value of gold since the discoveries of 1849 in this latter he has furnished a model for any subsequent investigator like professor jevons t e cliffe leslie49 opposed the older english school the socalled “orthodox” but in the different way of urging with great ability the use of the historical method of which more will be said in speaking of later german writers50 he also distinguished himself by a study of land tenures in his “land systems and industrial economy of ireland england and continental countries” 1870 which was a brilliant exposition of the advantages of small holdings  by far the ablest of the group both by reason of his natural gifts and his training as a banker and financial editor was walter bagehot51 in his “economic studies” 1880 he has discussed with a remarkable economic insight the postulates of political economy and the position of adam smith ricardo and malthus in his “lombard street” fourth edition 1873 the money market is pictured with a vivid distinctness which implies the possession of rare qualities for financial writing indeed it is in this practical way also as editor of the london “economist”52 that he made his great reputation  of living english economists professor henry fawcett53 in his “manual of political economy” 1865 sixth edition 1883 is a close follower of mill giving special care to cooperation silver nationalization of land and tradesunions he is an exponent of the strict wagesfund theory and a vigorous freetrader professor j e thorold rogers of oxford also holds aloof from the methods of the old school his greatest contribution has been a “history of agriculture and prices in england” from 1255 to 1793 in four volumes54 18661882  of all the writers55 since cairnes it may be said that while adding to the data with which political economy has to do and putting principles to the test of facts they have made no actual addition to the existing body of principles although questions of distribution and taxation are certainly not yet fully settled as is seen by the wide differences of opinion expressed on subjects falling within these heads by writers of today  it now remains to complete this sketch of the growth of political economy by a brief account of the writers on the continent and in the united states beginning with france about the time of the founding of the london “economist” 1844 and “the statistical journal” 1839 in england there was established in paris the “journal des Économistes” 1842 which contains many valuable papers on the whole the most popular writer since j b say has been bastiat56 who aspired to be the french cobden he especially urged a new57 view of value which he defined as the relation established by an exchange of services that nature’s products are gratuitous so that man can not exact anything except for a given service chiefly as a foe of protection which he regarded as qualified socialism he has won a reputation for popular and clever writing and he was led to believe in a general harmony of interests between industrial classes but in general he can not be said to have much influenced the course of french thought on value rent and population he is undoubtedly unsound a writer of far greater depth than bastiat with uncommon industry and wide knowledge was michel chevalier58 easily the first among modern french economists he has led in the discussion upon the fall of gold protection banking and particularly upon money an ardent freetrader he had influence enough to induce france to enter into the commercial treaty of 1860 with england one of the ablest writers on special topics is levasseur59 who has given us a history of the workingclasses before and since the revolution and the best existing monograph on john law the most industrious and reliable of the recent writers is the wellknown statistician maurice block60 while less profound economists were j a blanqui61 and wolowski62 the latter devoted himself enthusiastically to banks of issue and bimetallism a small group gave themselves up chiefly to studies on agriculture and landtenures—h passy63 laveleye and lavergne64 the latter is by far the most important as shown by his “l’économie rurale de la france depuis 1789” 1857 which gives a means of comparing recent french agriculture with that before the revolution as described in arthur young’s “travels in france” 1789 the best systematic treatise in french is the “précis de la science économique” 1862 by antoineÉlise cherbuliez65 a genevan the french were the first to produce an alphabetical encyclopædia of economics by coquelin and guillaumin entitled the “dictionnaire de l’économie politique” 18511853 third edition 1864 courcelleseneuil66 by his “traité théorique et pratique d’économie politique” second edition 1867 and baudrillart by a good compendium joseph garnier dunoyer67 paul leroybeaulieu68 reybaud69 de parieu70 léon say71 boiteau and others have done excellent work in france and walras72 in switzerland  as cobden had an influence on bastiat so both had an influence in germany in creating what has been styled by opponents the “manchester school” led by princesmith died 1874 they have worked to secure complete liberty of commerce and industry and include in their numbers many men of ability and learning yearly congresses have been organized for the purpose of disseminating liberal ideas and an excellent review the “vierteljahrschrift für volkswirthschaft politik und kulturgeschichte”73 has been established they have devoted themselves successfully to reforms of laborlaws interest workingmen’s dwellings the money system and banking and strive for the abolition of protective duties schulzedelitzsch has acquired a deserved reputation for the creation of people’s banks and other forms of cooperation the translator of mill into german adolph soetbeer74 is the most eminent living authority on the production of the precious metals and a vigorous monometallist the school is represented in the “handwörterbuch der volkswirthschaftslehre” 1865 of reutzsch the other writers of this group are von böhmert75 faucher braun wolff michaelis emminghaus76 wirth77 hertzka and von holtzendorf the best known of the german protectionists is friedrich list the author of “das nationale system der politischen oekonomie” 1841 whose doctrines are very similar to those of h c carey in this country78 an able writer on administrative functions and finance79 is lorenz stein of vienna  but german economists are of interest inasmuch as they have established a new school who urge the use of the historical method in political economy and it is about the question of method that much of the interest of today centers in 1814 savigny introduced this method into jurisprudence and about 1850 it was applied to political economy the new school claim that the english “orthodox” writers begin by an a priori process and by deductions reach conclusions which are possibly true of imaginary cases but are not true of man as he really acts they therefore assert that economic laws can only be truly discovered by induction or a study of phenomena first as the means of reaching a generalization to them bagehot80 answers that scientific bookkeeping or collections of facts in themselves give no results ending in scientific laws for instance since the facts of banking change and vary every day no one can by induction alone reach any laws of banking or for example the study of a panic from the concrete phenomena would be like trying to explain the bursting of a boiler without a theory of steam more lately81 since it seems that the new school claim that induction does not preclude deduction and as the old school never intended to disconnect themselves from “comparing conclusions with external facts” there is not such a cause of difference as has previously appeared doubtless the insistence upon the merits of induction will be fruitful of good to “orthodox” writers in the more general resort to the collection of statistics and means of verification it is suggestive also that the leaders of the new school in germany and england have reached no different results by their new method and in the main agree with the laws evolved by the old english school the economist does not pretend that his assumptions are descriptions of economic conditions existing at a given time he simply considers them as forces often acting many on one point or occasion to be inquired into separately inasmuch as concrete phenomena are the resultants of several forces not to be known until we know the separate operation of each of the conjoined forces  the most prominent of the new school is wilhelm roscher82 of leipsic who wrote a systematic treatise “system der volkswirthschaft” 1854 sixteenth edition 1883 in the first division of which the notes contain a marvelous collection of facts and authorities he agrees in results with adam smith ricardo malthus and mill but does not seem to have known much of cairnes this book however is only a first of four treatises eventually intended to include the political economy of 2 agriculture 3 industry and commerce and 4 the state and commune the ablest contemporary of roscher who was probably the first to urge the historical method is karl knies83 in “die politische oekonomie vom standpunkte der geschichtlichen methode” 1853 second edition 18811883 the third of the group who founded the historical school is bruno hildebrand84 of jena author of “die nationalökonomie der gegenwart und zukunft” 1848  the german mind has always been familiar with the interference of the state and a class of writers has arisen not only advocating the inductive method but strongly imbued with a belief in a close connection of the state with industry and inasmuch as the essence of modern socialism is a resort to statehelp this body of men with wagner at their head has received the name of “socialists85 of the chair” and now wield a wide influence in germany of these writers86 wagner engel schmoller von scheel brentano held schönberg and schäffle are the most prominent  the historical school has received the adhesion of Émile de laveleye87 in belgium and other economists in england and the united states while cliffe leslie has been the most vigorous opponent of the methods of the old school there have been many others of less distinction indeed the period the close of which is marked by j r mcculloch’s book was one in which the old school had seemingly come to an end of its progress from too close an adhesion to deductions from assumed premises mill’s great merit was that he began the movement to better adapt political economy to society as it actually existed and the historical school will probably give a most desirable impetus to the same results even though its exaggerated claims as to the true method88 can not possibly be admitted  italian writers have not received hitherto the attention they deserve after 1830 besides rossi who went to france there was romagnosi who dealt more with the relations of economics to other studies cattanes who turned to rural questions and free trade combating the german list scialoja at the university of turin and francesco ferrara also at turin from 1849 to 1858 the latter was a follower of bastiat and carey as regards value and rent and at the same time was a radical believer in laissezfaire since the union of italy there has been a new interest in economic study as with us after our war the most eminent living italian economist is said to be angelo messedaglia holding a chair at padua since 1858 he has excelled in statistical and financial subjects and is now engaged on a treatise on money “moneta” of which one part has been issued 1882 marco minghetti and fedele lampertico stand above others the former for a study of the connection of political economy with morals and for his public career as a statesman the latter for his studies on paper money and other subjects carlo ferrais presented a good monograph on “money and the forced currency” 1879 and boccardo issued a library of selected works of the best economists and a large dictionary of political economy “dizionario universale di economia politica e di commercio” 2 vols second edition 1875 luigi luzzati is a vigorous advocate of cooperation and elia lattes has made a serious study of the early venetian banks  political economy has gained little from american writers of our statesmen none have made any additions to the science and only hamilton and gallatin can properly be called economists hamilton in his famous “report on manufactures” 1791 shared in some of the erroneous conceptions of his day but this paper together with his reports on a national bank and the public credit are evidences of a real economic power gallatin’s “memorial in favor of tariff reform” 1832 is as able as hamilton’s report on manufactures and a strong argument against protection both men made a reputation as practical financiers  “with few exceptions the works produced in the united states have been prepared as textbooks89 by authors engaged in college instruction and therefore chiefly interested in bringing principles previously worked out by others within the easy comprehension of undergraduate students”90 of these exceptions alexander h everett’s “new ideas on population”91 1822 forms a valuable part in the discussion which followed the appearance of malthus’s “essay” the writer however who has drawn most attention at home and abroad for a vigorous attack on the doctrines of ricardo is henry charles carey92 beginning with “the rate of wages” 1835 he developed a new theory of value see “principles of political economy” 18371840 “which he defined as a measure of the resistance to be overcome in obtaining things required for use or the measure of the power of nature over man in simpler terms value is measured by the cost of reproduction the value of every article thus declines as the arts advance while the general command of commodities constantly increases this causes a constant fall in the value of accumulated capital as compared with the results of present labor from which is inferred a tendency toward harmony rather than divergence of interests between capitalist and laborer” this theory of value93 he applied to land and even to man in his desire to give it universality he next claimed to have discovered a law of increasing production from land in his “past present and future” 1848 which was diametrically opposed to ricardo’s law of diminishing returns his proof was an historical one that in fact the poorer not the richer lands were first taken into cultivation this however did not explain the fact that different grades of land are simultaneously under cultivation on which ricardo’s doctrine of rent is based the constantly increasing production of land naturally led carey to believe in the indefinite increase of population he however was logically brought to accept the supposed law of an ultimate limit to numbers suggested by herbert spencer based on a diminution of human fertility he tried to identify physical and social laws and fused his political economy in a system of “social science” 1853 and his “unity of law” 1872 from about 1845 he became a protectionist and his writings were vigorously controversial in his doctrines on money he is distinctly a mercantilist94 but by his earnest attacks on all that has been gained in the science up to his day he has done a great service in stimulating inquiry and causing a better statement of results while undoubtedly the best known of american writers yet because of a prolix style and an illogical habit of mind he has had no extended influence on his countrymen95  the effect of the civil war is now beginning to show itself in an unmistakable drift toward the investigation of economic questions and there is a distinctly energetic tone which may bring new contributions from american writers general francis a walker96 in his study on “the wages question” 1876 has combated the wagesfund theory and proposed in its place a doctrine that wages are paid out of the product and not out of accumulated capital professor w g sumner97 is a vigorous writer in the school of mill and cairnes and has done good work in the cause of sound money doctrines both general walker and professor sumner hold to the method of economic investigation as expounded by mr cairnes although several younger economists show the influence of the german school professor a l perry98 of williams college adopted bastiat’s theory of value he also accepts the wagesfund theory rejects the law of malthus and although believing in the law of diminishing returns from land regards rent as the reward for a service rendered another writer henry george99 has gained an abnormal prominence by a plausible book “progress and poverty” 1880 which rejects the doctrine of malthus and argues that the increase of production of any kind augments the demand for land and so raises its value his conclusions lead him to advocate the nationalization of land although in opposition to almost all that political economy has yet produced his writing has drawn to him very unusual notice the increasing interest in social questions and the general lack of economic training which prevents a right estimate of his reasoning by people in general sufficiently account for the wide attention he has received  of late however new activity has been shown in the establishment of better facilities for the study of political economy in the principal seats of learning—harvard yale cornell columbia michigan and pennsylvania and a “cyclopædia of political science” 18811884 three volumes has been published by j j lalor after the example of the french dictionaries     books for consultation from english french and german

annual of great usefulness     preliminary remarks   writers on political economy profess to teach or to investigate the nature of wealth and the laws of its production and distribution including directly or remotely the operation of all the causes by which the condition of mankind or of any society of human beings in respect to this universal object of human desire is made prosperous or the reverse       it will be noticed that political economy does not include ethics     legislation or the science of government the results of     political economy are offered to the statesman who reaches a     conclusion after weighing them in connection with moral and     political considerations political economy is distinct from     sociology although it is common to include in the former     everything which concerns social life some writers distinguish     between the pure or abstract science and the applied art and we     can speak of a science of political economy only in the sense of a     body of abstract laws or formulas this however does not make     political economy less practical than physics for after a     principle is ascertained its operation is to be observed in the     same way that we study the force of gravitation in a falling     stone even when retarded by opposing forces an economic force     or tendency can be likewise distinctly observed although other     influences working at the same time prevent the expected effect     from following its cause it is in short the aim of political     economy to investigate the laws which govern the phenomena of     material wealth cf cossa “guide” chap iii   while the mercantile system prevailed it was assumed either expressly or tacitly in the whole policy of nations that wealth consisted solely of money or of the precious metals which when not already in the state of money are capable of being directly converted into it according to the doctrines then prevalent whatever tended to heap up money or bullion in a country added to its wealth       more correctly the mercantilists in the sixteenth and seventeenth     centuries held that where money was most plentiful there would     be found the greatest abundance of the necessaries of life100   whatever sent the precious metals out of a country impoverished it if a country possessed no gold or silver mines the only industry by which it could be enriched was foreign trade being the only one which could bring in money any branch of trade which was supposed to send out more money than it brought in however ample and valuable might be the returns in another shape was looked upon as a losing trade exportation of goods was favored and encouraged even by means extremely onerous to the real resources of the country because the exported goods being stipulated to be paid for in money it was hoped that the returns would actually be made in gold and silver importation of anything other than the precious metals was regarded as a loss to the nation of the whole price of the things imported unless they were brought in to be reexported at a profit or unless being the materials or instruments of some industry practiced in the country itself they gave the power of producing exportable articles at smaller cost and thereby effecting a larger exportation the commerce of the world was looked upon as a struggle among nations which could draw to itself the largest share of the gold and silver in existence and in this competition no nation could gain anything except by making others lose as much or at the least preventing them from gaining it  the mercantile theory could not fail to be seen in its true character when men began even in an imperfect manner to explore into the foundations of things money as money satisfies no want its worth to any one consists in its being a convenient shape in which to receive his incomings of all sorts which incomings he afterwards at the times which suit him best converts into the forms in which they can be useful to him the difference between a country with money and a country altogether without it would be only one of convenience a saving of time and trouble like grinding by water instead of by hand or to use adam smith’s illustration like the benefit derived from roads and to mistake money for wealth is the same sort of error as to mistake the highway which may be the easiest way of getting to your house or lands for the house and lands themselves  money being the instrument of an important public and private purpose is rightly regarded as wealth but everything else which serves any human purpose and which nature does not afford gratuitously is wealth also to be wealthy is to have a large stock of useful articles or the means of purchasing them everything forms therefore a part of wealth which has a power of purchasing for which anything useful or agreeable would be given in exchange things for which nothing could be obtained in exchange however useful or necessary they may be are not wealth in the sense in which the term is used in political economy air for example though the most absolute of necessaries bears no price in the market because it can be obtained gratuitously to accumulate a stock of it would yield no profit or advantage to any one and the laws of its production and distribution are the subject of a very different study from political economy it is possible to imagine circumstances in which air would be a part of wealth if it became customary to sojourn long in places where the air does not naturally penetrate as in divingbells sunk in the sea a supply of air artificially furnished would like water conveyed into houses bear a price and if from any revolution in nature the atmosphere became too scanty for the consumption or could be monopolized air might acquire a very high marketable value in such a case the possession of it beyond his own wants would be to its owner wealth and the general wealth of mankind might at first sight appear to be increased by what would be so great a calamity to them the error would lie in not considering that however rich the possessor of air might become at the expense of the rest of the community all persons else would be poorer by all that they were compelled to pay for what they had before obtained without payment  wealth then may be defined all useful or agreeable things which possess exchangeable value or in other words all useful or agreeable things except those which can be obtained in the quantity desired without labor or sacrifice       this is the usual definition of wealth henry george see     “progress and poverty” pp 3437 regards wealth as consisting     “of natural products that have been secured moved combined     separated or in other ways modified by human exertion so as to     fit them for the gratification of human desires nothing which     nature supplies to man without his labor is wealth all things     which have an exchange value are therefore not wealth only such     things can be wealth the production of which increases and the     destruction of which decreases the aggregate of wealth     increase in land values does not represent increase in the common     wealth for what landowners gain by higher prices the tenants or     purchasers who must pay them will lose” jevons “primer” p 13     defines wealth very properly as what is transferable limited in     supply and useful f a walker defines wealth as comprising “all     articles of value and nothing else” “political economy” p 5     levasseur’s definition “précis” p 15 is “all material objects     possessing utility” ie the power to satisfy a want cf     various definitions in roscher’s “political economy” section 9     note 3 perry “political economy” p 99 rejects the term     wealth as a clog to progress in the science and adopts     property in its stead defining it as that “which can be bought     or sold” cherbuliez “précis” p 70 defines wealth as the     material product of nature appropriated by labor for the wants of     man carey “social science” i 186 asserts that wealth consists     in the power to command nature’s services including in wealth     such intangible things as mental qualities      book i production     chapter i of the requisites of production    § 1 the requisites of production are two labor and appropriate natural objects       there is a third requisite of production capital see page 58     since the limitation to only two requisites applies solely to a     primitive condition of existence so soon as the element of time     enters into production then a store of capital becomes necessary     that is so soon as production requires such a term that during     the operation the laborer can not at the same time provide himself     with subsistence then capital is a requisite of production this     takes place also under any general division of labor in a     community when one man is making a pinhead he must be supplied     with food by some person until the pins are finished and     exchanged   labor is either bodily or mental or to express the distinction more comprehensively either muscular or nervous and it is necessary to include in the idea not solely the exertion itself but all feelings of a disagreeable kind all bodily inconvenience or mental annoyance connected with the employment of one’s thoughts or muscles or both in a particular occupation       the word “sacrifice” conveys a just idea of what the laborer     undergoes and it corresponds to the abstinence of the capitalist   of the other requisite—appropriate natural objects—it is to be remarked that some objects exist or grow up spontaneously of a kind suited to the supply of human wants there are caves and hollow trees capable of affording shelter fruits roots wild honey and other natural products on which human life can be supported but even here a considerable quantity of labor is generally required not for the purpose of creating but of finding and appropriating them  of natural powers some are unlimited others limited in quantity by an unlimited quantity is of course not meant literally but practically unlimited a quantity beyond the use which can in any or at least in present circumstances be made of it land is in some newly settled countries practically unlimited in quantity there is more than can be used by the existing population of the country or by any accession likely to be made to it for generations to come but even there land favorably situated with regard to markets or means of carriage is generally limited in quantity there is not so much of it as persons would gladly occupy and cultivate or otherwise turn to use in all old countries land capable of cultivation land at least of any tolerable fertility must be ranked among agents limited in quantity coal metallic ores and other useful substances found in the earth are still more limited than land  for the present i shall only remark that so long as the quantity of a natural agent is practically unlimited it can not unless susceptible of artificial monopoly bear any value in the market since no one will give anything for what can be obtained gratis but as soon as a limitation becomes practically operative—as soon as there is not so much of the thing to be had as would be appropriated and used if it could be obtained for asking—the ownership or use of the natural agent acquires an exchangeable value       rich lands in our western territories a few years ago could be had     practically for the asking but now since railways and an     increase of population have brought them nearer to the markets     they have acquired a distinct exchange value the value of a     commodity it may be anticipated is the quantity of other things     for which it can be exchanged   when more waterpower is wanted in a particular district than there are falls of water to supply it persons will give an equivalent for the use of a fall of water when there is more land wanted for cultivation than a place possesses or than it possesses of a certain quality and certain advantages of situation land of that quality and situation may be sold for a price or let for an annual rent    § 2 the second requisite of production labor       it is now our purpose to describe the second requisite of     production labor and point out that it can be either direct or     indirect this division and subdivision can be seen from the     classification given below under the head of indirect labor are     to be arranged all the many employments subsidiary to the     production of any one article and which as they furnish but a     small part of labor for the one article eg bread are     subsidiary to the production of a vast number of other articles     and hence we see the interdependence of one employment on another     which comes out so conspicuously at the time of a commercial     depression      “we think it little to sit down to a table covered with articles     from all quarters of the globe and from the remotest isles of the     sea—with tea from china coffee from brazil spices from the east     and sugar from the west indies knives from sheffield made with     iron from sweden and ivory from africa with silver from mexico     and cotton from south carolina all being lighted with oil brought     from new zealand or the arctic circle still less do we think of     the great number of persons whose united agency is required to     bring any one of these finished products to our homes—of the     merchants insurers sailors shipbuilders cordage and sail     makers astronomicalinstrument makers men of science and     others before a pound of tea can appear in our market”101   the labor102 which terminates in the production of an article fitted for some human use is either employed directly about the thing or in previous operations destined to facilitate perhaps essential to the possibility of the subsequent ones in making bread for example the labor employed about the thing itself is that of the baker but the labor of the miller though employed directly in the production not of bread but of flour is equally part of the aggregate sum of labor by which the bread is produced as is also the labor of the sower and of the reaper some may think that all these persons ought to be considered as employing their labor directly about the thing the corn the flour and the bread being one substance in three different states without disputing about this question of mere language there is still the plowman who prepared the ground for the seed and whose labor never came in contact with the substance in any of its states and the plowmaker whose share in the result was still more remote we must add yet another kind of labor that of transporting the produce from the place of its production to the place of its destined use the labor of carrying the corn to market and from market to the miller’s the flour from the miller’s to the baker’s and the bread from the baker’s to the place of its final consumption       besides the two classes of indirect laborers here mentioned those     engaged in producing materials and those in transportation there     are several others who are paid fractions out of the bread     subsidiary to the direct labor of the breadmaker is the labor of     all those who make the instruments employed in the process as     eg the oven materials are completely changed in character by     one use as when the coal is burned or the flour baked into     bread while an instrument like an oven is capable of remaining     intact throughout many operations the producer of materials and     the transporter are paid by the breadmaker in the price of his     coal and flour when left at his door so that the price of the     loaf is influenced by these payments those persons moreover     who like the police and officers of our government act to     protect property and life are also to be classed as laborers     indirectly aiding in the production of the given article bread     and by his taxes the breadmaker helps pay the wages of these     officials shading off into a more distant although essential     connection is another class—that of those laborers who train human     beings in the branches of knowledge necessary to the attainment of     proper skill in managing the processes and instruments of an     industry the acquisition of the rudiments of education and in     many cases the most profound knowledge of chemistry physics and     recondite studies are essential to production and teachers are     indirect laborers in producing almost every article in the market     in this country especially are inventors a class of indirect     laborers essential to all ultimate production as it now goes on     the improvements in the instruments of production are the results     of an inventive ability which has made american machinery known     all over the world they too as well as the teacher are paid a     small fraction of course out of the ultimate result by an     indirect path and materially change the ease or difficulty     cheapness or dearness of production in nearly every branch of     industry in the particular illustration given they have improved     the ovens ranges and stoves so that the same or better articles     are produced at a less cost than formerly all these indirect     laborers receive in the way of remuneration a fraction some     more some less the farther they are removed from the direct     process of the value of the final result    § 3 of capital as a requisite of production       but another set of laborers are to be placed in distinct contrast     with these so far as the grounds on which they receive their     remuneration is concerned these are the men engaged previously in     providing the subsistence and articles by which the former     classes of labor can carry on their operations   the previous employment of labor is an indispensable condition to every productive operation on any other than the very smallest scale except the labor of the hunter and fisher there is scarcely any kind of labor to which the returns are immediate productive operations require to be continued a certain time before their fruits are obtained unless the laborer before commencing his work possesses a store of food or can obtain access to the stores of some one else in sufficient quantity to maintain him until the production is completed he can undertake no labor but such as can be carried on at odd intervals concurrently with the pursuit of his subsistence       the possession of capital is thus a third requisite of production     together with land and labor as noted above henry george     “progress and poverty” chap iv holds an opposite opinion “the     subsistence of the laborers who built the pyramids was drawn not     from a previously hoarded stock” does he not forget the story of     joseph’s store of corn “but from the constantly recurring crops     of the nile valley”   he can not obtain food itself in any abundance for every mode of so obtaining it requires that there be already food in store agriculture only brings forth food after the lapse of months and though the labors of the agriculturist are not necessarily continuous during the whole period they must occupy a considerable part of it not only is agriculture impossible without food produced in advance but there must be a very great quantity in advance to enable any considerable community to support itself wholly by agriculture a country like england or the united states is only able to carry on the agriculture of the present year because that of past years has provided in those countries or somewhere else sufficient food to support their agricultural population until the next harvest they are only enabled to produce so many other things besides food because the food which was in store at the close of the last harvest suffices to maintain not only the agricultural laborers but a large industrious population besides  the claim to remuneration founded on the possession of food available for the maintenance of laborers is of another kind remuneration for abstinence not for labor if a person has a store of food he has it in his power to consume it himself in idleness or in feeding others to attend on him or to fight for him or to sing or dance for him if instead of these things he gives it to productive laborers to support them during their work he can and naturally will claim a remuneration from the produce he will not be content with simple repayment if he receives merely that he is only in the same situation as at first and has derived no advantage from delaying to apply his savings to his own benefit or pleasure he will look for some equivalent for this forbearance103 he will expect his advance of food to come back to him with an increase called in the language of business a profit and the hope of this profit will generally have been a part of the inducement which made him accumulate a stock by economizing in his own consumption or at any rate which made him forego the application of it when accumulated to his personal ease or satisfaction     chapter ii of unproductive labor    § 1 definition of productive and unproductive labor   labor is indispensable to production but has not always production for its effect there is much labor and of a high order of usefulness of which production is not the object labor has accordingly been distinguished into productive and unproductive productive labor means labor productive of wealth we are recalled therefore to the question touched upon in our preliminary remarks what wealth is  by unproductive labor on the contrary will be understood labor which does not terminate in the creation of material wealth and all labor according to our present definition must be classed as unproductive which terminates in a permanent benefit however important provided that an increase of material products forms no part of that benefit the labor of saving a friend’s life is not productive unless the friend is a productive laborer and produces more than he consumes       the principle on which the distinction is made is perfectly clear     but in many cases persons may be misled chiefly in regard to     matters of fact a clergyman may at first sight be classed as an     unproductive laborer but until we know the facts we can not     apply the principle of our definition unless we know that no     clergyman by inculcating rules of morality and selfcontrol ever     caused an idler or wrongdoer to become a steady laborer we can     not say that a clergyman is a laborer unproductive of material     wealth likewise the army or the officers of our government at     washington may or may not have aided in producing material wealth     according as they do or do not in fact accomplish the protective     purposes for which they exist so with teachers there is     however no disparagement implied in the word unproductive it is     merely an economic question and has to do only with forces     affecting the production of wealth   unproductive may be as useful as productive labor it may be more useful even in point of permanent advantage or its use may consist only in pleasurable sensation which when gone leaves no trace or it may not afford even this but may be absolute waste in any case society or mankind grow no richer by it but poorer all material products consumed by any one while he produces nothing are so much subtracted for the time from the material products which society would otherwise have possessed  to be wasted however is a liability not confined to unproductive labor productive labor may equally be waste if more of it is expended than really conduces to production if defect of skill in laborers or of judgment in those who direct them causes a misapplication of productive industry labor is wasted productive labor may render a nation poorer if the wealth it produces that is the increase it makes in the stock of useful or agreeable things be of a kind not immediately wanted as when a commodity is unsalable because produced in a quantity beyond the present demand or when speculators build docks and warehouses before there is any trade    § 2 productive and unproductive consumption   the distinction of productive and unproductive is applicable to consumption as well as to labor all the members of the community are not laborers but all are consumers and consume either unproductively or productively whoever contributes nothing directly or indirectly to production is an unproductive consumer the only productive consumers are productive laborers the labor of direction being of course included as well as that of execution but the consumption even of productive laborers is not all of it productive consumption there is unproductive consumption by productive consumers what they consume in keeping up or improving their health strength and capacities of work or in rearing other productive laborers to succeed them is productive consumption but consumption on pleasures or luxuries whether by the idle or by the industrious since production is neither its object nor is in any way advanced by it must be reckoned unproductive with a reservation perhaps of a certain quantum of enjoyment which may be classed among necessaries since anything short of it would not be consistent with the greatest efficiency of labor that alone is productive consumption which goes to maintain and increase the productive powers of the community either those residing in its soil in its materials in the number and efficiency of its instruments of production or in its people  i grant that no labor really tends to the enrichment of society which is employed in producing things for the use of unproductive consumers the tailor who makes a coat for a man who produces nothing is a productive laborer but in a few weeks or months the coat is worn out while the wearer has not produced anything to replace it and the community is then no richer by the labor of the tailor than if the same sum had been paid for a stall at the opera nevertheless society has been richer by the labor while the coat lasted these things also such as lace and pineapples are wealth until they have been consumed    § 3 distinction between labor for the supply of productive consumption and labor for the supply of unproductive consumption   we see however by this that there is a distinction more important to the wealth of a community than even that between productive and unproductive labor the distinction namely between labor for the supply of productive and for the supply of unproductive consumption between labor employed in keeping up or in adding to the productive resources of the country and that which is employed otherwise of the produce of the country a part only is destined to be consumed productively the remainder supplies the unproductive consumption of producers and the entire consumption of the unproductive class suppose that the proportion of the annual produce applied to the first purpose amounts to half then one half the productive laborers of the country are all that are employed in the operations on which the permanent wealth of the country depends the other half are occupied from year to year and from generation to generation in producing things which are consumed and disappear without return and whatever this half consume is as completely lost as to any permanent effect on the national resources as if it were consumed unproductively suppose that this second half of the laboring population ceased to work and that the government maintained them in idleness for a whole year the first half would suffice to produce as they had done before their own necessaries and the necessaries of the second half and to keep the stock of materials and implements undiminished the unproductive classes indeed would be either starved or obliged to produce their own subsistence and the whole community would be reduced during a year to bare necessaries but the sources of production would be unimpaired and the next year there would not necessarily be a smaller produce than if no such interval of inactivity had occurred while if the case had been reversed if the first half of the laborers had suspended their accustomed occupations and the second half had continued theirs the country at the end of the twelvemonth would have been entirely impoverished it would be a great error to regret the large proportion of the annual produce which in an opulent country goes to supply unproductive consumption that so great a surplus should be available for such purposes and that it should be applied to them can only be a subject of congratulation  this principle may be seen by the following classification  a idlers or unproductive laborers—eg actors b productive laborers—eg farmers    c producing wealth for productive consumption one half the annual produce    d producing wealth for unproductive consumption a one half the annual produce  group d are productive laborers and their own necessaries are productively consumed but they are supplied by c who keep themselves and d in existence so long as c work both c and d can go on producing if d stopped working they could be still subsisted as before by c but a would be forced to produce for themselves but if c stopped working d and c would be left without the necessaries of life and would be obliged to cease their usual work in this way it may be seen how much more important to the increase of material wealth c are than d who labor “for the supply of unproductive consumption” of course group d are desirable on other than economic grounds because their labor represents what can be enjoyed beyond the necessities of life     chapter iii of capital    § 1 capital is wealth appropriated to reproductive employment   it has been seen in the preceding chapters that besides the primary and universal requisites of production labor and natural agents there is another requisite without which no productive operations beyond the rude and scanty beginnings of primitive industry are possible—namely a stock previously accumulated of the products of former labor this accumulated stock of the produce of labor is termed capital what capital does for production is to afford the shelter protection tools and materials which the work requires and to feed and otherwise maintain the laborers during the process these are the services which present labor requires from past and from the produce of past labor whatever things are destined for this use—destined to supply productive labor with these various prerequisites—are capital       professor fawcett “manual” chap ii says “since the laborer     must be fed by previously accumulated food  some of the     results of past labor are required to be set aside to sustain the     laborer while producing the third requisite of production     therefore is a fund reserved from consumption and devoted to     sustain those engaged in future production capital is not     confined to the food which feeds the laborers but includes     machinery buildings and in fact every product due to man’s     labor which can be applied to assist his industry” chap iv     general walker “political economy” pages 6870 defines capital     as that portion of wealth excluding unimproved land and natural     agents which is employed in the production of new forms of     wealth henry george “progress and poverty” page 41 returns to     adam smith’s definition “that part of a man’s stock which he     expects to yield him a revenue is called his capital” cherbuliez     “précis” page 70 points out the increasing interdependence of     industrial operations as society increases in wealth and that     there is not a single industry which does not demand the use of     products obtained by previous labor “these auxiliary products     accumulated with a view to the production to which they are     subservient” form what is called capital carey “social science”     iii page 48 regards as capital all things which in any way form     the machinery by which society obtains wealth roscher’s     definition is “every product laid by for purposes of further     production” “political economy” section 42 by some labor is     regarded as capital104   a manufacturer for example has one part of his capital in the form of buildings fitted and destined for carrying on this branch of manufacture another part he has in the form of machinery a third consists if he be a spinner of raw cotton flax or wool if a weaver of flaxen woolen silk or cotton thread and the like according to the nature of the manufacture food and clothing for his operatives it is not the custom of the present age that he should directly provide and few capitalists except the producers of food or clothing have any portion worth mentioning of their capital in that shape instead of this each capitalist has money which he pays to his workpeople and so enables them to supply themselves what then is his capital precisely that part of his possessions whatever it be which he designs to employ in carrying on fresh production it is of no consequence that a part or even the whole of it is in a form in which it can not directly supply the wants of laborers       care should be taken to distinguish between wealth capital and     money capital may be succinctly defined as saved wealth devoted     to reproduction and the relations of the three terms mentioned     may be illustrated by the following figure the area of the     circle a represents the wealth of a country the area of the     inscribed circle b the quantity out of the whole wealth which is     saved and devoted to reproduction and called capital but money is     only one part of capital as shown by the area of circle c     wherefore it can be plainly seen that not all capital b is     money that not all wealth a is capital although all capital is     necessarily wealth as included within it it is not always     understood that money is merely a convenient article by which     other forms of wealth are exchanged against each other and that a     man may have capital without ever having any actual money in his     possession in times of commercial depression that which is     capital today may not tomorrow satisfy any desires ie not be     in demand and so for the time it may so to speak drop entirely     out of our circles above for the moment not having an exchange     value it can not be wealth and so can the less be capital   illustration outer circle a enclosing inner circle b with small circle                      c overlapping edge of circle b  suppose for instance that the capitalist is a hardware manufacturer and that his stock in trade over and above his machinery consists at present wholly in iron goods iron goods can not feed laborers nevertheless by a mere change of the destination of the iron goods he can cause laborers to be fed suppose that the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent in buying plate and jewels and in order to render the effect perceptible let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers whom we shall suppose to have been previously like the irish peasantry only half employed and half fed the laborers on receiving their increased wages will not lay them out in plate and jewels but in food there is not however additional food in the country nor any unproductive laborers or animals as in the former case whose food is set free for productive purposes food will therefore be imported if possible if not possible the laborers will remain for a season on their short allowance but the consequence of this change in the demand for commodities occasioned by the change in the expenditure of capitalists from unproductive to productive is that next year more food will be produced and less plate and jewelry so that again without having had anything to do with the food of the laborers directly the conversion by individuals of a portion of their property no matter of what sort from an unproductive destination to a productive has had the effect of causing more food to be appropriated to the consumption of productive laborers the distinction then between capital and notcapital does not lie in the kind of commodities but in the mind of the capitalist—in his will to employ them for one purpose rather than another and all property however ill adapted in itself for the use of laborers is a part of capital so soon as it or the value to be received from it is set apart for productive reinvestment    § 2 more capital devoted to production than actually employed in it   as whatever of the produce of the country is devoted to production is capital so conversely the whole of the capital of the country is devoted to production this second proposition however must be taken with some limitations and explanations 1 a fund may be seeking for productive employment and find none adapted to the inclinations of its possessor it then is capital still but unemployed capital 2 or the stock may consist of unsold goods not susceptible of direct application to productive uses and not at the moment marketable these until sold are in the condition of unemployed capital       this is not an important distinction the goods are doubtless     marketable at some price if offered low enough if no one wants     them then by definition they are not wealth so long as that     condition exists   3 or suppose that the government lays a tax on the production in one of its earlier stages as for instance by taxing the material the manufacturer has to advance the tax before commencing the manufacture and is therefore under a necessity of having a larger accumulated fund than is required for or is actually employed in the production which he carries on he must have a larger capital to maintain the same quantity of productive labor or what is equivalent with a given capital he maintains less labor 4 for another example a farmer may enter on his farm at such a time of the year that he may be required to pay one two or even three quarters’ rent before obtaining any return from the produce this therefore must be paid out of his capital  5 finally that large portion of the productive capital of a country which is employed in paying the wages and salaries of laborers evidently is not all of it strictly and indispensably necessary for production as much of it as exceeds the actual necessaries of life and health an excess which in the case of skilled laborers is usually considerable is not expended in supporting labor but in remunerating it and the laborers could wait for this part of their remuneration until the production is completed       the previous accumulation of commodities requisite for production     must inevitably be large enough to cover necessaries but need not     be more if the laborer is willing to wait for the additional     amount of his wages the amount of his unproductive consumption     until the completion of the industrial operation in fact     however the accumulation must be sufficient to pay the laborer     all his wages from week to week by force of custom wherever     there is any considerable division of labor and also sufficient     to purchase tools and materials the various elements of capital     are materials instruments and subsistence giving “instruments”     its wide signification which includes money the tool of     exchange and other necessary appliances of each special kind of     production   in truth it is only after an abundant capital had already been accumulated that the practice of paying in advance any remuneration of labor beyond a bare subsistence could possibly have arisen since whatever is so paid is not really applied to production but to the unproductive consumption of productive laborers indicating a fund for production sufficiently ample to admit of habitually diverting a part of it to a mere convenience  it will be observed that i have assumed that the laborers are always subsisted from capital105 and this is obviously the fact though the capital need not necessarily be furnished by a person called a capitalist  the peasant does not subsist this year on the produce of this year’s harvest but on that of the last the artisan is not living on the proceeds of the work he has in hand but on those of work previously executed and disposed of each is supported by a small capital of his own which he periodically replaces from the produce of his labor the large capitalist is in like manner maintained from funds provided in advance    § 3 examination of cases illustrative of the idea of capital   that which is virtually capital to the individual is or is not capital to the nation according as the fund which by the supposition he has not dissipated has or has not been dissipated by somebody else       let the reader consider in the four following suppositions     whether or not the given capital has wholly dropped out of the     circle in the diagram page 67 in 3 and 4 the wealth is     entirely dissipated as it can not longer be in circle a it can     not of course be in circle b   1 for example let property of the value of ten thousand pounds belonging to a be lent to b a farmer or manufacturer and employed profitably in b’s occupation it is as much capital as if it belonged to b a is really a farmer or manufacturer not personally but in respect of his property capital worth ten thousand pounds is employed in production—in maintaining laborers and providing tools and materials—which capital belongs to a while b takes the trouble of employing it and receives for his remuneration the difference between the profit which it yields and the interest he pays to a this is the simplest case  2 suppose next that a’s ten thousand pounds instead of being lent to b are lent on mortgage to c a landed proprietor by whom they are employed in improving the productive powers of his estate by fencing draining roadmaking or permanent manures this is productive employment the ten thousand pounds are sunk but not dissipated they yield a permanent return the land now affords an increase of produce sufficient in a few years if the outlay has been judicious to replace the amount and in time to multiply it manifold here then is a value of ten thousand pounds employed in increasing the produce of the country this constitutes a capital for which c if he lets his land receives the returns in the nominal form of increased rent and the mortgage entitles a to receive from these returns in the shape of interest such annual sum as has been agreed on  3 suppose however that c the borrowing landlord is a spendthrift who burdens his land not to increase his fortune but to squander it expending the amount in equipages and entertainments in a year or two it is dissipated and without return a is as rich as before he has no longer his ten thousand pounds but he has a lien on the land which he could still sell for that amount c however is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly and nobody is richer it may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent no doubt if c lost it by gaming or was cheated of it by his servants that is a mere transfer not a destruction and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively but if c has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury which he has consumed on himself or by means of his servants or guests these articles have ceased to exist and nothing has been produced to replace them while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced at the end of the year by new products created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers by c’s prodigality that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return c’s tradesmen may have made a profit during the process but if the capital had been expended productively an equivalent profit would have been made by builders fencers toolmakers and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboringclasses while at the expiration of the time to say nothing of an increase c would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him which now he has not there is therefore on the general result a difference to the disadvantage of the community of at least ten thousand pounds being the amount of c’s unproductive expenditure to a the difference is not material since his income is secured to him and while the security is good and the market rate of interest the same he can always sell the mortgage at its original value to a therefore the lien of ten thousand pounds on c’s estate is virtually a capital of that amount but is it so in reference to the community it is not a had a capital of ten thousand pounds but this has been extinguished—dissipated and destroyed by c’s prodigality a now receives his income not from the produce of his capital but from some other source of income belonging to c probably from the rent of his land that is from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital  4 let us now vary the hypothesis still further and suppose that the money is borrowed not by a landlord but by the state a lends his capital to government to carry on a war he buys from the state what are called government securities that is obligations on the government to pay a certain annual income if the government employed the money in making a railroad this might be a productive employment and a’s property would still be used as capital but since it is employed in war that is in the pay of officers and soldiers who produce nothing and in destroying a quantity of gunpowder and bullets without return the government is in the situation of c the spendthrift landlord and a’s ten thousand pounds are so much national capital which once existed but exists no longer—virtually thrown into the sea as wealth or production is concerned though for other reasons the employment of it may have been justifiable a’s subsequent income is derived not from the produce of his own capital but from taxes drawn from the produce of the remaining capital of the community to whom his capital is not yielding any return to indemnify them for the payment it is all lost and gone and what he now possesses is a claim on the returns to other people’s capital and industry  the breach in the capital of the country was made when the government spent a’s money whereby a value of ten thousand pounds was withdrawn or withheld from productive employment placed in the fund for unproductive consumption and destroyed without equivalent       the united states had borrowed in the late civil war by august     31 1865 2845907626 and to june 30 1881 the government     had paid in interest on its bonds “from taxes drawn from the     produce of the remaining capital” 1270596784 as an income to     bondholders from this can be seen the enormous waste of wealth to     the united states during the war and consequently the less     existing capital today in this country since under the same     inducements to save the smaller the outside circle wealth the     less the inside circle capital must be     chapter iv fundamental propositions respecting capital    § 1 industry is limited by capital   the first of these propositions is that industry is limited by capital to employ labor in a manufacture is to invest capital in the manufacture this implies that industry can not be employed to any greater extent than there is capital to invest the proposition indeed must be assented to as soon as it is distinctly apprehended the expression “applying capital” is of course metaphorical what is really applied is labor capital being an indispensable condition the food of laborers and the materials of production have no productive power but labor can not exert its productive power unless provided with them there can be no more industry than is supplied with materials to work up and food to eat selfevident as the thing is it is often forgotten that the people of a country are maintained and have their wants supplied not by the produce of present labor but of past       therefore as capital increases more labor can be employed when     the pittsburg rioters in 1877 destroyed property or the product     of past labor they did not realize then that that property might     but now could never again be employed for productive purposes     and thereby support laborers   they consume what has been produced not what is about to be produced now of what has been produced a part only is allotted to the support of productive labor and there will not and can not be more of that labor than the portion so allotted which is the capital of the country can feed and provide with the materials and instruments of production  because industry is limited by capital we are not however to infer that it always reaches that limit there may not be as many laborers obtainable as the capital would maintain and employ this has been known to occur in new colonies where capital has sometimes perished uselessly for want of labor       in the farming districts of our middle and western states in     harvesttime crops have been often of late years ruined because     farmhands could not be obtained in earlier days president john     adams was unable to hire a man in washington to cut wood in the     surrounding forests with which to warm the white house   the unproductive consumption of productive laborers the whole of which is now supplied by capital might cease or be postponed until the produce came in and additional productive laborers might be maintained with the amount  governments can create capital they may lay on taxes and employ the amount productively they may do what is nearly equivalent they may lay taxes on income or expenditure and apply the proceeds toward paying off the public debts the fundholder when paid off would still desire to draw an income from his property most of which therefore would find its way into productive employment while a great part of it would have been drawn from the fund for unproductive expenditure since people do not wholly pay their taxes from what they would have saved but partly if not chiefly from what they would have spent    § 2 increase of capital gives increased employment to labor without assignable bounds   while on the one hand industry is limited by capital so on the other every increase of capital gives or is capable of giving additional employment to industry and this without assignable limit i do not mean to deny that the capital or part of it may be so employed as not to support laborers being fixed in machinery buildings improvement of land and the like in any large increase of capital a considerable portion will generally be thus employed and will only cooperate with laborers not maintain them       it will be remembered however that subsistence is but one part     or element of capital that instruments and materials form a large     part of capital but still the question of mere maintenance is     rightfully discussed because it is asserted today that while     the rich are growing richer the poor lack even the food to keep     them alive and throughout this discussion mr mill has in view     the fact that laborers may exist in the community either “half fed     or unemployed”   what i do intend to assert is that the portion which is destined to their maintenance may supposing no alteration in anything else be indefinitely increased without creating an impossibility of finding the employment in other words that if there are human beings capable of work and food to feed them they may always be employed in producing something it is very much opposed to common doctrines106 there is not an opinion more general among mankind than this that the unproductive expenditure of the rich is necessary to the employment of the poor       it is to be noticed that in fact after the arts have so far     advanced in a community that mankind can obtain by their exertion     more than the amount of the mere necessaries of life sufficient on     the average for the subsistence of all any further production     rendered possible to the human race by new discoveries and     processes is naturally unproductively consumed and that     consequently a demand for labor for unproductive consumption is     essential for the employment of all existing laborers this     however can be done because enough capital has been brought into     existence to create the demand for the labor yet it is clear that     it is not expenditure but capital by which employment is given     to the poor   suppose that every capitalist came to be of opinion that not being more meritorious than a wellconducted laborer he ought not to fare better and accordingly laid by from conscientious motives the surplus of his profits unproductive expenditure is now reduced to its lowest limit and it is asked how is the increased capital to find employment who is to buy the goods which it will produce there are no longer customers even for those which were produced before the goods therefore it is said will remain unsold they will perish in the warehouses until capital is brought down to what it was originally or rather to as much less as the demand of the customers has lessened but this is seeing only one half of the matter in the case supposed there would no longer be any demand for luxuries on the part of capitalists and landowners but when these classes turn their income into capital they do not thereby annihilate their power of consumption they do but transfer it from themselves to the laborers to whom they give employment now there are two possible suppositions in regard to the laborers either there is or there is not an increase of their numbers proportional to the increase of capital 1 if there is the case offers no difficulty the production of necessaries for the new population takes the place of the production of luxuries for a portion of the old and supplies exactly the amount of employment which has been lost 2 but suppose that there is no increase of population the whole of what was previously expended in luxuries by capitalists and landlords is distributed among the existing laborers in the form of additional wages we will assume them to be already sufficiently supplied with necessaries  what follows that the laborers become consumers of luxuries and the capital previously employed in the production of luxuries is still able to employ itself in the same manner the difference being that the luxuries are shared among the community generally instead of being confined to a few supposing that the power of their labor were physically sufficient to produce all this amount of indulgences for their whole number thus the limit of wealth is never deficiency of consumers but of producers and productive power every addition to capital gives to labor either additional employment or additional remuneration       that laborers should get more a by capitalists abstaining from     unproductive expenditure than b by expenditure in articles     unproductively consumed is a question difficult for many to     comprehend and needs all the elucidation possible to start with     no one ever knew of a community all of whose wants were satisfied     in fact civilization is constantly leading us into new fields of     enjoyment and results in a constant differentiation of new     desires to satisfy these wants is the spring to nearly all     production and industry there can therefore be no stop to     production arising from lack of desire for commodities “the limit     of wealth is never deficiency of consumers” but of productive     power      now in supposition 2 of the text remember that the laborers     are supposed not to be employed up to their full productive power     if all capitalists abstain from unproductive consumption and     devote that amount of wealth to production then since there can     be no production without labor the same number of laborers have     offered to them in the aggregate a larger sum of articles for     their exertions which is equivalent to saying they receive     additional wages      but some persons want to see the process in the concrete and the     same principle may be illustrated by a practical case it is     supposed that all laborers have the necessaries of life only but     none of the comforts decencies and luxuries let a be a farmer     in new york who can also weave carpets and b a lumberman in     maine a begins to want a better house and b wishes a carpet     both having food clothing and shelter one of the capitalists     abstaining from unproductive consumption as above is x who     knowing the two desires of a and b presents himself as a     middleman ie he gives a market for both men as is found in     every center of trade as well as in a country store furnishing     a the tools materials etc and giving him the promise of lumber     if he will create the carpet and promising b the carpet if he     will likewise produce the additional lumber to be more matter of     fact x buys the carpet of a and sells it to b for the lumber     thus two new articles have been created and for their exertions a     has received additional wages either in the form of lumber or of     the money paid him for the carpet and b has received additional     wages either in the form of a carpet or the money paid him by x     for the lumber if a and b are regarded as typifying all the     laborers and x all the above capitalists in the multiplicity of     actual exchanges it will be seen that a and b are creating new     articles to satisfy their own demand instead of meeting the     demands of x if their primary wants are already supplied then     they take their additional wages in the form of comforts and     decencies when class x forego their consumption but add that     amount to capital they do not give up their title to that     capital but they transfer the use of it or their consuming     power to others for the time being this question will be more     fully discussed in § 6    § 3 capital is the result of saving and all capital is consumed   a second fundamental theorem respecting capital relates to the source from which it is derived it is the result of saving  if all persons were to expend in personal indulgences all that they produce and all the income that they receive from what is produced by others capital could not increase some saving therefore there must have been even in the simplest of all states of economical relations people must have produced more than they used or used less than they produced still more must they do so before they can employ other laborers or increase their production beyond what can be accomplished by the work of their own hands if it were said for instance that the only way to accelerate the increase of capital is by increase of saving the idea would probably be suggested of greater abstinence and increased privation but it is obvious that whatever increases the productive power of labor creates an additional fund to make savings from and enables capital to be enlarged not only without additional privation but concurrently with an increase of personal consumption nevertheless there is here an increase of saving in the scientific sense though there is more consumed there is also more spared there is a greater excess of production over consumption to consume less than is produced is saving and that is the process by which capital is increased not necessarily by consuming less absolutely       the economic idea of saving involves of course the intention of     using the wealth in reproduction saving without this meaning     results only in hoarding of wealth and while hoarded this amount     is not capital to explain the process by which capital comes into     existence bastiat has given the wellknown illustration of the     plane in his “sophisms of protection”107   a fundamental theorem respecting capital closely connected with the one last discussed is that although saved and the result of saving it is nevertheless consumed the word saving does not imply that what is saved is not consumed nor even necessarily that its consumption is deferred but only that if consumed immediately it is not consumed by the person who saves it if merely laid by for future use it is said to be hoarded and while hoarded is not consumed at all but if employed as capital it is all consumed though not by the capitalist part is exchanged for tools or machinery which are worn out by use part for seed or materials which are destroyed as such by being sown or wrought up and destroyed altogether by the consumption of the ultimate product the remainder is paid in wages to productive laborers who consume it for their daily wants or if they in their turn save any part this also is not generally speaking hoarded but through savingsbanks benefit clubs or some other channel reemployed as capital and consumed to the vulgar it is not at all apparent that what is saved is consumed to them every one who saves appears in the light of a person who hoards the person who expends his fortune in unproductive consumption is looked upon as diffusing benefits all around and is an object of so much favor that some portion of the same popularity attaches even to him who spends what does not belong to him who not only destroys his own capital if he ever had any but under pretense of borrowing and on promise of repayment possesses himself of capital belonging to others and destroys that likewise  this popular error comes from attending to a small portion only of the consequences that flow from the saving or the spending all the effects of either which are out of sight being out of mind there is in the one case a wearing out of tools a destruction of material and a quantity of food and clothing supplied to laborers which they destroy by use in the other case there is a consumption that is to say a destruction of wines equipages and furniture thus far the consequence to the national wealth has been much the same an equivalent quantity of it has been destroyed in both cases but in the spending this first stage is also the final stage that particular amount of the produce of labor has disappeared and there is nothing left while on the contrary the saving person during the whole time that the destruction was going on has had laborers at work repairing it who are ultimately found to have replaced with an increase the equivalent of what has been consumed  almost all expenditure being carried on by means of money the money comes to be looked upon as the main feature in the transaction and since that does not perish but only changes hands people overlook the destruction which takes place in the case of unproductive expenditure the money being merely transferred they think the wealth also has only been handed over from the spendthrift to other people but this is simply confounding money with wealth the wealth which has been destroyed was not the money but the wines equipages and furniture which the money purchased and these having been destroyed without return society collectively is poorer by the amount in proportion as any class is improvident or luxurious the industry of the country takes the direction of producing luxuries for their use while not only the employment for productive laborers is diminished but the subsistence and instruments which are the means of such employment do actually exist in smaller quantity    § 4 capital is kept up by perpetual reproduction as shown by the recovery of countries from devastation   to return to our fundamental theorem everything which is produced is consumed—both what is saved and what is said to be spent—and the former quite as rapidly as the latter all the ordinary forms of language tend to disguise this when people talk of the ancient wealth of a country of riches inherited from ancestors and similar expressions the idea suggested is that the riches so transmitted were produced long ago at the time when they are said to have been first acquired and that no portion of the capital of the country was produced this year except as much as may have been this year added to the total amount the fact is far otherwise the greater part in value of the wealth now existing in the united states has been produced by human hands within the last twelve months       “in the state of massachusetts it is estimated that the capital     on the average belonging to each individual does not exceed 600     and that the average annual product per capita is about 200 so     that the total capital is the product of only two or three years’     labor”108   the land subsists and the land is almost the only thing that subsists everything which is produced perishes and most things very quickly most kinds of capital are not fitted by their nature to be long preserved westminster abbey has lasted many centuries with occasional repairs some grecian sculptures have existed above two thousand years the pyramids perhaps double or treble that time but these were objects devoted to unproductive use capital is kept in existence from age to age not by preservation but by perpetual reproduction every part of it is used and destroyed generally very soon after it is produced but those who consume it are employed meanwhile in producing more the growth of capital is similar to the growth of population every individual who is born dies but in each year the number born exceeds the number who die the population therefore always increases though not one person of those composing it was alive until a very recent date  this perpetual consumption and reproduction of capital afford the explanation of what has so often excited wonder the great rapidity with which countries recover from a state of devastation the possibility of a rapid repair of their disasters mainly depends on whether the country has been depopulated if its effective population have not been extirpated at the time and are not starved afterward then with the same skill and knowledge which they had before with their land and its permanent improvements undestroyed and the more durable buildings probably unimpaired or only partially injured they have nearly all the requisites for their former amount of production if there is as much of food left to them or of valuables to buy food as enables them by any amount of privation to remain alive and in working condition they will in a short time have raised as great a produce and acquired collectively as great wealth and as great a capital as before by the mere continuance of that ordinary amount of exertion which they are accustomed to employ in their occupations nor does this evince any strength in the principle of saving in the popular sense of the term since what takes place is not intentional abstinence but involuntary privation       the world has at any given period the power under existing     conditions of production and skill to create a certain amount of     wealth as represented by the inner rectangle w each increased     power of production arising from conquests over nature’s forces     as the use of steam and laborsaving machinery permits the total     wealth to be enlarged as in the figure to rectangle w’ for the     production of wealth are required labor capital and land     therefore if the labor and land are not destroyed by war there     need not necessarily be in existence all the previous capital if     there are the necessaries for all and only sufficient tools to     accomplish the work they will in a few years again recreate all     the wealth that formerly existed regain the same position as     before and go on slowly increasing the total wealth just as fast     as improvements in the arts of production render it possible         illustration inner rectangle w surrounded by rectangle w’    § 5 effects of defraying government expenditure by loans   an application of this truth has been made to the question of raising government supplies for war purposes loans being drawn from capital in lieu of taxes which would generally have been paid from income and made up in part or altogether by increased economy must according to the principles we have laid down tend to impoverish the country yet the years in which expenditure of this sort has been on the greatest scale have often been years of great apparent prosperity the wealth and resources of the country instead of diminishing have given every sign of rapid increase during the process and of greatly expanded dimensions after its close       during our civil war at the same time that wealth was being     destroyed on an enormous scale there was a very general feeling     that trade was good and large fortunes were made at the close of     the war a period of speculation and overtrading continued until it     was brought to a disastrous close by the panic of 1873 much of     this speculation however was due to an inflated paper currency   we will suppose the most unfavorable case possible that the whole amount borrowed and destroyed by the government was abstracted by the lender from a productive employment in which it had actually been invested the capital therefore of the country is this year diminished by so much but unless the amount abstracted is something enormous there is no reason in the nature of the case why next year the national capital should not be as great as ever the loan can not have been taken from that portion of the capital of the country which consists of tools machinery and buildings it must have been wholly drawn from the portion employed in paying laborers and the laborers will suffer accordingly but if none of them are starved if their wages can bear such an amount of reduction or if charity interposes between them and absolute destitution there is no reason that their labor should produce less in the next year than in the year before if they produce as much as usual having been paid less by so many millions sterling these millions are gained by their employers the breach made in the capital of the country is thus instantly repaired but repaired by the privations and often the real misery of the laboringclass       as mr mill points out during the napoleonic wars in france the     withdrawal of laborers from industry into the army was so large     that it caused a rise of wages and a fall in the profits of     capital while in england inasmuch as capital rather than men     was sent to the continent in the war the very reverse took place     the diversion of “hundreds of millions of capital from productive     employment” caused a fall of wages and the prosperity of the     capitalist class while the permanent productive resources did not     fall off   this leads to the vexed question to which dr chalmers has very particularly adverted whether the funds required by a government for extraordinary unproductive expenditure are best raised by loans the interest only being provided by taxes or whether taxes should be at once laid on to the whole amount which is called in the financial vocabulary raising the whole of the supplies within the year dr chalmers is strongly for the latter method he says the common notion is that in calling for the whole amount in one year you require what is either impossible or very inconvenient that the people can not without great hardship pay the whole at once out of their yearly income and that it is much better to require of them a small payment every year in the shape of interest than so great a sacrifice once for all to which his answer is that the sacrifice is made equally in either case whatever is spent can not but be drawn from yearly income the whole and every part of the wealth produced in the country forms or helps to form the yearly income of somebody the privation which it is supposed must result from taking the amount in the shape of taxes is not avoided by taking it in a loan the suffering is not averted but only thrown upon the laboringclasses the least able and who least ought to bear it while all the inconveniences physical moral and political produced by maintaining taxes for the perpetual payment of the interest are incurred in pure loss whenever capital is withdrawn from production or from the fund destined for production to be lent to the state and expended unproductively that whole sum is withheld from the laboringclasses the loan therefore is in truth paid off the same year the whole of the sacrifice necessary for paying it off is actually made only it is paid to the wrong persons and therefore does not extinguish the claim and paid by the very worst of taxes a tax exclusively on the laboringclass and after having in this most painful and unjust of ways gone through the whole effort necessary for extinguishing the debt the country remains charged with it and with the payment of its interest in perpetuity       the united states for example borrows capital from a with which     it buys stores from b if the loan all comes from within the     country a’s capital is borrowed when the united states should     have taken that amount outright by taxation when the money is     borrowed of a the laborers undergo the sacrifice the title to     the whole sum remains in a’s hands and the claim against the     government by a still exists while if the amount were taken by     taxation the title to the sum raised is in the state and it is     paid to the right person      the experience of the united states during the civil war is an     illustration of this principle it is asserted that as a matter     of fact the total expenses of the war were defrayed by the     northern states during the four years of its continuance out of     surplus earnings and yet at the close of the conflict a debt of     2800000000 was saddled on the country      the united states borrowed   2400000000     revenue during that time      1700000000     total cost of the war        4100000000      in reality we borrowed only about 1500000000 instead of     2400000000 since 1 the government issued paper which     depreciated and yet received it at par in subscriptions for     loans moreover the total cost would have been much reduced had     we issued no paper and 2 thereby not increased the prices of     goods to the state and 3 if no interest account had been     created by borrowing but could the country have raised the whole     sum each year by taxation in the first fiscal year after the war     the united states paid in war taxes 650000000 at the beginning     of the struggle to june 30 1862 the expenditure was     515000000 and by june 30 1863 it had amounted to     1098000000 so that 600000000 of taxes a year would have     paid the war expenses and left us free of debt at the close      a confirmatory experience is that of england during the     continental wars 17931817      total war expenditures                 £1060000000     interest charge on the existing debt      235000000     total amount required                  £1295000000     revenue for that period                 1145000000     deficit                                  £150000000      to provide for this deficit the government actually increased its     debt by £600000000 a slight additional exertion would have     provided £150000000 more of revenue and saved £450000000 to     the taxpayers109   the practical state of the case however seldom exactly corresponds with this supposition the loans of the less wealthy countries are made chiefly with foreign capital which would not perhaps have been brought in to be invested on any less security than that of the government while those of rich and prosperous countries are generally made not with funds withdrawn from productive employment but with the new accumulations constantly making from income and often with a part of them which if not so taken would have migrated to colonies or sought other investments abroad    § 6 demand for commodities is not demand for labor       mr mill’s statement of the theorem respecting capital discussed     in the argument that “demand for commodities is not demand for     labor” needs some simplification for this purpose represent by     the letters of the alphabet a b c  x y z the different     kinds of commodities produced in the world which are exchanged     against each other in the process of reaching the consumers this     exchange of commodities for each other it need hardly be said     does not increase the number or quantity of commodities already in     existence since their production as we have seen requires labor     and capital in connection with natural agents mere exchange does     not alter the quantity of commodities produced      to produce a plow for example the maker must have capital in     the form of subsistence tools and materials of which some one     has foregone the use by a process of saving in order that     something else in this case a plow may be produced this saving     must be accomplished first to an amount sufficient to keep     production going on from day to day this capital is all consumed     but in a longer or shorter term depending on the particular     industrial operation it is reproduced in new forms adapted to the     existing wants of man moreover without any new exertion of     abstinence this amount of capital may be again consumed and     reproduced and so go on forever after once being saved if never     destroyed in the mean while thereby passing out of the category     not only of capital but also of wealth the total capital of the     country then is not the sum of one year’s capital added to that     of another but that of last year reproduced in a new form this     year plus a fractional increase arising from new savings but     once saved capital can go on constantly aiding in production     forever this plow when made is exchanged if a plow is wanted     and the production is properly adjusted to meet desires for such     other products food means for repairing tools etc as give     back to the plowmaker all the commodities consumed in its     manufacture with an increase called profit      returning to our illustration of the alphabet it is evident that     a certain amount of capital united with labor constituting what     may be called a productive engine lies behind the production of a     such as the plow for example and to which its existence is     due the same is true of z suppose that 5000 of z is produced     of which 4000 is enough to reimburse the capital used up by labor     in the operation and that the owner of commodity z spends the     remaining 1000 z in exchange for 1000 of commodity a it is     evident no money being used as yet that this exchange of goods     is regulated entirely by the desires of the two parties to the     transaction no more goods are created simply by the exchange the     simple process of exchange does not keep the laborers engaged on a     occupied and yet the owner of z had a demand for commodity a his     demand was worthless except through the fact of his production     which gave him actual wealth or purchasing power in the form of     z his demand for commodity a was not the thing which employed the     laborers engaged in producing a although the demand if known     beforehand would cause them to produce a rather than some other     article—that is the demand of one quantity of wealth for a     certain thing determines the direction taken by the owner of     capital a but since the exchange is merely the form in which the     demand manifests itself it is clear that the demand does not add     to production and so of itself does not employ labor of course     if there were no desires there would be no demand and so no     production and employment of labor but we may conclude by     formulating the proposition that wealth z offered for     commodities a necessitates the use of other wealth than z as     capital to support the operation by which those commodities a     are produced it makes no difference to the existing employment of     labor what want is supplied by the producers of a whether it is     velvet intended for unproductive consumption or plows intended     for productive consumption even if z is no longer offered in     exchange for a and if then a is no longer to be made the     laborers formerly occupied in producing a—if warning is given of     the coming change if not loss results—having the plant can     produce something else wanted by the owner of z      now into a community as here pictured all laborers supposed to     be occupied and all capital employed in producing a b c  x     y z imagine the coming of a shipwrecked crew instead of     exchanging z for a as before the owner of z may offer his wealth     to the crew to dance for him the essential question is is more     employment offered to labor by this action than the former     exchange for a that is it is a question merely of distribution     of wealth among the members of a community the labor engaged on a     is not thrown out of employment if they have warning there is     no more wealth in existence but it is differently distributed     than before the crew instead of the former owner now have 1000     of z so far as the question of employment is concerned it makes     no difference on what terms the crew got it they might have been     hired to stand in a row and admire the owner of z when he goes     out but yet it may naturally be assumed that the crew were     employed productively in this case after they have consumed the     wealth z they have brought into existence articles in the place     of those they consumed but although this last operation is     economically more desirable for the future growth of wealth yet     no more laborers for the time were employed than if the crew had     merely danced the advantages or disadvantages of productive     consumption are not to be discussed here it is intended however     to establish the proposition that wealth paid out in wages or     advanced to producers itself supports labor that wealth offered     directly to laborers in this way employs more labor than when     merely offered in exchange for other goods or in other words by     a demand for commodities that an increased demand for commodities     does not involve an increased demand for labor since this can     only be created by capital the essential difference is that the     owner of z in one case by exchanging goods for a did not forego     his consuming power in the other case by giving z to the     unemployed crew he actually went through the process of saving by     foregoing his personal consumption and handing it over to the     crew if the crew use it unproductively it is in the end the same     as if the owner of z had done it but meanwhile the additional     laborers were employed if the crew be employed productively then     the saving once made will go on forever as explained above and     the world will be the richer by the wealth this additional capital     can create      it may now be objected that if a is no longer in demand the     laborers in that industry will be thrown out of employment out of     that employment certainly but not out of every other one     thousand of z was able to purchase certain results of labor and     capital in industry a when in the hands of its former owner and     now when in the hands of the crew it will control as purchasing     power equivalent results of labor and capital the crew may not     want the same articles as the former owner of z but they will     want the equivalents of 1000 of z in something and that     something will be produced now instead of a the whole process may     be represented by this diagram      illustration showing interrelationships between a z and crew      1 z is exchanged against a and the crew remain unemployed      2 here the crew possess z and they themselves exchange z for     whatever a may produce in satisfaction of their wants and the     crew are then employed      it is possible that the intervention of money blinds some minds to     a proper understanding of the operations described above the     supposition as given applies to a condition of barter but is     equally true if money is used110 imagine a display of all the     industries of the world a b c  x y z presented within     sight on one large field and at the central spot the producer of     gold and silver when z is produced it is taken to the     goldcounter and exchanged for money when a is produced the     same is done then the former money is given for a and the latter     for z so that in truth a is exchanged against z through the     medium of money just as before money was considered now it may     be said by an objector “if a is not wanted after it is produced     and can not be sold because the demand from z has been withdrawn     then the capital used for a will not be returned and the laborers     in a will be thrown out of employment” the answer is of course     that the state of things here contemplated is a permanent and     normal one wherein production is correctly adapted to human     desires if a is found not to be wanted after the production of     it an industrial blunder has been committed and wealth is wasted     just as when burned up it is illassorted production the trouble     is not in a lack of demand for what a may produce of something     else but with the producers of a in not making that for which     there were desires from ignorance or lack of early information of     the disposition of wealth z in practice however it will be     found that most goods are made upon “orders” and except under     peculiar circumstances not actually produced unless a market is     foreseen indeed as every man knows the most important function     of a successful business man is the adaptation of production to     the market that is to the desires of consumers      one other form of this question needs brief mention it is truly     remarked that a large portion of industrial activity is engaged     today not in supplying productive consumption such as food     shelter and clothing but in supplying the comforts and luxuries     of low and high alike or unproductive consumption now if there     were not a demand for luxuries and comforts many vast industries     would cease to exist and labor would be thrown out of employment     is not a demand for such commodities then a cause of the present     employment of labor no it is not luxuries and comforts are of     course the objects of human wants but a desire alone without     purchasing power can not either buy or produce these commodities     to obtain a piano one must produce goods and this implies the     possession of capital by which to bring into existence goods or     purchasing power to be offered for a piano nor is this     sufficient even after a man a for example offers purchasing     power he will not get a piano unless there exists an accumulation     of unemployed capital together with labor ready to manufacture     the instrument if capital were all previously occupied no piano     could be made although a stood offering an equivalent in valuable     goods it may be said that a himself has the means he has the     wealth and if he is willing to forego the use of this wealth     or in other words save it by devoting it to reproduction in the     piano industry—that is create the capital necessary for the     purpose—then the piano can be made but this shows again that not     a mere desire but the existence of capital is necessary to the     production and so to the employment of labor an increased demand     for commodities therefore does not give additional employment to     labor unless there be capital to support the labor      some important corollaries result from this proposition a     when a country by legislation creates a home demand for     commodities that does not of itself give additional employment to     labor if the goods had before been purchased abroad under free     discretion then if produced at home they must require more     capital and labor or they would not have been brought from     foreign countries if produced at home it would require to     purchase them more of what was formerly sent abroad or some must     do without the legislation can not ipso facto create capital     and only by an increase of capital can more employment result it     is possible however that legislation might cause a more     effective use of existing capital but that must be a question of     fact to be settled by circumstances in each particular case it     is not a thing to be governed by principles      b it follows from the above proposition also that taxes     levied on the rich and paid by a saving from their consumption of     luxuries do not fall on the poor because of a lessened demand for     commodities since as we have seen that demand does not create     or diminish the demand for labor but if the taxes levied on the     rich are paid by savings from what the rich would have expended in     wages then if the government spends the amount of revenue thus     taken in the direct purchase of labor as of soldiers and sailors     the tax does not fall on the laboringclass taken as a whole when     the government takes that wealth which was formerly capital burns     it up or dissipates it in war it ceases to exist any longer as a     means of again producing wealth or of employing labor     chapter v on circulating and fixed capital    § 1 fixed and circulating capital   of the capital engaged in the production of any commodity there is a part which after being once used exists no longer as capital is no longer capable of rendering service to production or at least not the same service nor to the same sort of production such for example is the portion of capital which consists of materials the tallow and alkali of which soap is made once used in the manufacture are destroyed as alkali and tallow in the same division must be placed the portion of capital which is paid as the wages or consumed as the subsistence of laborers that part of the capital of a cottonspinner which he pays away to his workpeople once so paid exists no longer as his capital or as a cottonspinner’s capital capital which in this manner fulfills the whole of its office in the production in which it is engaged by a single use is called circulating capital the term which is not very appropriate is derived from the circumstance that this portion of capital requires to be constantly renewed by the sale of the finished product and when renewed is perpetually parted with in buying materials and paying wages so that it does its work not by being kept but by changing hands  another large portion of capital however consists in instruments of production of a more or less permanent character which produce their effect not by being parted with but by being kept and the efficacy of which is not exhausted by a single use to this class belong buildings machinery and all or most things known by the name of implements or tools the durability of some of these is considerable and their function as productive instruments is prolonged through many repetitions of the productive operation in this class must likewise be included capital sunk as the expression is in permanent improvements of land so also the capital expended once for all in the commencement of an undertaking to prepare the way for subsequent operations the expense of opening a mine for example of cutting canals of making roads or docks other examples might be added but these are sufficient capital which exists in any of these durable shapes and the return to which is spread over a period of corresponding duration is called fixed capital  of fixed capital some kinds require to be occasionally or periodically renewed such are all implements and buildings they require at intervals partial renewal by means of repairs and are at last entirely worn out in other cases the capital does not unless as a consequence of some unusual accident require entire renewal a dock or a canal once made does not require like a machine to be made again unless purposely destroyed the most permanent of all kinds of fixed capital is that employed in giving increased productiveness to a natural agent such as land  to return to the theoretical distinction between fixed and circulating capital since all wealth which is destined to be employed for reproduction comes within the designation of capital there are parts of capital which do not agree with the definition of either species of it for instance the stock of finished goods which a manufacturer or dealer at any time possesses unsold in his warehouses but this though capital as to its destination is not yet capital in actual exercise it is not engaged in production but has first to be sold or exchanged that is converted into an equivalent value of some other commodities and therefore is not yet either fixed or circulating capital but will become either one or the other or be eventually divided between them    § 2 increase of fixed capital when at the expense of circulating might be detrimental to the laborers   there is a great difference between the effects of circulating and those of fixed capital on the amount of the gross produce of the country circulating capital being destroyed as such the result of a single use must be a reproduction equal to the whole amount of the circulating capital used and a profit besides this however is by no means necessary in the case of fixed capital since machinery for example is not wholly consumed by one use it is not necessary that it should be wholly replaced from the product of that use the machine answers the purpose of its owner if it brings in during each interval of time enough to cover the expense of repairs and the deterioration in value which the machine has sustained during the same time with a surplus sufficient to yield the ordinary profit on the entire value of the machine  from this it follows that all increase of fixed capital when taking place at the expense of circulating must be at least temporarily prejudicial to the interests of the laborers this is true not of machinery alone but of all improvements by which capital is sunk that is rendered permanently incapable of being applied to the maintenance and remuneration of labor       it is highly probable that in the twentyfive years preceding the     panic of 1873 owing to the progress of invention those     industries in the united states employing much machinery were     unduly stimulated in comparison with other industries and that     the readjustment was a slow and painful process after the     collapse vast numbers left the manufacturing to enter the     extractive industries   the argument relied on by most of those who contend that machinery can never be injurious to the laboringclass is that by cheapening production it creates such an increased demand for the commodity as enables ere long a greater number of persons than ever to find employment in producing it the argument does not seem to me to have the weight commonly ascribed to it the fact though too broadly stated is no doubt often true the copyists who were thrown out of employment by the invention of printing were doubtless soon outnumbered by the compositors and pressmen who took their place and the number of laboring persons now employed in the cotton manufacture is many times greater than were so occupied previously to the inventions of hargreaves and arkwright which shows that besides the enormous fixed capital now embarked in the manufacture it also employs a far larger circulating capital than at any former time but if this capital was drawn from other employments if the funds which took the place of the capital sunk in costly machinery were supplied not by any additional saving consequent on the improvements but by drafts on the general capital of the community what better are the laboringclasses for the mere transfer       there is a machine used for sizing the cotton yarn to prepare it     for weaving by which it is dried over a steam cylinder the wages     for attendance on which were only two dollars per day as compared     with an expenditure for labor of fourteen dollars per day to     accomplish the same ends before the machine was invented   all attempts to make out that the laboringclasses as a collective body can not suffer temporarily by the introduction of machinery or by the sinking of capital in permanent improvements are i conceive necessarily fallacious111 that they would suffer in the particular department of industry to which the change applies is generally admitted and obvious to common sense but it is often said that though employment is withdrawn from labor in one department an exactly equivalent employment is opened for it in others because what the consumers save in the increased cheapness of one particular article enables them to augment their consumption of others thereby increasing the demand for other kinds of labor this is plausible but as was shown in the last chapter involves a fallacy demand for commodities being a totally different thing from demand for labor it is true the consumers have now additional means of buying other things but this will not create the other things unless there is capital to produce them and the improvement has not set at liberty any capital even if it has not absorbed some from other employments       if the improvement has lowered the cost of production it has     often required less capital as well as less labor to produce the     same quantity of goods or what is the same thing an increased     product with the same capital    § 3 —this seldom if ever occurs   nevertheless i do not believe that as things are actually transacted improvements in production are often if ever injurious even temporarily to the laboringclasses in the aggregate they would be so if they took place suddenly to a great amount because much of the capital sunk must necessarily in that case be provided from funds already employed as circulating capital but improvements are always introduced very gradually and are seldom or never made by withdrawing circulating capital from actual production but are made by the employment of the annual increase i doubt if there would be found a single example of a great increase of fixed capital at a time and place where circulating capital was not rapidly increasing likewise       in the united states while the cost per yard of the manufactured     goods has decreased and so made accessible to poorer classes than     before the capital engaged in manufactures has increased so as to     allow a vastly greater number of persons to be employed as will     be seen by the following comparison of 1860 with 1880 taken from     the last census returns compendium 1880 pp 928 930          number of         capital        average     total amount        establishments   thousands   number of   paid in                                         hands       wages during                                         employed   the year 1860           140433     1009855   1311246   378878966 1880           253852      2790272   2732595    947953795       “a hundred years ago one person in every family of five or six     must have been absolutely needed to spin and weave by hand the     fabrics required for the scanty clothing of the people now one     person in two hundred or two hundred and fifty only need work in     the factory to produce the cotton and woolen fabrics of the most     amply clothed nation of the world”112   to these considerations must be added that even if improvements did for a time decrease the aggregate produce and the circulating capital of the community they would not the less tend in the long run to augment both this tendency of improvements in production to cause increased accumulation and thereby ultimately to increase the gross produce even if temporarily diminishing it will assume a still more decided character if it should appear that there are assignable limits both to the accumulation of capital and to the increase of production from the land which limits once attained all further increase of produce must stop but that improvements in production whatever may be their other effects tend to throw one or both of these limits farther off now these are truths which will appear in the clearest light in a subsequent stage of our investigation it will be seen that the quantity of capital which will or even which can be accumulated in any country and the amount of gross produce which will or even which can be raised bear a proportion to the state of the arts of production there existing and that every improvement even if for the time it diminish the circulating capital and the gross produce ultimately makes room for a larger amount of both than could possibly have existed otherwise it is this which is the conclusive answer to the objections against machinery and the proof thence arising of the ultimate benefit to laborers of mechanical inventions even in the existing state of society will hereafter be seen to be conclusive113     chapter vi of causes affecting the efficiency of production    § 1 general causes of superior productiveness   the most evident cause of superior productiveness is what are called natural advantages these are various fertility of soil is one of the principal the influence of climate is another advantage and consists in lessening the physical requirements of the producers       in spinning very fine cotton thread england’s natural climate     gives in some parts of the country such advantages in proper     moisture and electric conditions that the operation can be carried     on outofdoors while in the united states it is generally     necessary to create an artificial atmosphere in ordinary spinning     in our country more is accomplished when the wind is in one     quarter than in another the dry northwest wind in new england     reduces the amount of product while the dry northeast wind in     england has a similar effect and it is said has practically     driven the cottonspinners from manchester to oldham where the     climate is more equably moist the full reasons for these facts     are not yet ascertained      experts in the woolen industry also explain that the quality and     fiber of wool depend upon the soil and climate where the sheep are     pastured when ohio sheep are transferred to texas in a few years     their wool loses the distinctive quality it formerly possessed     and takes on a new character belonging to the breeds of texas the     wool produced by one set of climatic conditions is quite different     from that of another set and is used by the manufacturers for     different purposes   in hot regions mankind can exist in comfort with less perfect housing less clothing fuel that absolute necessary of life in cold climates they can almost dispense with except for industrial uses they also require less aliment among natural advantages besides soil and climate must be mentioned abundance of mineral productions in convenient situations and capable of being worked with moderate labor such are the coalfields of great britain which do so much to compensate its inhabitants for the disadvantages of climate and the scarcely inferior resource possessed by this country and the united states in a copious supply of an easily reduced ironore at no great depth below the earth’s surface and in close proximity to coaldeposits available for working it but perhaps a greater advantage than all these is a maritime situation especially when accompanied with good natural harbors and next to it great navigable rivers these advantages consist indeed wholly in saving of cost of carriage but few who have not considered the subject have any adequate notion how great an extent of economical advantage this comprises  as the second of the general causes of superior productiveness we may rank the greater energy of labor by this is not to be understood occasional but regular and habitual energy the third element which determines the productiveness of the labor of a community is the skill and knowledge therein existing whether it be the skill and knowledge of the laborers themselves or of those who direct their labor that the productiveness of the labor of a people is limited by their knowledge of the arts of life is selfevident and that any progress in those arts any improved application of the objects or powers of nature to industrial uses enables the same quantity and intensity of labor to raise a greater produce one principal department of these improvements consists in the invention and use of tools and machinery114  the deficiency of practical good sense which renders the majority of the laboringclass such bad calculators—which makes for instance their domestic economy so improvident lax and irregular—must disqualify them for any but a low grade of intelligent labor and render their industry far less productive than with equal energy it otherwise might be the moral qualities of the laborers are fully as important to the efficiency and worth of their labor as the intellectual independently of the effects of intemperance upon their bodily and mental faculties and of flighty unsteady habits upon the energy and continuity of their work points so easily understood as not to require being insisted upon it is well worthy of meditation how much of the aggregate effect of their labor depends on their trustworthiness  among the secondary causes which determine the productiveness of productive agents the most important is security by security i mean the completeness of the protection which society affords to its members    § 2 combination and division of labor increase productiveness   in the enumeration of the circumstances which promote the productiveness of labor we have left one untouched which is cooperation or the combined action of numbers of this great aid to production a single department known by the name of division of labor has engaged a large share of the attention of political economists most deservedly indeed but to the exclusion of other cases and exemplifications of the same comprehensive law in the lifting of heavy weights for example in the felling of trees in the sawing of timber in the gathering of much hay or corn during a short period of fine weather in draining a large extent of land during the short season when such a work may be properly conducted in the pulling of ropes on board ship in the rowing of large boats in some mining operations in the erection of a scaffolding for building and in the breaking of stones for the repair of a road so that the whole of the road shall always be kept in good order in all these simple operations and thousands more it is absolutely necessary that many persons should work together at the same time in the same place and in the same way but in the present state of society the breeding and feeding of sheep is the occupation of one set of people dressing the wool to prepare it for the spinner is that of another spinning it into thread of a third weaving the thread into broadcloth of a fourth dyeing the cloth of a fifth making it into a coat of a sixth without counting the multitude of carriers merchants factors and retailers put in requisition at the successive stages of this progress  without some separation of employments very few things would be produced at all suppose a set of persons or a number of families all employed precisely in the same manner each family settled on a piece of its own land on which it grows by its labor the food required for its own sustenance and as there are no persons to buy any surplus produce where all are producers each family has to produce within itself whatever other articles it consumes in such circumstances if the soil was tolerably fertile and population did not tread too closely on the heels of subsistence there would be no doubt some kind of domestic manufactures clothing for the family might perhaps be spun and woven within it by the labor probably of the women a first step in the separation of employments and a dwelling of some sort would be erected and kept in repair by their united labor but beyond simple food precarious too from the variations of the seasons coarse clothing and very imperfect lodging it would be scarcely possible that the family should produce anything more  suppose that a company of artificers provided with tools and with food sufficient to maintain them for a year arrive in the country and establish themselves in the midst of the population these new settlers occupy themselves in producing articles of use or ornament adapted to the taste of a simple people and before their food is exhausted they have produced these in considerable quantity and are ready to exchange them for more food the economical position of the landed population is now most materially altered they have an opportunity given them of acquiring comforts and luxuries things which while they depended solely upon their own labor they never could have obtained because they could not have produced are now accessible to them if they can succeed in producing an additional quantity of food and necessaries they are thus incited to increase the productiveness of their industry the new settlers constitute what is called a market for surplus agricultural produce and their arrival has enriched the settlement not only by the manufactured articles which they produce but by the food which would not have been produced unless they had been there to consume it  there is no inconsistency between this doctrine and the proposition we before maintained115 that a market for commodities does not constitute employment for labor the labor of the agriculturists was already provided with employment they are not indebted to the demand of the newcomers for being able to maintain themselves what that demand does for them is to call their labor into increased vigor and efficiency to stimulate them by new motives to new exertions  from these considerations it appears that a country will seldom have a productive agriculture unless it has a large town population or the only available substitute a large export trade in agricultural produce to supply a population elsewhere i use the phrase “town population” for shortness to imply a population nonagricultural  it is found that the productive power of labor is increased by carrying the separation further and further by breaking down more and more every process of industry into parts so that each laborer shall confine himself to an ever smaller number of simple operations and thus in time arise those remarkable cases of what is called the division of labor with which all readers on subjects of this nature are familiar adam smith’s illustration from pinmaking though so well known is so much to the point that i will venture once more to transcribe it “the business of making a pin is divided into about eighteen distinct operations one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper i have seen a small manufactory where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day there are in a pound upward of four thousand pins of a middling size those ten persons therefore could make among them upward of fortyeight thousand pins in a day each person therefore making a tenth part of fortyeight thousand pins might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day but if they had all wrought separately and independently and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business they certainly could not each of them have made twenty perhaps not one pin in a day”    § 3 advantages of division of labor   the causes of the increased efficiency given to labor by the division of employments are some of them too familiar to require specification but it is worth while to attempt a complete enumeration of them by adam smith they are reduced to three “first the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many”  1 of these the increase of dexterity of the individual workman is the most obvious and universal it does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener it will be done better that depends on the intelligence of the workman and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands but it will be done more easily this is as true of mental operations as of bodily even a child after much practice sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition the act of speaking any language of reading fluently of playing music at sight are cases as remarkable as they are familiar among bodily acts dancing gymnastic exercises ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition in simpler manual operations the effect is of course still sooner produced  2 the second advantage enumerated by adam smith as arising from the division of labor is one on which i can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves to do full justice to his opinion i will quote his own exposition of it “it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less it is even in this case however very considerable a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another” i am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight but i think there are counterconsiderations which are overlooked if one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy it is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations than if confined during the whole time to one116 different occupations employ different muscles or different energies of the mind some of which rest and are refreshed while others work bodily labor itself rests from mental and conversely the variety itself has an invigorating effect on what for want of a more philosophical appellation we must term the animal spirits—so important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical and not unimportant even to that  3 the third advantage attributed by adam smith to the division of labor is to a certain extent real inventions tending to save labor in a particular operation are more likely to occur to any one in proportion as his thoughts are intensely directed to that occupation and continually employed upon it       this also can not be wholly true “the founder of the cotton     manufacture was a barber the inventor of the powerloom was a     clergyman a farmer devised the application of the     screwpropeller a fancygoods shopkeeper is one of the most     enterprising experimentalists in agriculture the most remarkable     architectural design of our day has been furnished by a gardener     the first person who supplied london with water was a goldsmith     the first extensive maker of english roads was a blind man bred     to no trade the father of english inland navigation was a duke     and his engineer was a millwright the first great builder of iron     bridges was a stonemason and the greatest railway engineer     commenced his life as a colliery engineer”117   4 the greatest advantage next to the dexterity of the workmen derived from the minute division of labor which takes place in modern manufacturing industry is one not mentioned by adam smith but to which attention has been drawn by mr babbage the more economical distribution of labor by classing the workpeople according to their capacity different parts of the same series of operations require unequal degrees of skill and bodily strength and those who have skill enough for the most difficult or strength enough for the hardest parts of the labor are made much more useful by being employed solely in them the operations which everybody is capable of being left to those who are fit for no others  the division of labor as all writers on the subject have remarked is limited by the extent of the market if by the separation of pinmaking into ten distinct employments fortyeight thousand pins can be made in a day this separation will only be advisable if the number of accessible consumers is such as to require every day something like fortyeight thousand pins if there is only a demand for twentyfour thousand the division of labor can only be advantageously carried to the extent which will every day produce that smaller number the increase of the general riches of the world when accompanied with freedom of commercial intercourse improvements in navigation and inland communication by roads canals or railways tends to give increased productiveness to the labor of every nation in particular by enabling each locality to supply with its special products so much larger a market that a great extension of the division of labor in their production is an ordinary consequence the division of labor is also limited in many cases by the nature of the employment agriculture for example is not susceptible of so great a division of occupations as many branches of manufactures because its different operations can not possibly be simultaneous       5 “in the examples given above the advantage obtained was     derived from the mere fact of the separation of employments     altogether independently of the mode in which the separated     employments were distributed among the persons carrying them on     as well as of the places in which they were conducted but a     further gain arises when the employments are of a kind which in     order to their effective performance call for special capacities     in the workman or special natural resources in the scene of     operation there would be a manifest waste of special power in     compelling to a mere mechanical or routine pursuit a man who is     fitted to excel in a professional career and similarly if a     branch of industry were established on some site which offered     greater facilities to an industry of another sort a waste     analogous in character would be incurred in a word while a     great number of the occupations in which men engage are such as     with proper preparation for them might equally well be carried on     by any of those engaged in them or in any of the localities in     which they are respectively established there are others which     demand for their effective performance special personal     qualifications and special local conditions and the general     effectiveness of productive industry will other things being     equal be proportioned to the completeness with which the     adaptation is accomplished between occupation on the one hand and     individuals and localities on the other”118    § 4 production on a large and production on a small scale   whenever it is essential to the greatest efficiency of labor that many laborers should combine the scale of the enterprise must be such as to bring many laborers together and the capital must be large enough to maintain them still more needful is this when the nature of the employment allows and the extent of the possible market encourages a considerable division of labor the larger the enterprise the further the division of labor may be carried this is one of the principal causes of large manufactories every increase of business would enable the whole to be carried on with a proportionally smaller amount of labor  as a general rule the expenses of a business do not increase by any means proportionally to the quantity of business let us take as an example a set of operations which we are accustomed to see carried on by one great establishment that of the postoffice suppose that the business let us say only of the letterpost instead of being centralized in a single concern were divided among five or six competing companies each of these would be obliged to maintain almost as large an establishment as is now sufficient for the whole since each must arrange for receiving and delivering letters in all parts of the town each must send lettercarriers into every street and almost every alley and this too as many times in the day as is now done by the postoffice if the service is to be as well performed each must have an office for receiving letters in every neighborhood with all subsidiary arrangements for collecting the letters from the different offices and redistributing them to this must be added the much greater number of superior officers who would be required to check and control the subordinates implying not only a greater cost in salaries for such responsible officers but the necessity perhaps of being satisfied in many instances with an inferior standard of qualification and so failing in the object  whether or not the advantages obtained by operating on a large scale preponderate in any particular case over the more watchful attention and greater regard to minor gains and losses usually found in small establishments can be ascertained in a state of free competition by an unfailing test wherever there are large and small establishments in the same business that one of the two which in existing circumstances carries on the production at greatest advantage will be able to undersell the other the power of permanently underselling can only generally speaking be derived from increased effectiveness of labor and this when obtained by a more extended division of employment or by a classification tending to a better economy of skill always implies a greater produce from the same labor and not merely the same produce from less labor it increases not the surplus only but the gross produce of industry if an increased quantity of the particular article is not required and part of the laborers in consequence lose their employment the capital which maintained and employed them is also set at liberty and the general produce of the country is increased by some other application of their labor  a considerable part of the saving of labor effected by substituting the large system of production for the small is the saving in the labor of the capitalists themselves if a hundred producers with small capitals carry on separately the same business the superintendence of each concern will probably require the whole attention of the person conducting it sufficiently at least to hinder his time or thoughts from being disposable for anything else while a single manufacturer possessing a capital equal to the sum of theirs with ten or a dozen clerks could conduct the whole of their amount of business and have leisure too for other occupations  production on a large scale is greatly promoted by the practice of forming a large capital by the combination of many small contributions or in other words by the formation of stock companies the advantages of the principle are important since 1 many undertakings require an amount of capital beyond the means of the richest individual or private partnership of course the government can alone be looked to for any of those works for which a great combination of means is requisite because it can obtain those means by compulsory taxation and is already accustomed to the conduct of large operations for reasons however which are tolerably well known government agency for the conduct of industrial operations is generally one of the least eligible of resources when any other is available of the advantages referred to above one of the most important is 2 that which relates to the intellectual and active qualifications of the directing head the stimulus of individual interest is some security for exertion but exertion is of little avail if the intelligence exerted is of an inferior order which it must necessarily be in the majority of concerns carried on by the persons chiefly interested in them where the concern is large and can afford a remuneration sufficient to attract a class of candidates superior to the common average it is possible to select for the general management and for all the skilled employments of a subordinate kind persons of a degree of acquirement and cultivated intelligence which more than compensates for their inferior interest in the result it must be further remarked that it is not a necessary consequence of jointstock management that the persons employed whether in superior or in subordinate offices should be paid wholly by fixed salaries in the case of the managers of jointstock companies and of the superintending and controlling officers in many private establishments it is a common enough practice to connect their pecuniary interest with the interest of their employers by giving them part of their remuneration in the form of a percentage on the profits  the possibility of substituting the large system of production for the small depends of course in the first place on the extent of the market the large system can only be advantageous when a large amount of business is to be done it implies therefore either a populous and flourishing community or a great opening for exportation  in the countries in which there are the largest markets the widest diffusion of commercial confidence and enterprise the greatest annual increase of capital and the greatest number of large capitals owned by individuals there is a tendency to substitute more and more in one branch of industry after another large establishments for small ones these are almost always able to undersell the smaller tradesmen partly it is understood by means of division of labor and the economy occasioned by limiting the employment of skilled agency to cases where skill is required and partly no doubt by the saving of labor arising from the great scale of the transactions as it costs no more time and not much more exertion of mind to make a large purchase for example than a small one and very much less than to make a number of small ones with a view merely to production and to the greatest efficiency of labor this change is wholly beneficial       a single large company very often instead of being a monopoly is     generally better than two large companies for there is little     likelihood of competition and lower prices when the competitors     are so few as to be able to agree not to compete as mr mill says     in regard to parallel railroads “no one can desire to see the     enormous waste of capital and land not to speak of increased     nuisance involved in the construction of a second railway to     connect the same places already united by an existing one while     the two would not do the work better than it could be done by one     and after a short time would probably be amalgamated” the actual     tendency of charges to diminish on the railways before the matter     of parallel railways was suggested is clearly seen by reference to     chart v p 137     chapter vii of the law of the increase of labor    § 1 the law of the increase of production depends on those of three elements—labor capital and land   production is not a fixed but an increasing thing when not kept back by bad institutions or a low state of the arts of life the produce of industry has usually tended to increase stimulated not only by the desire of the producers to augment their means of consumption but by the increasing number of the consumers  we have seen that the essential requisites of production are three—labor capital and natural agents the term capital including all external and physical requisites which are products of labor the term natural agents all those which are not the increase of production therefore depends on the properties of these elements it is a result of the increase either of the elements themselves or of their productiveness we proceed to consider the three elements successively with reference to this effect or in other words the law of the increase of production viewed in respect of its dependence first on labor secondly on capital and lastly on land    § 2 the law of population   the increase of labor is the increase of mankind of population the power of multiplication inherent in all organic life may be regarded as infinite there are many species of vegetables of which a single plant will produce in one year the germs of a thousand if only two come to maturity in fourteen years the two will have multiplied to sixteen thousand and more it is but a moderate case of fecundity in animals to be capable of quadrupling their numbers in a single year if they only do as much in half a century ten thousand will have swelled within two centuries to upward to two millions and a half the capacity of increase is necessarily in a geometrical progression the numerical ratio alone is different  to this property of organized beings the human species forms no exception its power of increase is indefinite and the actual multiplication would be extraordinarily rapid if the power were exercised to the utmost it never is exercised to the utmost and yet in the most favorable circumstances known to exist which are those of a fertile region colonized from an industrious and civilized community population has continued for several generations independently of fresh immigration to double itself in not much more than twenty years       years   population   food     25          11 mills       x     25          22 mills      2x     25          44 mills      3x     25          88 mills      4x     25         176 mills      5x      by this table it will be seen that if population can double itself     in twentyfive years and if food can only be increased by as much     as x the subsistence of eleven millions by additional     application of another equal quantity of labor on the same land in     each period then at the end of one hundred years there would be     the disproportion of one hundred and seventysix millions of     people with subsistence for only fiftyfive millions of course     this is prevented either by checking population to the amount of     the subsistence by sending off the surplus population or by     bringing in food from new lands      in the united states to 1860 population has doubled itself about     every twenty years while in france there is practically no     increase of population it is stated that the white population of     the united states between 1790 and 1840 increased 4004 per cent     deducting immigration the extraordinary advance of population     with us where subsistence is easily attainable is to be seen in     the chart on the next page no iii which shows the striking     rapidity of increase in the united states when compared with the     older countries of europe the steady demand for land can be seen     by the gradual westward movement of the center of population as     seen in chart no iv p 116 and by the rapid settlement of the     distant parts of our country as shown by the two charts     frontispieces which represent to the eye by heavier colors the     areas of the more densely settled districts in 1830 and in 1880                                illustration         chart iii population of european countries xixth century    § 3 by what checks the increase of population is practically limited   the obstacle to a just understanding of the subject arises from too confused a notion of the causes which at most times and places keep the actual increase of mankind so far behind the capacity  the conduct of human creatures is more or less influenced by foresight of consequences and by some impulses superior to mere animal instincts and they do not therefore propagate like swine but are capable though in very unequal degrees of being withheld by prudence or by the social affections from giving existence to beings born only to misery and premature death       malthus found an explanation of the anomaly that in the swiss     villages with the longest average duration of life there were     the fewest births by noting that no one married until a     cowherd’s cottage became vacant and precisely because the     tenants lived so long were the newcomers long kept out of a     place   in proportion as mankind rise above the condition of the beast population is restrained by the fear of want rather than by want itself even where there is no question of starvation many are similarly acted upon by the apprehension of losing what have come to be regarded as the decencies of their situation in life among the middle classes in many individual instances there is an additional restraint exercised from the desire of doing more than maintaining their circumstances—of improving them but such a desire is rarely found or rarely has that effect in the laboringclasses if they can bring up a family as they were themselves brought up even the prudent among them are usually satisfied too often they do not think even of that but rely on fortune or on the resources to be found in legal or voluntary charity                               illustration             chart iv westward movement of center of population       this in effect is the wellknown malthusian doctrine the     thorough reader will also consult the original “essay” of malthus     mr bowen119 and other writers oppose it saying it has “no     relation to the times in which we live or to any which are near     at hand” he thinks the productive power of the whole world     prevents the necessity of considering the pressure of population     upon subsistence as an actuality now or in the future this     however does not deny the existence of malthus’s principles but     opposes them only on the methods of their action mr     rickards120 holds that man’s food—as eg wheat—has the power     to increase geometrically faster than man but he omits to     consider that for the growth of this food land is demanded that     land is not capable of such geometrical increase and that without     it the food can not be grown of course any extension of the land     area as happened when england abolished the corn laws and drew     her food from our prairies removes the previous pressure of     population on subsistence no believer in the malthusian doctrine     is so absurd as to hold that the growth of population actually     exceeds subsistence but that there is a “constant tendency in     all animated life to increase beyond the nourishment prepared for     it” no one can possibly doubt this is not inconsistent with the     fact that subsistence has at any time increased faster than     population it is as if a block of wood on the floor were acted on     by two opposing forces one tending to move it forward one     backward if it moves backward that does not prove the absence of     any force working to move it forward but only that the other     force is the stronger of the two and that the final motion is the     resultant of the two forces it is only nearsighted     generalization to say that since the block moves forward there is     therefore no opposing force to its advance121 mr doubleday     maintains that as people become better fed they become     unprolific mr mill’s answer referring to the large families of     the english peerage is unfortunate122 in sweden the increase     of the peasantry is six times that of the middle classes and     fourteen times that of the nobility the diminishing fertility of     new england families gives a truer explanation when it is seen     that with the progress in material wealth later marriages are the     rule when newenglanders emigrate to the western states where     labor is in demand and where it is less burdensome to have large     families there is no question as to their fertility123   1 in a very backward state of society like that of europe in the middle ages and many parts of asia at present population is kept down by actual starvation the starvation does not take place in ordinary years but in seasons of scarcity which in those states of society are much more frequent and more extreme than europe is now accustomed to 2 in a more improved state few even among the poorest of the people are limited to actual necessaries and to a bare sufficiency of those and the increase is kept within bounds not by excess of deaths but by limitation of births124 the limitation is brought about in various ways in some countries it is the result of prudent or conscientious selfrestraint there is a condition to which the laboringpeople are habituated they perceive that by having too numerous families they must sink below that condition or fail to transmit it to their children and this they do not choose to submit to  there are other cases in which the prudence and forethought which perhaps might not be exercised by the people themselves are exercised by the state for their benefit marriage not being permitted until the contracting parties can show that they have the prospect of a comfortable support there are places again in which the restraining cause seems to be not so much individual prudence as some general and perhaps even accidental habit of the country in the rural districts of england during the last century the growth of population was very effectually repressed by the difficulty of obtaining a cottage to live in it was the custom for unmarried laborers to lodge and board with their employers it was the custom for married laborers to have a cottage and the rule of the english poorlaws by which a parish was charged with the support of its unemployed poor rendered landowners averse to promote marriage about the end of the century the great demand for men in war and manufactures made it be thought a patriotic thing to encourage population and about the same time the growing inclination of farmers to live like rich people favored as it was by a long period of high prices made them desirous of keeping inferiors at a greater distance and pecuniary motives arising from abuses of the poorlaws being superadded they gradually drove their laborers into cottages which the landowners now no longer refused permission to build  it is but rarely that improvements in the condition of the laboringclasses do anything more than give a temporary margin speedily filled up by an increase of their numbers unless either by their general improvement in intellectual and moral culture or at least by raising their habitual standard of comfortable living they can be taught to make a better use of favorable circumstances nothing permanent can be done for them the most promising schemes end only in having a more numerous but not a happier people there is no doubt that the standard is gradually though slowly rising in the more advanced countries of western europe125 subsistence and employment in england have never increased more rapidly than in the last forty years but every census since 1821 showed a smaller proportional increase of population than that of the period preceding and the produce of french agriculture and industry is increasing in a progressive ratio while the population exhibits in every quinquennial census a smaller proportion of births to the population       this brings forward the near connection between landtenures and     population france is preeminently a country of small holdings     and it is undoubtedly true that the system has checked the     thoughtless increase of numbers on his few hectares the french     peasant sees in the size of his farm and the amount of its produce     the limit of subsistence for himself and his family as in no     other way does he see beforehand the results of any lack of food     from his lack of prudence126 from 1790 to 1815 the average     yearly increase of population was 120000 from 1815 to 1846 the     golden age of french agriculture 200000 from 1846 to 1856 when     agriculture was not prosperous 60000 from 1856 to 1880 the     increase has been not more than 36000 yearly in france the     question shapes itself to the peasant proprietor how many can be     subsisted by the amount of produce not on an unlimited area of     land in other parts of the world but on this particular property     of a small size while in england there are ten births to six     deaths in france there are about ten births to every nine     deaths127 in no country has the doctrine of malthus been more     attacked than in france and yet in no other country has there     been a more marked obedience to its principles in actual practice     since the french are practically not at all an emigrating people     population has strictly adapted itself to subsistence for the     relative increase of population in france and the united states     see also the movement of lines indicating the increase of     population in chart no iii p 114     chapter viii of the law of the increase of capital    § 1 means for saving in the surplus above necessaries   the requisites of production being labor capital and land it has been seen from the preceding chapter that the impediments to the increase of production do not arise from the first of these elements but production has other requisites and of these the one which we shall next consider is capital there can not be more people in any country or in the world than can be supported from the produce of past labor until that of present labor comes in although it is not to be supposed that capital consists wholly of food we have next therefore to inquire into the conditions of the increase of capital the causes by which the rapidity of its increase is determined and the necessary limitations of that increase  since all capital is the product of saving that is of abstinence from present consumption for the sake of a future good the increase of capital must depend upon two things—the amount of the fund from which saving can be made and the strength of the dispositions which prompt to it  1 the fund from which saving can be made is the surplus of the produce of labor after supplying the necessaries of life to all concerned in the production including those employed in replacing the materials and keeping the fixed capital in repair more than this surplus can not be saved under any circumstances as much as this though it never is saved always might be this surplus is the fund from which the enjoyments as distinguished from the necessaries of the producers are provided it is the fund from which all are subsisted who are not themselves engaged in production and from which all additions are made to capital the capital of the employer forms the revenue of the laborers and if this exceeds the necessaries of life it gives them a surplus which they may either expend in enjoyments or save       it is evident that the whole unproductive consumption of the     laborer can be saved when it is considered how enormous a sum is     spent by the workingclasses in drink alone and also in the great     reserves of the tradesunions collected for purposes of strikes     it is indisputable that the laborers have the margin from which     savings can be made and by which they themselves may become     capitalists the great accumulations in the savingsbanks by small     depositors in the united states also show somewhat how much is     actually saved in 18821883 there were 2876438 persons who had     deposited in the savingsbanks of the united states     1024856787 with an average to each depositor of 35629 the     unproductive consumption however of all classes—not merely that     of the workingmen—is the possible fund which may be saved that     being the amount which can be saved how much will be saved     depends on the strength of the desire to save   the greater the produce of labor after supporting the laborers the more there is which can be saved the same thing also partly contributes to determine how much will be saved a part of the motive to saving consists in the prospect of deriving an income from savings in the fact that capital employed in production is capable of not only reproducing itself but yielding an increase the greater the profit that can be made from capital the stronger is the motive to its accumulation    § 2 motive for saving in the surplus above necessaries   but the disposition to save does not wholly depend on the external inducement to it on the amount of profit to be made from savings with the same pecuniary inducement the inclination is very different in different persons and in different communities  2 all accumulation involves the sacrifice of a present for the sake of a future good       this is the fundamental motive underlying the effective desire of     accumulation and is far more important than any other it is in     short the test of civilization in order to induce the     laboringclasses to improve their condition and save capital it     is absolutely necessary to excite in them by education or     religion a belief in a future gain greater than the present     sacrifice it is to be sure the whole problem of creating     character and belongs to sociology and ethics rather than to     political economy   in weighing the future against the present the uncertainty of all things future is a leading element and that uncertainty is of very different degrees “all circumstances” therefore “increasing the probability of the provision we make for futurity being enjoyed by ourselves or others tend” justly and reasonably “to give strength to the effective desire of accumulation thus a healthy climate or occupation by increasing the probability of life has a tendency to add to this desire when engaged in safe occupations and living in healthy countries men are much more apt to be frugal than in unhealthy or hazardous occupations and in climates pernicious to human life sailors and soldiers are prodigals in the west indies new orleans the east indies the expenditure of the inhabitants is profuse the same people coming to reside in the healthy parts of europe and not getting into the vortex of extravagant fashion live economically war and pestilence have always waste and luxury among the other evils that follow in their train for similar reasons whatever gives security to the affairs of the community is favorable to the strength of this principle in this respect the general prevalence of law and order and the prospect of the continuance of peace and tranquillity have considerable influence”128       it is asserted that the prevalence of homicide in certain parts of     the united states has had a vital influence in retarding the     material growth of those sections the southern states have     received but a very small fraction from ten to thirteen per cent     of foreign immigration “a country where law and order prevail to     perfection may find its material prosperity checked by a deadly     and fatal climate or on the other hand a people may destroy all     the advantages accruing from matchless natural resources and     climate by persistent disregard of life and property a rather     startling confirmation of this economic truth is afforded by the     fact that homicide has been as destructive of life in the south as     yellow fever although there have been forty thousand deaths from     yellow fever since the war the deaths from homicide for the same     period have been even greater”129 the influence of the old     slave régime and its still existing influences in checking     foreign immigration into the south can be seen by the colored     chart no viii showing the relative density of foreignborn     inhabitants in the several parts of the united states the deeper     color shows the greater foreignborn population   the more perfect the security the greater will be the effective strength of the desire of accumulation where property is less safe or the vicissitudes ruinous to fortunes are more frequent and severe fewer persons will save at all and of those who do many will require the inducement of a higher rate of profit on capital to make them prefer a doubtful future to the temptation of present enjoyment  in the circumstances for example of a hunting tribe “man may be said to be necessarily improvident and regardless of futurity because in this state the future presents nothing which can be with certainty either foreseen or governed besides a want of the motives exciting to provide for the needs of futurity through means of the abilities of the present there is a want of the habits of perception and action leading to a constant connection in the mind of those distant points and of the series of events serving to unite them even therefore if motives be awakened capable of producing the exertion necessary to effect this connection there remains the task of training the mind to think and act so as to establish it”    § 3 examples of deficiency in the strength of this desire   for instance “upon the banks of the st lawrence there are several little indian villages the cleared land is rarely i may almost say never cultivated nor are any inroads made in the forest for such a purpose the soil is nevertheless fertile and were it not manure lies in heaps by their houses were every family to inclose half an acre of ground till it and plant it in potatoes and maize it would yield a sufficiency to support them one half the year they suffer too every now and then extreme want insomuch that joined to occasional intemperance it is rapidly reducing their numbers this to us so strange apathy proceeds not in any great degree from repugnance to labor on the contrary they apply very diligently to it when its reward is immediate it is evidently not the necessary labor that is the obstacle to more extended culture but the distant return from that labor i am assured indeed that among some of the more remote tribes the labor thus expended much exceeds that given by the whites on the indian succeeding years are too distant to make sufficient impression though to obtain what labor may bring about in the course of a few months he toils even more assiduously than the white man”  this view of things is confirmed by the experience of the jesuits in their interesting efforts to civilize the indians of paraguay the real difficulty was the improvidence of the people their inability to think for the future and the necessity accordingly of the most unremitting and minute superintendence on the part of their instructors “thus at first if these gave up to them the care of the oxen with which they plowed their indolent thoughtlessness would probably leave them at evening still yoked to the implement worse than this instances occurred where they cut them up for supper thinking when reprehended that they sufficiently excused themselves by saying they were hungry”  as an example intermediate in the strength of the effective desire of accumulation between the state of things thus depicted and that of modern europe the case of the chinese deserves attention “durability is one of the chief qualities marking a high degree of the effective desire of accumulation the testimony of travelers ascribes to the instruments formed by the chinese a very inferior durability to similar instruments constructed by europeans the houses we are told unless of the higher ranks are in general of unburnt bricks of clay or of hurdles plastered with earth the roofs of reeds fastened to laths a greater degree of strength in the effective desire of accumulation would cause them to be constructed of materials requiring a greater present expenditure but being far more durable from the same cause much land that in other countries would be cultivated lies waste all travelers take notice of large tracts of lands chiefly swamps which continue in a state of nature to bring a swamp into tillage is generally a process to complete which requires several years it must be previously drained the surface long exposed to the sun and many operations performed before it can be made capable of bearing a crop though yielding probably a very considerable return for the labor bestowed on it that return is not made until a long time has elapsed the cultivation of such land implies a greater strength of the effective desire of accumulation than exists in the empire the amount of selfdenial would seem to be small it is their great deficiency in forethought and frugality in this respect which is the cause of the scarcities and famines that frequently occur”  that it is defect of providence not defect of industry that limits production among the chinese is still more obvious than in the case of the semiagriculturized indians “where the returns are quick where the instruments formed require but little time to bring the events for which they were formed to an issue” it is well known that “the great progress which has been made in the knowledge of the arts suited to the nature of the country and the wants of its inhabitants” makes industry energetic and effective “what marks the readiness with which labor is forced to form the most difficult materials into instruments where these instruments soon bring to an issue the events for which they are formed is the frequent occurrence on many of their lakes and rivers of structures resembling the floating gardens of the peruvians rafts covered with vegetable soil and cultivated labor in this way draws from the materials on which it acts very speedy returns nothing can exceed the luxuriance of vegetation when the quickening powers of a genial sun are ministered to by a rich soil and abundant moisture it is otherwise as we have seen in cases where the return though copious is distant european travelers are surprised at meeting these little floating farms by the side of swamps which only require draining to render them tillable”  when a country has carried production as far as in the existing state of knowledge it can be carried with an amount of return corresponding to the average strength of the effective desire of accumulation in that country it has reached what is called the stationary state the state in which no further addition will be made to capital unless there takes place either some improvement in the arts of production or an increase in the strength of the desire to accumulate in the stationary state though capital does not on the whole increase some persons grow richer and others poorer those whose degree of providence is below the usual standard become impoverished their capital perishes and makes room for the savings of those whose effective desire of accumulation exceeds the average these become the natural purchasers of the lands manufactories and other instruments of production owned by their less provident countrymen  in china if that country has really attained as it is supposed to have done the stationary state accumulation has stopped when the returns to capital are still as high as is indicated by a rate of interest legally twelve per cent and practically varying it is said between eighteen and thirtysix it is to be presumed therefore that no greater amount of capital than the country already possesses can find employment at this high rate of profit and that any lower rate does not hold out to a chinese sufficient temptation to induce him to abstain from present enjoyment what a contrast with holland where during the most flourishing period of its history the government was able habitually to borrow at two per cent and private individuals on good security at three    § 4 examples of excess of this desire   in the united states and the more prosperous countries of europe there are to be found abundance of prodigals still in a very numerous portion of the community the professional manufacturing and trading classes being those who generally speaking unite more of the means with more of the motives for saving than any other class the spirit of accumulation is so strong that the signs of rapidly increasing wealth meet every eye and the great amount of capital seeking investment excites astonishment whenever peculiar circumstances turning much of it into some one channel such as railway construction or foreign speculative adventure bring the largeness of the total amount into evidence  there are many circumstances which in england give a peculiar force to the accumulating propensity the long exemption of the country from the ravages of war and the far earlier period than elsewhere at which property was secure from military violence or arbitrary spoliation have produced a longstanding and hereditary confidence in the safety of funds when trusted out of the owner’s hands which in most other countries is of much more recent origin and less firmly established       the growth of depositbanking in great britain therefore     advances with enormous strides while in continental countries it     makes very little headway the disturbed condition of the country     in france owing to wars leads the thrifty to hoard instead of     depositing their savings but in the united states the same growth     is seen as among the english the net deposits of the national     banks of the united states in 1871 were 636000000 but in 1883     they had increased more than 83 per cent to 1168000000     deposit accounts are the rule even with small tradesmen and the     savingsbanks of massachusetts alone show deposits in 18821883 of     241311362 and those of new york of 412147213 the united     states also escapes from the heavy taxation which in europe is     imposed to maintain an extravagant army and navy chest the effect     of institutions moreover in stimulating the growth of material     prosperity is far more true of the united states than of england     for the barriers raised against the movement from lower to higher     social classes in the latter country are nonexistent here and     consequently there is more stimulus toward acquiring the means of     bettering a man’s social condition   the geographical causes which have made industry rather than war the natural source of power and importance to great britain and the united states have turned an unusual proportion of the most enterprising and energetic characters into the direction of manufactures and commerce into supplying their wants and gratifying their ambition by producing and saving rather than by appropriating what has been produced and saved much also depended on the better political institutions of this country which by the scope they have allowed to individual freedom of action have encouraged personal activity and selfreliance while by the liberty they confer of association and combination they facilitate industrial enterprise on a large scale the same institutions in another of their aspects give a most direct and potent stimulus to the desire of acquiring wealth the earlier decline of feudalism in england having removed or much weakened invidious distinctions between the originally trading classes and those who had been accustomed to despise them and a polity having grown up which made wealth the real source of political influence its acquisition was invested with a factitious value independent of its intrinsic utility and inasmuch as to be rich without industry has always hitherto constituted a step in the social scale above those who are rich by means of industry it becomes the object of ambition to save not merely as much as will afford a large income while in business but enough to retire from business and live in affluence on realized gains  in the united states england and holland then for a long time past and now in most other countries in europe the second requisite of increased production increase of capital shows no tendency to become deficient so far as that element is concerned production is susceptible of an increase without any assignable bounds the limitation to production not consisting in any necessary limit to the increase of the other two elements labor and capital must turn upon the properties of the only element which is inherently and in itself limited in quantity it must depend on the properties of land     chapter ix of the law of the increase of production from land    § 1 the law of production from the soil a law of diminishing return in proportion to the increased application of labor and capital   land differs from the other elements of production labor and capital in not being susceptible of indefinite increase its extent is limited and the extent of the more productive kinds of it more limited still it is also evident that the quantity of produce capable of being raised on any given piece of land is not indefinite this limited quantity of land and limited productiveness of it are the real limits to the increase of production  the limitation to production from the properties of the soil is not like the obstacle opposed by a wall which stands immovable in one particular spot and offers no hindrance to motion short of stopping it entirely we may rather compare it to a highly elastic and extensible band which is hardly ever so violently stretched that it could not possibly be stretched any more yet the pressure of which is felt long before the final limit is reached and felt more severely the nearer that limit is approached  after a certain and not very advanced stage in the progress of agriculture—as soon in fact as mankind have applied themselves to cultivation with any energy and have brought to it any tolerable tools—from that time it is the law of production from the land that in any given state of agricultural skill and knowledge by increasing the labor the produce is not increased in an equal degree doubling the labor does not double the produce or to express the same thing in other words every increase of produce is obtained by a more than proportional increase in the application of labor to the land this general law of agricultural industry is the most important proposition in political economy were the law different nearly all the phenomena of the production and distribution of wealth would be other than they are       it is not generally considered that in the united states where in     many sparsely settled parts of the country new land is constantly     being brought into cultivation an additional population under     existing conditions of agricultural skill can be maintained with     constantly increasing returns up to a certain point before the law     of diminishing returns begins to operate where more laborers are     necessary and more capital wanted to cooperate in a new country     before all the land can give its maximum product in such a stage     of cultivation it can not be said that the law of diminishing     returns has yet practically set in   when for the purpose of raising an increase of produce recourse is had to inferior land it is evident that so far the produce does not increase in the same proportion with the labor the very meaning of inferior land is land which with equal labor returns a smaller amount of produce land may be inferior either in fertility or in situation the one requires a greater proportional amount of labor for growing the produce the other for carrying it to market if the land a yields a thousand quarters of wheat to a given outlay in wages manure etc and in order to raise another thousand recourse must be had to the land b which is either less fertile or more distant from the market the two thousand quarters will cost more than twice as much labor as the original thousand and the produce of agriculture will be increased in a less ratio than the labor employed in procuring it  instead of cultivating the land b it would be possible by higher cultivation to make the land a produce more it might be plowed or harrowed twice instead of once or three times instead of twice it might be dug instead of being plowed after plowing it might be gone over with a hoe instead of a harrow and the soil more completely pulverized it might be oftener or more thoroughly weeded the implements used might be of higher finish or more elaborate construction a greater quantity or more expensive kinds of manure might be applied or when applied they might be more carefully mixed and incorporated with the soil       the example of marketgardens in the vicinity of great cities and     towns shows how the intensive culture permits an increase of labor     and capital with larger returns these lands by their situation     are superior lands for this particular purpose although they     might be inferior lands as regards absolute productiveness when     compared with the rich wheatlands of dakota new england and new     jersey farms generally speaking no longer attempt the culture of     grains but when driven out of that culture by the great railway     lines which have opened up the west they have arranged themselves     in a scale of adaptability for stock grass fruit dairy or     vegetable farming and have thereby given greater profits to their     owners than the same land did under the old régime even on     lands where any grain can still be grown corn buckwheat barley     oats and rye cover the cultivated areas instead of wheat   inferior lands or lands at a greater distance from the market of course yield an inferior return and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost and therefore of price if the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands by applying additional labor and capital at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others and engross the whole market lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors for the sake of subsistence or independence but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit that a profit can be made from them sufficient to attract capital to such an investment is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield at the best no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands  “it is long” says a late traveler in the united states130 “before an english eye becomes reconciled to the lightness of the crops and the careless farming as we should call it which is apparent one forgets that where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness as it were and finish about everything which requires labor” of the two causes mentioned the plentifulness of land seems to me the true explanation rather than the dearness of labor for however dear labor may be when food is wanted labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else but this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to fresh soil than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation       the western movement of what might be called the “wheatcenter” is     quite perceptible until recently minnesota has been a great     wheatproducing state and vast tracts of land were there planted     with that grain when the soil was first broken the profits on the     first few crops have been enormous but it is now said to be more     desirable for wheatgrowers to move onward to newer lands and to     sell the land to cultivators of a different class of fruit and     varied products who produce for a denser population so that in     1884 dakota instead of minnesota has become the district of the     greatest wheat production131   only when no soils remain to be broken up but such as either from distance or inferior quality require a considerable rise of price to render their cultivation profitable can it become advantageous to apply the high farming of europe to any american lands except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of towns where saving in cost of carriage may compensate for great inferiority in the return from the soil itself  the principle which has now been stated must be received no doubt with certain explanations and limitations even after the land is so highly cultivated that the mere application of additional labor or of an additional amount of ordinary dressing would yield no return proportioned to the expense it may still happen that the application of a much greater additional labor and capital to improving the soil itself by draining or permanent manures would be as liberally remunerated by the produce as any portion of the labor and capital already employed it would sometimes be much more amply remunerated this could not be if capital always sought and found the most advantageous employment    § 2 antagonist principle to the law of diminishing return the progress of improvements in production   that the produce of land increases cæteris paribus in a diminishing ratio to the increase in the labor employed is as we have said allowing for occasional and temporary exceptions the universal law of agricultural industry this principle however has been denied so much so indeed that it is affirmed the worst land now in cultivation produces as much food per acre and even as much to a given amount of labor as our ancestors contrived to extract from the richest soils in england       the law of diminishing returns is the physical fact upon which the     economic doctrine of rent is based and requires careful     attention carey asserts instead that there is a law of     increasing productiveness since as men grow in numbers and     intelligence there arises an ability to get more from the     soil132 some objectors even deny that different grades of land     are cultivated and that there is no need of taking inferior soils     into cultivation if this were true why would not one half an     acre of land be as good as a whole state johnston133 says “in     a country and among poor settlers  poor land is a relative     term land is called poor which is not suitable to a poor man     which on mere clearing and burning will not yield good first     crops thus that which is poor land for a poor man may prove rich     land to a rich man”134 moreover as is constantly the case in     our country it often happens that a railway may bring new lands     into competition with old lands in a given market of which the     most conspicuous example is the competition of western     grainfields with the eastern farms in these older districts     before the competition came there was a given series of grades in     the cultivated land after the railway was built there was a     disarrangement of the old series some going out of cultivation     some remaining and some of the new lands entering the list the     result is a new series of grades better suited to satisfy the     wants of men   this however does not prove that the law of which we have been speaking does not exist but only that there is some antagonizing principle at work capable for a time of making head against the law such an agency there is in habitual antagonism to the law of diminishing return from land and to the consideration of this we shall now proceed it is no other than the progress of civilization the most obvious part of it is the progress of agricultural knowledge skill and invention improved processes of agriculture are of two kinds 1 some enable the land to yield a greater absolute produce without an equivalent increase of labor 2 others have not the power of increasing the produce but have that of diminishing the labor and expense by which it is obtained 1 among the first are to be reckoned the disuse of fallows by means of the rotation of crops and the introduction of new articles of cultivation capable of entering advantageously into the rotation the change made in agriculture toward the close of the last century by the introduction of turniphusbandry is spoken of as amounting to a revolution next in order comes the introduction of new articles of food containing a greater amount of sustenance like the potato or more productive species or varieties of the same plant such as the swedish turnip in the same class of improvements must be placed a better knowledge of the properties of manures and of the most effectual modes of applying them the introduction of new and more powerful fertilizing agents such as guano and the conversion to the same purpose of substances previously wasted inventions like subsoilplowing or tiledraining by which the produce of some kinds of lands is so greatly multiplied improvements in the breed or feeding of laboring cattle augmented stock of the animals which consume and convert into human food what would otherwise be wasted and the like 2 the other sort of improvements those which diminish labor but without increasing the capacity of the land to produce are such as the improved construction of tools the introduction of new instruments which spare manual labor as the winnowing and thrashing machines these improvements do not add to the productiveness of the land but they are equally calculated with the former to counteract the tendency in the cost of production of agricultural produce to rise with the progress of population and demand    § 3 —in railways   analogous in effect to this second class of agricultural improvements are improved means of communication good roads are equivalent to good tools it is of no consequence whether the economy of labor takes place in extracting the produce from the soil or in conveying it to the place where it is to be consumed       the functions performed by railways in the system of production is     highly important they are among the most influential causes     affecting the cost of producing commodities particularly those     which satisfy the primary wants of man of which food is the     chief the amount of tonnage carried is enormous and the cost of     this service to the producers and consumers of the united states     is a question of very great magnitude the serious reduction in     the cost of transportation on the railways will be a surprise to     all who have not followed the matter very closely the more so     that it has been brought about by natural causes and independent     of legislation corn meat and dairy products form it is said     at least 50 per cent and coal and timber about 30 per cent of     the tonnage moved on all the railways of the united states if a     lowered cost of transportation has come about it has then cost     less to move the main articles of immediate necessity had the     charge in 1880 remained as high even as it was from 1866 to 1869     the number of tons carried in 1880 would have cost the united     states from 500000000 to 800000000 more than the charge     actually made owing to the reductions by the railways it seems     however that this process of reduction culminated about 1879 in     order to show the facts of

    the explanation of this reduced cost is given by mr edward     atkinson135 as 1 the competition of waterways 2 the     competition of one railway with another and 3 the competition     of other countries which forces our railways to try to lay our     staple products down in foreign markets at a price which will     warrant continued shipment besides these reasons much ought also     4 to be assigned to the progress of inventions and the reduced     cost of steel and all appliances necessary to the railways      the large importance of the railways shows itself in an influence     on general business prosperity and as a place for large     investments of a rapidly growing capital the building of     railways however has been going on at some times with greater     speed than at others instead of 33908 miles of railways at the     close of our war we have now 1884 over 120000 miles how the     additional mileage has been built year by year with two distinct     eras of increased building—one from 1869 to 1873 and another from     1879 to 1884—may be seen by the shorter lines of the subjoined     chart no vi      that speculation has been excited at different times by the     opening up of our western country there can be no doubt and if a     comparison be made with chart no xvii book iv chap iii which     gives the total graincrops of the united states it will be seen     that since 1879 although our population has increased from 12½     per cent to 14 per cent our graincrops only 5 per cent yet our     railway mileage has increased 40 per cent      the extent to which the united states has carried     railwaybuilding as compared with european countries although we     have a very much greater area is distinctly shown by chart no     vii this application of one form of improvement to oppose the law     of diminishing returns in the united states has produced     extraordinary results especially when we consider that we are     probably not yet using all our best lands or in other words     that we have not yet felt the law of diminishing returns in some     large districts   chart vi  miles of railroad in operation on the 1st january in

appliances and aids for producing which they serve to transmit by their means land can be cultivated which would not otherwise have remunerated the cultivators without a rise of price improvements in navigation have with respect to food or materials brought from beyond sea a corresponding effect    § 4 —in manufactures   from similar considerations it appears that many purely mechanical improvements which have apparently at least no peculiar connection with agriculture nevertheless enable a given amount of food to be obtained with a smaller expenditure of labor a great improvement in the process of smelting iron would tend to cheapen agricultural implements diminish the cost of railroads of wagons and carts ships and perhaps buildings and many other things to which iron is not at present applied because it is too costly and would thence diminish the cost of production of food the same effect would follow from an improvement in those processes of what may be termed manufacture to which the material of food is subjected after it is separated from the ground the first application of wind or water power to grind corn tended to cheapen bread as much as a very important discovery in agriculture would have done and any great improvement in the construction of cornmills would have in proportion a similar influence  those manufacturing improvements which can not be made instrumental to facilitate in any of its stages the actual production of food and therefore do not help to counteract or retard the diminution of the proportional return to labor from the soil have however another effect which is practically equivalent what they do not prevent they yet in some degree compensate for136  chart vii  ratio of miles of railroad to the areas of states and

inhabitants europe has one mile to each 3000 inhabitants if russia be included about one mile to each 2540 exclusive of russia  the materials of manufactures being all drawn from the land and many of them from agriculture which supplies in particular the entire material of clothing the general law of production from the land the law of diminishing return must in the last resort be applicable to manufacturing as well as to agricultural history as population increases and the power of the land to yield increased produce is strained harder and harder any additional supply of material as well as of food must be obtained by a more than proportionally increasing expenditure of labor but the cost of the material forming generally a very small portion of the entire cost of the manufacture the agricultural labor concerned in the production of manufactured goods is but a small fraction of the whole labor worked up in the commodity       mr babbage137 gives an interesting illustration of this     principle bariron of the value of £1 became worth when     manufactured into—                                           £     slitiron for nails              110     natural steel

effect upon the price of the cloth that the cost of the     materials forms but a small portion of the cost of the     manufacture138   all the labor not engaged in preparing materials tends constantly and strongly toward diminution as the amount of production increases manufactures are vastly more susceptible than agriculture of mechanical improvements and contrivances for saving labor in manufactures accordingly the causes tending to increase the productiveness of industry preponderate greatly over the one cause which tends to diminish it and the increase of production called forth by the progress of society takes place not at an increasing but at a continually diminishing proportional cost this fact has manifested itself in the progressive fall of the prices and values of almost every kind of manufactured goods during two centuries past a fall accelerated by the mechanical inventions of the last seventy or eighty years and susceptible of being prolonged and extended beyond any limit which it would be safe to specify the benefit might even extend to the poorest class the increased cheapness of clothing and lodging might make up to them for the augmented cost of their food  there is thus no possible improvement in the arts of production which does not in one or another mode exercise an antagonistic influence to the law of diminishing return to agricultural labor nor is it only industrial improvements which have this effect improvements in government and almost every kind of moral and social advancement operate in the same manner we may say the same of improvements in education the intelligence of the workman is a most important element in the productiveness of labor the carefulness economy and general trustworthiness of laborers are as important as their intelligence friendly relations and a community of interest and feeling between laborers and employers are eminently so in the rich and idle classes increased mental energy more solid instruction and stronger feelings of conscience public spirit or philanthropy would qualify them to originate and promote the most valuable improvements both in the economical resources of their country and in its institutions and customs    § 5 law holds true of mining   we must observe that what we have said of agriculture is true with little variation of the other occupations which it represents of all the arts which extract materials from the globe mining industry for example usually yields an increase of produce at a more than proportional increase of expense  it does worse for even its customary annual produce requires to be extracted by a greater and greater expenditure of labor and capital as a mine does not reproduce the coal or ore taken from it not only are all mines at last exhausted but even when they as yet show no signs of exhaustion they must be worked at a continually increasing cost shafts must be sunk deeper galleries driven farther greater power applied to keep them clear of water the produce must be lifted from a greater depth or conveyed a greater distance the law of diminishing return applies therefore to mining in a still more unqualified sense than to agriculture but the antagonizing agency that of improvements in production also applies in a still greater degree mining operations are more susceptible of mechanical improvements than agricultural the first great application of the steamengine was to mining and there are unlimited possibilities of improvement in the chemical processes by which the metals are extracted there is another contingency of no unfrequent occurrence which avails to counterbalance the progress of all existing mines toward exhaustion this is the discovery of new ones equal or superior in richness       professor jevons has applied this economic law to the industrial     situation of england139 while explaining that the supply of     cheap coal is the basis of english manufacturing prosperity yet     he insists that if the demand for coal is constantly increasing     the point must inevitably be reached in the future when the     increased supply can be obtained only at a higher cost when coal     costs england as much as it does any other nation then her     exclusive industrial advantage will cease to exist in the united     states the outlying iron deposits of lake superior lake     champlain and pennsylvania so geologists tell us will find     competition arising from the new grades of greater productiveness     in the richer deposits of states like alabama in that case we     shall be going from poorer to better grades of ironmines but     after the change is made a series of different grades of     productiveness will be established as before   to resume all natural agents which are limited in quantity are not only limited in their ultimate productive power but long before that power is stretched to the utmost they yield to any additional demands on progressively harder terms this law may however be suspended or temporarily controlled by whatever adds to the general power of mankind over nature and especially by any extension of their knowledge and their consequent command of the properties and powers of natural agents     chapter x consequences of the foregoing laws    § 1 remedies for weakness of the principle of accumulation   from the preceding exposition it appears that the limit to the increase of production is twofold from deficiency of capital or of land production comes to a pause either because the effective desire of accumulation is not sufficient to give rise to any further increase of capital or because however disposed the possessors of surplus income may be to save a portion of it the limited land at the disposal of the community does not permit additional capital to be employed with such a return as would be an equivalent to them for their abstinence  in countries where the principle of accumulation is as weak as it is in the various nations of asia the desideratum economically considered is an increase of industry and of the effective desire of accumulation the means are first a better government more complete security of property moderate taxes and freedom from arbitrary exaction under the name of taxes a more permanent and more advantageous tenure of land securing to the cultivator as far as possible the undivided benefits of the industry skill and economy he may exert secondly improvement of the public intelligence thirdly the introduction of foreign arts which raise the returns derivable from additional capital to a rate corresponding to the low strength of the desire of accumulation       an excellent example of what might be done by this process is to     be seen under our very eyes in the present development of mexico     to which american capital and enterprise have been so prominently     drawn of late all these proposed remedies if put into use in     mexico would undoubtedly result in a striking increase of wealth    § 2 even where the desire to accumulate is strong population must be kept within the limits of population from land   but there are other countries and england and the united states are at the head of them in which neither the spirit of industry nor the effective desire of accumulation need any encouragement in these countries there would never be any deficiency of capital if its increase were never checked or brought to a stand by too great a diminution of its returns it is the tendency of the returns to a progressive diminution which causes the increase of production to be often attended with a deterioration in the condition of the producers and this tendency which would in time put an end to increase of production altogether is a result of the necessary and inherent conditions of production from the land       this of course is based on the supposition that no new lands     such as those of the united states can be opened for cultivation     if there is no prohibition to the importation of cheaper food new     and richer land in any part of the world within reach of the     given country is an influence which works against the tendency     yet the tendency or economic law is there all the same forever     working   in all countries which have passed beyond a very early stage in the progress of agriculture every increase in the demand for food occasioned by increased population will always unless there is a simultaneous improvement in production diminish the share which on a fair division would fall to each individual an increased production in default of unoccupied tracts of fertile land or of fresh improvements tending to cheapen commodities can never be obtained but by increasing the labor in more than the same proportion the population must either work harder or eat less or obtain their usual food by sacrificing a part of their other customary comforts whenever this necessity is postponed it is because the improvements which facilitate production continue progressive because the contrivances of mankind for making their labor more effective keep up an equal struggle with nature and extort fresh resources from her reluctant powers as fast as human necessities occupy and engross the old  from this results the important corollary that the necessity of restraining population is not as many persons believe peculiar to a condition of great inequality of property a greater number of people can not in any given state of civilization be collectively so well provided for as a smaller the niggardliness of nature140 not the injustice of society is the cause of the penalty attached to overpopulation an unjust distribution of wealth does not even aggravate the evil but at most causes it to be somewhat earlier felt it is in vain to say that all mouths which the increase of mankind calls into existence bring with them hands the new mouths require as much food as the old ones and the hands do not produce as much  after a degree of density has been attained sufficient to allow the principal benefits of combination of labor all further increase tends in itself to mischief so far as regards the average condition of the people but the progress of improvement has a counteracting operation and allows of increased numbers without any deterioration and even consistently with a higher average of comfort improvement must here be understood in a wide sense including not only new industrial inventions or an extended use of those already known but improvements in institutions education opinions and human affairs generally provided they tend as almost all improvements do to give new motives or new facilities to production       the increase in the population of the united states has been     enormous as already seen but the increase of production has been     still greater owing to the fertility of our land to improvements     in the arts and to our great genius for invention as may be seen     by the following table amounts in the second column are given in     millions141 the steady increase of the valuation of our wealth     goes on faster than the increase of population so that

increase as rapidly as advancing numbers call for an augmentation of produce it is not necessary to obtain that augmentation by the cultivation of soils more sterile than the worst already under culture or by applying additional labor to the old soils at a diminished advantage or at all events this loss of power is compensated by the increased efficiency with which in the progress of improvement labor is employed in manufactures in one way or the other the increased population is provided for and all are as well off as before but if the growth of human power over nature is suspended or slackened and population does not slacken its increase if with only the existing command over natural agencies those agencies are called upon for an increased produce this greater produce will not be afforded to the increased population without either demanding on the average a greater effort from each or on the average reducing each to a smaller ration out of the aggregate produce  ever since the great mechanical inventions of watt arkwright and their contemporaries the return to labor has probably increased as fast as the population and would even have outstripped it if that very augmentation of return had not called forth an additional portion of the inherent power of multiplication in the human species during the twenty or thirty years last elapsed so rapid has been the extension of improved processes of agriculture in england that even the land yields a greater produce in proportion to the labor employed the average price of corn had become decidedly lower even before the repeal of the corn laws had so materially lightened for the time being the pressure of population upon production but though improvement may during a certain space of time keep up with or even surpass the actual increase of population it assuredly never comes up to the rate of increase of which population is capable and nothing could have prevented a general deterioration in the condition of the human race were it not that population has in fact been restrained had it been restrained still more and the same improvements taken place there would have been a larger dividend than there now is for the nation or the species at large the new ground wrung from nature by the improvements would not have been all tied up in the support of mere numbers though the gross produce would not have been so great there would have been a greater produce per head of the population    § 3 necessity of restraining population not superseded by free trade in food   when the growth of numbers outstrips the progress of improvement and a country is driven to obtain the means of subsistence on terms more and more unfavorable by the inability of its land to meet additional demands except on more onerous conditions there are two expedients by which it may hope to mitigate that disagreeable necessity even though no change should take place in the habits of the people with respect to their rate of increase one of these expedients is the importation of food from abroad the other is emigration  the admission of cheaper food from a foreign country is equivalent to an agricultural invention by which food could be raised at a similarly diminished cost at home it equally increases the productive power of labor the return was before so much food for so much labor employed in the growth of food the return is now a greater quantity of food for the same labor employed in producing cottons or hardware or some other commodity to be given in exchange for food the one improvement like the other throws back the decline of the productive power of labor by a certain distance but in the one case as in the other it immediately resumes its course the tide which has receded instantly begins to readvance it might seem indeed that when a country draws its supply of food from so wide a surface as the whole habitable globe so little impression can be produced on that great expanse by any increase of mouths in one small corner of it that the inhabitants of the country may double and treble their numbers without feeling the effect in any increased tension of the springs of production or any enhancement of the price of food throughout the world but in this calculation several things are overlooked  in the first place the foreign regions from which corn can be imported do not comprise the whole globe but those parts of it almost alone which are in the immediate neighborhood of coasts or navigable rivers and of such there is not in the productive regions of the earth so great a multitude as to suffice during an indefinite time for a rapidly growing demand without an increasing strain on the productive powers of the soil  in the next place even if the supply were drawn from the whole instead of a small part of the surface of the exporting countries the quantity of food would still be limited which could be obtained from them without an increase of the proportional cost the countries which export food may be divided into two classes those in which the effective desire of accumulation is strong and those in which it is weak in australia and the united states of america the effective desire of accumulation is strong capital increases fast and the production of food might be very rapidly extended but in such countries population also increases with extraordinary rapidity their agriculture has to provide for their own expanding numbers as well as for those of the importing countries they must therefore from the nature of the case be rapidly driven if not to less fertile at least what is equivalent to remoter and less accessible lands and to modes of cultivation like those of old countries less productive in proportion to the labor and expense       the extraordinary resources of the united states are scarcely     understood even by americans chart no xviii see book iv chap     iii may give some idea of the agricultural possibilities of our     land it will be seen from this that the quantity of fertile land     in but one of our states—texas—is greater than that of     austriahungary   but the countries which have at the same time cheap food and great industrial prosperity are few being only those in which the arts of civilized life have been transferred fullgrown to a rich and uncultivated soil among old countries those which are able to export food are able only because their industry is in a very backward state because capital and hence population have never increased sufficiently to make food rise to a higher price such countries are russia poland and hungary  the law therefore of diminishing return to industry whenever population makes a more rapid progress than improvement is not solely applicable to countries which are fed from their own soil but in substance applies quite as much to those which are willing to draw their food from any accessible quarter that can afford it cheapest    § 4 —nor by emigration   besides the importation of corn there is another resource which can be invoked by a nation whose increasing numbers press hard not against their capital but against the productive capacity of their land i mean emigration especially in the form of colonization of this remedy the efficacy as far as it goes is real since it consists in seeking elsewhere those unoccupied tracts of fertile land which if they existed at home would enable the demand of an increasing population to be met without any falling off in the productiveness of labor accordingly when the region to be colonized is near at hand and the habits and tastes of the people sufficiently migratory this remedy is completely effectual the migration from the older parts of the american confederation to the new territories which is to all intents and purposes colonization is what enables population to go on unchecked throughout the union without having yet diminished the return to industry or increased the difficulty of earning a subsistence       how strictly true this is may be seen by examining the map given     in the last census returns142 showing the residence of the     natives of the state of new york the greater or less frequency of     natives of new york residing in other states is shown by     different degrees of shading on the map a large district westward     as far as the mississippi shows a density of natives of new york     of from two to six to a square mile and a lesser density from     minnesota to indian territory on the other side of the     mississippi the same is shown of other older states the     explanation of the movement can not be anything else than the same     as that for the larger movement from europe to america   there is no probability that even under the most enlightened arrangements in older countries a permanent stream of emigration could be kept up sufficient to take off as in america all that portion of the annual increase when proceeding at its greatest rapidity which being in excess of the progress made during the same short period in the arts of life tends to render living more difficult for every averagely situated individual in the community and unless this can be done emigration can not even in an economical point of view dispense with the necessity of checks to population  the influence of immigration to the united states from european countries in lessening the tension in the relation between food and numbers is one of the most marked events in this century the united states has received about one fourth of its total population in 1880 from abroad since the foundation of the republic as will be seen by this table  total immigration into the united states  periods        numbers from        250000143

causes operating on this movement of men—a movement unequaled in history—are undoubtedly economic like the migration of the early teutonic races from the baltic to southern europe it is due to the pressure of numbers on subsistence  a still more interesting study is that of the causes which attempt to explain the direction of this stream after it has reached our shores it is a definite fact that the old slave states have hitherto received practically none of this vast foreign immigration144 the actual distribution of the foreign born in the united states is to be seen in a most interesting way by aid of the colored map chart no viii giving the different densities of foreignborn population in different parts of the union it seems almost certain that the general belief hitherto in the insecurity of life and property in the old slave states has worked against the material prosperity of that section  the different ages of the native and foreignborn inhabitants of the united states may be seen from the accompanying diagrams145 comparing the aggregate population of the united states with the foreignborn this may profitably be compared with a similar diagram relating

wealth partake of the character of physical truths there is nothing optional or arbitrary in them it is not so with the distribution of wealth that is a matter of human institution solely the things once there mankind individually or collectively can do with them as they like they can place them at the disposal of whomsoever they please and on whatever terms the distribution of wealth depends on the laws and customs of society the rules by which it is determined are what the opinions and feelings of the ruling portion of the community make them and are very different in different ages and countries and might be still more different if mankind so chose we have here to consider not the causes but the consequences of the rules according to which wealth may be distributed those at least are as little arbitrary and have as much the character of physical laws as the laws of production  we proceed then to the consideration of the different modes of distributing the produce of land and labor which have been adopted in practice or may be conceived in theory among these our attention is first claimed by that primary and fundamental institution on which unless in some exceptional and very limited cases the economical arrangements of society have always rested though in its secondary features it has varied and is liable to vary i mean of course the institution of individual property  private property as an institution did not owe its origin to any of those considerations of utility which plead for the maintenance of it when established enough is known of rude ages both from history and from analogous states of society in our own time to show that tribunals which always precede laws were originally established not to determine rights but to repress violence and terminate quarrels with this object chiefly in view they naturally enough gave legal effect to first occupancy by treating as the aggressor the person who first commenced violence by turning or attempting to turn another out of possession  in considering the institution of property as a question in social philosophy we must leave out of consideration its actual origin in any of the existing nations of europe we may suppose a community unhampered by any previous possession a body of colonists occupying for the first time an uninhabited country 1 if private property were adopted we must presume that it would be accompanied by none of the initial inequalities and injustice which obstruct the beneficial operation of the principle in old society every fullgrown man or woman we must suppose would be secured in the unfettered use and disposal of his or her bodily and mental faculties and the instruments of production the land and tools would be divided fairly among them so that all might start in respect to outward appliances on equal terms it is possible also to conceive that in this original apportionment compensation might be made for the injuries of nature and the balance redressed by assigning to the less robust members of the community advantages in the distribution sufficient to put them on a par with the rest but the division once made would not again be interfered with individuals would be left to their own exertions and to the ordinary chances for making an advantageous use of what was assigned to them 2 if individual property on the contrary were excluded the plan which must be adopted would be to hold the land and all instruments of production as the joint property of the community and to carry on the operations of industry on the common account the direction of the labor of the community would devolve upon a magistrate or magistrates whom we may suppose elected by the suffrages of the community and whom we must assume to be voluntarily obeyed by them the division of the produce would in like manner be a public act the principle might either be that of complete equality or of apportionment to the necessities or deserts of individuals in whatever manner might be conformable to the ideas of justice or policy prevailing in the community  the assailants of the principle of individual property may be divided into two classes 1 those whose scheme implies absolute equality in the distribution of the physical means of life and enjoyment and 2 those who admit inequality but grounded on some principle or supposed principle of justice or general expediency and not like so many of the existing social inequalities dependent on accident alone the characteristic name for this first economical system is communism a word of continental origin only of late introduced into this country the word socialism which originated among the english communists and was assumed by them as a name to designate their own doctrine is now on the continent employed in a larger sense not necessarily implying communism or the entire abolition of private property but applied to any system which requires that the land and the instruments of production should be the property not of individuals but of communities or associations or of the government       it should be said moreover that socialism is today used in the     distinct sense of a system which abolishes private property and     places the control of the capital labor and combined industries     of the country in the hands of the state the essence of modern     socialism is the appeal to statehelp and the weakening of     individual selfhelp collectivism is also a term now used by     german and french writers to describe an organization of the     industries of a country under a collective instead of an     individual management collectivism is but the french expression     for the system of state socialism    § 2 the case for communism against private property presented   the objection ordinarily made to a system of community of property and equal distribution of the produce that each person would be incessantly occupied in evading his fair share of the work points undoubtedly to a real difficulty but those who urge this objection forget to how great an extent the same difficulty exists under the system on which nine tenths of the business of society is now conducted and though the “master’s eye” when the master is vigilant and intelligent is of proverbial value it must be remembered that in a socialist farm or manufactory each laborer would be under the eye not of one master but of the whole community if communistic labor might be less vigorous than that of a peasant proprietor or a workman laboring on his own account it would probably be more energetic than that of a laborer for hire who has no personal interest in the matter at all  another of the objections to communism is that if every member of the community were assured of subsistence for himself and any number of children on the sole condition of willingness to work prudential restraint on the multiplication of mankind would be at an end and population would start forward at a rate which would reduce the community through successive stages of increasing discomfort to actual starvation but communism is precisely the state of things in which opinion might be expected to declare itself with greatest intensity against this kind of selfish intemperance an augmentation of numbers which diminished the comfort or increased the toil of the mass would then cause which now it does not immediate and unmistakable inconvenience to every individual in the association inconvenience which could not then be imputed to the avarice of employers or the unjust privileges of the rich  a more real difficulty is that of fairly apportioning the labor of the community among its members there are many kinds of work and by what standard are they to be measured one against another who is to judge how much cottonspinning or distributing goods from the stores or bricklaying or chimneysweeping is equivalent to so much plowing besides even in the same kind of work nominal equality of labor would be so great a real inequality that the feeling of justice would revolt against its being enforced all persons are not equally fit for all labor and the same quantity of labor is an unequal burden on the weak and the strong the hardy and the delicate the quick and the slow the dull and the intelligent146  if therefore the choice were to be made between communism with all its chances and the present state of society with all its sufferings and injustices all the difficulties great or small of communism would be but as dust in the balance but to make the comparison applicable we must compare communism at its best with the régime of individual property not as it is but as it might be made the laws of property have never yet conformed to the principles on which the justification of private property rests they have made property of things which never ought to be property and absolute property where only a qualified property ought to exist private property in every defense made of it is supposed to mean the guarantee to individuals of the fruits of their own labor and abstinence the guarantee to them of the fruits of the labor and abstinence of others transmitted to them without any merit or exertion of their own is not of the essence of the institution but a mere incidental consequence which when it reaches a certain height does not promote but conflicts with the ends which render private property legitimate to judge of the final destination of the institution of property we must suppose everything rectified which causes the institution to work in a manner opposed to that equitable principle of proportion between remuneration and exertion on which in every vindication of it that will bear the light it is assumed to be grounded we must also suppose two conditions realized without which neither communism nor any other laws or institutions could make the condition of the mass of mankind other than degraded and miserable one of these conditions is universal education the other a due limitation of the numbers of the community with these there could be no poverty even under the present social institutions and these being supposed the question of socialism is not as generally stated by socialists a question of flying to the sole refuge against the evils which now bear down humanity but a mere question of comparative advantages which futurity must determine we are too ignorant either of what individual agency in its best form or socialism in its best form can accomplish to be qualified to decide which of the two will be the ultimate form of human society  if a conjecture may be hazarded the decision will probably depend mainly on one consideration viz which of the two systems is consistent with the greatest amount of human liberty and spontaneity it is yet to be ascertained whether the communistic scheme would be consistent with that multiform development of human nature those manifold unlikenesses that diversity of tastes and talents and variety of intellectual points of view which not only form a great part of the interest of human life but by bringing intellects into stimulating collision and by presenting to each innumerable notions that he would not have conceived of himself are the mainspring of mental and moral progression    § 3 the socialists who appeal to statehelp       for general purposes a clearer understanding of the various     schemes may be gained by observing that 1 one class of     socialists intend to include the state itself within their plan     and 2 another class aim to form separate communities inside the     state and under its protection      of this first system there are no present examples but the object     of most of the socialistic organizations in the united states and     europe is to strive for the assumption by the state of the     production and distribution of wealth147 at present the most     active socialists are to be found in germany the origin of this     influence however is to be traced to france148 louis     blanc149 in his “organisation du travail” considers property     the great scourge of society the government he asserts should     regulate production raise money to be appropriated without     interest for creating state workshops in which the workmen should     elect their own overseers and all receive the same wages and the     sums needed should be raised from the abolition of collateral     inheritance the important practical part of his scheme was that     the great state workshops aided by the government would make     private competition in those industries impossible and thus bring     about the change from the private to the socialistic system      the founder of modern german socialism was karl marx150 and     almost the only socialist who pretended to economic knowledge he     aimed his attack on the present social system against the question     of value by asserting that the amount of labor necessary for the     production of an article is the sole measure of its exchange     value it follows from this that the right of property in the     article vests wholly in the laborer while the capitalist if he     claims a share of the product is nothing less than a robber no     just system he avers can properly exist so long as the rate of     wages is fixed by free contract between the employer and laborer     therefore the only remedy is the nationalization of all the     elements of production land tools materials and all existing     appliances which involves of course the destruction of the     institution of private property an obvious weakness in this     scheme is the provision that the government should determine what     goods are to be produced and that every one is bound to perform     that work which is assigned by the state in this there is no     choice of work and the tyranny of one master would be supplanted     by the tyranny of a greater multiplex master in the officers of     government moreover it can not be admitted that exchange value     is determined by the quantity of labor alone every one knows that     the result of ten days’ labor of a skilled watchmaker does not     exchange for the result of ten days’ labor of an unskilled hodman     of two men making shoes one may produce a good the other a poor     article although both may work the same length of time so that     their exchange value ought not to be determined by the mere     quantity of labor expended above all marx would extend the     equality of wages for the same time to the manager and     superintendent also in other words he proposes to take away all     the incentives to the acquirement or exercise of superior and     signal ability in every work of life the result of which would     inevitably lead to a deadening extension of mediocrity      this system gained an undue attention because it was made the     instrument of a socialist propaganda under the leadership of     ferdinand lassalle151 this active leader in 1863 founded the     german “workingmen’s union” a year earlier than the     “international152 association” in 1869 liebknecht and his     friends established the “social democratic workingmen’s party”     which after some difficulties absorbed the followers of lassalle     in a congress at gotha in 1875 and form the present socialist     party in germany their programme153 as announced at gotha is     as follows      i labor is the source of all riches and of all culture as     general profitable labor can only be done by the human society     the whole product of labor belongs to society—ie to all its     members—who have the same duties and the same right to work each     according to his reasonable wants      in the present society the means of work are the monopoly of the     class of capitalists the class of workingmen thus become     dependent on them and consequently are given over to all degrees     of misery and servitude      in order to emancipate labor it is requisite that the means of     work be transformed into the common property of society that all     production be regulated by associations and that the entire     product of labor be turned over to society and justly distributed     for the benefit of all      none but the workingclass itself can emancipate labor as in     relation to it all other classes are only a reactionary mass      ii led by these principles the german social workingmen’s party     by all legal means strives for a free state and society the     breaking down of the iron laws of wages by abolishing the system     of hired workingmen by abolishing exploitation in every shape     and doing away with all social and political inequality      the german social workingmen’s party although first working     within its national confines is fully conscious of the     international character of the general workingmen’s movement and     is resolved to fulfill all duties which it imposes on each     workingman in order to realize the fraternity of all men      the german social workingmen’s party for the purpose of preparing     the way and for the solution of the social problem demands the     creation of social productive associations to be supported by the     state government and under the control of the workingpeople the     productive associations are to be founded in such numbers that the     social organization of the whole production can be effected by     them      the german social workingmen’s party requires as the basis of     state government      1 universal equal direct and secret suffrage which beginning     with the twentieth year obliges all citizens to vote in all     state county and town elections electionday must be a sunday     or a holiday      2 direct legislation by the people decision as to war and peace     by the people      3 general capability of bearing arms popular defense in place of     standing armies      4 abolition of all exceptional laws especially those relating to     the press public meetings and associations—in short of all laws     which hinder the free expression of ideas and thought      5 gratuitous administration of justice by the people      6 general and equal popular and gratuitous education by the     government in all classes and institutes of learning general duty     to attend school religion to be declared a private affair      the german social workingmen’s party insists on realizing in the     present state of society      1 the largest possible extension of political rights and freedom     in conformity to the above six demands      2 a single progressive incometax for state counties and towns     instead of those which are imposed at present and in place of     indirect taxes which unequally burden the people      3 unlimited right of combination      4 a normal workingday corresponding with the wants of society     prohibition of sunday labor      5 prohibition of children’s work and of women’s work so far as     it injures their health and morality      6 protective laws for the life and health of workingmen sanitary     control of their dwellings superintendence of mines factories     industry and home work by officers chosen by the workingmen an     effectual law guaranteeing the responsibility of employers      7 regulation of prisonwork      8 unrestricted selfgovernment of all banks established for the     mutual assistance of workingmen      the above scheme also represents very well the character of the     socialist agitators in the united states who are themselves     chiefly foreigners and have foreign conceptions of socialism on     this form of socialism it is interesting to have mr mill’s later     opinions154 in his own words   “among those who call themselves socialists two kinds of persons may be distinguished there are in the first place 1 those whose plans for a new order of society in which private property and individual competition are to be superseded and other motives to action substituted are on the scale of a village community or township and would be applied to an entire country by the multiplication of such selfacting units of this character are the systems of owen of fourier and the more thoughtful and philosophic socialists generally the other class 2 who are more a product of the continent than of great britain and may be called the revolutionary socialists propose to themselves a much bolder stroke their scheme is the management of the whole productive resources of the country by one central authority the general government and with this view some of them avow as their purpose that the workingclasses or somebody in their behalf should take possession of all the property of the country and administer it for the general benefit the aim of that is to substitute the new rule for the old at a single stroke and to exchange the amount of good realized under the present system and its large possibilities of improvement for a plunge without any preparation into the most extreme form of the problem of carrying on the whole round of the operations of social life without the motive power which has always hitherto worked the social machinery it must be acknowledged that those who would play this game on the strength of their own private opinion unconfirmed as yet by any experimental verification must have a serene confidence in their own wisdom on the one hand and a recklessness of people’s sufferings on the other which robespierre and st just hitherto the typical instances of those united attributes scarcely came up to”    § 4 of various minor schemes communistic and socialistic   of the schemes to be tried within a state the two elaborate forms of noncommunistic socialism known as saintsimonism and fourierism are totally free from the objections usually urged against communism the saintsimonian155 scheme does not contemplate an equal but an unequal division of the produce it does not propose that all should be occupied alike but differently according to their vocation or capacity the function of each being assigned like grades in a regiment by the choice of the directing authority and the remuneration being by salary proportioned to the importance in the eyes of that authority of the function itself and the merits of the person who fulfills it but to suppose that one or a few human beings howsoever selected could by whatever machinery of subordinate agency be qualified to adapt each person’s work to his capacity and proportion each person’s remuneration to his merits is a supposition almost too chimerical to be reasoned against156  the most skillfully combined and with the greatest foresight of objections of all the forms of socialism is that commonly known as fourierism157 this system does not contemplate the abolition of private property nor even of inheritance on the contrary it avowedly takes into consideration as an element in the distribution of the produce capital as well as labor it proposes that the operations of industry should be carried on by associations of about two thousand members combining their labor on a district of about a square league in extent under the guidance of chiefs selected by themselves the “phalanstery” in the distribution a certain minimum is first assigned for the subsistence of every member of the community whether capable or not of labor the remainder of the produce is shared in certain proportions to be determined beforehand among the three elements labor capital and talent the capital of the community may be owned in unequal shares by different members who would in that case receive as in any other jointstock company proportional dividends the claim of each person on the share of the produce apportioned to talent is estimated by the grade or rank which the individual occupies in the several groups of laborers to which he or she belongs these grades being in all cases conferred by the choice of his or her companions the remuneration when received would not of necessity be expended or enjoyed in common there would be separate ménages for all who preferred them and no other community of living is contemplated than that all the members of the association should reside in the same pile of buildings for saving of labor and expense not only in building but in every branch of domestic economy and in order that the whole buying and selling operations of the community being performed by a single agent the enormous portion of the produce of industry now carried off by the profits of mere distributors might be reduced to the smallest amount possible       fourierism was tried in west virginia by american disciples and     it was advocated by horace greeley a modified form appeared in     the famous community at brook farm near dedham massachusetts     which drew there george ripley margaret fuller and even george     william curtis and nathaniel hawthorne      there have been many smaller communities established in the united     states but it can not be said that they have been successful from     the point of view either of numbers or material prosperity the     followers of rapp or the harmonists in pennsylvania and indiana     the owenites158 in indiana the community of zoar in ohio the     inspirationists in new york and iowa the perfectionists at     oneida and wallingford—are all evidently suffering from the     difficulties due to the absence of family life from the     increasing spirit of personal independence which carries away the     younger members of the organizations159 and the want of that     executive ability which distinguishes the successful manager in     private enterprises    § 5  the socialist objections to the present order of society examined   “the attacks160 on the present social order are vigorous and earnest but open to the charge of exaggeration  “in the first place it is unhappily true that the wages of ordinary labor in all the countries of europe are wretchedly insufficient to supply the physical and moral necessities of the population in any tolerable measure but when it is further alleged that even this insufficient remuneration has a tendency to diminish that there is in the words of m louis blanc une baisse continue des salaires the assertion is in opposition to all accurate information and to many notorious facts it has yet to be proved that there is any country in the civilized world where the ordinary wages of labor estimated either in money or in articles of consumption are declining while in many they are on the whole on the increase and an increase which is becoming not slower but more rapid there are occasionally branches of industry which are being gradually superseded by something else and in those until production accommodates itself to demand wages are depressed  “m louis blanc appears to have fallen into the same error which was at first committed by malthus and his followers that of supposing because population has a greater power of increase than subsistence its pressure upon subsistence must be always growing more severe it is a great point gained for truth when it comes to be seen that the tendency to overpopulation is a fact which communism as well as the existing order of society would have to deal with however this may be experience shows that in the existing state of society the pressure of population on subsistence which is the principal cause of low wages though a great is not an increasing evil on the contrary the progress of all that is called civilization has a tendency to diminish it partly by the more rapid increase of the means of employing and maintaining labor partly by the increased facilities opened to labor for transporting itself to new countries and unoccupied fields of employment and partly by a general improvement in the intelligence and prudence of the population it is of course open to discussion what form of society has the greatest power of dealing successfully with the pressure of population on subsistence and on this question there is much to be said for socialism but it has no just claim to be considered as the sole means of preventing the general and growing degradation of the mass of mankind through the peculiar tendency of poverty to produce overpopulation  “next it must be observed that socialists generally and even the most enlightened of them have a very imperfect and onesided notion of the operation of competition they see half its effects and overlook the other half they forget that competition is a cause of high prices and values as well as of low that the buyers of labor and of commodities compete with one another as well as the sellers and that if it is competition which keeps the prices of labor and commodities as low as they are it is competition which keeps them from falling still lower to meet this consideration socialists are reduced to affirm that when the richest competitor has got rid of all his rivals he commands the market and can demand any price he pleases but in the ordinary branches of industry no one rich competitor has it in his power to drive out all the smaller ones some businesses show a tendency to pass out of the hands of small producers or dealers into a smaller number of larger ones but the cases in which this happens are those in which the possession of a larger capital permits the adoption of more powerful machinery more efficient by more expensive processes or a better organized and more economical mode of carrying on business and this enables the large dealer legitimately and permanently to supply the commodity cheaper than can be done on the small scale to the great advantage of the consumers and therefore of the laboringclasses and diminishing pro tanto that waste of the resources of the community so much complained of by socialists the unnecessary multiplication of mere distributors and of the various other classes whom fourier calls the parasites of industry  “another point on which there is much misapprehension on the part of socialists as well as of tradesunionists and other partisans of labor against capital relates to the proportion in which the produce of the country is really shared and the amount of what is actually diverted from those who produce it to enrich other persons when for instance a capitalist invests £20000 in his business and draws from it an income of suppose £2000 a year the common impression is as if he were the beneficial owner both of the £20000 and of the £2000 while the laborers own nothing but their wages the truth however is that he only obtains the £2000 on condition of applying no part of the £20000 to his own use he has the legal control over it and might squander it if he chose but if he did he would not have the £2000 a year also for all personal purposes they have the capital and he has but the profits which it only yields to him on condition that the capital itself is employed in satisfying not his own wants but those of laborers even of his own share a small part only belongs to him as the owner of capital the portion of the produce which falls to capital merely as capital is measured by the interest of money since that is all that the owner of capital obtains when he contributes to production nothing except the capital itself  “the result of our review of the various difficulties of socialism has led us to the conclusion that the various schemes for managing the productive resources of the country by public instead of private agency have a case for a trial and some of them may eventually establish their claims to preference over the existing order of things but that they are at present workable only by the élite of mankind and have yet to prove their power of training mankind at large to the state of improvement which they presuppose”    § 6 property in land different from property in movables   it is next to be considered what is included in the idea of private property and by what considerations the application of the principle should be bounded  the institution of property when limited to its essential elements consists in the recognition in each person of a right to the exclusive disposal of what he or she have produced by their own exertions or received either by gift or by fair agreement without force or fraud from those who produced it the foundation of the whole is the right of producers to what they themselves have produced nothing is implied in property but the right of each to his or her own faculties to what he can produce by them and to whatever he can get for them in a fair market together with his right to give this to any other person if he chooses and the right of that other to receive and enjoy it  it follows therefore that although the right of bequest or gift after death forms part of the idea of private property the right of inheritance as distinguished from bequest does not that the property of persons who have made no disposition of it during their lifetime should pass first to their children and failing them to the nearest relations may be a proper arrangement or not but is no consequence of the principle of private property i see no reason why collateral inheritance should exist at all mr bentham long ago proposed and other high authorities have agreed in the opinion that if there are no heirs either in the descending or in the ascending line the property in case of intestacy should escheat to the state the parent owes to society to endeavor to make the child a good and valuable member of it and owes to the children to provide so far as depends on him such education and such appliances and means as will enable them to start with a fair chance of achieving by their own exertions a successful life to this every child has a claim and i can not admit that as a child he has a claim to more  the essential principle of property being to assure to all persons what they have produced by their labor and accumulated by their abstinence this principle can not apply to what is not the produce of labor the raw material of the earth if the land derived its productive power wholly from nature and not at all from industry or if there were any means of discriminating what is derived from each source it not only would not be necessary but it would be the height of injustice to let the gift of nature be engrossed by individuals but the use of the land in agriculture must indeed for the time being be of necessity exclusive the same person who has plowed and sown must be permitted to reap  but though land is not the produce of industry most of its valuable qualities are so labor is not only requisite for using but almost equally so for fashioning the instrument considerable labor is often required at the commencement to clear the land for cultivation in many cases even when cleared its productiveness is wholly the effect of labor and art one of the barrenest soils in the world composed of the material of the goodwin sands the pays de waes in flanders has been so fertilized by industry as to have become one of the most productive in europe cultivation also requires buildings and fences which are wholly the produce of labor the fruits of this industry can not be reaped in a short period the labor and outlay are immediate the benefit is spread over many years perhaps over all future time a holder will not incur this labor and outlay when strangers and not himself will be benefited by it if he undertakes such improvements he must have a sufficient period before him in which to profit by them and he is in no way so sure of having always a sufficient period as when his tenure is perpetual  these are the reasons which form the justification in an economical point of view of property in land it is seen that they are only valid in so far as the proprietor of land is its improver whenever in any country the proprietor generally speaking ceases to be the improver political economy has nothing to say in defense of landed property as there established  when the “sacredness of property” is talked of it should always be remembered that any such sacredness does not belong in the same degree to landed property no man made the land it is the original inheritance of the whole species its appropriation is wholly a question of general expediency when private property in land is not expedient it is unjust the reverse is the case with property in movables and in all things the product of labor over these the owner’s power both of use and of exclusion should be absolute except where positive evil to others would result from it but in the case of land no exclusive right should be permitted in any individual which can not be shown to be productive of positive good to be allowed any exclusive right at all over a portion of the common inheritance while there are others who have no portion is already a privilege no quantity of movable goods which a person can acquire by his labor prevents others from acquiring the like by the same means but from the very nature of the case whoever owns land keeps others out of the enjoyment of it when land is not intended to be cultivated no good reason can in general be given for its being private property at all even in the case of cultivated land a man whom though only one among millions the law permits to hold thousands of acres as his single share is not entitled to think that all this is given to him to use and abuse and deal with as if it concerned nobody but himself the rents or profits which he can obtain from it are at his sole disposal but with regard to the land in everything which he does with it and in everything which he abstains from doing he is morally bound and should whenever the case admits be legally compelled to make his interest and pleasure consistent with the public good     chapter ii of wages    § 1 of competition and custom   political economists generally and english political economists above others have been accustomed to lay almost exclusive stress upon the first of two agencies competition and custom to exaggerate the effect of competition and to take into little account the other and conflicting principle they are apt to express themselves as if they thought that competition actually does in all cases whatever it can be shown to be the tendency of competition to do this is partly intelligible if we consider that only through the principle of competition has political economy any pretension to the character of a science so far as rents profits wages prices are determined by competition laws may be assigned for them assume competition to be their exclusive regulator and principles of broad generality and scientific precision may be laid down according to which they will be regulated the political economist justly deems this his proper business and as an abstract or hypothetical science political economy can not be required to do and indeed can not do anything more but it would be a great misconception of the actual course of human affairs to suppose that competition exercises in fact this unlimited sway i am not speaking of monopolies either natural or artificial or of any interferences of authority with the liberty of production or exchange such disturbing causes have always been allowed for by political economists i speak of cases in which there is nothing to restrain competition no hindrance to it either in the nature of the case or in artificial obstacles yet in which the result is not determined by competition but by custom or usage competition either not taking place at all or producing its effect in quite a different manner from that which is ordinarily assumed to be natural to it       as stated by mr cairnes161 political economy is a science just     as is any recognized physical science—astronomy chemistry     physiology the economic “facts we find existing are the results     of causes between which and them the connection is constant and     invariable it is then the constant relations exhibited in     economic phenomena that we have in view when we speak of the laws     of the phenomena of wealth and in the exposition of these laws     consists the science of political economy” it is to be remembered     that economic laws are tendencies not actual descriptions of     any given conditions in this or that place   competition in fact has only become in any considerable degree the governing principle of contracts at a comparatively modern period the further we look back into history the more we see all transactions and engagements under the influence of fixed customs the relations more especially between the landowner and the cultivator and the payments made by the latter to the former are in all states of society but the most modern determined by the usage of the country the custom of the country is the universal rule nobody thinks of raising or lowering rents or of letting land on other than the customary conditions competition as a regulator of rent has no existence  prices whenever there was no monopoly came earlier under the influence of competition and are much more universally subject to it than rents the wholesale trade in the great articles of commerce is really under the dominion of competition but retail price the price paid by the actual consumer seems to feel very slowly and imperfectly the effect of competition and when competition does exist it often instead of lowering prices merely divides the gains of the high price among a greater number of dealers the influence of competition is making itself felt more and more through the principal branches of retail trade in the large towns  all professional remuneration is regulated by custom the fees of physicians surgeons and barristers the charges of attorneys are nearly invariable not certainly for want of abundant competition in those professions but because the competition operates by diminishing each competitor’s chance of fees not by lowering the fees themselves  these observations must be received as a general correction to be applied whenever relevant whether expressly mentioned or not to the conclusions contained in the subsequent portions of this treatise our reasonings must in general proceed as if the known and natural effects of competition were actually produced by it in all cases in which it is not restrained by some positive obstacle where competition though free to exist does not exist or where it exists but has its natural consequences overruled by any other agency the conclusions will fail more or less of being applicable to escape error we ought in applying the conclusions of political economy to the actual affairs of life to consider not only what will happen supposing the maximum of competition but how far the result will be affected if competition falls short of the maximum    § 2 the wagesfund and the objections to it considered   under the head of wages are to be considered first the causes which determine or influence the wages of labor generally and secondly the differences that exist between the wages of different employments it is convenient to keep these two classes of considerations separate and in discussing the law of wages to proceed in the first instance as if there were no other kind of labor than common unskilled labor of the average degree of hardness and disagreeableness  competition however must be regarded in the present state of society as the principal regulator of wages and custom or individual character only as a modifying circumstance and that in a comparatively slight degree  wages then depend mainly upon the demand and supply of labor or as it is often expressed on the proportion between population and capital by population is here meant the number only of the laboringclass or rather of those who work for hire and by capital only circulating capital and not even the whole of that but the part which is expended in the direct purchase of labor to this however must be added all funds which without forming a part of capital are paid in exchange for labor such as the wages of soldiers domestic servants and all other unproductive laborers there is unfortunately no mode of expressing by one familiar term the aggregate of what may be called the wagesfund of a country and as the wages of productive labor form nearly the whole of that fund it is usual to overlook the smaller and less important part and to say that wages depend on population and capital it will be convenient to employ this expression remembering however to consider it as elliptical and not as a literal statement of the entire truth  with these limitations of the terms wages not only depend upon the relative amount of capital and population but can not under the rule of competition be affected by anything else wages meaning of course the general rate can not rise but by an increase of the aggregate funds employed in hiring laborers or a diminution in the number of the competitors for hire nor fall except either by a diminution of the funds devoted to paying labor or by an increase in the number of laborers to be paid         illustration pie chart of fixed capital raw materials and                                wages fund      this is the simple statement of the wellknown wagesfund theory     which has given rise to no little animated discussion few     economists now assent to this doctrine when stated as above and     without changes the first attack on this explanation of the rate     of wages came from what is now a very scarce pamphlet written by     f d longe entitled “a refutation of the wagefund theory of     modern political economy” 1866 because laborers do not really     compete with each other he regarded the idea of average wages as     absurd as the idea of an average price of ships and cloth he     declared that there was no predetermined wagesfund necessarily     expended on labor and that “demand for commodities” determined     the amount of wealth devoted to paying wages p 46 while the     socalled wagesfund limits the total amount which the laborers     can receive the employer would try to get his workmen at as     much less than that amount as possible so that the aggregate fund     would have no bearing on the actual amount paid in wages the     quantity of work to be done he asserts determines the quantity     of labor to be employed about the same time but unknown to mr     longe w t thornton was studying the same subject and     attracted considerable attention by his publication “on labor”     1868 which in book ii chap i contained an extended argument     to show that demand and supply ie the proportion between     wagesfund and laborers did not regulate wages and denied the     existence of a predetermined wagesfund fixed in amount his     attack however assumes a very different conception of an     economic law from that which we think right to insist upon the     character of mankind being what it is it will be for their     interest to invest so much and no more in labor and we must     believe that in this sense there is a predetermination of wealth     to be paid in wages in order to make good investments a certain     amount must if capitalists follow their best interests go to the     payment of labor162 mr thornton’s argument attracted the more     attention because mr mill163 admitted that mr thornton had     induced him to abandon his wagesfund theory the subject was     however taken up reexamined by mr cairnes164 and stated in     a truer form 1 the total wealth of a country circle a in the     diagram is the outside limit of its capital how much capital     will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of     accumulation in the community as set forth in book i chap     viii the size of circle b within circle a therefore depends on     the character of the people the wagesfund then depends     ultimately on the extent of a and proximately on the extent of b     it can never be larger than b so far at least its amount is     “predetermined” in the economic sense by general laws regarding     the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit circle     b contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do     with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers 2     another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital     actually paid as wages one also governed by general causes     outside the reach of laborer or capitalist that is the state of     the arts of production in production the particular conditions     of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set     apart for raw material how much for machinery buildings and all     forms of fixed capital and how many laborers will be assigned to     a given machine for a given amount of material with some kinds of     handmade goods the largest share of capital goes to wages a less     amount for materials and a very small proportion for machinery     and tools in many branches of agriculture and small farming this     holds true the converse however is true in many manufactures     where machinery is largely used no two industries will maintain     the same proportion between the three elements the nature of the     industry therefore will determine whether a greater or a less     share of capital will be spent in wages it is needless to say     that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the     demand of either of the two parties to production labor and     capital it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or     general intelligence it is impossible then to escape the     conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will     under any normal investment go to the payment of wages only     within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or     contraction take place 3 within these limits of course minor     changes may take place so that the fund can not be said to be     “fixed” or “absolutely predetermined” but these changes must take     place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the     practical side of the question how these changes act may be seen     in a part of the following illustration of the above principles      suppose a cottonmill established in one of the valleys of     vermont for the management of which the owner has 140000 of     capital of this 100000 is given for buildings machinery and     plant if he turns over his remaining capital 40000 each     month we will suppose that 28000 spent in raw materials will     keep five hundred men occupied at a monthly expenditure of     12000 the present state of cottonmanufacture itself settles     the relation between a given quantity of raw cotton and a certain     amount of machinery a fixed amount of cotton no more no less     can be spun by each spindle and woven by each loom and the nature     of the process determines the number of laborers to each machine     this proportion is something which an owner must obey if he     expects to compete with other manufacturers the relationship is     fixed for not by him now each of the five hundred laborers     being supposed to receive on an average 100 a day imagine an     influx of a body of french canadians who offer to work on an     average for eighty cents a day165 the five hundred men will     now receive but 9600 monthly instead of 12000 as before as a     wagesfund the monthly payment for wages now is nearly seven per     cent while formerly it was nearly nine per cent of the total     capital invested 140000 thus it will be seen that the     wagesfund can change with a change in the supply of labor but     the point to be noticed is that it is a change in the subdivision     12000 of the total 140000 that is this alteration can take     place only within the limits set by the nature of the industry     now if this 2400 ie 12000 less 9600 saved out of the     wagesfund were to be reinvested it must necessarily be divided     between raw materials fixed capital and wages in the existing     relations that is only seven per cent of the new 2400 would be     added to the wagesfund it is worth while calling attention to     this if for no other reason than to show that in this way a     change can be readily made in the wagesfund by natural movements     and that no one can be so absurd as to say that it is absolutely     fixed in amount but it certainly is “predetermined” in the     economic sense in that any reinvestments as well as former     funds must necessarily be distributed according to the above     general principles independent of the “higgling” in the labor     market the following is mr cairnes’s statement of the amount and     “predetermination” of the wagesfund      “i believe that in the existing state of the national wealth the     character of englishmen being what it is a certain prospect of     profit will ‘determine’ a certain proportion of this wealth to     productive investment that the amount thus ‘determined’ will     increase as the field for investment is extended and that it will     not increase beyond what this field can find employment for at     that rate of profit which satisfies english commercial     expectation further i believe that investment thus taking     place the form which it shall assume will be ‘determined’ by the     nature of the national industries—‘determined’ not under acts of     parliament or in virtue of any physical law but through the     influence of the investor’s interests while this the form of the     investment will again ‘determine’ the proportion of the whole     capital which shall be paid as wages to laborers”166 in this     excellent and masterly conception the doctrine of a wagesfund is     not open to the objections usually urged against it indeed with     the exception of professor fawcett scarcely any economist     believes in an absolutely fixed wagesfund in this sense then     and in view of the above explanation it will be understood what     is meant by saying that wages depend upon the proportion of the     wagesfund to the number of the wagereceivers167      in applying these principles to the question of strikes it is     evident enough that if they result in an actual expansion of the     whole circle b by forcing saving from unproductive expenditure a     real addition of some extent may be made to the wagesfund but     only by increasing the total capital if however they attempt to     increase one of the elements of capital the wagesfund without     also adding to the other elements fixed capital and materials in     the proportion fixed by the nature of the industry they will     destroy all possibility of continuing that production in the     normal way and the capitalist must withdraw from the enterprise      francis a walker168 has also offered a solution of this problem     in his “wages question” 1876 in which he holds that “wages are     in a philosophical view of the subject paid out of the product of     present industry and hence that production furnishes the true     measure of wages” p 128 “it is the prospect of a profit in     production which determines the employer to hire laborers it is     the anticipated value of the product which determines how much he     can pay him” p 144 no doubt wages can be and often are     paid out of the current product but what amount what is the     principle of distribution wherever the incoming product is a     moral certainty and unless this is true in no case could wages     be paid out of the future product saving is as effective upon it     as upon the actual accumulations of the past and the amount of     the coming product which will be saved and used as capital is     determined by the same principles which govern the saving of past     products an increase of circle a by a larger production makes     possible an increase of circle b but whether it will be enlarged     or not depends on the principle of accumulation the larger the     total production of wealth the greater the possible wages all     must admit but it does not seem clear that general walker has     given us a solution of the real question at issue the larger the     house you build the larger the rooms may be but it does not     follow that the rooms will be necessarily large—as any inmate of a     summer hotel will testify    § 3 examination of some popular opinions respecting wages   there are however some facts in apparent contradiction to this the wagesfund doctrine which it is incumbent on us to consider and explain  1 for instance it is a common saying that wages are high when trade is good the demand for labor in any particular employment is more pressing and higher wages are paid when there is a brisk demand for the commodity produced and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation then workpeople are dismissed and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before this is true and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor but keeps idle in his hands is the same thing to the laborers for the time being as if it did not exist all capital is from the variations of trade occasionally in this state a manufacturer finding a slack demand for his commodity forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them but no one expects either of these states to be permanent if he did he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation in which it would still continue to employ labor the capital remains unemployed for a time during which the labor market is overstocked and wages fall afterward the demand revives and perhaps becomes unusually brisk enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency and if he is able he borrows capital in addition which would otherwise have gone into some other employment these however are but temporary fluctuations the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment that which is this year unable to keep up with the demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly but nothing can permanently alter general wages except an increase or a diminution of capital itself always meaning by the term the funds of all sorts destined for the payment of labor compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired  2 again it is another common notion that high prices make high wages because the producers and dealers being better off can afford to pay more to their laborers i have already said that a brisk demand which causes temporary high prices causes also temporary high wages but high prices in themselves can only raise wages if the dealers receiving more are induced to save more and make an addition to their capital or at least to their purchases of labor wages will probably be temporarily higher in the employment in which prices have risen and somewhat lower in other employments in which case while the first half of the phenomenon excites notice the other is generally overlooked or if observed is not ascribed to the cause which really produced it nor will the partial rise of wages last long for though the dealers in that one employment gain more it does not follow that there is room to employ a greater amount of savings in their own business their increasing capital will probably flow over into other employments and there counterbalance the diminution previously made in the demand for labor by the diminished savings of other classes       a clear distinction must be made between real wages and money     wages the former is of importance to the laborer as being his     real receipts the quantity of commodities satisfying his desires     which the laborer receives for his exertion constitutes his real     wages the mere amount of money he receives for his exertions     irrespective of what the money will exchange for forms his money     wages since the functions of money have not yet been explained     it is difficult to discuss the relation between prices and money     wages here but as the total value of the products in a certain     industry is the sum out of which both money wages and profits are     paid this total will rise or fall efficiency of labor remaining     the same with the price of the particular article if the price     rises profits will be greater than elsewhere and more capital     will be invested in that one business that is the capital will     be a demand for more labor and until equalization is     accomplished in all trades between wages and profits money wages     will be higher in some trades than in others169      when reference is had to the connection between real wages and     prices the question is a different one general high prices would     not change general real wages but if high prices cause higher     money wages in particular branches of trade then because the     movement is not general there will accrue to those receiving     more money the means to buy more of real wages and as in     practice changes in prices which arise from an increased demand     are partial and not general it often happens that high prices     produce high real wages not general high wages in some not in     all employments for a further study of this relation between     prices and wages the reader is advised to recall this discussion     in connection with that in a later part of the volume book iii     chaps xx and xxi   3 another opinion often maintained is that wages meaning of course money wages vary with the price of food rising when it rises and falling when it falls this opinion is i conceive only partially true and in so far as true in no way affects the dependence of wages on the proportion between capital and labor since the price of food when it affects wages at all affects them through that law dear or cheap food caused by variety of seasons does not affect wages unless they are artificially adjusted to it by law or charity or rather it has some tendency to affect them in the contrary way to that supposed since in times of scarcity people generally compete more violently for employment and lower the labor market against themselves but dearness or cheapness of food when of a permanent character and capable of being calculated on beforehand may affect wages 1 in the first place if the laborers have as is often the case no more than enough to keep them in working condition and enable them barely to support the ordinary number of children it follows that if food grows permanently dearer without a rise of wages a greater number of the children will prematurely die and thus wages will ultimately be higher but only because the number of people will be smaller than if food had remained cheap 2 but secondly even though wages were high enough to admit of food’s becoming more costly without depriving the laborers and their families of necessaries though they could bear physically speaking to be worse off perhaps they would not consent to be so they might have habits of comfort which were to them as necessaries and sooner than forego which they would put an additional restraint on their power of multiplication so that wages would rise not by increase of deaths but by diminution of births in these cases then wages do adapt themselves to the price of food though after an interval of almost a generation170 if wages were previously so high that they could bear reduction to which the obstacle was a high standard of comfort habitual among the laborers a rise of the price of food or any other disadvantageous change in their circumstances may operate in two ways a it may correct itself by a rise of wages brought about through a gradual effect on the prudential check to population or b it may permanently lower the standard of living of the class in case their previous habits in respect of population prove stronger than their previous habits in respect of comfort in that case the injury done to them will be permanent and their deteriorated condition will become a new minimum tending to perpetuate itself as the more ample minimum did before it is to be feared that of the two modes in which the cause may operate the last b is the most frequent or at all events sufficiently so to render all propositions ascribing a selfrepairing quality to the calamities which befall the laboringclasses practically of no validity  the converse case occurs when by improvements in agriculture the repeal of corn laws or other such causes the necessaries of the laborers are cheapened and they are enabled with the same money wages to command greater comforts than before wages will not fall immediately it is even possible that they may rise but they will fall at last so as to leave the laborers no better off than before unless during this interval of prosperity the standard of comfort regarded as indispensable by the class is permanently raised unfortunately this salutary effect is by no means to be counted upon it is a much more difficult thing to raise than to lower the scale of living which the laborers will consider as more indispensable than marrying and having a family according to all experience a great increase invariably takes place in the number of marriages in seasons of cheap food and full employment       this is to be seen by some brief statistics of marriages in     vermont and massachusetts      year   vermont   massachusetts     1860      2179          12404     1861      2188          10972     1862      1962          11014     1863      2007          10873     1864      1804          12513     1865

breaking out of the war rose in     1863 under the fair progress of the northern arms again fell off     in 1864 during the period of discouragement and since 1865 has     kept a steadily higher average in manufacturing massachusetts the     number fell earlier than in agricultural vermont at the beginning     of the difficulties      1856 july to jan   6418     1857 jan to july   5803     1857 july to jan   5936     1858 jan to july   4917     1858 july to jan   5610      the effects of the financial panic of 1857 in massachusetts show     a similar movement in the number of marriages the crisis came in     october 1857 in the three months following that date there were     400 less marriages   to produce permanent advantage the temporary cause operating upon them must be sufficient to make a great change in their condition—a change such as will be felt for many years notwithstanding any stimulus which it may give during one generation to the increase of people when indeed the improvement is of this signal character and a generation grows up which has always been used to an improved scale of comfort the habits of this new generation in respect to population become formed upon a higher minimum and the improvement in their condition becomes permanent    § 4 certain rare circumstances excepted high wages imply restraints on population   wages depend then on the proportion between the number of the laboring population and the capital or other funds devoted to the purchase of labor we will say for shortness the capital if wages are higher at one time or place than at another if the subsistence and comfort of the class of hired laborers are more ample it is for no other reason than because capital bears a greater proportion to population it is not the absolute amount of accumulation or of production that is of importance to the laboringclass it is not the amount even of the funds destined for distribution among the laborers it is the proportion between those funds and the numbers among whom they are shared the condition of the class can be bettered in no other way than by altering that proportion to their advantage and every scheme for their benefit which does not proceed on this as its foundation is for all permanent purposes a delusion  in countries like north america and the australian colonies where the knowledge and arts of civilized life and a high effective desire of accumulation coexist with a boundless extent of unoccupied land the growth of capital easily keeps pace with the utmost possible increase of population and is chiefly retarded by the impracticability of obtaining laborers enough all therefore who can possibly be born can find employment without overstocking the market every laboring family enjoys in abundance the necessaries many of the comforts and some of the luxuries of life and unless in case of individual misconduct or actual inability to work poverty does not and dependence need not exist in england so gigantic has been the progress of the cotton manufacture since the inventions of watt and arkwright that the capital engaged in it has probably quadrupled in the time which population requires for doubling while therefore it has attracted from other employments nearly all the hands which geographical circumstances and the habits or inclinations of the people rendered available and while the demand it created for infant labor has enlisted the immediate pecuniary interest of the operatives in favor of promoting instead of restraining the increase of population nevertheless wages in the great seats of the manufacture are still so high that the collective earnings of a family amount on an average of years to a very satisfactory sum and there is as yet no sign of decrease while the effect has also been felt in raising the general standard of agricultural wages in the counties adjoining  but those circumstances of a country or of an occupation in which population can with impunity increase at its utmost rate are rare and transitory very few are the countries presenting the needful union of conditions either the industrial arts are backward and stationary and capital therefore increases slowly or the effective desire of accumulation being low the increase soon reaches its limit or even though both these elements are at their highest known degree the increase of capital is checked because there is not fresh land to be resorted to of as good quality as that already occupied though capital should for a time double itself simultaneously with population if all this capital and population are to find employment on the same land they can not without an unexampled succession of agricultural inventions continue doubling the produce therefore if wages do not fall profits must and when profits fall increase of capital is slackened  except therefore in the very peculiar cases which i have just noticed of which the only one of any practical importance is that of a new colony or a country in circumstances equivalent to it it is impossible that population should increase at its utmost rate without lowering wages in no old country does population increase at anything like its utmost rate in most at a very moderate rate in some countries not at all these facts are only to be accounted for in two ways either the whole number of births which nature admits of and which happen in some circumstances do not take place or if they do a large proportion of those who are born die the retardation of increase results either from mortality or prudence from mr malthus’s positive or from his preventive check and one or the other of these must and does exist and very powerfully too in all old societies wherever population is not kept down by the prudence either of individuals or of the state it is kept down by starvation or disease    § 5 due restriction of population the only safeguard of a laboringclass   where a laboringclass who have no property but their daily wages and no hope of acquiring it refrain from overrapid multiplication the cause i believe has always hitherto been either actual legal restraint or a custom of some sort which without intention on their part insensibly molds their conduct or affords immediate inducements not to marry it is not generally known in how many countries of europe direct legal obstacles are opposed to improvident marriages  where there is no general law restrictive of marriage there are often customs equivalent to it when the guilds or trade corporations of the middle ages were in vigor their bylaws or regulations were conceived with a very vigilant eye to the advantage which the trade derived from limiting competition and they made it very effectually the interest of artisans not to marry until after passing through the two stages of apprentice and journeyman and attaining the rank of master  unhappily sentimentality rather than common sense usually presides over the discussions of these subjects discussions on the condition of the laborers lamentations over its wretchedness denunciations of all who are supposed to be indifferent to it projects of one kind or another for improving it were in no country and in no time of the world so rife as in the present generation but there is a tacit agreement to ignore totally the law of wages or to dismiss it in a parenthesis with such terms as “hardhearted malthusianism” as if it were not a thousand times more hardhearted to tell human beings that they may than that they may not call into existence swarms of creatures who are sure to be miserable and most likely to be depraved  i ask then is it true or not that if their numbers were fewer they would obtain higher wages this is the question and no other and it is idle to divert attention from it by attacking any incidental position of malthus or some other writer and pretending that to refute that is to disprove the principle of population some for instance have achieved an easy victory over a passing remark of mr malthus hazarded chiefly by way of illustration that the increase of food may perhaps be assumed to take place in an arithmetical ratio while population increases in a geometrical when every candid reader knows that mr malthus laid no stress on this unlucky attempt to give numerical precision to things which do not admit of it and every person capable of reasoning must see that it is wholly superfluous to his argument others have attached immense importance to a correction which more recent political economists have made in the mere language of the earlier followers of mr malthus several writers had said that it is the tendency of population to increase faster than the means of subsistence the assertion was true in the sense in which they meant it namely that population would in most circumstances increase faster than the means of subsistence if it were not checked either by mortality or by prudence but inasmuch as these checks act with unequal force at different times and places it was possible to interpret the language of these writers as if they had meant that population is usually gaining ground upon subsistence and the poverty of the people becoming greater under this interpretation of their meaning it was urged that the reverse is the truth that as civilization advances the prudential check tends to become stronger and population to slacken its rate of increase relatively to subsistence and that it is an error to maintain that population in any improving community tends to increase faster than or even so fast as subsistence171 the word tendency172 is here used in a totally different sense from that of the writers who affirmed the proposition but waiving the verbal question is it not allowed on both sides that in old countries population presses too closely upon the means of subsistence     chapter iii of remedies for low wages    § 1 a legal or customary minimum of wages with a guarantee of employment   the simplest expedient which can be imagined for keeping the wages of labor up to the desirable point would be to fix them by law and this is virtually the object aimed at in a variety of plans which have at different times been or still are current for remodeling the relation between laborers and employers no one probably ever suggested that wages should be absolutely fixed since the interests of all concerned often require that they should be variable but some have proposed to fix a minimum of wages leaving the variations above that point to be adjusted by competition another plan which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives is that councils should be formed which in england have been called local boards of trade in france “conseils de prud’hommes” and other names consisting of delegates from the workpeople and from the employers who meeting in conference should agree upon a rate of wages and promulgate it from authority to be binding generally on employers and workmen the ground of decision being not the state of the labor market but natural equity to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages and the capitalist reasonable profits       the one expedient most suggested by politicians and     laborreformers in the united states is an eighthour law     mandatory upon all employers it is to be remembered however     that in very many industries piecework exists and if a     diminution of hours is enforced that will mean a serious     reduction in the amount of wages which can be possibly earned in a     day even if all industries were alike in the matter of arranging     their work this plan means higher wages for the same work or the     same wages for less work and so an increased cost of labor this     would then take its effect on profits at once and the effects     would be probably seen in a withdrawal of capital from many     industries where as now the profits are very low it must be     recalled however that in the united states there has been under     the influence of natural causes unaided by legislation a very     marked reduction in the hours of labor accompanied by an increase     of wages for example in 1840 rhode island operatives in the     cardingroom of the cottonmills worked fourteen hours a day for     328 a week while in 1884 they work eleven hours and receive     540 a week this result is most probably due to the gain arising     from the invention of laborsaving machinery   others again but these are rather philanthropists interesting themselves for the laboringclasses than the laboring people themselves are shy of admitting the interference of authority in contracts for labor they fear that if law intervened it would intervene rashly and ignorantly they are convinced that two parties with opposite interests attempting to adjust those interests by negotiation through their representatives on principles of equity when no rule could be laid down to determine what was equitable would merely exasperate their differences instead of healing them but what it is useless to attempt by the legal sanction these persons desire to compass by the moral every employer they think ought to give sufficient wages and if he does it not willingly should be compelled to it by general opinion the test of sufficient wages being their own feelings or what they suppose to be those of the public this is i think a fair representation of a considerable body of existing opinion on the subject  i desire to confine my remarks to the principle involved in all these suggestions without taking into account practical difficulties serious as these must at once be seen to be i shall suppose that by one or other of these contrivances wages could be kept above the point to which they would be brought by competition this is as much as to say above the highest rate which can be afforded by the existing capital consistently with employing all the laborers for it is a mistake to suppose that competition merely keeps down wages it is equally the means by which they are kept up when there are any laborers unemployed these unless maintained by charity become competitors for hire and wages fall but when all who were out of work have found employment wages will not under the freest system of competition fall lower there are strange notions afloat concerning the nature of competition some people seem to imagine that its effect is something indefinite that the competition of sellers may lower prices and the competition of laborers may lower wages down to zero or some unassignable minimum nothing can be more unfounded goods can only be lowered in price by competition to the point which calls forth buyers sufficient to take them off and wages can only be lowered by competition until room is made to admit all the laborers to a share in the distribution of the wagesfund if they fell below this point a portion of capital would remain unemployed for want of laborers a countercompetition would commence on the side of capitalists and wages would rise       the assumption in the last chapter in regard to competition and     custom should be kept in mind in all this reasoning as a matter     of fact there is not that mobility of labor which insures so free     an operation of competition that equality of payment always     exists in reality there is no competition at all between the     lower grades of laborers and the higher classes of skilled labor     of course the tendency is as explained by mr mill and as time     goes on there is a distinctly greater mobility of labor visible     vast numbers pass from scandinavia and other countries of europe     to the united states or from england to australia urged by the     desire to go from a community of low to one of higher wages   since therefore the rate of wages which results from competition distributes the whole wagesfund among the whole laboring population if law or opinion succeeds in fixing wages above this rate some laborers are kept out of employment and as it is not the intention of the philanthropists that these should starve they must be provided for by a forced increase of the wagesfund—by a compulsory saving it is nothing to fix a minimum of wages unless there be a provision that work or wages at least be found for all who apply for it this accordingly is always part of the scheme and is consistent with the ideas of more people than would approve of either a legal or a moral minimum of wages popular sentiment looks upon it as the duty of the rich or of the state to find employment for all the poor if the moral influence of opinion does not induce the rich to spare from their consumption enough to set all the poor at work at “reasonable wages” it is supposed to be incumbent on the state to lay on taxes for the purpose either by local rates or votes of public money the proportion between labor and the wagesfund would thus be modified to the advantage of the laborers not by restriction of population but by an increase of capital    § 2 —would require as a condition legal measures for repression of population   if this claim on society could be limited to the existing generation if nothing more were necessary than a compulsory accumulation sufficient to provide permanent employment at ample wages for the existing numbers of the people such a proposition would have no more strenuous supporter than myself society mainly consists of those who live by bodily labor and if society that is if the laborers lend their physical force to protect individuals in the enjoyment of superfluities they are entitled to do so and have always done so with the reservation of a power to tax those superfluities for purposes of public utility among which purposes the subsistence of the people is the foremost since no one is responsible for having been born no pecuniary sacrifice is too great to be made by those who have more than enough for the purpose of securing enough to all persons already in existence  but it is another thing altogether when those who have produced and accumulated are called upon to abstain from consuming until they have given food and clothing not only to all who now exist but to all whom these or their descendants may think fit to call into existence such an obligation acknowledged and acted upon would suspend all checks both positive and preventive there would be nothing to hinder population from starting forward at its rapidest rate and as the natural increase of capital would at the best not be more rapid than before taxation to make up the growing deficiency must advance with the same gigantic strides but let them work ever so efficiently the increasing population could not as we have so often shown increase the produce proportionally the surplus after all were fed would bear a less and less proportion to the whole produce and to the population and the increase of people going on in a constant ratio while the increase of produce went on in a diminishing ratio the surplus would in time be wholly absorbed taxation for the support of the poor would engross the whole income of the country the payers and the receivers would be melted down into one mass  it would be possible for the state to guarantee employment at ample wages to all who are born but if it does this it is bound in selfprotection and for the sake of every purpose for which government exists to provide that no person shall be born without its consent to give profusely to the people whether under the name of charity or of employment without placing them under such influences that prudential motives shall act powerfully upon them is to lavish the means of benefiting mankind without attaining the object but remove the regulation of their wages from their own control guarantee to them a certain payment either by law or by the feeding of the community and no amount of comfort that you can give them will make either them or their descendants look to their own selfrestraint as the proper means for preserving them in that state       the famous poorlaws of elizabeth enacted in 1601 were at first     intended to relieve the destitute poor sick aged and impotent     but in their administration a share was given to all who begged     it employers of course found it cheaper to hire labor partly     paid for by the parish and the independent farmlaborer who would     not go on the parish found his own wages lowered by this kind of     competition this continued a crying evil until it reached the     proportions described by may “as the cost of pauperism thus     encouraged was increasing the poorer ratepayers were themselves     reduced to poverty the soil was illcultivated by pauper labor     and its rental consumed by parish rates in a period of fifty     years the poorrates were quadrupled and had reached in 1833     the enormous amount of £8600000 in many parishes they were     approaching the annual value of the land itself”173 the old     poorlaws were repealed and there went into effect in 1834 the     workhouse system which while not denying subsistence to all     those born required that the giving of aid should be made as     disagreeable as possible in order to stimulate among the poor a     feeling of repugnance to all aid from the community this is also     the general idea of poorrelief in the united states      the cultivation of the principle of selfhelp in each laborer is     certainly the right object at which to aim in the united states     voluntary charitable organizations have associated together in     some cities in order to scrutinize all cases of poverty through a     number of visitors in each district who advise and counsel the     unfortunate but never give money this system has been very     successful and by basing its operations on the principle of     selfhelp has given the best proof of its right to an increasing     influence    § 3 allowances in aid of wages and the standard of living   next to the attempts to regulate wages and provide artificially that all who are willing to work shall receive an adequate price for their labor we have to consider another class of popular remedies which do not profess to interfere with freedom of contract which leave wages to be fixed by the competition of the market but when they are considered insufficient endeavor by some subsidiary resource to make up to the laborers for the insufficiency of this nature was the allowance system the principle of this scheme being avowedly that of adapting the means of every family to its necessities it was a natural consequence that more should be given to the married than to the single and to those who had large families than to those who had not in fact an allowance was usually granted for every child it is obvious that this is merely another mode of fixing a minimum of wages  there is a rate of wages either the lowest on which the people can or the lowest on which they will consent to live we will suppose this to be seven shillings a week shocked at the wretchedness of this pittance the parish authorities humanely make it up to ten but the laborers are accustomed to seven and though they would gladly have more will live on that as the fact proves rather than restrain the instinct of multiplication their habits will not be altered for the better by giving them parish pay receiving three shillings from the parish they will be as well off as before though they should increase sufficiently to bring down wages to four shillings they will accordingly people down to that point or perhaps without waiting for an increase of numbers there are unemployed laborers enough in the workhouse to produce the effect at once it is well known that the allowance system did practically operate in the mode described and that under its influence wages sank to a lower rate than had been known in england before       the operation of a low standard upon the wages of those in the     community who have a higher one has been seen in the united     states to a certain extent by the landing on our shores of chinese     laborers who maintain a decidedly lower standard of living than     either their american or irish competitors if they come in such     numbers as to retain their lower standard by forming a group by     themselves and are thereby not assimilated into the body of     laborers who have a higher standard of comfort they can to the     extent of their ability to do work drive other laborers out of     employment this moreover is exactly what was done by the irish     who drove americans out of the mills of new england and who are     now being driven out probably by the french canadians with a     standard lower than the irish the chinese come here now without     their families as may be seen by the accompanying diagram in     which the shaded side represents the males on the left and the     unshaded the females on the right of the perpendicular line      decade   males   females     1              6          4     2            106         12

females there are      it need hardly be said that the economic side of a question is     here discussed which requires for its solution many ethical and     political considerations besides    § 4 grounds for expecting improvement in public opinion on the subject of population   by what means then is poverty to be contended against how is the evil of low wages to be remedied if the expedients usually recommended for the purpose are not adapted to it can no others be thought of is the problem incapable of solution can political economy do nothing but only object to everything and demonstrate that nothing can be done those who think it hopeless that the laboringclasses should be induced to practice a sufficient degree of prudence in regard to the increase of their families because they have hitherto stopped short of that point show an inability to estimate the ordinary principles of human action nothing more would probably be necessary to secure that result than an opinion generally diffused that it was desirable  but let us try to imagine what would happen if the idea became general among the laboringclass that the competition of too great numbers was the principal cause of their poverty we are often told that the most thorough perception of the dependence of wages on population will not influence the conduct of a laboringman because it is not the children he himself can have that will produce any effect in generally depressing the labor market true and it is also true that one soldier’s running away will not lose the battle accordingly it is not that consideration which keeps each soldier in his rank it is the disgrace which naturally and inevitably attends on conduct by any one individual which if pursued by a majority everybody can see would be fatal men are seldom found to brave the general opinion of their class unless supported either by some principle higher than regard for opinion or by some strong body of opinion elsewhere  if the opinion were once generally established among the laboringclass that their welfare required a due regulation of the numbers of families the respectable and wellconducted of the body would conform to the prescription and only those would exempt themselves from it who were in the habit of making light of social obligations generally and there would be then an evident justification for converting the moral obligation against bringing children into the world who are a burden to the community into a legal one just as in many other cases of the progress of opinion the law ends by enforcing against recalcitrant minorities obligations which to be useful must be general and which from a sense of their utility a large majority have voluntarily consented to take upon themselves  the dependence of wages on the number of the competitors for employment is so far from hard of comprehension or unintelligible to the laboringclasses that by great bodies of them it is already recognized and habitually acted on it is familiar to all tradesunions every successful combination to keep up wages owes its success to contrivances for restricting the number of competitors all skilled trades are anxious to keep down their own numbers and many impose or endeavor to impose as a condition upon employers that they shall not take more than a prescribed number of apprentices there is of course a great difference between limiting their numbers by excluding other people and doing the same thing by a restraint imposed on themselves but the one as much as the other shows a clear perception of the relation between their numbers and their remuneration the principle is understood in its application to any one employment but not to the general mass of employment for this there are several reasons first the operation of causes is more easily and distinctly seen in the more circumscribed field secondly skilled artisans are a more intelligent class than ordinary manual laborers and the habit of concert and of passing in review their general condition as a trade keeps up a better understanding of their collective interests thirdly and lastly they are the most provident because they are the best off and have the most to preserve    § 5 twofold means of elevating the habits of the laboringpeople by education and by foreign and home colonization   for the purpose therefore of altering the habits of the laboring people there is need of a twofold action directed simultaneously upon their intelligence and their poverty an effective national education of the children of the laboringclass is the first thing needful and coincidently with this a system of measures which shall as the revolution did in france extinguish extreme poverty for one whole generation without entering into disputable points it may be asserted without scruple that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to cultivate common sense to qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded but education is not compatible with extreme poverty it is impossible effectually to teach an indigent population toward effecting this object there are two resources available without wrong to any one without any of the liabilities of mischief attendant on voluntary or legal charity and not only without weakening but on the contrary strengthening every incentive to industry and every motive to forethought  the first is a great national measure of colonization i mean a grant of public money sufficient to remove at once and establish in the colonies a considerable fraction of the youthful agricultural population it has been shown by others that colonization on an adequate scale might be so conducted as to cost the country nothing or nothing that would not be certainly repaid and that the funds required even by way of advance would not be drawn from the capital employed in maintaining labor but from that surplus which can not find employment at such profit as constitutes an adequate remuneration for the abstinence of the possessor and which is therefore sent abroad for investment or wasted at home in reckless speculations  the second resource would be to devote all common land hereafter brought into cultivation to raising a class of small proprietors what i would propose is that common land should be divided into sections of five acres or thereabout to be conferred in absolute property on individuals of the laboringclass who would reclaim and bring them into cultivation by their own labor       this suggestion works to the same purpose as the proposal that our     government should retain its public lands and aid in the formation     of a great number of small farmers rather than by huge grants     to foster large holdings in the western states and     territories174   the preference should be given to such laborers and there are many of them as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security the tools the manure and in some cases the subsistence also might be supplied by the parish or by the state interest for the advance at the rate yielded by the public funds being laid on as a perpetual quitrent with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years’ purchase these little landed estates might if it were thought necessary be indivisible by law though if the plan worked in the manner designed i should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision in case of intestacy and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs they might be bought by government at their value and regranted to some other laborer who could give security for the price the desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become as on the continent an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided an intermediate class between them and their employers affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes and as there would be good reason to anticipate an example for their imitation  it would however be of little avail that either or both of these measures of relief should be adopted unless on such a scale as would enable the whole body of hired laborers remaining on the soil to obtain not merely employment but a large addition to the present wages—such an addition as would enable them to live and bring up their children in a degree of comfort and independence to which they have hitherto been strangers     chapter iv of the differences of wages in different employments    § 1 differences of wages arising from different degrees of attractiveness in different employments   in treating of wages we have hitherto confined ourselves to the causes which operate on them generally and en masse the laws which govern the remuneration of ordinary or average labor without reference to the existence of different kinds of work which are habitually paid at different rates depending in some degree on different laws we will now take into consideration these differences and examine in what manner they affect or are affected by the conclusions already established  the differences says adam smith arise partly “from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others” these circumstances he considers to be “first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them”  1 “the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a laborer does in eight his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground honor makes a great part of the reward of all honorable professions in point of pecuniary gain all things considered” their recompense is in his opinion below the average “disgrace has the contrary effect the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades the most detestable of all employments that of the public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever”  2 “employment is much more constant” continues adam smith “in some trades than in others in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work a mason or bricklayer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion”  “when 1 the inconstancy of the employment is combined with 2 the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skillful artificers a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases the coalheavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coalships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coalheavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages in the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in london”  these inequalities of remuneration which are supposed to compensate for the disagreeable circumstances of particular employments would under certain conditions be natural consequences of perfectly free competition and as between employments of about the same grade and filled by nearly the same description of people they are no doubt for the most part realized in practice  but it is altogether a false view of the state of facts to present this as the relation which generally exists between agreeable and disagreeable employments the really exhausting and the really repulsive labors instead of being better paid than others are almost invariably paid the worst of all because performed by those who have no choice if the laborers in the aggregate instead of exceeding fell short of the amount of employment work which was generally disliked would not be undertaken except for more than ordinary wages but when the supply of labor so far exceeds the demand that to find employment at all is an uncertainty and to be offered it on any terms a favor the case is totally the reverse partly from this cause and partly from the natural and artificial monopolies which will be spoken of presently the inequalities of wages are generally in an opposite direction to the equitable principle of compensation erroneously represented by adam smith as the general law of the remuneration of labor  3 one of the points best illustrated by adam smith is the influence exercised on the remuneration of an employment by the uncertainty of success in it if the chances are great of total failure the reward in case of success must be sufficient to make up in the general estimation for those adverse chances put your son apprentice to a shoemaker there is little doubt of his learning to make a pair of shoes but send him to study the law it is at least twenty to one if ever he makes such proficiency as will enable him to live by the business in a perfectly fair lottery those who draw the prizes ought to gain all that is lost by those who draw the blanks in a profession where twenty fail for one that succeeds that one ought to gain all that should have been gained by the unsuccessful twenty how extravagant soever the fees of counselorsatlaw may sometimes appear their real retribution is never equal to this    § 2  differences arising from natural monopolies   the preceding are cases in which inequality of remuneration is necessary to produce equality of attractiveness and are examples of the equalizing effect of free competition the following are cases of real inequality and arise from a different principle  4 “the wages of labor vary according to the small or great trust which must be reposed in the workmen the wages of goldsmiths and jewelers are everywhere superior to those of many other workmen not only of equal but of much superior ingenuity on account of the precious materials with which they are intrusted” the superiority of reward is not here the consequence of competition but of its absence not a compensation for disadvantages inherent in the employment but an extra advantage a kind of monopoly price the effect not of a legal but of what has been termed a natural monopoly if all laborers were trustworthy it would not be necessary to give extra pay to working goldsmiths on account of the trust the degree of integrity required being supposed to be uncommon those who can make it appear that they possess it are able to take advantage of the peculiarity and obtain higher pay in proportion to its rarity       this same explanation of a natural monopoly applies exactly to the     causes which give able executive managers who watch over     productive operations the usually high rewards for labor under     the name of “wages of superintendence” if successful managers of     cotton or woolen mills were as plentiful in proportion to the     demand for them as ordinary artisans in proportion to the demand     for them then the former would get no higher rewards than the     latter able executive and business managers secure high wages     solely on the ground—as explained above—of monopoly that is     because their numbers owing to natural causes are few relatively     to the demand for them in every industry in the land   5 some employments require a much longer time to learn and a much more expensive course of instruction than others and to this extent there is as explained by adam smith an inherent reason for their being more highly remunerated wages consequently must yield over and above the ordinary amount an annuity sufficient to repay these sums with the common rate of profit within the number of years the laborer can expect to live and be in working condition  but independently of these or any other artificial monopolies there is a natural monopoly in favor of skilled laborers against the unskilled which makes the difference of reward exceed sometimes in a manifold proportion what is sufficient merely to equalize their advantages but the fact that a course of instruction is required of even a low degree of costliness or that the laborer must be maintained for a considerable time from other sources suffices everywhere to exclude the great body of the laboring people from the possibility of any such competition until lately all employments which required even the humble education of reading and writing could be recruited only from a select class the majority having had no opportunity of acquiring those attainments       here is found the germ of the idea which has been elaborately     worked out by mr cairnes175 in his theory of noncompeting     groups of laborers “what we find in effect is not a whole     population competing indiscriminately for all occupations but a     series of industrial layers superposed on one another within each     of which the various candidates for employment possess a real and     effective power of selection while those occupying the several     strata are for all purposes of effective competition practically     isolated from each other” mr mill certainly understood this     fully and stated it clearly again in book iii chap ii § 2   the changes however now so rapidly taking place in usages and ideas are undermining all these distinctions the habits or disabilities which chained people to their hereditary condition are fast wearing away and every class is exposed to increased and increasing competition from at least the class immediately below it the general relaxation of conventional barriers and the increased facilities of education which already are and will be in a much greater degree brought within the reach of all tend to produce among many excellent effects one which is the reverse they tend to bring down the wages of skilled labor    § 3  effect on wages of the competition of persons having other means of support   a modifying circumstance still remains to be noticed which interferes to some extent with the operation of the principles thus far brought to view while it is true as a general rule that the earnings of skilled labor and especially of any labor which requires school education are at a monopoly rate from the impossibility to the mass of the people of obtaining that education it is also true that the policy of nations or the bounty of individuals formerly did much to counteract the effect of this limitation of competition by offering eleemosynary instruction to a much larger class of persons than could have obtained the same advantages by paying their price  adam smith has pointed out that “whenever the law has attempted to regulate the wages of workmen it has always been rather to lower them than to raise them but the law has upon many occasions attempted to raise the wages of curates and for the dignity of the church to oblige the rectors of parishes to give them more than the wretched maintenance which they themselves might be willing to accept of and in both cases the law seems to have been equally ineffectual and has never been either able to raise the wages of curates or to sink those of laborers to the degree that was intended because it has never been able to hinder either the one from being willing to accept of less than the legal allowance on account of the indigence of their situation and the multitude of their competitors or the other from receiving more on account of the contrary competition of those who expected to derive either profit or pleasure from employing them”  although the highest pecuniary prizes of successful authorship are incomparably greater than at any former period yet on any rational calculation of the chances in the existing competition scarcely any writer can hope to gain a living by books and to do so by magazines and reviews becomes daily more difficult it is only the more troublesome and disagreeable kinds of literary labor and those which confer no personal celebrity such as most of those connected with newspapers or with the smaller periodicals on which an educated person can now rely for subsistence of these the remuneration is on the whole decidedly high because though exposed to the competition of what used to be called “poor scholars” persons who have received a learned education from some public or private charity they are exempt from that of amateurs those who have other means of support being seldom candidates for such employments  when an occupation is carried on chiefly by persons who derive the main portion of their subsistence from other sources its remuneration may be lower almost to any extent than the wages of equally severe labor in other employments the principal example of the kind is domestic manufactures when spinning and knitting were carried on in every cottage by families deriving their principal support from agriculture the price at which their produce was sold which constituted the remuneration of their labor was often so low that there would have been required great perfection of machinery to undersell it the amount of the remuneration in such a case depends chiefly upon whether the quantity of the commodity produced by this description of labor suffices to supply the whole of the demand if it does not and there is consequently a necessity for some laborers who devote themselves entirely to the employment the price of the article must be sufficient to pay those laborers at the ordinary rate and to reward therefore very handsomely the domestic producers but if the demand is so limited that the domestic manufacture can do more than satisfy it the price is naturally kept down to the lowest rate at which peasant families think it worth while to continue the production thus far as to the remuneration of the subsidiary employment but the effect to the laborers of having this additional resource is almost certain to be unless peculiar counteracting causes intervene a proportional diminution of the wages of their main occupation  for the same reason it is found that cæteris paribus those trades are generally the worst paid in which the wife and children of the artisan aid in the work the income which the habits of the class demand and down to which they are almost sure to multiply is made up in those trades by the earnings of the whole family while in others the same income must be obtained by the labor of the man alone it is even probable that their collective earnings will amount to a smaller sum than those of the man alone in other trades because the prudential restraint on marriage is unusually weak when the only consequence immediately felt is an improvement of circumstances the joint earnings of the two going further in their domestic economy after marriage than before       this statement seems to be borne out by the statistics of     wages176 both in england and the united states in our     cottonmills where women do certain kinds of work equally well     with men the wages of the men are lower than in outside     employments into which women can not enter      blacksmiths per week 1674     family of four drawersin cottonmill—man per week 550     family of four drawersin cottonmill—woman per week 550     family of four tenders two boys 450     total 1550      in this case the family of four all together receive only about     the same as the wages of the single blacksmith alone    § 4 wages of women why lower than those of men   where men and women work at the same employment if it be one for which they are equally fitted in point of physical power they are not always unequally paid women in factories sometimes earn as much as men and so they do in handloom weaving which being paid by the piece brings their efficiency to a sure test when the efficiency is equal but the pay unequal the only explanation that can be given is custom but the principal question relates to the peculiar employments of women the remuneration of these is always i believe greatly below that of employments of equal skill and equal disagreeableness carried on by men in some of these cases the explanation is evidently that already given as in the case of domestic servants whose wages speaking generally are not determined by competition but are greatly in excess of the market value of the labor and in this excess as in almost all things which are regulated by custom the male sex obtains by far the largest share in the occupations in which employers take full advantage of competition the low wages of women as compared with the ordinary earnings of men are a proof that the employments are overstocked that although so much smaller a number of women than of men support themselves by wages the occupations which law and usage make accessible to them are comparatively so few that the field of their employment is still more overcrowded       yet within the employments open to women such as millinery and     dressmaking certain women are able to charge excessively high     prices for work because having obtained a reputation for     especial skill and taste they can exact in the high prices of     their articles what is really their high wages within these     employments women are unable to earn a living not so much by the     lack of work as by not bringing to their occupation that amount     of skill and those business qualities owing of course to their     being brought up unaccustomed to business methods which are     requisite for the success of any one either man or woman   it must be observed that as matters now stand a sufficient degree of overcrowding may depress the wages of women to a much lower minimum than those of men the wages at least of single women must be equal to their support but need not be more than equal to it the minimum in their case is the pittance absolutely requisite for the sustenance of one human being now the lowest point to which the most superabundant competition can permanently depress the wages of a man is always somewhat more than this where the wife of a laboringman does not by general custom contribute to his earnings the man’s wages must be at least sufficient to support himself a wife and a number of children adequate to keep up the population since if it were less the population would not be kept up    § 5 differences of wages arising from laws combinations or customs   thus far we have throughout this discussion proceeded on the supposition that competition is free so far as regards human interference being limited only by natural causes or by the unintended effect of general social circumstances but law or custom may interfere to limit competition if apprentice laws or the regulations of corporate bodies make the access to a particular employment slow costly or difficult the wages of that employment may be kept much above their natural proportion to the wages of common labor in some trades however and to some extent the combinations of workmen produce a similar effect those combinations always fail to uphold wages at an artificial rate unless they also limit the number of competitors putting aside the atrocities sometimes committed by workmen in the way of personal outrage or intimidation which can not be too rigidly repressed if the present state of the general habits of the people were to remain forever unimproved these partial combinations in so far as they do succeed in keeping up the wages of any trade by limiting its numbers might be looked upon as simply intrenching round a particular spot against the inroads of overpopulation and making the wages of the class depend upon their own rate of increase instead of depending on that of a more reckless and improvident class than themselves  to conclude this subject i must repeat an observation already made that there are kinds of labor of which the wages are fixed by custom and not by competition such are the fees or charges of professional persons—of physicians surgeons barristers and even attorneys     chapter v of profits    § 1 profits include interest and risk but correctly speaking do not include wages of superintendence   having treated of the laborer’s share of the produce we next proceed to the share of the capitalist the profits of capital or stock the gains of the person who advances the expenses of production—who from funds in his possession pays the wages of the laborers or supports them during the work who supplies the requisite buildings materials and tools or machinery and to whom by the usual terms of the contract the produce belongs to be disposed of at his pleasure after indemnifying him for his outlay there commonly remains a surplus which is his profit the net income from his capital and skill the amount which he can afford to expend in necessaries or pleasures or from which by further saving he can add to his wealth  as the wages of the laborer are the remuneration of labor so a part of the profits of the capitalist are properly according to mr senior’s wellchosen expression the remuneration of abstinence they are what he gains by forbearing to consume his capital for his own uses and allowing it to be consumed by productive laborers for their uses for this forbearance he requires a recompense  of the gains however which the possession of a capital enables a person to make 1 a part only is properly an equivalent for the use of the capital itself namely as much as a solvent person would be willing to pay for the loan of it this which as everybody knows is called interest is all that a person is enabled to get by merely abstaining from the immediate consumption of his capital and allowing it to be used for productive purposes by others the remuneration which is obtained in any country for mere abstinence is measured by the current rate of interest on the best security such security as precludes any appreciable chance of losing the principal what a person expects to gain who superintends the employment of his own capital is always more and generally much more than this the rate of profit greatly exceeds the rate of interest 2 the surplus is partly compensation for risk by lending his capital on unexceptionable security he runs little or no risk but if he embarks in business on his own account he always exposes his capital to some and in many cases to very great danger of partial or total loss for this danger he must be compensated otherwise he will not incur it 3 he must likewise be remunerated for the devotion of his time and labor the control of the operations of industry usually belongs to the person who supplies the whole or the greatest part of the funds by which they are carried on and who according to the ordinary arrangement is either alone interested or is the person most interested at least directly in the result to exercise this control with efficiency if the concern is large and complicated requires great assiduity and often no ordinary skill this assiduity and skill must be remunerated  the gross profits from capital the gains returned to those who supply the funds for production must suffice for these three purposes and the three parts into which profit may be considered as resolving itself may be described respectively as interest insurance and wages of superintendence       inasmuch as risk is the cause affecting the rate of interest it     would be much simpler to consider the whole reward for abstinence     as interest the rate of which is affected by the risk and to     carefully exclude from the profits of capital the payment for     “assiduity and skill” which is distinctly wages of labor the     “wages of superintendence” as every one on a moment’s reflection     must admit have no necessary connection whatever with the     possession of capital the thing with which the laborer is     occupied does not give the reason for associating his wages with     the name of that thing because a highlyqualified manager     supervises the operations of capital it does not follow that he     has capital or should be regarded as being paid for the     possession of capital the man who shovels ashes is not paid wages     of ashes any more than a man who superintends other people’s     capital is paid the reward of capital the payment for services     in the one case as in the other depends upon the skill of the     manager just as it does with an ordinary mechanic rising or     falling with his fitness for the peculiar work skill as a manager     is the cause the amount of the remuneration is the consequence     if so then the wages of superintendence have no logical     connection in the economic sense with capital as the thing which     determines the amount of its reward any more than it affects the     wages of any and all labor the payment for the use of capital     simply as capital may be seen by the amount which a widow who is     not engaged in active business receives from her property invested     as trust funds moreover it is less and less true that the     manager of the operations of industry is necessarily the     capitalist to see this mark the executive managers called     “treasurers” by custom of cotton and woolen mills who receive a     remuneration entirely distinct from any capital they may have     invested in the shares of the corporation and the officials of     the great mutual insurance companies who receive the wages of     managers but for managing the capital of others a large—by far     the largest—part of what is usually called profit therefore     should be treated as wages and the forces which govern its amount     are the same as those affecting the amounts of all other kinds of     wages such as are discussed in the preceding chapter the     acknowledgment of this distinction is of extreme importance and     affects in a profound way the whole question of distribution to     include “wages of superintendence” in profits of capital is to     unnecessarily complicate one of the most serious economic     questions—namely the relations of capital and labor    § 2 the minimum of profits what produces variations in the amount of profits   the lowest rate of profit that can permanently exist is that which is barely adequate at the given place and time to afford an equivalent for the abstinence risk and exertion implied in the employment of capital from the gross profit has first to be deducted as much as will form a fund sufficient on the average to cover all losses incident to the employment next it must afford such an equivalent to the owner of the capital for forbearing to consume it as is then and there a sufficient motive to him to persist in his abstinence how much will be required to form this equivalent depends on the comparative value placed in the given society upon the present and the future in the words formerly used on the strength of the effective desire of accumulation further after covering all losses and remunerating the owner for forbearing to consume there must be something left to recompense the labor and skill of the person who devotes his time to the business  such then is the minimum of profits but that minimum is exceedingly variable and at some times and places extremely low on account of the great variableness of two out of its three elements that the rate of necessary remuneration for abstinence or in other words the effective desire of accumulation differs widely in different states of society and civilization has been seen in a former chapter there is a still wider difference in the element which consists in compensation for risk  the remuneration of capital in different employments much more than the remuneration of labor varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another the profits for example of retail trade in proportion to the capital employed exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers for this reason among others that there is less consideration attached to the employment the greatest however of these differences is that caused by difference of risk the profits of a gunpowdermanufacturer must be considerably greater than the average to make up for the peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed when however as in the case of marine adventure the peculiar risks are capable of being and commonly are commuted for a fixed payment the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits but is included in the replacement of his capital       the minimum of profits can not properly include wages of     superintendence nor is it so included practically in mr mill’s     discussions on the minimum of profits in a later part of this     volume the operation of the various elements in changing the     amount of profits might be expressed as follows as between     different countries and communities who have a different     effective desire of accumulation profits may vary with the     element of interest and risk within the same district where     interest is generally the same on the same security profits may     vary with the risk attached to different industries and within     the same occupations interest and risk being given the wages of     superintendence may make a greater variation than either of the     other two causes—since a skillful manager may make a large return     a poor one none at all or between two employments interest and     risk remaining the same wages of superintendence sometimes     produce a wide difference   the portion too of the gross profit which forms the remuneration for the labor and skill of the dealer or producer is very different in different employments this is the explanation always given of the extraordinary rate of apothecaries’ profit there are cases again in which a considerable amount of labor and skill is required to conduct a business necessarily of limited extent in such cases a higher than common rate of profit is necessary to yield only the common rate of remuneration  all the natural monopolies meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances and not by law which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labor operate similarly between different employments of capital       in this passage mr mill points out distinctly that the movement     up and down in the wages of a manager are governed by the same     laws as those which regulate differences in the different rewards     of labor but yet he connects it improperly with capital it will     be seen that mr mill uses the term “gross profit” on the next     page in order to avoid the difficulty which rises unconsciously     in his mind of the anomalous presence of the wages of the manager     in the question of profit    § 3 general tendency of profits to an equality   after due allowance is made for these various causes of inequality namely difference in the risk or agreeableness of different employments and natural or artificial monopolies which give greater or less wages of superintendence the rate of profit on capital in all employments tends to an equality that portion of profit which is properly interest and which forms the real remuneration for abstinence is strictly the same at the same time and place whatever be the employment the rate of interest on equally good security does not vary according to the destination of the principal though it does vary from time to time very much according to the circumstances of the market  it is far otherwise with gross profit which though as will presently be seen it does not vary much from employment to employment varies very greatly from individual to individual and can scarcely be in any two cases the same it depends on the knowledge talents economy and energy of the capitalist himself or of the agents whom he employs on the accidents of personal connection and even on chance hardly any two dealers in the same trade even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap carry on their business at the same expense or turn over their capital in the same time that equal capitals give equal profits as a general maxim of trade would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge the effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified on an average whatever may be the occasional fluctuations the various employments of capital are on such a footing as to hold out not equal profits but equal expectations of profit to persons of average abilities and advantages by equal i mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety of an employment if the case were not so if there were evidently and to common experience more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others more persons would engage their capital in the business if on the contrary a business is not considered thriving if the chances of profit in it are thought to be inferior to those in other employments capital gradually leaves it or at least new capital is not attracted to it and by this change in the distribution of capital between the less profitable and the more profitable employments a sort of balance is restored  illustration parallel vertical lines ab and gd with horizontal lines eg                           and fc joining them       this may be easily shown by a diagram in which the capital in one     employment is represented by a b and which exceeds c d that     in another employment by the amount of a f it is not necessary     that the whole of the excess a f should be transferred to c d     to make the two capitals equal but only a e which added to c     d brings c d to an equality with e b   this equalizing process commonly described as the transfer of capital from one employment to another is not necessarily the onerous slow and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be in the first place it does not always imply the actual removal of capital already embarked in an employment in a rapidly progressive state of capital the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades even when a real transfer of capital is necessary it is by no means implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments the numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which in commercial nations unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels are the means by which the equalization is accomplished the process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital       “political economists say that capital sets toward the most     profitable trades and that it rapidly leaves the less profitable     and nonpaying trades but in ordinary countries this is a slow     process and some persons who want to have ocular demonstrations     of abstract truths have been inclined to doubt it because they     could not see it the process would be visible enough if you could     only see the books of the billbrokers and the bankers if the     irontrade ceases to be as profitable as usual less iron is sold     the fewer the sales the fewer the bills and in consequence the     number of iron bills at the banks is diminished on the other     hand if in consequence of a bad harvest the corn trade becomes     on a sudden profitable immediately ‘corn bills’ are created in     large numbers and if good are discounted at the banks thus     capital runs as surely and instantly where it is most wanted and     where there is most to be made of it as water runs to find its     level”177   in the case of an altogether declining trade in which it is necessary that the production should be not occasionally varied but greatly and permanently diminished or perhaps stopped altogether the process of extricating the capital is no doubt tardy and difficult and almost always attended with considerable loss much of the capital fixed in machinery buildings permanent works etc being either not applicable to any other purpose or only applicable after expensive alterations and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss namely by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out there is besides in totally changing the destination of a capital so great a sacrifice of established connection and of acquired skill and experience that people are always very slow in resolving upon it and hardly ever do so until long after a change of fortune has become hopeless  in general then although profits are very different to different individuals and to the same individual in different years there can not be much diversity at the same time and place in the average profits of different employments other than the standing differences necessary to compensate for difference of attractiveness except for short periods or when some great permanent revulsion has overtaken a particular trade it is true that to persons with the same amount of original means there is more chance of making a large fortune in some employments than in others but it would be found that in those same employments bankruptcies also are more frequent and that the chance of greater success is balanced by a greater probability of complete failure    § 4 the cause of the existence of any profit the advances of capitalists consist of wages of labor   the preceding remarks have i hope sufficiently elucidated what is meant by the common phrase “the ordinary rate of profit” and the sense in which and the limitations under which this ordinary rate has a real existence it now remains to consider what causes determine its amount  the cause of profit is that labor produces more than is required for its support the reason why capital yields a profit is because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which is required to produce them so that if a capitalist supplies a party of laborers with these things on condition of receiving all they produce they will in addition to reproducing their own necessaries and instruments have a portion of their time remaining to work for the capitalist we thus see that profit arises not from the incident of exchange but from the productive power of labor and the general profit of the country is always what the productive power of labor makes it whether any exchange takes place or not i proceed in expansion of the considerations thus briefly indicated to exhibit more minutely the mode in which the rate of profit is determined  i assume throughout the state of things which where the laborers and capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration of the laborer that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity the laborer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand sufficient for his temporary support but in the latter case the laborer is to that extent really a capitalist investing capital in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds necessary for carrying it on and even in the former case he may be looked upon in the same light since contributing his labor at less than the market price he may be regarded as lending the difference to his employer and receiving it back with interest on whatever principle computed from the proceeds of the enterprise  the capitalist then may be assumed to make all the advances and receive all the produce his profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount advanced       for example if a advances 8000 bushels of corn to laborers in     return for 10000 yards of cloth and if one bushel of corn sells     for the same sum as one yard of cloth his profit consists of     2000 yards of cloth the ratio of the excess 2000 to 8000     the outlay or 25 per cent is the rate of profit it is not the     ratio of 2000 to 10000   but what do the advances consist of it is for the present necessary to suppose that the capitalist does not pay any rent has not to purchase the use of any appropriated natural agent the nature of rent however we have not yet taken into consideration and it will hereafter appear that no practical error on the question we are now examining is produced by disregarding it  if then leaving rent out of the question we inquire in what it is that the advances of the capitalist for purposes of production consist we shall find that they consist of wages of labor  a large portion of the expenditure of every capitalist consists in the direct payment of wages what does not consist of this is composed of materials and implements including buildings but materials and implements are produced by labor and as our supposed capitalist is not meant to represent a single employment but to be a type of the productive industry of the whole country we may suppose that he makes his own tools and raises his own materials he does this by means of previous advances which again consist wholly of wages if we suppose him to buy the materials and tools instead of producing them the case is not altered he then repays to a previous producer the wages which that previous producer has paid it is true he repays it to him with a profit and if he had produced the things himself he himself must have had that profit on this part of his outlay as well as on every other part the fact however remains that in the whole process of production beginning with the materials and tools and ending with the finished product all the advances have consisted of nothing but wages except that certain of the capitalists concerned have for the sake of general convenience had their share of profit paid to them before the operation was completed       this idea may be more clear perhaps if we imagine a large     corporation not only making woolen cloth but owning     sheepranches where the raw materials are produced the shops     where all machinery is made and who even produce on their own     property all the food clothing shelter and consumption of the     laborers employed by them a line of division may be passed     through the returns in all these branches of the industry     separating what is wages from what is profit then it can be     easily imagined that all the returns on one side representing     profits go to capitalists no matter whether they are thousands     in number or only one capitalist typifying the rest or a single     corporation acting for many small capitalists    § 5 the rate of profit depends on the cost of labor   it thus appears that the two elements on which and which alone the gains of the capitalists depend are first the magnitude of the produce in other words the productive power of labor and secondly the proportion of that produce obtained by the laborers themselves the ratio which the remuneration of the laborers bears to the amount they produce  we thus arrive at the conclusion of ricardo and others that the rate of profits depends upon wages rising as wages fall and falling as wages rise in adopting however this doctrine i must insist upon making a most necessary alteration in its wording instead of saying that profits depend on wages let us say what ricardo really meant that they depend on the cost of labor       this is an entirely different question from that concerning the     rate of wages before discussed book ii chap ii that had to do     with the amount of the capital which each laborer on an average     received as real wages and this average rate was affected by the     number of competitors for labor as compared with the existing     capital taking into account the nature of the industries in a     country an increase of population bringing more laborers to     compete for employment will lower the average amount of real     wages received by each one and a decrease of population will     bring about the reverse the rate of wages however now that we     are considering the matter from the point of view of the     capitalist is but one of the things to be considered affecting     cost of labor the former question was one as to the     distribution of capital the latter is one as to the amount by     which the total production is greater than the total capital     advanced since all capital consists of advances to labor the     present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances     compared with the quantity returned that is the relation of the     total capital to the total production arising from the use of that     capital in the diagram before used p 179 the question is not     how the contents of circle b are to be distributed but the     relative size of circle b to circle a in order to produce circle     a it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle b   wages and the cost of labor what labor brings in to the laborer and what it costs to the capitalist are ideas quite distinct and which it is of the utmost importance to keep so for this purpose it is essential not to designate them as is almost always done by the same name wages in public discussions both oral and printed being looked upon from the same point of view of the payers much oftener than from that of the receivers nothing is more common than to say that wages are high or low meaning only that the cost of labor to the capitalist is high or low the reverse of this would be oftener the truth the cost of labor is frequently at its highest where wages are lowest this may arise from two causes 1 in the first place the labor though cheap may be inefficient       the facts presented by mr brassey178 very fully illustrate this     principle although french workmen in their shipyards receive     less wages for the same kind of work than the english workmen in     english yards yet it costs less per ton to build ships in england     than in france the same correspondence between high wages and     efficient work was found to be true of railway construction in     different parts of the world with different character varying     amounts of industrial energy varying intelligence and endurance     different people do not have the same efficiency of labor it is     ascertained that inefficiency is as a rule accompanied by low     wages even though wages paid for ordinary labor in constructing     railways were in india only from nine to twelve cents a day and     in england from seventyfive to eightyseven cents a day yet it     cost as much to build a mile of railway in india as in england     the english laborer gave a full equivalent for his higher wages     moreover while an english weaver tends from two to three times as     many looms as his russian competitor the workman in the united     states it is said will tend even more than the englishman in     american sailingvessels also a less number of sailors     relatively to the tonnage is required than in english     sailingships mr brassey besides came to the conclusion that     the working power or efficiency of ordinary english laborers was     to the french as five to three   2 the other cause which renders wages and the cost of labor no real criteria of one another is the varying costliness of the articles which the laborer consumes if these are cheap wages in the sense which is of importance to the laborer may be high and yet the cost of labor may be low if dear the laborer may be wretchedly off though his labor may cost much to the capitalist this last is the condition of a country overpeopled in relation to its land in which food being dear the poorness of the laborer’s real reward does not prevent labor from costing much to the purchaser and low wages and low profits coexist the opposite case is exemplified in the united states of america the laborer there enjoys a greater abundance of comforts than in any other country of the world except some of the newest colonies but owing to the cheap price at which these comforts can be obtained combined with the great efficiency of the labor the cost of labor to the capitalist is considerably lower than in europe it must be so since the rate of profit is higher as indicated by the rate of interest which is six per cent at new york when it is three or three and a quarter per cent in london  the cost of labor then is in the language of mathematics a function of three variables 1 the efficiency of labor 2 the wages of labor meaning thereby the real reward or real wages of the laborer and 3 the greater or less cost179 at which the articles composing that real reward can be produced or purchased it is plain that the cost of labor to the capitalist must be influenced by each of these three circumstances and by no others these therefore are also the circumstances which determine the rate of profit and it can not be in any way affected except through one or other of them       the efficiency of labor in this connection is highly important     in its practical aspects and as affecting the labor question     because as a function of cost of labor that is as an element     affecting the quantity of things advanced to the laborers in     comparison with the quantity of things returned to the employer     it includes the whole influence of machinery laborsaving     devices and the results of invention the quantity of produce     depends for a given advance on the kind of machinery the speed     with which it is run and on the general state of the arts and     industrial inventions the extent to which the productive capacity     of a single laborer has been increased in the united states has     been almost incredible instead of weaving cloth by hand as was     done a hundred years ago “one operative in lowell working one     year can produce the cotton fabric needed for the year’s supply     of 1500 to 1800 chinese” moreover there is no question as to     the fact that no nation in the world compares with ours in the     power to invent construct and manage the most ingenious and     complicated machinery the inventive faculty belongs to every     class in our country and in studying cost of labor it must be     well borne in mind that the efficiency of american labor     particularly as combined with mechanical appliances is one of the     great causes of our enormous production the result of this for     instance has been that without lowering profits although the     price of cloth has been greatly reduced employers have been able     to raise the wages of operatives and shorten their hours of     labor because machinery has so vastly increased the production     for a given outlay as one of a few facts showing this tendency in     the last fifty years note the following table taken from the     books of the namquit cottonmill in bristol rhode island      kind of labor                    1841   1884     cardroom help per week          328   540     cardstrippers per week           498    600     weavers per week                  475    600     cardingroom overseer per week    700   1350      the hours per week have decreased in the same time from 84 to 66     while the product of the mill in pounds has increased 25 per cent     it may be unnecessary perhaps to say that these figures     represent the current wages in other mills at the same periods     and that these facts can be sustained by the records of other     mills      in its economic effect we must also consider under efficiency     the whole question of natural advantages of soil climate and     natural resources laborers of the same skill paid the same real     wages of the same cost will produce a vastly greater amount of     wheat in dakota than in vermont or england this is the chief     reason why profits are so high in the united states in many     industries we have very marked natural advantages which permits a     high reward to labor and yet yields a high profit to the     capitalist this applies not merely to agriculture but to all the     extractive industries such as the production of petroleum wood     copper etc      in short the whole matter of ease and difficulty of production     of high or low cost of production taking it in the sense of great     or little sacrifice compare carefully book iii chap ii § 4     comes in under the element of efficiency in cost of labor the     reader can not be too strongly urged to connect different parts of     the economic system together and the questions of cost of labor     and cost of production are of paramount importance to a proper     understanding of political economy   if labor generally became more efficient without being more highly rewarded if without its becoming less efficient its remuneration fell no increase taking place in the cost of the articles composing that remuneration or if those articles became less costly without the laborers obtaining more of them in any one of these three cases profits would rise if on the contrary labor became less efficient as it might do from diminished bodily vigor in the people destruction of fixed capital or deteriorated education or if the laborer obtained a higher remuneration without any increased cheapness in the things composing it or if without his obtaining more that which he did obtain became more costly profits in all these cases would suffer a diminution and there is no other combination of circumstances in which the general rate of profit of a country in all employments indifferently can either fall or rise       the connection of profit with the three constituents of cost of     labor may probably be better seen by aid of the following     illustration it being premised that as yet money is not used and     that the laborers are paid in the articles which their money wages     would have bought had money been used for simplicity we will     suppose that all articles of the laborer’s consumption are     represented by corn imagine a large woolenmill employing 500     men and paying them in corn and suppose that one yard of woolen     cloth exchanges for one bushel of corn in the open market in the     beginning with a given condition of efficiency suppose that each     man produces on an average 1200 yards of cloth for which he is     paid 1000 bushels of corn      500 men each producing 1200 yards give a total product of     600000 yards     500 men each paid 1000 bushels cause an outlay of 500000     yards     profit 100000 yards      1 now suppose a change increasing the efficiency of labor to     such an extent that each laborer produces 1300 instead of 1200     yards then the account will stand if the other elements remain     unchanged      500 men each producing 1300 yards give a total product of     650000 yards     500 men each paid 1000 bushels cause an outlay of 500000     yards     profit 150000 yards      2 if efficiency and the cost of producing food remain the same     as at first suppose a change to occur which raises the quantity     of corn each laborer receives from 1000 to 1100 or as it is     called increases his real wages—then the account will be      500 men each producing 1200 yards give a total product of     600000 yards     500 men each paid 1100 bushels cause an outlay of 550000     yards     profit 50000 yards      3 if efficiency and real wages remain the same suppose such an     increase in the cost to the employers of obtaining corn that they     are obliged to give one and one tenth yard of their goods for one     bushel of corn 1000 bushels of corn costing them 1100 yards of     cloth then the statement will read      500 men each producing 1200 yards give a total product of     600000 yards     500 men each paid 1000 bushels cause an outlay of 550000     yards     profit 50000 yards     chapter vi of rent    § 1 rent the effect of a natural monopoly   the requisites of production being labor capital and natural agents the only person besides the laborer and the capitalist whose consent is necessary to production and who can claim a share of the produce as the price of that consent is the person who by the arrangements of society possesses exclusive power over some natural agent the land is the principal of the natural agents which are capable of being appropriated and the consideration paid for its use is called rent landed proprietors are the only class of any numbers or importance who have a claim to a share in the distribution of the produce through their ownership of something which neither they nor any one else have produced if there be any other cases of a similar nature they will be easily understood when the nature and laws of rent are comprehended  it is at once evident that rent is the effect of a monopoly the reason why landowners are able to require rent for their land is that it is a commodity which many want and which no one can obtain but from them if all the land of the country belonged to one person he could fix the rent at his pleasure this case however is nowhere known to exist and the only remaining supposition is that of free competition the landowners being supposed to be as in fact they are too numerous to combine       the ratio of the land to the cultivators shows the limited     quantity of land it is very desirable to keep the connection of     one part of the subject with another wherever possible     “agricultural rent as it actually exists” says mr cairnes180     truly “is not a consequence of the monopoly of the soil but of     its diminishing productiveness” the doctrine of rent depends upon     the law of diminishing returns and it is only by the pressure of     population upon land that the lessened productiveness of land     whether because of poorer qualities or poorer situations is made     apparent or to take things in their natural sequence an     increase of population necessitates more food and this implies a     resort to more expensive methods or poorer soils so soon as land     is pushed to the extent that it will not yield an increased crop     for the same application of labor and capital as formerly     different qualities of land then being in cultivation at the     same time the better qualities must of course yield a greater     return than the poorer and the conditions then exist under which     land pays rent those therefore who admit the law of diminishing     returns are inevitably led to the doctrine of rent    § 2 no land can pay rent except land of such quality or situation as exists in less quantity than the demand   a thing which is limited in quantity even though its possessors do not act in concert is still a monopolized article but even when monopolized a thing which is the gift of nature and requires no labor or outlay as the condition of its existence will if there be competition among the holders of it command a price only if it exist in less quantity than the demand  if the whole land of a country were required for cultivation all of it might yield a rent but in no country of any extent do the wants of the population require that all the land which is capable of cultivation should be cultivated the food and other agricultural produce which the people need and which they are willing and able to pay for at a price which remunerates the grower may always be obtained without cultivating all the land sometimes without cultivating more than a small part of it the more fertile lands or those in the more convenient situations being of course preferred there is always therefore some land which can not in existing circumstances pay any rent and no land ever pays rent unless in point of fertility or situation it belongs to those superior kinds which exist in less quantity than the demand—which can not be made to yield all the produce required for the community unless on terms still less advantageous than the resort to less favored soils 1 the worst land which can be cultivated as a means of subsistence is that which will just replace the seed and the food of the laborers employed on it together with what dr chalmers calls their secondaries that is the laborers required for supplying them with tools and with the remaining necessaries of life whether any given land is capable of doing more than this is not a question of political economy but of physical fact the supposition leaves nothing for profits nor anything for the laborers except necessaries the land therefore can only be cultivated by the laborers themselves or else at a pecuniary loss and a fortiori can not in any contingency afford a rent 2 the worst land which can be cultivated as an investment for capital is that which after replacing the seed not only feeds the agricultural laborers and their secondaries but affords them the current rate of wages which may extend to much more than mere necessaries and leaves for those who have advanced the wages of these two classes of laborers a surplus equal to the profit they could have expected from any other employment of their capital 3 whether any given land can do more than this is not merely a physical question but depends partly on the market value of agricultural produce what the land can do for the laborers and for the capitalist beyond feeding all whom it directly or indirectly employs of course depends upon what the remainder of the produce can be sold for the higher the market value of produce the lower are the soils to which cultivation can descend consistently with affording to the capital employed the ordinary rate of profit  as however differences of fertility slide into one another by insensible gradations and differences of accessibility that is of distance from markets do the same and since there is land so barren that it could not pay for its cultivation at any price it is evident that whatever the price may be there must in any extensive region be some land which at that price will just pay the wages of the cultivators and yield to the capital employed the ordinary profit and no more until therefore the price rises higher or until some improvement raises that particular land to a higher place in the scale of fertility it can not pay any rent it is evident however that the community needs the produce of this quality of land since if the lands more fertile or better situated than it could have sufficed to supply the wants of society the price would not have risen so high as to render its cultivation profitable this land therefore will be cultivated and we may lay it down as a principle that so long as any of the land of a country which is fit for cultivation and not withheld from it by legal or other factitious obstacles is not cultivated the worst land in actual cultivation in point of fertility and situation together pays no rent    § 3 the rent of land is the excess of its return above the return to the worst land in cultivation   if then of the land in cultivation the part which yields least return to the labor and capital employed on it gives only the ordinary profit of capital without leaving anything for rent a standard ie the “margin of cultivation” is afforded for estimating the amount of rent which will be yielded by all other land any land yields just as much more than the ordinary profits of stock as it yields more than what is returned by the worst land in cultivation the surplus is what the farmer can afford to pay as rent to the landlord and since if he did not so pay it he would receive more than the ordinary rate of profit the competition of other capitalists that competition which equalizes the profits of different capitals will enable the landlord to appropriate it the rent therefore which any land will yield is the excess of its produce beyond what would be returned to the same capital if employed on the worst land in cultivation  it has been denied that there can be any land in cultivation which pays no rent because landlords it is contended would not allow their land to be occupied without payment inferior land however does not usually occupy without interruption many square miles of ground it is dispersed here and there with patches of better land intermixed and the same person who rents the better land obtains along with it the inferior soils which alternate with it he pays a rent nominally for the whole farm but calculated on the produce of those parts alone however small a portion of the whole which are capable of returning more than the common rate of profit it is thus scientifically true that the remaining parts pay no rent       this point seems to need some illustration suppose that all the     lands in a community are of five different grades of     productiveness when the price of agricultural produce was such     that grades one two and three all came into cultivation lands     of poorer quality would not be cultivated when a man rents a     farm he always gets land of varying degrees of fertility within     its limits now in determining what he ought to pay as rent the     farmer will agree to give that which will still leave him a profit     on his working capital if in his fields he finds land which would     not enter into the question of rental because it did not yield     more than the profit on working it after he rented the farm he     would find it to his interest to cultivate it simply because it     yielded him a profit and because he was not obliged to pay rent     upon it if required to pay rent for it he would lose the     ordinary rate of profit would have no reason for cultivating it     of course and would throw it out of cultivation moreover     suppose that lands down to grade three paid rent when a took the     farm now if the price of produce rises slightly grade four may     pay something but possibly not enough to warrant any rent going     to a landlord a will put capital on it for this return but     certainly not until the price warrants it that is not until the     price will return him at least the cost of working the land     plus the profit on his outlay but the community needed this     land or the price would not have gone up to the point which makes     possible its cultivation even for a profit without rent there     must always be somewhere some land affected in just this way    § 4 —or to the capital employed in the least advantageous circumstances   let us however suppose that there were a validity in this objection which can by no means be conceded to it that when the demand of the community had forced up food to such a price as would remunerate the expense of producing it from a certain quality of soil it happened nevertheless that all the soil of that quality was withheld from cultivation the increase of produce which the wants of society required would for the time be obtained wholly as it always is partially not by an extension of cultivation but by an increased application of labor and capital to land already cultivated  now we have already seen that this increased application of capital other things being unaltered is always attended with a smaller proportional return the rise of price enables measures to be taken for increasing the produce which could not have been taken with profit at the previous price the farmer uses more expensive manures or manures land which he formerly left to nature or procures lime or marl from a distance as a dressing for the soil or pulverizes or weeds it more thoroughly or drains irrigates or subsoils portions of it which at former prices would not have paid the cost of the operation and so forth the farmer or improver will only consider whether the outlay he makes for the purpose will be returned to him with the ordinary profit and not whether any surplus will remain for rent even therefore if it were the fact that there is never any land taken into cultivation for which rent and that too of an amount worth taking into consideration was not paid it would be true nevertheless that there is always some agricultural capital which pays no rent because it returns nothing beyond the ordinary rate of profit this capital being the portion of capital last applied—that to which the last addition to the produce was due or to express the essentials of the case in one phrase that which is applied in the least favorable circumstances but the same amount of demand and the same price which enable this least productive portion of capital barely to replace itself with the ordinary profit enable every other portion to yield a surplus proportioned to the advantage it possesses and this surplus it is which competition enables the landlord to appropriate       if land were all occupied and of only one grade the first     installment of labor and capital produced we will say twenty     bushels of wheat when the price of wheat rose and it became     profitable to resort to greater expense on the soil a second     installment of the same amount of labor and capital when applied     however only yielded fifteen bushels more a third ten bushels     more and a fourth five bushels more the soil now gives fifty     bushels only under the highest pressure but if it was profitable     to invest the same installment of labor and capital simply for the     five bushels that at first had received a return of twenty     bushels the price must have gone up so that five bushels should     sell for as much as the twenty did formerly so mutatis     mutandis of installments second and third so that if the demand     is such as to require all of the fifty bushels the agricultural     capital which produced the five bushels will be the standard     according to which the rent of the capital which grew twenty     fifteen and ten bushels respectively is measured the principle     is exactly the same as if equal installments of capital and labor     were invested on four different grades of land returning twenty     fifteen ten and five bushels for each installment or as if in     the table on page 240 a b c and d each represented different     installments of the same amount of labor and capital put upon the     same spot of ground instead of being as there put upon     different grades of land   the rent of all land is measured by the excess of the return to the whole capital employed on it above what is necessary to replace the capital with the ordinary rate of profit or in other words above what the same capital would yield if it were all employed in as disadvantageous circumstances as the least productive portion of it whether that least productive portion of capital is rendered so by being employed on the worst soil or by being expended in extorting more produce from land which already yielded as much as it could be made to part with on easier terms  it will be true that the farmer requires the ordinary rate of profit on the whole of his capital that whatever it returns to him beyond this he is obliged to pay to the landlord but will not consent to pay more that there is a portion of capital applied to agriculture in such circumstances of productiveness as to yield only the ordinary profits and that the difference between the produce of this and of any other capital of similar amount is the measure of the tribute which that other capital can and will pay under the name of rent to the landlord this constitutes a law of rent as near the truth as such a law can possibly be though of course modified or disturbed in individual cases by pending contracts individual miscalculations the influence of habit and even the particular feelings and dispositions of the persons concerned       the law of rent in the economic sense operates in the united     states as truly as elsewhere although there is no separate class     of landlords here with us almost all land is owned by the     cultivator so that two functions those of the landlord and     farmer are both united in one person although one payment is     made it is still just as distinctly made up of two parts one of     which is a payment to the owner for the superior quality of his     soil and the other a payment to the same person if the owner is     the cultivator of profit on the farmer’s working capital land     which in the united states will only return enough to pay a profit     on this capital can not pay any rent and land which can pay more     than a profit on this working capital returns that excess as     rent even if the farmer is also the owner and landlord the     principle which regulates the amount of that excess—which is the     essential point—is the principle which determines the amount of     economic rent and it holds true in the united states or finland     provided only that different grades of land are called into     cultivation the governing principle is the same no matter     whether a payment is made to one man as profit and to another as     rent or whether the two payments are made to the same man in two     capacities it has been urged that the law of rent does not hold     in the united states because “the price of grain and other     agricultural produce has not risen in proportion to the increase     of our numbers as it ought to have done if ricardo’s theory were     true but has fallen since 1830 though since that time our     population has been more than tripled”181 this overlooks the     fact that we have not even yet taken up all our best agricultural     lands so that for some products the law of diminishing     productiveness has not yet shown itself the reason is that the     extension of our railway system has only of late years brought the     really good grainlands into cultivation the fact that there has     been no rise in agricultural products is due to the enormous     extent of marvelously fertile grainlands in the west and to the     cheapness of transportation from those districts to the seaboard      for a general understanding of the law of rent the following table     will show how under constant increase of population represented     by four different advances of population in the first column     first the best and then the poorer lands are brought into     cultivation we will suppose 1 that the most fertile land a at     first pays no rent then 2 when more food is wanted than land a     can supply it will be profitable to till land b but which as     yet pays no rent but if eighteen bushels are a sufficient return     to a given amount of labor and capital then when an equal amount     of labor and capital engaged on a returns twentyfour bushels six     of that are beyond the ordinary profit and form the rent on land     a and so on c will next be the line of comparison and then d     as the poorer soils are cultivated the rent of a increases   population

name of rent many payments are commonly included which are not a remuneration for the original powers of the land itself but for capital expended on it the buildings are as distinct a thing from the farm as the stock or the timber on it and what is paid for them can no more be called rent of land than a payment for cattle would be if it were the custom that the landlord should stock the farm for the tenant the buildings like the cattle are not land but capital regularly consumed and reproduced and all payments made in consideration for them are properly interest  but with regard to capital actually sunk in improvements and not requiring periodical renewal but spent once for all in giving the land a permanent increase of productiveness it appears to me that the return made to such capital loses altogether the character of profits and is governed by the principles of rent it is true that a landlord will not expend capital in improving his estate unless he expects from the improvement an increase of income surpassing the interest of his outlay prospectively this increase of income may be regarded as profit but when the expense has been incurred and the improvement made the rent of the improved land is governed by the same rules as that of the unimproved       mr carey as well as bastiat has declared that there is a law of     increasing returns from land he points out that everything now     existing could be reproduced today at a less cost than that     involved in its original production owing to our advance in     skill knowledge and all the arts of production that for     example it costs less to make an axe now than it did five hundred     years ago so also with a farm since a farm of a given amount of     productiveness can be brought into cultivation at less cost today     than that originally spent upon it the gain of society has we     all admit been such that we produce almost everything at a less     cost now than long ago but to class a farm and an axe together     overlooks in the most remarkable way the fact that land can not     be created by labor and capital while axes can and that too     indefinitely nor can the produce from the land be increased     indefinitely at a diminishing cost this is sometimes denied by     the appeal to facts “it can be abundantly proved that if we take     any two periods sufficiently distant to afford a fair test     whether fifty or one hundred or five hundred years the production     of the land relatively to the labor employed upon it has     progressively become greater and greater”182 but this does not     prove that an existing tendency to diminishing returns has not     been more than offset by the progress of the arts and     improvements “the advance of a ship against wind and tide is no     proof that there is no wind and tide”   in a work entitled “the past the present and the future” mr carey takes a ground of objection to the ricardo theory of rent namely that in point of historical fact the lands first brought under cultivation are not the most fertile but the barren lands “we find the settler invariably occupying the high and thin lands requiring little clearing and no drainage with the growth of population and wealth other soils yielding a larger return to labor are always brought into activity with a constantly increasing return to the labor expended upon them”  in whatever order the lands come into cultivation those which when cultivated yield the least return in proportion to the labor required for their culture will always regulate the price of agricultural produce and all other lands will pay a rent simply equivalent to the excess of their produce over this minimum whatever unguarded expressions may have been occasionally used in describing the law of rent these two propositions are all that was ever intended by it if indeed mr carey could show that the return to labor from the land agricultural skill and science being supposed the same is not a diminishing return he would overthrow a principle much more fundamental than any law of rent but in this he has wholly failed       another objection taken against the law of diminishing returns     and so against the law of rent is that the potential increase of     food eg of a grain of wheat is far greater than that of     man183 no one disputes the fact that one grain of wheat can     reproduce itself more times than man and that too in a geometric     increase but not without land a grain of wheat needs land in     which it can multiply itself and this necessary element of its     increase is limited and it is the very thing which limits the     multiplication of the grains of wheat on the same piece of land     one can not get more than what comes from one act of reproduction     in the grain if one grain produces 100 of its kind doubling the     capital will not repeatedly cause a geometric increase in the     ratio of reproduction of each grain on this same land so that one     grain by one process produces of its kind 200 400 800 or     1600 because you can not multiply the land in any such ratio as     would accompany this potential reduplication of the grain this     objection would not seem worth answering were it not that it     furnishes some difficulty to really honest inquirers   others again allege as an objection against ricardo that if all land were of equal fertility it might still yield a rent but ricardo says precisely the same it is also distinctly a portion of ricardo’s doctrine that even apart from differences of situation the land of a country supposed to be of uniform fertility would all of it on a certain supposition pay rent namely if the demand of the community required that it should all be cultivated and cultivated beyond the point at which a further application of capital begins to be attended with a smaller proportional return       this is simply the question before discussed whether if only     one class of land were cultivated some agricultural capital would     pay rent or not it all depends on the fact whether population—and     so the demand for food—has increased to the point where it calls     out a recognition of the diminishing productiveness of the soil     in that case different capitals would be invested so that there     would be different returns to the same amount of capital and the     prior or more advantageous investments of capital on the land     would yield more than the ordinary rate of profit which could be     claimed as rent      a l perry184 admits the law of diminishing returns but holds     that “as land is capital and as every form of capital may be     loaned or rented and thus become fruitful in the hands of     another the rent of land does not differ essentially in its     nature from the rent of buildings in cities or from the interest     of money” henry george admits ricardo’s law of rent to its full     extent but very curiously says “irrespective of the increase of     population the effect of improvements in methods of production     and exchange is to increase rent the effect of laborsaving     improvements will be to increase the production of wealth now     for the production of wealth two things are required labor and     land therefore the effect of laborsaving improvements will be     to extend the demand for land and wherever the limit of the     quality of land in use is reached to bring into cultivation lands     of less natural productiveness or to extend cultivation on the     same lands to a point of lower natural productiveness and thus     while the primary effect of laborsaving improvements is to     increase the power of labor the secondary effect is to extend     cultivation and where this lowers the margin of cultivation to     increase rent”185 francis bowen186 rejects ricardo’s law and     says “rent depends not on the increase but on the distribution     of the population”—asserting that the existence of large cities     and towns determines the amount of rent paid by neighboring     land187    § 6 rent does not enter into the cost of production of agricultural produce   rent does not really form any part of the expenses of agricultural production or of the advances of the capitalist the grounds on which this assertion was made are now apparent it is true that all tenantfarmers and many other classes of producers pay rent but we have now seen that whoever cultivates land paying a rent for it gets in return for his rent an instrument of superior power to other instruments of the same kind for which no rent is paid the superiority of the instrument is in exact proportion to the rent paid for it if a few persons had steamengines of superior power to all others in existence but limited by physical laws to a number short of the demand the rent which a manufacturer would be willing to pay for one of these steamengines could not be looked upon as an addition to his outlay because by the use of it he would save in his other expenses the equivalent of what it cost him without it he could not do the same quantity of work unless at an additional expense equal to the rent the same thing is true of land the real expenses of production are those incurred on the worst land or by the capital employed in the least favorable circumstances this land or capital pays as we have seen no rent but the expenses to which it is subject cause all other land or agricultural capital to be subjected to an equivalent expense in the form of rent whoever does pay rent gets back its full value in extra advantages and the rent which he pays does not place him in a worse position than but only in the same position as his fellowproducer who pays no rent but whose instrument is one of inferior efficiency       soils are of every grade some which if cultivated might replace     the capital but give no profit some give a slight but not an     ordinary profit some the ordinary profit that is “there is a     point up to which it is profitable to cultivate and beyond which     it is not profitable to cultivate the price of corn will not for     any long time remain at a higher rate than is sufficient to cover     with ordinary profit the cost of that portion of the general crop     which is raised at greatest expense”188 for similar reasons the     price will not remain at a lower rate if then the cost of     production of grain is determined by that land which replaces the     capital yields only the ordinary profit and pays no rent rent     forms no part of this cost since that land does not and can not     pay any rent mcleod189 however says it is not the cost of     production which regulates the value of agricultural produce but     the value which regulates the cost      book iii exchange     chapter i of value    § 1 definitions of value in use exchange value and price   it is evident that of the two great departments of political economy the production of wealth and its distribution the consideration of value has to do with the latter alone and with that only so far as competition and not usage or custom is the distributing agency  the use of a thing in political economy means its capacity to satisfy a desire or serve a purpose diamonds have this capacity in a high degree and unless they had it would not bear any price value in use or as mr de quincey calls it teleologic value is the extreme limit of value in exchange the exchange value of a thing may fall short to any amount of its value in use but that it can ever exceed the value in use implies a contradiction it supposes that persons will give to possess a thing more than the utmost value which they themselves put upon it as a means of gratifying their inclinations  the word value when used without adjunct always means in political economy value in exchange  exchange value requires to be distinguished from price writers have employed price to express the value of a thing in relation to money—the quantity of money for which it will exchange by the price of a thing therefore we shall henceforth understand its value in money by the value or exchange value of a thing its general power of purchasing the command which its possession gives over purchasable commodities in general what is meant by command over commodities in general the same thing exchanges for a greater quantity of some commodities and for a very small quantity of others a coat may exchange for less bread this year than last if the harvest has been bad but for more glass or iron if a tax has been taken off those commodities or an improvement made in their manufacture has the value of the coat under these circumstances fallen or risen it is impossible to say all that can be said is that it has fallen in relation to one thing and risen in respect to another suppose for example that an invention has been made in machinery by which broadcloth could be woven at half the former cost the effect of this would be to lower the value of a coat and if lowered by this cause it would be lowered not in relation to bread only or to glass only but to all purchasable things except such as happened to be affected at the very time by a similar depressing cause those changes which originate in the commodities with which we compare it affect its value in relation to those commodities but those which originate in itself affect its value in relation to all commodities  there is such a thing as a general rise of prices all commodities may rise in their money price but there can not be a general rise of values it is a contradiction in terms a can only rise in value by exchanging for a greater quantity of b and c in which case these must exchange for a smaller quantity of a all things can not rise relatively to one another if one half of the commodities in the market rise in exchange value the very terms imply a fall of the other half and reciprocally the fall implies a rise things which are exchanged for one another can no more all fall or all rise than a dozen runners can each outrun all the rest or a hundred trees all overtop one another a general rise or a general fall of prices is merely tantamount to an alteration in the value of money and is a matter of complete indifference save in so far as it affects existing contracts for receiving and paying fixed pecuniary amounts  before commencing the inquiry into the laws of value and price i have one further observation to make i must give warning once for all that the cases i contemplate are those in which values and prices are determined by competition alone in so far only as they are thus determined can they be reduced to any assignable law the buyers must be supposed as studious to buy cheap as the sellers to sell dear       the reader is advised to study the definitions of value given by     other writers cairnes190 defines value as “the ratio in which     commodities in open market are exchanged against each other” f     a walker191 holds that “value is the power which an article     confers upon its possessor irrespective of legal authority or     personal sentiments of commanding in exchange for itself the     labor or the products of the labor of others” carey192 says     “value is the measure of the resistance to be overcome in     obtaining those commodities or things required for our purposes—of     the power of nature over man” value is thus with him the     antithesis of wealth which is according to carey the power of     man over nature in this school value is the service rendered by     any one who supplies the article for the use of another this is     also bastiat’s idea193 “le rapport de deux services     échangés” following bastiat a l perry194 defines value as     “always and everywhere the relation of mutual purchase established     between two services by their exchange” roscher195 explains     exchange value as “the quality which makes them exchangeable     against other goods” he also makes a distinction between utility     and value in use “utility is a quality of things themselves in     relation it is true to human wants value in use is a quality     imputed to them the result of man’s thought or his view of them     thus for instance in a beleaguered city the stores of food do     not increase in utility but their value in use does”     levasseur196 regards value as “the relation resulting from     exchange”—le rapport resultant de l’échange cherbuliez197     asserts that “the value of a product or of a service can be     expressed only as the products or services which it obtains in     exchange if i exchange the thing a against b a is the value     of b b is the value of a” jevons198 defines value as     “proportion in exchange”    § 2 conditions of value utility difficulty of attainment and transferableness   that a thing may have any value in exchange two conditions are necessary 1 it must be of some use that is as already explained it must conduce to some purpose satisfy some desire no one will pay a price or part with anything which serves some of his purposes to obtain a thing which serves none of them 2 but secondly the thing must not only have some utility there must also be some difficulty in its attainment       the question is one as to the conditions essential to the     existence of any value very justly cairnes199 adds also a third     condition “the possibility of transferring the possession of the     articles which are the subject of the exchange” for instance a     cargo of wheat at the bottom of the sea has value in use and     difficulty of attainment but it is not transferable jevons     following j b say maintains that “value depends entirely on     utility” if utility means the power to satisfy a desire things     which merely have utility and no difficulty of attainment could     have no exchange value200 f a walker201 believes that     “value depends wholly on the relation between demand and supply”     carey202 holds that value depends merely on the cost of     reproduction of the given article roscher203 finds that     exchange value is “based on a combination of value in use with     cost value” cherbuliez204 calls the conditions of value two     “the ability to give satisfaction and inability of attainment     without effort the first element is subjective it is determined     wholly by the needs or desires of the parties to the exchange the     second is objective it depends upon material considerations     which are the conditions of the existence of the thing and upon     which the needs of the persons exchanging have no influence     whatever” it is as usual one of cherbuliez’s clear expositions     a l perry205 states that “while value always takes its rise     in the desires of men it is never realized except through the     efforts of men and through these efforts as mutually     exchanged”   the difficulty of attainment which determines value is not always the same kind of difficulty 1 it sometimes consists in an absolute limitation of the supply there are things of which it is physically impossible to increase the quantity beyond certain narrow limits such are those wines which can be grown only in peculiar circumstances of soil climate and exposure such also are ancient sculptures pictures by the old masters rare books or coins or other articles of antiquarian curiosity among such may also be reckoned houses and buildingground in a town of definite extent       de quincey206 has presented some ingenious diagrams to represent     the operations of the two constituents of value in each of the     three following cases u represents the power of the article to     satisfy some desire and d difficulty of attainment in the first     case exchange value is not hindered by d from going up to any     height and so it rises and falls entirely according to the force     of u d being practically infinite the horizontal line exchange     value is not kept down by d but it rises just as far as u the     desires of purchasers may carry it    illustration vertical line d paralleled by shorter vertical line u d              and u connected at top of u by horizontal line  2 but there is another category embracing the majority of all things that are bought and sold in which the obstacle to attainment consists only in the labor and expense requisite to produce the commodity without a certain labor and expense it can not be had but when any one is willing to incur these there needs be no limit to the multiplication of the product if there were laborers enough and machinery enough cottons woolens or linens might be produced by thousands of yards for every single yard now manufactured       in case 2 the horizontal line representing exchange value     follows the force of d entirely the utility of the article is     very great but the value is only limited by the difficulty of     obtaining it so far as u is concerned exchange value can go up a     great distance but will go no higher than the point where the     article can be obtained the dotted lines underneath the     horizontal line indicate that the exchange value of articles in     this class tend to fall in value   illustration parallel vertical lines u and d u being longer joined by                several horizontal lines of exchange value  3 there is a third case intermediate between the two preceding and rather more complex which i shall at present merely indicate but the importance of which in political economy is extremely great there are commodities which can be multiplied to an indefinite extent by labor and expenditure but not by a fixed amount of labor and expenditure only a limited quantity can be produced at a given cost if more is wanted it must be produced at a greater cost to this class as has been often repeated agricultural produce belongs and generally all the rude produce of the earth and this peculiarity is a source of very important consequences one of which is the necessity of a limit to population and another the payment of rent       in case 3 articles like agricultural produce have a very great     power to satisfy desires and if scarce would have a high value     so far as u is concerned here also as in case 2 exchange     value might mount upward to almost any height but it can go no     higher than d permits in commodities of this class affected by     the law of diminishing returns the tendency is for d to increase     and so for exchange value to rise as indicated by the dotted     lines above that of the exchange value                        illustration same as before    § 3 commodities limited in quantity by the law of demand and supply general working of this law   these being the three classes in one or other of which all things that are bought and sold must take their place we shall consider them in their order and first of things absolutely limited in quantity such as ancient sculptures or pictures  of such things it is commonly said that their value depends on their scarcity others say that the value depends on the demand and supply but this statement requires much explanation the supply of a commodity is an intelligible expression it means the quantity offered for sale the quantity that is to be had at a given time and place by those who wish to purchase it but what is meant by the demand not the mere desire for the commodity a beggar may desire a diamond but his desire however great will have no influence on the price writers have therefore given a more limited sense to demand and have defined it the wish to possess combined with the power of purchasing207 to distinguish demand in this technical sense from the demand which is synonymous with desire they call the former effectual demand       general supply consists in the commodities offered in exchange for     other commodities general demand likewise if no money exists     consists in the commodities offered as purchasing power in     exchange for other commodities that is one can not increase the     demand for certain things without increasing the supply of some     articles which will be received in exchange for the desired     commodities demand is based upon the production of articles     having exchange value in its economic sense and the measure of     this demand is necessarily the quantity of commodities offered in     exchange for the desired goods general demand and supply are thus     reciprocal to each other but as soon as money or general     purchasing power is introduced mr cairnes208 defines “demand     as the desire for commodities or services seeking its end by an     offer of general purchasing power and supply as the desire for     general purchasing power seeking its end by an offer of specific     commodities or services” but many persons find a difficulty     because they insist upon separating the idea of supply from that     of demand owing to the fact that producers seem to be a distinct     class in the community different from consumers that they are in     reality the same persons can be easily explained by the following     statement “a certain number of people a b c d e f etc     are engaged in industrial occupations—a produces for b c d e     f b for a c d e f c for a b d e f and so on in each     case the producer and the consumers are distinct and hence by a     very natural fallacy it is concluded that the whole body of     consumers is distinct from the whole body of producers whereas     they consist of precisely the same persons”      but in regard to demand and supply of particular commodities not     general demand and supply the increase of the demand is not     necessarily followed by an increased supply or vice versa out     of the total production which constitutes general demand a     varying amount sometimes more sometimes less may be directed by     the desires of men to the purchase of some given thing this     should be borne in mind in connection with the future discussion     of overproduction the identity of general demand with general     supply shows there can be no general overproduction but so long     as there exists the possibility that the demand for a particular     commodity may diminish without a corresponding effect being     thereby produced on the supply of that commodity by a necessary     connection we see that there may be overproduction of particular     commodities that is a production in excess of the demand   the proper mathematical analogy between demand and supply is that of an equation if unequal at any moment competition equalizes them and the manner in which this is done is by an adjustment of the value if the demand increases the value rises if the demand diminishes the value falls again if the supply falls off the value rises and falls if the supply is increased the rise or the fall continues until the demand and supply are again equal to one another and the value which a commodity will bring in any market is no other than the value which in that market gives a demand just sufficient to carry off the existing or expected supply  mr cairnes209 finally defined market value as the price “which is sufficient and no more than sufficient to carry the existing supply over with such a surplus as circumstances may render advisable to meet the new supplies forthcoming” which is nothing more than a paraphrase of the words “existing or expected supply” just used by mr mill it seems unnecessary therefore that mr cairnes should have added “according to mr mill the actual market price is the price which equalizes supply and demand in a given market as i view the case the ‘proper market price’ is the price which equalizes supply and demand not as existing in the particular market but in the larger sense which i have assigned to the terms to this price the actual market price will according to my view approximate in proportion to the intelligence and knowledge of the dealers”  adam smith who introduced the expression “effectual demand” employed it to denote the demand of those who are willing and able to give for the commodity what he calls its natural price—that is the price which will enable it to be permanently produced and brought to market210  this then is the law of value with respect to all commodities not susceptible of being multiplied at pleasure    § 4 miscellaneous cases falling under this law   there are but few commodities which are naturally and necessarily limited in supply but any commodity whatever may be artificially so the monopolist can fix the value as high as he pleases short of what the consumer either could not or would not pay but he can only do so by limiting the supply monopoly value therefore does not depend on any peculiar principle but is a mere variety of the ordinary case of demand and supply  again though there are few commodities which are at all times and forever unsusceptible of increase of supply any commodity whatever may be temporarily so and with some commodities this is habitually the case agricultural produce for example can not be increased in quantity before the next harvest the quantity of corn already existing in the world is all that can be had for sometimes a year to come during that interval corn is practically assimilated to things of which the quantity can not be increased in the case of most commodities it requires a certain time to increase their quantity and if the demand increases then until a corresponding supply can be brought forward that is until the supply can accommodate itself to the demand the value will so rise as to accommodate the demand to the supply  there is another case the exact converse of this there are some articles of which the supply may be indefinitely increased but can not be rapidly diminished there are things so durable that the quantity in existence is at all times very great in comparison with the annual produce gold and the more durable metals are things of this sort and also houses the supply of such things might be at once diminished by destroying them but to do this could only be the interest of the possessor if he had a monopoly of the article and could repay himself for the destruction of a part by the increased value of the remainder the value therefore of such things may continue for a long time so low either from excess of supply or falling off in the demand as to put a complete stop to further production the diminution of supply by wearing out being so slow a process that a long time is requisite even under a total suspension of production to restore the original value during that interval the value will be regulated solely by supply and demand and will rise very gradually as the existing stock wears out until there is again a remunerating value and production resumes its course       the total value of gold and silver in the world is variously     estimated at from 10000000000 to 14000000000 while the     annual production of both gold and silver in the world during     1882211 was only 212000000 the loss of gold by abrasion is     about 11000 annually and of silver about 1700 but much depends     on the size of the coin a change in the annual production of the     precious metals can have a perceptible effect on their value only     after such a time as will permit the change to affect the existing     quantity in a way somewhat comparable with its previous amount     the quantity however of wheat produced is nearly all consumed     between harvests and the annual supply bears a very large ratio     to the existing quantity consequently the price of wheat will be     very seriously affected by the quantity coming from the annual     product   finally there are commodities of which though capable of being increased or diminished to a great and even an unlimited extent the value never depends upon anything but demand and supply this is the case in particular with the commodity labor of the value of which we have treated copiously in the preceding book and there are many cases besides in which we shall find it necessary to call in this principle to solve difficult questions of exchange value this will be particularly exemplified when we treat of international values that is of the terms of interchange between things produced in different countries or to speak more generally in distant places    § 5 commodities which are susceptible of indefinite multiplication without increase of cost law of their value cost of production   when the production of a commodity is the effect of labor and expenditure whether the commodity is susceptible of unlimited multiplication or not there is a minimum value which is the essential condition of its being permanently produced the value at any particular time is the result of supply and demand and is always that which is necessary to create a market for the existing supply but unless that value is sufficient to repay the cost of production and to afford besides the ordinary expectation of profit the commodity will not continue to be produced capitalists will not go on permanently producing at a loss when such profit is evidently not to be had if people do not actually withdraw their capital they at least abstain from replacing it when consumed the cost of production together with the ordinary profit may therefore be called the necessary price or value of all things made by labor and capital nobody willingly produces in the prospect of loss  when a commodity is not only made by labor and capital but can be made by them in indefinite quantity this necessary value the minimum with which the producers will be content is also if competition is free and active the maximum which they can expect if the value of a commodity is such that it repays the cost of production not only with the customary but with a higher rate of profit capital rushes to share in this extra gain and by increasing the supply of the article reduces its value this is not a mere supposition or surmise but a fact familiar to those conversant with commercial operations whenever a new line of business presents itself offering a hope of unusual profits and whenever any established trade or manufacture is believed to be yielding a greater profit than customary there is sure to be in a short time so large a production or importation of the commodity as not only destroys the extra profit but generally goes beyond the mark and sinks the value as much too low as it had before been raised too high until the oversupply is corrected by a total or partial suspension of further production as already intimated212 these variations in the quantity produced do not presuppose or require that any person should change his employment those whose business is thriving increase their produce by availing themselves more largely of their credit while those who are not making the ordinary profit restrict their operations and in manufacturing phrase work short time in this mode is surely and speedily effected the equalization not of profits perhaps but of the expectations of profit in different occupations  as a general rule then things tend to exchange for one another at such values as will enable each producer to be repaid the cost of production with the ordinary profit in other words such as will give to all producers the same rate of profit on their outlay but in order that the profit may be equal where the outlay that is the cost of production is equal things must on the average exchange for one another in the ratio of their cost of production things of which the cost of production is the same must be of the same value       mr mill has here used cost of production almost exactly in the     sense of cost of labor and as excluding profit while in the next     chapter he includes some part of profit in the analysis it will     be well for the sake of definiteness to collect the phrases     above in which he describes cost of production “unless that value     is sufficient to repay the cost of production and to afford     besides the ordinary expectation of profit the commodity will     not continue to be produced” “the cost of production together     with the ordinary profit may therefore be called the necessary     price or value” “it repays the cost of production not only     with the customary but with a higher rate of profit” “the     cost of production with the ordinary profit—in other words such     as will give to all producers the same rate of profit on their     outlay” “that the profit may be equal where the outlay that is     the cost of production is equal” this is a view which     distinctly uses cost of production in the sense of the outlay to     the capitalist or cost of labor in no other way can profit vary     with “cost of production” than in the sense that it is what a     given article “costs to the capitalist” but that is mr mill’s     definition of cost of labor p 227 it is however very     puzzling when in the next section he speaks of “the natural value     that is the cost of production” above value included cost of     production and profit also having thus pointed out what is mr     mill’s conception of cost of production it will remain for us in     the next chapter to consider whether any other view of it is more     satisfactory   adam smith and ricardo have called that value of a thing which is proportional to its cost of production its natural value or its natural price they meant by this the point about which the value oscillates and to which it always tends to return the center value toward which as adam smith expresses it the market value of a thing is constantly gravitating and any deviation from which is but a temporary irregularity which the moment it exists sets forces in motion tending to correct it on an average of years sufficient to enable the oscillations on one side of the central line to be compensated by those on the other the market value agrees with the natural value but it very seldom coincides exactly with it at any particular time the sea everywhere tends to a level but it never is at an exact level its surface is always ruffled by waves and often agitated by storms it is enough that no point at least in the open sea is permanently higher than another each place is alternately elevated and depressed but the ocean preserves its level    § 6 the value of these commodities confirm in the long run to their cost of production through the operation of demand and supply   the latent influence by which the values of things are made to conform in the long run to the cost of production is the variation that would otherwise take place in the supply of the commodity the supply would be increased if the thing continued to sell above the ratio of its cost of production and would be diminished if it fell below that ratio       if one dollar covers the expense of making one spade then when a     spade by virtue of a sudden demand rises in value to one dollar     and ten cents the manufacturers get an extra profit of ten cents     this could not long remain so because other capital would enter     this industry and so increase the supply that one spade would     sell for only one dollar then all would receive the average     profit if owing to a cessation of demand for spades the price     fell to ninety cents then the manufacturers would lose ten cents     on each one made and sold thereupon they would cease to do a     losing business capital would be withdrawn and spades would not     be made until the supply was suited to the necessary expense of     making them one dollar in this way whenever there is a     departure of the value from the normal cost there is set in     motion ipso facto a series of forces which automatically     restores the value to that cost so here again we see the nature     of an economic law the value may not often correspond exactly     with cost of production but there is a tendency in all values     to conform to that cost and this tendency they irresistibly obey     a body possessing weight does not move downward under all     circumstances stones may be thrown upward but the law of     gravitation holds true nevertheless   there is no need that there should be any actual alteration of supply and when there is the alteration if permanent is not the cause but the consequence of the alteration in value if indeed the supply could not be increased no diminution in the cost of production would lower the value but there is by no means any necessity that it should the mere possibility often suffices the dealers are aware of what would happen and their mutual competition makes them anticipate the result by lowering the price       before the electric light was yet known as a feasible means of     lighting in 1878 the mere rumor of edison’s invention before     it was made public and long before it became practicable caused     a serious fall in the price of gas stocks   it is therefore strictly correct to say that the value of things which can be increased in quantity at pleasure does not depend except accidentally and during the time necessary for production to adjust itself upon demand and supply on the contrary demand and supply depend upon it there is a demand for a certain quantity of the commodity at its natural or cost value and to that the supply in the long run endeavors to conform       mr cairnes213 fitly says “the supply of a commodity always     tends to adapt itself to the demand at the normal price i may     here say briefly that by the normal price of a commodity i mean     that price which suffices and no more than suffices to yield to     the producers what is considered to be the average and usual     remuneration on such sacrifices as they undergo”   when at any time it fails of so conforming it is either from miscalculation or from a change in some of the elements of the problem either in the natural value that is in the cost of production or in the demand from an alteration in public taste or in the number or wealth of the consumers if a value different from the natural value be necessary to make the demand equal to the supply the market value will deviate from the natural value but only for a time for the permanent tendency of supply is to conform itself to the demand which is found by experience to exist for the commodity when selling at its natural value if the supply is either more or less than this it is so accidentally and affords either more or less than the ordinary rate of profit which under free and active competition can not long continue to be the case  to recapitulate demand and supply govern the value of all things which can not be indefinitely increased except that even for them when produced by industry there is a minimum value determined by the cost of production but in all things which admit of indefinite multiplication demand and supply only determine the perturbations of value during a period which can not exceed the length of time necessary for altering the supply while thus ruling the oscillations of value they themselves obey a superior force which makes value gravitate toward cost of production and which would settle it and keep it there if fresh disturbing influences were not continually arising to make it again deviate     chapter ii ultimate analysis of cost of production    § 1 of labor the principal element in cost of production   the component elements of cost of production have been set forth in the first part of this inquiry214 the principal of them and so much the principal as to be nearly the sole was found to be labor what the production of a thing costs to its producer or its series of producers is the labor expended in producing it if we consider as the producer the capitalist who makes the advances the word labor may be replaced by the word wages what the produce costs to him is the wages which he has had to pay at the first glance indeed this seems to be only a part of his outlay since he has not only paid wages to laborers but has likewise provided them with tools materials and perhaps buildings these tools materials and buildings however were produced by labor and capital and their value like that of the article to the production of which they are subservient depends on cost of production which again is resolvable into labor the cost of production of broadcloth does not wholly consist in the wages of weavers which alone are directly paid by the clothmanufacturer it consists also of the wages of spinners and woolcombers and it may be added of shepherds all of which the clothier has paid for in the price of yarn it consists too of the wages of builders and brickmakers which he has reimbursed in the contract price of erecting his factory it partly consists of the wages of machinemakers ironfounders and miners and to these must be added the wages of the carriers who transported any of the means and appliances of the production to the place where they were to be used and the product itself to the place where it is to be sold       confirmation is here given in the above words of the opinion     that in mr mill’s mind cost of production was looked at wholly     from the standpoint of the capitalist and was identical with     cost of labor to the capitalist   the value of commodities therefore depends principally we shall presently see whether it depends solely on the quantity of labor required for their production including in the idea of production that of conveyance to the market but since the cost of production to the capitalist is not labor but wages and since wages may be either greater or less the quantity of labor being the same it would seem that the value of the product can not be determined solely by the quantity of labor but by the quantity together with the remuneration and that values must partly depend on wages  now the relation of one thing to another can not be altered by any cause which affects them both alike a rise or fall of general wages is a fact which affects all commodities in the same manner and therefore affords no reason why they should exchange for each other in one rather than in another proportion though there is no such thing as a general rise of values there is such a thing as a general rise of prices as soon as we form distinctly the idea of values we see that high or low wages can have nothing to do with them but that high wages make high prices is a popular and widely spread opinion the whole amount of error involved in this proposition can only be seen thoroughly when we come to the theory of money at present we need only say that if it be true there can be no such thing as a real rise of wages for if wages could not rise without a proportional rise of the price of everything they could not for any substantial purpose rise at all it must be remembered too that general high prices even supposing them to exist can be of no use to a producer or dealer considered as such for if they increase his money returns they increase in the same degree all his expenses there is no mode in which capitalists can compensate themselves for a high cost of labor through any action on values or prices it can not be prevented from taking its effect in low profits if the laborers really get more that is get the produce of more labor a smaller percentage must remain for profit    § 2 wages affect values only if different in different employments “noncompeting groups”   although however general wages whether high or low do not affect values yet if wages are higher in one employment than another or if they rise or fall permanently in one employment without doing so in others these inequalities do really operate upon values things for example which are made by skilled labor exchange for the produce of a much greater quantity of unskilled labor for no reason but because the labor is more highly paid we have before remarked that the difficulty of passing from one class of employments to a class greatly superior has hitherto caused the wages of all those classes of laborers who are separated from one another by any very marked barrier to depend more than might be supposed upon the increase of the population of each class considered separately and that the inequalities in the remuneration of labor are much greater than could exist if the competition of the laboring people generally could be brought practically to bear on each particular employment it follows from this that wages in different employments do not rise or fall simultaneously but are for short and sometimes even for long periods nearly independent of one another all such disparities evidently alter the relative cost of production of different commodities and will therefore be completely represented in their natural or average value       this is again a clear recognition of the influence of mr     cairnes’s theory of “noncompeting groups”215   wages do enter into value the relative wages of the labor necessary for producing different commodities affect their value just as much as the relative quantities of labor it is true the absolute wages paid have no effect upon values but neither has the absolute quantity of labor if that were to vary simultaneously and equally in all commodities values would not be affected if for instance the general efficiency of all labor were increased so that all things without exception could be produced in the same quantity as before with a smaller amount of labor no trace of this general diminution of cost of production would show itself in the values of commodities    § 3 profits an element in cost of production   thus far of labor or wages as an element in cost of production but in our analysis in the first book of the requisites of production we found that there is another necessary element in it besides labor there is also capital and this being the result of abstinence the produce or its value must be sufficient to remunerate not only all the labor required but the abstinence of all the persons by whom the remuneration of the different classes of laborers was advanced the return from abstinence is profit and profit we have also seen is not exclusively the surplus remaining to the capitalist after he has been compensated for his outlay but forms in most cases no unimportant part of the outlay itself the flaxspinner part of whose expenses consists of the purchase of flax and of machinery has had to pay in their price not only the wages of the labor by which the flax was grown and the machinery made but the profits of the grower the flaxdresser the miner the ironfounder and the machinemaker all these profits together with those of the spinner himself were again advanced by the weaver in the price of his material—linen yarn and along with them the profits of a fresh set of machinemakers and of the miners and ironworkers who supplied them with their metallic material all these advances form part of the cost of production of linen profits therefore as well as wages enter into the cost of production which determines the value of the produce    § 4 cost of production properly represented by sacrifice or cost to the laborer as well as to the capitalist the relation of this conception to the cost of labor       in discussing cost of labor supra pp 225 226 mr mill     found that the advances of the immediate producer consisted not     only of wages but also of tools materials etc in the price of     which he was including the profits of an auxiliary capitalist who     advanced the capital for making these tools etc but then if a     line of division were to be passed down through all these     advances separating wages from profits he urged that if all the     capitalists auxiliary and immediate both were one all the     advances of the capitalist might be considered as wages profits     did not form a part of the outlay to the capitalists in the former     analysis and this seems correct enough now however he suggests     that the outlay of the immediate producers should include the     profit of the auxiliary capitalist more than this mr mill now     includes in cost to the capitalist the profit of the immediate     capitalist for example in his illustration of the manufacture of     linen he includes not merely the profit of the auxiliary capital     engaged in spinning and weaving but the profit of the immediate     and last capitalist the linenmanufacturer also this includes     in the cost of producing an article a profit not realized until     after the commodity is produced      it is now time to give a more correct idea of cost of production     every one admits for example that the “cost of production” of     wheat is less in the united states than in england if for     instance three men with a capital of one hundred dollars may on a     plot of ground a in the united states produce one hundred     bushels of wheat it will happen that the same men and capital     will only produce sixty bushels on ground b in england                     illustration cost of production      in ordinary language then we say that the cost of production is     greater in england than in the united states because the same     labor and capital here produce one hundred bushels for sixty in     england or what amounts to the same thing that less labor and     capital could produce sixty bushels in the united states than     sixty bushels in england if we suppose that one fourth of the     crop is profit and three fourths is assigned to wages in both     countries then in the united states the one hundred dollars of     capital receives twentyfive bushels of profit while in england     it receives only fifteen and the three men receive as wages in     the united states twentyfive bushels each while in england they     receive only fifteen bushels each the first important induction     to be made is that where cost of production is low wages and     profits are high the high productiveness of extractive industries     in the united states is the reason why wages and profits are     higher here than in older countries      now the second important question is is cost of production made     up of wages and profits and is it true that the cost rises with a     rise of wages and profits certainly not wages and profits are     both higher in the united states than in england but no one is so     absurd as to say that the cost of production of wheat as above     explained is higher here than there it is exactly because cost     of production of wheat is lower in the united states that wages     and profits measured in wheat are higher here than in england     therefore it can not be granted as mr mill expounds the     doctrine that cost of production is made up of wages and profits     when we speak of an increased cost of production of a given     article we mean that its production requires more labor and     capital than before and of a decrease in cost of production that     it requires less labor and capital than before meaning by “more     labor” that a given quality of labor is exerted for a longer or     shorter time and by “more capital” that a greater or less     quantity of wealth abstained from is employed for a longer or     shorter time or in other words that laborers and capitalists     undergo more or less sacrifice in exertion and abstinence     respectively to attain a given result this is the contribution     to cost of production made by mr cairnes and briefly defined as     follows “in the case of labor the cost of producing a given     commodity will be represented by the number of average laborers     employed in its production—regard at the same time being had to     the severity of the work and the degree of risk it     involves—multiplied by the duration of their labors in that of     abstinence the principle is analogous the sacrifice will be     measured by the quantity of wealth abstained from taken in     connection with the risk incurred and multiplied by the duration     of the abstinence”216      this view of cost of production takes into consideration in the     act of production what mr mill does not include the cost or     real sacrifice to the laborer as well as to the capitalist it     may then be well to state the relations of cost of production     taken in this better sense to value      within competing groups where there is free choice for labor and     capital to select the most remunerative occupations the hardest     and most disagreeable employments will be best paid and the wages     and profits will be in proportion to the sacrifice involved in     each case if so the amount paid in wages and profits represents     the sacrifices in each case now the aggregate product of an     industry is the source from which is drawn its wages and profits     the aggregate wages and profits therefore must vary with the     value of the total product if the total value depart from the sum     hitherto sufficient to pay the given wages and profits then some     will be paid proportionally less than their sacrifice the value     of a commodity therefore within the competing group must     conform to the costs of production if for example a the     value at any time were such as not to give the laborer the usual     equivalent for his sacrifice he would change his employment to     another within the group where he could get it if b the share     of the capitalist were at any time insufficient to give him the     usual reward for his abstinence he would change the investment of     his capital therefore within such limits as allow a free     competition of labor and capital value must conform itself to     cost of production      not so however with the products of noncompeting industrial     groups as shown by mr mill labor does not pass freely from one     employment to another and it must be said that capital does not     either although vastly more ready to move than labor in a large     and thinly settled country capital does not move freely over the     whole area of industry if it did different rates of profit would     not prevail as we all know they do in the united states now as     before stated the total value of the commodities resulting from     the exertions of each group of producers is the source from which     wages and profits are drawn the aggregate wages and profits in     each industry will vary with the value of the aggregate products     but this total value depends upon what it will exchange for of the     products of other groups that is this value depends on the     reciprocal demand of one group for the commodities of the other     groups as compared with the demand of the other groups for its     products for example although cost of production is low in group     a if the demand from outside groups were to be strong the     exchange value of a’s products would rise and a would get more of     other goods in exchange that is the total produce is large but     a second increment arising from a higher exchange value is to be     shared among a’s laborers and capitalists a few years ago about     18781879 the value of wheat in the united states rose because of     the increased demand from europe where the harvests had been     unusually deficient there had been no falling off in the     productiveness of the farming industry of the united states to     cause the increased price but the relative demand of other     industrial groups for wheat the product of the farming industry     raised the exchange value of wheat and so increased the     industrial rewards of those engaged as laborers and capitalists in     farming so it is to be concluded that since there is no free     movement of labor and capital between noncompeting groups wages     and profits may constantly remain at rates which are not in     correspondence with the actual sacrifice or cost to labor and     capital in different groups hence their products do not exchange     for each other in proportion to their costs of production     reciprocal demand is the law of their value      it will be said at once that the foregoing conception of cost of     production is entirely opposed to the language of practical men of     affairs they constantly speak of higher or lower wages as     increasing their cost of production or as affecting their ability     to compete with foreigners so universal a usage implies a     foundation of truth which demands attention wages do represent     cost to the capitalist that is the chief part of the outlay he     makes in order to get a given return but we have already seen     this and in the language of political economy termed it “cost     of labor” to the capitalist when the business world use the     phrase cost of production they use it in the sense of cost of     labor as hitherto explained when they are obliged by strikers to     pay more wages they say that it increases their “cost of     production” meaning the cost to them of getting their product     and that it affects their profits this then will show that     there is no objection to be urged in its true sense against the     phrase cost of production arising from its misuse in the common     language of business      the real connection between the proper conception of cost of     production and cost of labor is however worth attention it     touches cost of labor through that one of its elements called     “efficiency of labor” the more productive an industry is the     higher its wages and profits may be and it is exactly at this     point that more attention should be given to the relations of     labor and capital if productiveness can be increased higher     wages as well as higher profits are possible the proper     understanding of the idea that where cost of production is low     wages and profits are high throws a flood of light on many     industrial questions in the united states in the connection in     which it stands as i have shown to cost of labor it means that     if commodities can be produced at a less sacrifice to labor and     capital by the use of machinery and new processes higher wages     are consistent with a lower price of the given product it     explains the fact that owing to skill or natural resources     labor although paid much higher rates can produce articles     cheaper than laborers who are less highly paid mr brassey217     has pointed out that english wages are higher than on the     continent and yet england through low cost of production owing     to skill natural resources etc can produce so much more of     commodities for a given outlay that while keeping her usual rate     of profit she can generally undersell her competitors who employ     cheaper labor the same observations apply to the united states     but the question of foreign competition will be further discussed     book iii chap xx after we have studied international trade and     values      “and here it may be well to state precisely what is to be     understood by a ‘fluctuation of the market’ as distinguished from     those changes of normal price which we have been considering     normal price as we have seen is governed according to the     circumstances of the case as to whether there is free industrial     competition or not by one or other of two causes—cost of     production and reciprocal demand a change in normal price     therefore is a change which is the consequence of an alteration     in one or other of these conditions so long as the determining     condition—be it cost of production or reciprocal demand—remains     constant the normal price must be considered as remaining     constant but the normal price remaining constant the market     price which as we have seen depends on the opinion of dealers     respecting the state of supply and demand in relation to the     particular article may undergo a change—may deviate that is to     say either upward or downward from the normal level such changes     of price occurring while the permanent conditions of production     remain unaffected can only be temporary calling into action as     they do forces which at once tend to restore the normal state of     things they may therefore be properly described as ‘fluctuations     of the market’ ”218    § 5 when profits vary from employment to employment or are spread over unequal lengths of time they affect values accordingly   value however being purely relative can not depend upon absolute profits no more than upon absolute wages but upon relative profits only high general profits can not any more than high general wages be a cause of high values because high general values are an absurdity and a contradiction in so far as profits enter into the cost of production of all things they can not affect the value of any it is only by entering in a greater degree into the cost of production of some things than of others that they can have any influence on value  profits however may enter more largely into the conditions of production of one commodity than of another even though there be no difference in the rate of profit between the two employments the one commodity may be called upon to yield a profit during a longer period of time than the other the example by which this case is usually illustrated is that of wine suppose a quantity of wine and a quantity of cloth made by equal amounts of labor and that labor paid at the same rate the cloth does not improve by keeping the wine does suppose that to attain the desired quality the wine requires to be kept five years the producer or dealer will not keep it unless at the end of five years he can sell it for as much more than the cloth as amounts to five years’ profit accumulated at compound interest the wine and the cloth were made by the same original outlay here then is a case in which the natural values relatively to one another of two commodities do not conform to their cost of production alone but to their cost of production plus something else—unless indeed for the sake of generality in the expression we include the profit which the winemerchant foregoes during the five years in the cost of production of the wine looking upon it as a kind of additional outlay over and above his other advances for which outlay he must be indemnified at last       regarding cost of production as the amounts of labor and     abstinence required in production and not as mr mill regards it     as the amounts of wages and profits the above is simply a case     where in the production of wine there is a longer duration of     the abstinence than in the production of cloth if there is a     free movement of labor and capital between the two industries     they will exchange for each other in proportion to the sacrifices     involved so that the wine would exchange for more of cloth     because there was more sacrifice undergone the same explanation     also holds good in the following illustration   all commodities made by machinery are assimilated at least approximately to the wine in the preceding example in comparison with things made wholly by immediate labor profits enter more largely into their cost of production suppose two commodities a and b each requiring a year for its production by means of a capital which we will on this occasion denote by money and suppose it to be £1000 a is made wholly by immediate labor the whole £1000 being expended directly in wages b is made by means of labor which cost £500 and a machine which cost £500 and the machine is worn out by one year’s use the two commodities will be of exactly the same value which if computed in money and if profits are 20 per cent per annum will be £1200 but of this £1200 in the case of a only £200 or one sixth is profit while in the case of b there is not only the £200 but as much of £500 the price of the machine as consisted of the profits of the machinemaker which if we suppose the machine also to have taken a year for its production is again one sixth so that in the case of a only one sixth of the entire return is profit while in b the element of profit comprises not only a sixth of the whole but an additional sixth of a large part  from the unequal proportion in which in different employments profits enter into the advances of the capitalist and therefore into the returns required by him two consequences follow in regard to value 1 one is that commodities do not exchange in the ratio simply of the quantities of labor required to produce them not even if we allow for the unequal rates at which different kinds of labor are permanently remunerated  2 a second consequence is that every rise or fall of general profits will have an effect on values not indeed by raising or lowering them generally which as we have so often said is a contradiction and an impossibility but by altering the proportion in which the values of things are affected by the unequal lengths of time for which profit is due when two things though made by equal labor are of unequal value because the one is called upon to yield profit for a greater number of years or months than the other this difference of value will be greater when profits are greater and less when they are less the wine which has to yield five years’ profit more than the cloth will surpass it in value much more if profits are forty per cent than if they are only twenty  it follows from this that even a general rise of wages when it involves a real increase in the cost of labor does in some degree influence values it does not affect them in the manner vulgarly supposed by raising them universally but an increase in the cost of labor lowers profits and therefore lowers in natural values the things into which profits enter in a greater proportion than the average and raises those into which they enter in a less proportion than the average all commodities in the production of which machinery bears a large part especially if the machinery is very durable are lowered in their relative value when profits fall or what is equivalent other things are raised in value relatively to them this truth is sometimes expressed in a phraseology more plausible than sound by saying that a rise of wages raises the value of things made by labor in comparison with those made by machinery but things made by machinery just as much as any other things are made by labor—namely the labor which made the machinery itself—the only difference being that profits enter somewhat more largely into the production of things for which machinery is used though the principal item of the outlay is still labor    § 6 occasional elements in cost of production taxes and groundrent   cost of production consists of several elements some of which are constant and universal others occasional the universal elements of cost of production are the wages of the labor and the profits of the capital the occasional elements are taxes and any extra cost occasioned by a scarcity value of some of the requisites besides the natural and necessary elements in cost of production—labor and profits—there are others which are artificial and casual as for instance a tax the taxes on hops and malt are as much a part of the cost of production of those articles as the wages of the laborers the expenses which the law imposes as well as those which the nature of things imposes must be reimbursed with the ordinary profit from the value of the produce or the things will not continue to be produced but the influence of taxation on value is subject to the same conditions as the influence of wages and of profits it is not general taxation but differential taxation that produces the effect if all productions were taxed so as to take an equal percentage from all profits relative values would be in no way disturbed if only a few commodities were taxed their value would rise and if only a few were left untaxed their value would fall  but the case in which scarcity value chiefly operates in adding to cost of production is the case of natural agents these when unappropriated and to be had for the taking do not enter into the cost of production save to the extent of the labor which may be necessary to fit them for use even when appropriated they do not as we have already seen bear a value from the mere fact of the appropriation but only from scarcity—that is from limitation of supply but it is equally certain that they often do bear a scarcity value  no one can deny that rent sometimes enters into cost of production of other than agricultural products if i buy or rent a piece of ground and build a clothmanufactory on it the groundrent forms legitimately a part of my expenses of production which must be repaid by the product and since all factories are built on ground and most of them in places where ground is peculiarly valuable the rent paid for it must on the average be compensated in the values of all things made in factories in what sense it is true that rent does not enter into the cost of production or affect the value of agricultural produce will be shown in the succeeding chapter       these occasional elements in cost of production such as taxes     insurance groundrent etc are to be considered as just so much     of an increase in the quantity of capital required for the     operation involved in the particular production and     consequently result in an increased cost of production because     there is either more abstinence or abstinence for a longer time     to be rewarded these elements therefore if they are not     universal or common to all articles will affect the exchange     value of commodities wherever there is a free competition     chapter iii of rent in its relation to value    § 1 commodities which are susceptible of indefinite multiplication but not without increase of cost law of their value cost of production in the most unfavorable existing circumstances   we have investigated the laws which determine the value of two classes of commodities—the small class which being limited to a definite quantity have their value entirely determined by demand and supply save that their cost of production if they have any constitutes a minimum below which they can not permanently fall and the large class which can be multiplied ad libitum by labor and capital and of which the cost of production fixes the maximum as well as the minimum at which they can permanently exchange if there be free competition but there is still a third kind of commodities to be considered—those which have not one but several costs of production which can always be increased in quantity by labor and capital but not by the same amount of labor and capital of which so much may be produced at a given cost but a further quantity not without a greater cost these commodities form an intermediate class partaking of the character of both the others the principal of them is agricultural produce we have already made abundant reference to the fundamental truth that in agriculture the state of the art being given doubling the labor does not double the produce that if an increased quantity of produce is required the additional supply is obtained at a greater cost than the first where a hundred quarters of corn are all that is at present required from the lands of a given village if the growth of population made it necessary to raise a hundred more either by breaking up worse land now uncultivated or by a more elaborate cultivation of the land already under the plow the additional hundred or some part of them at least might cost double or treble as much per quarter as the former supply  if the first hundred quarters were all raised at the same expense only the best land being cultivated and if that expense would be remunerated with the ordinary profit by a price of 20s the quarter the natural price of wheat so long as no more than that quantity was required would be 20s and it could only rise above or fall below that price from vicissitudes of seasons or other casual variations in supply but if the population of the district advanced a time would arrive when more than a hundred quarters would be necessary to feed it we must suppose that there is no access to any foreign supply by the hypothesis no more than a hundred quarters can be produced in the district unless by either bringing worse land into cultivation or altering the system of culture to a more expensive one neither of these things will be done without a rise in price this rise of price will gradually be brought about by the increasing demand so long as the price has risen but not risen enough to repay with the ordinary profit the cost of producing an additional quantity the increased value of the limited supply partakes of the nature of a scarcity value suppose that it will not answer to cultivate the second best land or land of the second degree of remoteness for a less return than 25s the quarter and that this price is also necessary to remunerate the expensive operations by which an increased produce might be raised from land of the first quality if so the price will rise through the increased demand until it reaches 25s that will now be the natural price being the price without which the quantity for which society has a demand at that price will not be produced at that price however society can go on for some time longer could go on perhaps forever if population did not increase the price having attained that point will not again permanently recede though it may fall temporarily from accidental abundance nor will it advance further so long as society can obtain the supply it requires without a second increase of the cost of production  in the case supposed different portions of the supply of corn have different costs of production though the twenty or fifty or one hundred and fifty quarters additional have been produced at a cost proportional to 25s the original hundred quarters per annum are still produced at a cost only proportional to 20s this is selfevident if the original and the additional supply are produced on different qualities of land it is equally true if they are produced on the same land suppose that land of the best quality which produced one hundred quarters at 20s has been made to produce one hundred and fifty by an expensive process which it would not answer to undertake without a price of 25s the cost which requires 25s is incurred for the sake of fifty quarters alone the first hundred might have continued forever to be produced at the original cost and with the benefit on that quantity of the whole rise of price caused by the increased demand no one therefore will incur the additional expense for the sake of the additional fifty unless they alone will pay for the whole of it the fifty therefore will be produced at their natural price proportioned to the cost of their production while the other hundred will now bring in 5s a quarter more than their natural price—than the price corresponding to and sufficing to remunerate their lower cost of production  if the production of any even the smallest portion of the supply requires as a necessary condition a certain price that price will be obtained for all the rest we are not able to buy one loaf cheaper than another because the corn from which it was made being grown on a richer soil has cost less to the grower the value therefore of an article meaning its natural which is the same with its average value is determined by the cost of that portion of the supply which is produced and brought to market at the greatest expense this is the law of value of the third of the three classes into which all commodities are divided    § 2 such commodities when produced in circumstances more favorable yield a rent equal to the difference of cost   if the portion of produce raised in the most unfavorable circumstances obtains a value proportioned to its cost of production all the portions raised in more favorable circumstances selling as they must do at the same value obtain a value more than proportioned to their cost of production  the owners however of those portions of the produce enjoy a privilege they obtain a value which yields them more than the ordinary profit the advantage depends on the possession of a natural agent of peculiar quality as for instance of more fertile land than that which determines the general value of the commodity and when this natural agent is not owned by themselves the person who does own it is able to exact from them in the form of rent the whole extra gain derived from its use we are thus brought by another road to the law of rent investigated in the concluding chapter of the second book rent we again see is the difference between the unequal returns to different parts of the capital employed on the soil whatever surplus any portion of agricultural capital produces beyond what is produced by the same amount of capital on the worst soil or under the most expensive mode of cultivation which the existing demands of society compel a recourse to that surplus will naturally be paid as rent from that capital to the owner of the land on which it is employed       the discussion of rent is here followed wholly from the point of     view of value while before book ii chap vi the law of rent     was reached through a limitation of the quantity of land due to     the influence of population in the former case the rent and     produce were stated in bushels by introducing price now as the     convenient symbol of value instead of the separate increased     demands of population in our illustration than used p 240 it     will be seen how the same operation looking at it solely in     respect to value brings us to the same law   price            a                   b                   c                   d per bushel            24                  18                  12                  6            bushels             bushels             bushels             bushels

        product 100       2400    000                                133       3200    800     2400    000                    200       4800   2400     3600   1200     2400    000        400       9600   7200     7200   4800     4800   2400     2400  it was long thought by political economists among the rest even by adam smith that the produce of land is always at a monopoly value because they said in addition to the ordinary rate of profit it always yields something further for rent this we now see to be erroneous a thing can not be at a monopoly value when its supply can be increased to an indefinite extent if we are only willing to incur the cost as long as there is any land fit for cultivation which at the existing price can not be profitably cultivated at all there must be some land a little better which will yield the ordinary profit but allow nothing for rent and that land if within the boundary of a farm will be cultivated by the farmer if not so probably by the proprietor or by some other person on sufferance some such land at least under cultivation there can scarcely fail to be  rent therefore forms no part of the cost of production which determines the value of agricultural produce the land or the capital most unfavorably circumstanced among those actually employed pays no rent and that land or capital determines the cost of production which regulates the value of the whole produce thus rent is as we have already seen no cause of value but the price of the privilege which the inequality of the returns to different portions of agricultural produce confers on all except the least favored portion  rent in short merely equalizes the profits of different farming capitals by enabling the landlord to appropriate all extra gains occasioned by superiority of natural advantages if all landlords were unanimously to forego their rent they would but transfer it to the farmers without benefiting the consumer for the existing price of corn would still be an indispensable condition of the production of part of the existing supply and if a part obtained that price the whole would obtain it rent therefore unless artificially increased by restrictive laws is no burden on the consumer it does not raise the price of corn and is no otherwise a detriment to the public than inasmuch as if the state had retained it or imposed an equivalent in the shape of a landtax it would then have been a fund applicable to general instead of private advantage       the nationalization of the land consequently would not benefit     the laboringclasses a whit through lowering the price to them or     any consumer of food or agricultural produce    § 3 rent of mines and fisheries and groundrent of buildings and cases of gain analogous to rent   agricultural productions are not the only commodities which have several different costs of production at once and which in consequence of that difference and in proportion to it afford a rent mines are also an instance almost all kinds of raw material extracted from the interior of the earth—metals coals precious stones etc—are obtained from mines differing considerably in fertility—that is yielding very different quantities of the product to the same quantity of labor and capital there are perhaps cases in which it is impossible to extract from a particular vein in a given time more than a certain quantity of ore because there is only a limited surface of the vein exposed on which more than a certain number of laborers can not be simultaneously employed but this is not true of all mines in collieries for example some other cause of limitation must be sought for in some instances the owners limit the quantity raised in order not too rapidly to exhaust the mine in others there are said to be combinations of owners to keep up a monopoly price by limiting the production whatever be the causes it is a fact that mines of different degrees of richness are in operation and since the value of the produce must be proportional to the cost of production at the worst mine fertility and situation taken together it is more than proportional to that of the best all mines superior in produce to the worst actually worked will yield therefore a rent equal to the excess they may yield more and the worst mine may itself yield a rent mines being comparatively few their qualities do not graduate gently into one another as the qualities of land do and the demand may be such as to keep the value of the produce considerably above the cost of production at the worst mine now worked without being sufficient to bring into operation a still worse during the interval the produce is really at a scarcity value  fisheries are another example fisheries in the open sea are not appropriated but fisheries in lakes or rivers almost always are so and likewise oysterbeds or other particular fishinggrounds on coasts we may take salmonfisheries as an example of the whole class some rivers are far more productive in salmon than others none however without being exhausted can supply more than a very limited demand all others therefore will if appropriated afford a rent equal to the value of their superiority  both in the case of mines and of fisheries the natural order of events is liable to be interrupted by the opening of a new mine or a new fishery of superior quality to some of those already in use in this case when things have permanently adjusted themselves the result will be that the scale of qualities which supply the market will have been cut short at the lower end while a new insertion will have been made in the scale at some point higher up and the worst mine or fishery in use—the one which regulates the rents of the superior qualities and the value of the commodity—will be a mine or fishery of better quality than that by which they were previously regulated  the groundrent of a building and the rent of a garden or park attached to it will not be less than the rent which the same land would afford in agriculture but may be greater than this to an indefinite amount the surplus being either in consideration of beauty or of convenience the convenience often consisting in superior facilities for pecuniary gain sites of remarkable beauty are generally limited in supply and therefore if in great demand are at a scarcity value sites superior only in convenience are governed as to their value by the ordinary principles of rent the groundrent of a house in a small village is but little higher than the rent of a similar patch of ground in the open fields       suppose the various kinds of land to be represented by the     alphabet that those below o pay no agricultural rent and that     all lands increase in fertility and situation as we approach the     beginning of the alphabet but which as far up as k are used in     agriculture that higher than k all are more profitably used for     building purposes viz      a b c   k l m n o   x y z      now it will happen that land is chosen for building purposes     irrespective of its fertility for agricultural purposes it will     not be true as some may think that no land will be used for     building until it will pay a groundrent greater than the greatest     agricultural rent paid by any piece of land it is not true for     example if n be selected for a buildinglot that it must pay a     groundrent as high as the agricultural rent of k the most     fertile land cultivated in agriculture it must pay a groundrent     higher only than it itself would pay if cultivated it is only     necessary that it pay more than the same not better land would     pay as rent if used only in agriculture   the rents of wharfage dock and harbor room waterpower and many other privileges may be analyzed on similar principles take the case for example of a patent or exclusive privilege for the use of a process by which the cost of production is lessened if the value of the product continues to be regulated by what it costs to those who are obliged to persist in the old process the patentee will make an extra profit equal to the advantage which his process possesses over theirs this extra profit is essentially similar to rent and sometimes even assumes the form of it the patentee allowing to other producers the use of his privilege in consideration of an annual payment  the extra gains which any producer or dealer obtains through superior talents for business or superior business arrangements are very much of a similar kind if all his competitors had the same advantages and used them the benefit would be transferred to their customers through the diminished value of the article he only retains it for himself because he is able to bring his commodity to market at a lower cost while its value is determined by a higher219    § 4 résumé of the laws of value of each of the three classes of commodities   a general résumé of the laws of value where a free movement of labor and capital exists may now be briefly made in the following form  exchange value has three conditions viz 1 utility or ability to satisfy a desire u 2 difficulty of attainment d according to which there are three classes of commodities 3 transferableness  of the second condition there are three classes 1 those limited in supply—eg ancient pictures or monopolized articles 2 those whose supply is capable of indefinite increase by the use of labor and capital 3 those whose supply is gained at a gradually increasing cost under the law of diminishing returns  of those limited in supply their value is regulated by demand and supply the only limit is u  of those whose supply is capable of indefinite increase their normal and permanent value is regulated by cost of production and their temporary or market value is regulated by demand and supply oscillating around cost of production which consists of the amount of labor and abstinence required  of those whose supply is gained at a gradually increasing cost their normal value is regulated by the cost of production of that portion of the whole amount of the whole amount needed which is brought to market at the greatest expense and their market value is regulated by demand and supply as in class 2  if there be no free competition between industries then the value of those commodities which has been said in the above classification to depend on cost of production will be governed by the law of reciprocal demand     chapter iv of money    § 1 the three functions of money—a common denominator of value a medium of exchange a “standard of value”   having proceeded thus far in ascertaining the general laws of value without introducing the idea of money except occasionally for illustration it is time that we should now superadd that idea and consider in what manner the principles of the mutual interchange of commodities are affected by the use of what is termed a medium of exchange       as professor jevons220 has pointed out money performs three     distinct services capable of being separated by the mind and     worthy of separate definition and explanation      1 a common measure or common denominator of value      2 a medium of exchange      3 a standard of value      f a walker221 however says “money is the medium of     exchange whatever performs this function does this work is     money no matter what it is made of that which does the     moneywork is the moneything”   1 if we had no money the first and most obvious inconvenience would be the want of a common measure for values of different sorts if a tailor had only coats and wanted to buy bread or a horse it would be very troublesome to ascertain how much bread he ought to obtain for a coat or how many coats he should give for a horse the calculation must be recommenced on different data every time he bartered his coats for a different kind of article and there could be no current price or regular quotations of value as it is much easier to compare different lengths by expressing them in a common language of feet and inches so it is much easier to compare values by means of a common language of dollars and cents       the need of a common denominator of values an excellent term     introduced by storch to whose terms the values of all other     commodities may be reduced and so compared is as great as that     the inhabitants of the different states of the united states     should have a common language as a means by which ideas could be     communicated to the whole nation a man may have a horse whose     value he wishes to compare in some common term with the value of     his house although he might not wish to sell either a valuation     by the state for taxation could not exist but for this common     denominator or register of value      2 the second function is that of a medium of exchange the     distinction between this function and the common denominator of     value is that the latter measures value the former transfers     value the man owning the horse after having measured its value     by comparison with a given thing may now wish to exchange it for     other things this discloses the need of another quality in money   the inconveniences of barter are so great that without some more commodious means of effecting exchanges the division of employments could hardly have been carried to any considerable extent a tailor who had nothing but coats might starve before he could find any person having bread to sell who wanted a coat besides he would not want as much bread at a time as would be worth a coat and the coat could not be divided every person therefore would at all times hasten to dispose of his commodity in exchange for anything which though it might not be fitted to his own immediate wants was in great and general demand and easily divisible so that he might be sure of being able to purchase with it whatever was offered for sale the thing which people would select to keep by them for making purchases must be one which besides being divisible and generally desired does not deteriorate by keeping this reduces the choice to a small number of articles       this need is well explained by the following facts furnished by     professor jevons “some years since mademoiselle zélie a singer     of the théâtre lyrique at paris made a professional tour round     the world and gave a concert in the society islands in exchange     for an air from ‘norma’ and a few other songs she was to receive     a third part of the receipts when counted her share was found to     consist of three pigs twentythree turkeys fortyfour chickens     five thousand cocoanuts besides considerable quantities of     bananas lemons and oranges in the society islands however     pieces of money were very scarce and as mademoiselle could not     consume any considerable portion of the receipts herself it     became necessary in the mean time to feed the pigs and poultry     with the fruit”222      3 the third function desired of money is what is usually termed     a “standard of value” it is perhaps better expressed by f a     walker223 as a “standard of deferred payments” its existence is     due to the desire to have a means of comparing the purchasing     power of a commodity at one time with its purchasing power at     another distant time that is that for long contracts exchanges     may be in unchanged ratios at the beginning and at the end of the     contracts there is no distinction between this function and the     first except one arising from the introduction of time at the     same time and place the “standard of value” is given in the     common denominator of value   a measure of value224 in the ordinary sense of the word measure would mean something by comparison with which we may ascertain what is the value of any other thing when we consider further that value itself is relative and that two things are necessary to constitute it independently of the third thing which is to measure it we may define a measure of value to be something by comparing with which any two other things we may infer their value in relation to one another  in this sense any commodity will serve as a measure of value at a given time and place since we can always infer the proportion in which things exchange for one another when we know the proportion in which each exchanges for any third thing to serve as a convenient measure of value is one of the functions of the commodity selected as a medium of exchange it is in that commodity that the values of all other things are habitually estimated  but the desideratum sought by political economists is not a measure of the value of things at the same time and place but a measure of the value of the same thing at different times and places something by comparison with which it may be known whether any given thing is of greater or less value now than a century ago or in this country than in america or china to enable the money price of a thing at two different periods to measure the quantity of things in general which it will exchange for the same sum of money must correspond at both periods to the same quantity of things in general—that is money must always have the same exchange value the same general purchasing power now not only is this not true of money or of any other commodity but we can not even suppose any state of circumstances in which it would be true       it being very clear that money or the precious metals do not     themselves remain absolutely stable in value for long periods the     only way in which a “standard of value” can be properly     established is by the proposed “multiple standard of value”     stated as follows      “a number of articles in general use—corn beef potatoes wool     cotton silk tea sugar coffee indigo timber iron coal and     others—shall be taken in a definite quantity of each so many     pounds or bushels or cords or yards to form a standard     required the value of these articles in the quantities     specified and all of standard quality shall be ascertained     monthly or weekly by government and the total sum in money     which would then purchase this bill of goods shall be thereupon     officially promulgated persons may then if they choose make     their contracts for future payments in terms of this multiple or     tabular standard”225 a who had borrowed 1000 of b in 1870     for ten years would make note of the total money value of all     these articles composing the multiple standard which we will     suppose is 125 in 1870 consequently a would promise to pay b     eight multiple units in ten years that is eight times 125 or     1000 but if other things change in value relatively to money     during these ten years the same sum of money—1000—in 1880 will     not return to b the same just amount of purchasing power which he     parted with in 1870 now if in 1880 when his note falls due     the government list is examined and it is found that commodities     in general have fallen in value relatively to gold the multiple     unit will not amount to as much gold as it did in 1870 perhaps     each unit may be rated only at 100 in that case a is obliged to     pay back but eight multiple units which costs him only 800 in     money while b receives from a the same amount of purchasing power     over other commodities which he loaned to him b had no just claim     to ten units since the fall of all commodities relatively to gold     was not due to his exertions on the other hand if between 1870     and 1880 prices had risen mutatis mutandis the eight units     would have cost a more than 1000 in gold but he would have been     justly obliged to return the same amount of purchasing power to b     which he received from him    § 2 gold and silver why fitted for those purposes   by a tacit concurrence almost all nations at a very early period fixed upon certain metals and especially gold and silver to serve this purpose no other substances unite the necessary qualities in so great a degree with so many subordinate advantages these were the things which it most pleased every one to possess and which there was most certainty of finding others willing to receive in exchange for any kind of produce they were among the most imperishable of all substances they were also portable and containing great value in small bulk were easily hid a consideration of much importance in an age of insecurity jewels are inferior to gold and silver in the quality of divisibility and are of very various qualities not to be accurately discriminated without great trouble gold and silver are eminently divisible and when pure always of the same quality and their purity may be ascertained and certified by a public authority  jevons226 has more fully stated the requisites for a perfect money as—        1 value       2 portability       3 indestructibility       4 homogeneity       5 divisibility       6 stability of value       7 cognizability  accordingly though furs have been employed as money in some countries cattle in others in chinese tartary cubes of tea closely pressed together the shells called cowries on the coast of western africa and in abyssinia at this day blocks of rocksalt gold and silver have been generally preferred by nations which were able to obtain them either by industry commerce or conquest to the qualities which originally recommended them another came to be added the importance of which only unfolded itself by degrees of all commodities they are among the least influenced by any of the causes which produce fluctuations of value no commodity is quite free from such fluctuations gold and silver have sustained since the beginning of history one great permanent alteration of value from the discovery of the american mines  in the present age the opening of new sources of supply so abundant as the ural mountains california and australia may be the commencement of another period of decline on the limits of which it would be useless at present to speculate but on the whole no commodities are so little exposed to causes of variation they fluctuate less than almost any other things in their cost of production and from their durability the total quantity in existence is at all times so great in proportion to the annual supply that the effect on value even of a change in the cost of production is not sudden a very long time being required to diminish materially the quantity in existence and even to increase it very greatly not being a rapid process gold and silver therefore are more fit than any other commodity to be the subject of engagements for receiving or paying a given quantity at some distant period       since mr mill wrote two great changes in the production of the     precious metals have occurred the discoveries of gold briefly     referred to by him have led to an enormous increase of the     existing fund of gold see chart no ix chap vi and a fall in     the value of gold within twenty years after the discoveries     according to mr jevons’s celebrated study227 of from nine to     fifteen per cent another change took place a change in the     value of silver in 1876 which has resulted in a permanent fall     of its value since that time see chart no x chap vii before     that date silver sold at about 60d per ounce in the central     market of the world london and now it remains about 52d per     ounce although it once fell to 47d in july 1876 in spite of     mr mill’s expressions of confidence in their stability of     value—although certainly more stable than other commodities—the     events of the last thirtyfive years have fully shown that neither     gold nor silver—silver far less than gold—can successfully serve     as a perfect “standard of value” for any considerable length of     time   when gold and silver had become virtually a medium of exchange by becoming the things for which people generally sold and with which they generally bought whatever they had to sell or to buy the contrivance of coining obviously suggested itself by this process the metal was divided into convenient portions of any degree of smallness and bearing a recognized proportion to one another and the trouble was saved of weighing and assaying at every change of possessors—an inconvenience which on the occasion of small purchases would soon have become insupportable governments found it their interest to take the operation into their own hands and to interdict all coining by private persons    § 3 money a mere contrivance for facilitating exchanges which does not affect the laws of value   it must be evident however that the mere introduction of a particular mode of exchanging things for one another by first exchanging a thing for money and then exchanging the money for something else makes no difference in the essential character of transactions it is not with money that things are really purchased nobody’s income except that of the gold or silver miner is derived from the precious metals the dollars or cents which a person receives weekly or yearly are not what constitutes his income they are a sort of tickets or orders which he can present for payment at any shop he pleases and which entitle him to receive a certain value of any commodity that he makes choice of the farmer pays his laborers and his landlord in these tickets as the most convenient plan for himself and them but their real income is their share of his corn cattle and hay and it makes no essential difference whether he distributes it to them directly or sells it for them and gives them the price there can not in short be intrinsically a more insignificant thing in the economy of society than money except in the character of a contrivance for sparing time and labor it is a machine for doing quickly and commodiously what would be done though less quickly and commodiously without it and like many other kinds of machinery it only exerts a distinct and independent influence of its own when it gets out of order  the introduction of money does not interfere with the operation of any of the laws of value laid down in the preceding chapters the reasons which make the temporary or market value of things depend on the demand and supply and their average and permanent values upon their cost of production are as applicable to a money system as to a system of barter things which by barter would exchange for one another will if sold for money sell for an equal amount of it and so will exchange for one another still though the process of exchanging them will consist of two operations instead of only one the relations of commodities to one another remain unaltered by money the only new relation introduced is their relation to money itself how much or how little money they will exchange for in other words how the exchange value of money itself is determined money is a commodity and its value is determined like that of other commodities temporarily by demand and supply permanently and on the average by cost of production     chapter v of the value of money as dependent on demand and supply    § 1 value of money an ambiguous expression   the value of money is to appearance an expression as precise as free from possibility of misunderstanding as any in science the value of a thing is what it will exchange for the value of money is what money will exchange for the purchasing power of money if prices are low money will buy much of other things and is of high value if prices are high it will buy little of other things and is of low value the value of money is inversely as general prices falling as they rise and rising as they fall when one person lends to another as well as when he pays wages or rent to another what he transfers is not the mere money but a right to a certain value of the produce of the country to be selected at pleasure the lender having first bought this right by giving for it a portion of his capital what he really lends is so much capital the money is the mere instrument of transfer but the capital usually passes from the lender to the receiver through the means either of money or of an order to receive money and at any rate it is in money that the capital is computed and estimated hence borrowing capital is universally called borrowing money the loan market is called the money market those who have their capital disposable for investment on loan are called the moneyed class and the equivalent given for the use of capital or in other words interest is not only called the interest of money but by a grosser perversion of terms the value of money    § 2 the value of money depends on its quantity   the value or purchasing power of money depends in the first instance on demand and supply but demand and supply in relation to money present themselves in a somewhat different shape from the demand and supply of other things  the supply of a commodity means the quantity offered for sale but it is not usual to speak of offering money for sale people are not usually said to buy or sell money this however is merely an accident of language in point of fact money is bought and sold like other things whenever other things are bought and sold for money whoever sells corn or tallow or cotton buys money whoever buys bread or wine or clothes sells money to the dealer in those articles the money with which people are offering to buy is money offered for sale the supply of money then is the quantity of it which people are wanting to lay out that is all the money they have in their possession except what they are hoarding or at least keeping by them as a reserve for future contingencies the supply of money in short is all the money in circulation at the time  the demand for money again consists of all the goods offered for sale every seller of goods is a buyer of money and the goods he brings with him constitute his demand the demand for money differs from the demand for other things in this that it is limited only by the means of the purchaser       in this last statement mr mill is misled by his former definition     of demand as “quantity demanded” he has the true idea of demand     in this case regarding money but the demand for money does not     as he thinks differ from the demand for other things inasmuch     as in our corrected view of demand for other things p 255 it     was found that the demand for other things than money was also     limited by the means of the purchaser228   as the whole of the goods in the market compose the demand for money so the whole of the money constitutes the demand for goods the money and the goods are seeking each other for the purpose of being exchanged they are reciprocally supply and demand to one another it is indifferent whether in characterizing the phenomena we speak of the demand and supply of goods or the supply and the demand of money they are equivalent expressions  supposing the money in the hands of individuals to be increased the wants and inclinations of the community collectively in respect to consumption remaining exactly the same the increase of demand would reach all things equally and there would be a universal rise of prices let us rather suppose therefore that to every pound or shilling or penny in the possession of any one another pound shilling or penny were suddenly added there would be an increased money demand and consequently an increased money value or price for things of all sorts this increased value would do no good to any one would make no difference except that of having to reckon dollars and cents in higher numbers it would be an increase of values only as estimated in money a thing only wanted to buy other things with and would not enable any one to buy more of them than before prices would have risen in a certain ratio and the value of money would have fallen in the same ratio  it is to be remarked that this ratio would be precisely that in which the quantity of money had been increased if the whole money in circulation was doubled prices would be doubled if it was only increased one fourth prices would rise one fourth there would be one fourth more money all of which would be used to purchase goods of some description when there had been time for the increased supply of money to reach all markets or according to the conventional metaphor to permeate all the channels of circulation all prices would have risen one fourth but the general rise of price is independent of this diffusing and equalizing process even if some prices were raised more and others less the average rise would be one fourth this is a necessary consequence of the fact that a fourth more money would have been given for only the same quantity of goods general prices therefore would in any case be a fourth higher  so that the value of money other things being the same varies inversely as its quantity every increase of quantity lowering the value and every diminution raising it in a ratio exactly equivalent this it must be observed is a property peculiar to money we did not find it to be true of commodities generally that every diminution of supply raised the value exactly in proportion to the deficiency or that every increase lowered it in the precise ratio of the excess some things are usually affected in a greater ratio than that of the excess or deficiency others usually in a less because in ordinary cases of demand the desire being for the thing itself may be stronger or weaker and the amount of what people are willing to expend on it being in any case a limited quantity may be affected in very unequal degrees by difficulty or facility of attainment but in the case of money which is desired as the means of universal purchase the demand consists of everything which people have to sell and the only limit to what they are willing to give is the limit set by their having nothing more to offer the whole of the goods being in any case exchanged for the whole of the money which comes into the market to be laid out they will sell for less or more of it exactly according as less or more is brought    § 3 —together with the rapidity of circulation   it might be supposed that there is always in circulation in a country a quantity of money equal in value to the whole of the goods then and there on sale but this would be a complete misapprehension the money laid out is equal in value to the goods it purchases but the quantity of money laid out is not the same thing with the quantity in circulation as the money passes from hand to hand the same piece of money is laid out many times before all the things on sale at one time are purchased and finally removed from the market and each pound or dollar must be counted for as many pounds or dollars as the number of times it changes hands in order to effect this object  if we assume the quantity of goods on sale and the number of times those goods are resold to be fixed quantities the value of money will depend upon its quantity together with the average number of times that each piece changes hands in the process the whole of the goods sold counting each resale of the same goods as so much added to the goods have been exchanged for the whole of the money multiplied by the number of purchases made on the average by each piece consequently the amount of goods and of transactions being the same the value of money is inversely as its quantity multiplied by what is called the rapidity of circulation and the quantity of money in circulation is equal to the money value of all the goods sold divided by the number which expresses the rapidity of circulation       this may be expressed in mathematical language where v is the     value of money q is the quantity in circulation and r the number     expressing the rapidity of circulation as follows      v  1  q × r   the phrase rapidity of circulation requires some comment it must not be understood to mean the number of purchases made by each piece of money in a given time time is not the thing to be considered the state of society may be such that each piece of money hardly performs more than one purchase in a year but if this arises from the small number of transactions—from the small amount of business done the want of activity in traffic or because what traffic there is mostly takes place by barter—it constitutes no reason why prices should be lower or the value of money higher the essential point is not how often the same money changes hands in a given time but how often it changes hands in order to perform a given amount of traffic we must compare the number of purchases made by the money in a given time not with the time itself but with the goods sold in that same time if each piece of money changes hands on an average ten times while goods are sold to the value of a million sterling it is evident that the money required to circulate those goods is £100000 and conversely if the money in circulation is £100000 and each piece changes hands by the purchase of goods ten times in a month the sales of goods for money which take place every month must amount on the average to £1000000 the essential point to be considered is the average number of purchases made by each piece in order to affect a given pecuniary amount of transactions       “there is no doubt that the rapidity of circulation varies very     much between one country and another a thrifty people with slight     banking facilities like the french swiss belgians and dutch     hoard coin much more than an improvident people like the english     or even a careful people with a perfect banking system like the     scotch many circumstances too affect the rapidity of     circulation railways and rapid steamboats enable coin and bullion     to be more swiftly remitted than of old telegraphs prevent its     needless removal and the acceleration of the mails has a like     effect” “so different are the commercial habits of different     peoples that there evidently exists no proportion whatever     between the amount of currency in a country and the aggregate of     the exchanges which can be effected by it”229    § 4 explanations and limitations of this principle   the proposition which we have laid down respecting the dependence of general prices upon the quantity of money in circulation must be understood as applying only to a state of things in which money—that is gold or silver—is the exclusive instrument of exchange and actually passes from hand to hand at every purchase credit in any of its shapes being unknown when credit comes into play as a means of purchasing distinct from money in hand we shall hereafter find that the connection between prices and the amount of the circulating medium is much less direct and intimate and that such connection as does exist no longer admits of so simple a mode of expression that an increase of the quantity of money raises prices and a diminution lowers them is the most elementary proposition in the theory of currency and without it we should have no key to any of the others in any state of things however except the simple and primitive one which we have supposed the proposition is only true other things being the same  it is habitually assumed that whenever there is a greater amount of money in the country or in existence a rise of prices must necessarily follow but this is by no means an inevitable consequence in no commodity is it the quantity in existence but the quantity offered for sale that determines the value whatever may be the quantity of money in the country only that part of it will affect prices which goes into the market of commodities and is there actually exchanged against goods whatever increases the amount of this portion of the money in the country tends to raise prices       this statement needs modification since the change in the amounts     of specie in the bank reserves particularly of england and the     united states determines the amount of credit and purchasing     power granted and so affects prices in that way but prices are     affected not by this specie being actually exchanged against     goods   it frequently happens that money to a considerable amount is brought into the country is there actually invested as capital and again flows out without having ever once acted upon the markets of commodities but only upon the market of securities or as it is commonly though improperly called the money market  a foreigner landing in the country with a treasure might very probably prefer to invest his fortune at interest which we shall suppose him to do in the most obvious way by becoming a competitor for a portion of the stock railway debentures mercantile bills mortgages etc which are at all times in the hands of the public by doing this he would raise the prices of those different securities or in other words would lower the rate of interest and since this would disturb the relation previously existing between the rate of interest on capital in the country itself and that in foreign countries it would probably induce some of those who had floating capital seeking employment to send it abroad for foreign investment rather than buy securities at home at the advanced price as much money might thus go out as had previously come in while the prices of commodities would have shown no trace of its temporary presence this is a case highly deserving of attention and it is a fact now beginning to be recognized that the passage of the precious metals from country to country is determined much more than was formerly supposed by the state of the loan market in different countries and much less by the state of prices  if there be at any time an increase in the number of money transactions a thing continually liable to happen from differences in the activity of speculation and even in the time of year since certain kinds of business are transacted only at particular seasons an increase of the currency which is only proportional to this increase of transactions and is of no longer duration has no tendency to raise prices       for example bankers in eastern cities each year send in the     autumn to the west as the crops are gathered very large sums of     money to settle transactions in the buying and selling of grain     wool etc but it again flows back to the great centers of     business in a short time in payment of purchases from eastern     merchants     chapter vi of the value of money as dependent on cost of production    § 1 the value of money in a state of freedom conforms to the value of the bullion contained in it   but money no more than commodities in general has its value definitely determined by demand and supply the ultimate regulator of its value is cost of production  we are supposing of course that things are left to themselves governments have not always left things to themselves it was until lately the policy of all governments to interdict the exportation and the melting of money while by encouraging the exportation and impeding the importation of other things they endeavored to have a stream of money constantly flowing in by this course they gratified two prejudices they drew or thought that they drew more money into the country which they believed to be tantamount to more wealth and they gave or thought that they gave to all producers and dealers high prices which though no real advantage people are always inclined to suppose to be one  we are however to suppose a state not of artificial regulation but of freedom in that state and assuming no charge to be made for coinage the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made a poundweight of gold or silver in coin and the same weight in an ingot will precisely exchange for one another on the supposition of freedom the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin for as it can be melted without any loss of time and with hardly any expense this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion it may be thought however that the coin though it can not be of less may be and being a manufactured article will naturally be of greater value than the bullion contained in it on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of linen yarn this would be true were it not that government in this country and in some others coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal if government however throws the expense of coinage as is reasonable upon the holder by making a charge to cover the expense which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion and is called levying a seigniorage the coin will rise to the extent of the seigniorage above the value of the bullion if the mint kept back one per cent to pay the expense of coinage it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction the coin therefore would be kept one per cent higher in value which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity than if its coinage were gratuitous       in the united states there was no charge for seigniorage on gold     and silver to 1853 when one half of one per cent was charged as     interest on the delay if coin was immediately delivered on the     deposit of bullion in 1873 it was reduced to one fifth of one per     cent and in 1875 by a provision of the resumption act it was     wholly abolished the depositor however paying for the copper     alloy for the tradedollars as was consistent with their being     only coined ingots and not legal money a seigniorage was charged     equal simply to the expense of coinage which was one and a     quarter per cent at philadelphia and one and a half per cent at     san francisco on the tale value    § 2 —which is determined by the cost of production   the value of money then conforms permanently and in a state of freedom almost immediately to the value of the metal of which it is made with the addition or not of the expenses of coinage according as those expenses are borne by the individual or by the state  to the majority of civilized countries gold and silver are foreign products and the circumstances which govern the values of foreign products present some questions which we are not yet ready to examine for the present therefore we must suppose the country which is the subject of our inquiries to be supplied with gold and silver by its own mines as in the case of the united states reserving for future consideration how far our conclusions require modification to adapt them to the more usual case  of the three classes into which commodities are divided—those absolutely limited in supply those which may be had in unlimited quantity at a given cost of production and those which may be had in unlimited quantity but at an increasing cost of production—the precious metals being the produce of mines belong to the third class their natural value therefore is in the long run proportional to their cost of production in the most unfavorable existing circumstances that is at the worst mine which it is necessary to work in order to obtain the required supply a pound weight of gold will in the goldproducing countries ultimately tend to exchange for as much of every other commodity as is produced at a cost equal to its own meaning by its own cost the cost in labor and expense at the least productive sources of supply which the then existing demand makes it necessary to work the average value of gold is made to conform to its natural value in the same manner as the values of other things are made to conform to their natural value suppose that it were selling above its natural value that is above the value which is an equivalent for the labor and expense of mining and for the risks attending a branch of industry in which nine out of ten experiments have usually been failures a part of the mass of floating capital which is on the lookout for investment would take the direction of mining enterprise the supply would thus be increased and the value would fall if on the contrary it were selling below its natural value miners would not be obtaining the ordinary profit they would slacken their works if the depreciation was great some of the inferior mines would perhaps stop working altogether and a falling off in the annual supply preventing the annual wear and tear from being completely compensated would by degrees reduce the quantity and restore the value  when examined more closely the following are the details of the process if gold is above its natural or cost value—the coin as we have seen conforming in its value to the bullion—money will be of high value and the prices of all things labor included will be low these low prices will lower the expenses of all producers but as their returns will also be lowered no advantage will be obtained by any producer except the producer of gold whose returns from his mine not depending on price will be the same as before and his expenses being less he will obtain extra profits and will be stimulated to increase his production e converso if the metal is below its natural value since this is as much as to say that prices are high and the money expenses of all producers unusually great for this however all other producers will be compensated by increased money returns the miner alone will extract from his mine no more metal than before while his expenses will be greater his profits therefore being diminished or annihilated he will diminish his production if not abandon his employment  in this manner it is that the value of money is made to conform to the cost of production of the metal of which it is made it may be well however to repeat what has been said before that the adjustment takes a long time to effect in the case of a commodity so generally desired and at the same time so durable as the precious metals being so largely used not only as money but for plate and ornament there is at all times a very large quantity of these metals in existence while they are so slowly worn out that a comparatively small annual production is sufficient to keep up the supply and to make any addition to it which may be required by the increase of goods to be circulated or by the increased demand for gold and silver articles by wealthy consumers even if this small annual supply were stopped entirely it would require many years to reduce the quantity so much as to make any very material difference in prices the quantity may be increased much more rapidly than it can be diminished but the increase must be very great before it can make itself much felt over such a mass of the precious metals as exists in the whole commercial world and hence the effects of all changes in the conditions of production of the precious metals are at first and continue to be for many years questions of quantity only with little reference to cost of production more especially is this the case when as at the present time many new sources of supply have been simultaneously opened most of them practicable by labor alone without any capital in advance beyond a pickaxe and a week’s food and when the operations are as yet wholly experimental the comparative permanent productiveness of the different sources being entirely unascertained       for the facts in regard to the production of the precious metals     see the investigation by dr adolf soetbeer230 from which chart     ix has been taken it is worthy of careful study the figures in     each period at

discoveries of                               1849 to 1862       the fall of prices from 1873 to 1879 owing to the commercial     panic in the former year however is regarded somewhat unjustly     in my opinion as an evidence of an appreciation of gold mr     giffen’s paper in the “statistical journal” vol xlii is the     basis on which mr goschen founded an argument in the “journal of     the institute of bankers” london may 1883 and which attracted     considerable attention on the other side see bourne     “statistical journal” vol xlii the claim that the value of gold     has risen seems particularly hasty especially when we consider     that after the panics of 1857 and 1866 the value of money rose     for reasons not affecting gold respectively fifteen and     twentyfive per cent      the very thing for which the precious metals are most recommended     for use as the materials of money—their durability—is also the     very thing which has for all practical purposes excepted them     from the law of cost of production and caused their value to     depend practically upon the law of demand and supply their     durability is the reason of the vast accumulations in existence     and this it is which makes the annual product very small in     relation to the whole existing supply and so prevents its value     from conforming except after a long term of years to the cost of     production of the annual supply    § 3 this law how related to the principle laid down in the preceding chapter   since however the value of money really conforms like that of other things though more slowly to its cost of production some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity when the truth is that it is governed by the very same laws to this we may answer in the first place that the statement in question assumes no peculiar law it is simply the law of demand and supply which is acknowledged to be applicable to all commodities and which in the case of money as of most other things is controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production since cost of production would have no effect on value if it could have none on supply but secondly there really is in one respect a closer connection between the value of money and its quantity than between the values of other things and their quantity the value of other things conforms to the changes in the cost of production without requiring as a condition that there should be any actual alteration of the supply the potential alteration is sufficient and if there even be an actual alteration it is but a temporary one except in so far as the altered value may make a difference in the demand and so require an increase or diminution of supply as a consequence not a cause of the alteration in value now this is also true of gold and silver considered as articles of expenditure for ornament and luxury but it is not true of money if the permanent cost of production of gold were reduced one fourth it might happen that there would not be more of it bought for plate gilding or jewelry than before and if so though the value would fall the quantity extracted from the mines for these purposes would be no greater than previously not so with the portion used as money that portion could not fall in value one fourth unless actually increased one fourth for at prices one fourth higher one fourth more money would be required to make the accustomed purchases and if this were not forthcoming some of the commodities would be without purchasers and prices could not be kept up alterations therefore in the cost of production of the precious metals do not act upon the value of money except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its quantity which can not be said of any other commodity it would therefore i conceive be an error both scientifically and practically to discard the proposition which asserts a connection between the value of money and its quantity       there are cases however in which the potential change of the     precious metals affects their value as money in the same way that     it affects the value of other things such a case was the change     in the value of silver in 1876 the usual causes assigned for that     serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from     the mines of nevada the demonetization of silver by germany and     the decreased demand for export to india it is true that the     exports of silver from england to india fell off from about     32000000 in 18711872 to about 23000000 in 18741875 but     none of the increased nevada silver was exported from the united     states to london nor had germany put more than 30000000 of her     silver on the market233 and yet the price of silver so fell     that the depreciation amounted to 20¼ per cent as compared with     the average price between 1867 and 1872 the change in value     however took place without any corresponding change in the actual     quantity in circulation the relation between prices and the     quantities of the precious metals is therefore not so exact     certainly as regards silver as mr mill would have us believe     and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of     demand and supply in the same way that it affects things other     than money   it is evident however that the cost of production in the long run regulates the quantity and that every country temporary fluctuation excepted will possess and have in circulation just that quantity of money which will perform all the exchanges required of it consistently with maintaining a value conformable to its cost of production the prices of things will on the average be such that money will exchange for its own cost in all other goods and precisely because the quantity can not be prevented from affecting the value the quantity itself will by a sort of selfacting machinery be kept at the amount consistent with that standard of prices—at the amount necessary for performing at those prices all the business required of it     chapter vii of a double standard and subsidiary coins    § 1 objections to a double standard   though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for being used as money are rarely united in any considerable perfection there are two commodities which possess them in an eminent and nearly an equal degree—the two precious metals as they are called—gold and silver some nations have accordingly attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals indiscriminately  there is an obvious convenience in making use of the more costly metal for larger payments and the cheaper one for smaller and the only question relates to the mode in which this can best be done the mode most frequently adopted has been to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion to decide by law for example that sixteen grains of silver should be equivalent to one grain of gold and it being left free to every one who has a dollar to pay either to pay it in the one metal or in the other  if their natural or cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one another the arrangement would be unobjectionable this however is far from being the fact gold and silver though the least variable in value of all commodities are not invariable and do not always vary simultaneously silver for example was lowered in permanent value more than gold by the discovery of the american mines and those small variations of value which take place occasionally do not affect both metals alike suppose such a variation to take place—the value of the two metals relatively to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportion—one or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value and there will be a profit to be made by melting it  suppose for example that gold rises in value relatively to silver so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings two consequences will ensue no debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold he will always pay in silver because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign the other consequence will be that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty shillings all the sovereigns will be melted since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin the converse of all this would happen if silver instead of gold were the metal which had risen in comparative value a sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted and sold as bullion for gold at their real value—that is above the legal valuation the money of the community therefore would never really consist of both metals but of the one only which at the particular time best suited the interest of debtors and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other at a loss on each change of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use       this is the operation by which is carried into effect the law of     sir thomas gresham a merchant of the time of elizabeth to the     purport that “money of less value drives out money of more value”     where both are legal payments among individuals a celebrated     instance is that where the clipped coins of england were received     by the state on equal terms with new and perfect coin before 1695     they hanged men and women but they did not prevent the operation     of gresham’s law and the disappearance of the perfect coins when     the state refused the clipped coins at legal value by no longer     receiving them in payment of taxes the trouble ceased234     jevons gives a striking illustration of the same law “at the time     of the treaty of 1858 between great britain the united states     and japan which partially opened up the last country to european     traders a very curious system of currency existed in japan the     most valuable japanese coin was the kobang consisting of a thin     oval disk of gold about two inches long and one and a quarter     inch wide weighing two hundred grains and ornamented in a very     primitive manner it was passing current in the towns of japan for     four silver itzebus but was worth in english money about 18s     5d whereas the silver itzebu was equal only to about 1s     4d four itzebus being worth in english money 5s 4d the     earliest european traders enjoyed a rare opportunity for making     profit by buying up the kobangs at the native rating they trebled     their money until the natives perceiving what was being done     withdrew from circulation the remainder of the gold”235   it appears therefore that the value of money is liable to more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal it is subject to derangement from those of two the particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value or what is commonly called a depreciation since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the rated value if the tendency of the metals be to rise in value all payments will be made in the one which has risen least and if to fall then in that which has fallen most       while liable to “more frequent fluctuations” prices do not follow     the extreme fluctuations of both metals as some suppose and as     is shown by the following diagram236 a represents the line of     the value of gold and b of silver relatively to some third     commodity represented by the horizontal line superposing these     curves c would show the line of extreme variations while since     prices would follow the metal which falls in value d would show     the actual course of variations while the fluctuations are more     frequent in d they are less extreme than in c                               illustration          chart showing the line of prices under a double standard    § 2 the use of the two metals as money and the management of subsidiary coins   the plan of a double standard is still occasionally brought forward by here and there a writer or orator as a great improvement in currency  it is probable that with most of its adherents its chief merit is its tendency to a sort of depreciation there being at all times abundance of supporters for any mode either open or covert of lowering the standard but the advantage without the disadvantages of a double standard seems to be best obtained by those nations with whom one only of the two metals is a legal tender but the other also is coined and allowed to pass for whatever value the market assigns to it  when this plan is adopted it is naturally the more costly metal which is left to be bought and sold as an article of commerce but nations which like england adopt the more costly of the two as their standard resort to a different expedient for retaining them both in circulation namely 1 to make silver a legal tender but only for small payments in england no one can be compelled to receive silver in payment for a larger amount than forty shillings with this regulation there is necessarily combined another namely 2 that silver coin should be rated in comparison with gold somewhat above its intrinsic value that there should not be in twenty shillings as much silver as is worth a sovereign for if there were a very slight turn of the market in its favor would make it worth more than a sovereign and it would be profitable to melt the silver coin the overvaluation of the silver coin creates an inducement to buy silver and send it to the mint to be coined since it is given back at a higher value than properly belongs to it this however has been guarded against 3 by limiting the quantity of the silver coinage which is not left like that of gold to the discretion of individuals but is determined by the government and restricted to the amount supposed to be required for small payments the only precaution necessary is not to put so high a valuation upon the silver as to hold out a strong temptation to private coining    § 3 the experience of the united states with a double standard from 1792 to 1883       the experience of the united states with a double standard     extending as it does from 1792 to 1873 without a break and from     1878 to the present time is a most valuable source of instruction     in regard to the practical working of bimetallism while we have     nominally had a double standard in reality we have either had one     alone or been in a transition from one to the other standard and     the history of our coinage strikingly illustrates the truth that     the natural values of the two metals in spite of all legislation     so vary relatively to each other that a constant ratio can not be     maintained for any length of time and that “the poor money drives     out the good” according to gresham’s statement for clearness     the period may be divided in accordance with the changes of     legislation into four divisions      i 17921834 transition from gold to silver      ii 18341853 transition from silver to gold      iii 18531878 single gold currency except 18621879 the paper     period      iv 18781884 transition from gold to silver      i with the establishment of the mint hamilton agreed upon the     use of both gold and silver in our money at a ratio of 15 to 1     that is that the amount of pure silver in a dollar should be     fifteen times the weight of gold in a dollar so while the     various spanish dollars then in circulation in the united states     seemed to contain on the average about 371¼ grains of pure     silver and since hamilton believed the relative market value of     gold and silver to be about 1 to 15 he put 115 of 371¼ grains     or 24¾ grains of pure gold into the gold dollar it was the best     possible example of the bimetallic system to be found and the     mint ratio was intended to conform to the market ratio if this     conformity could have been maintained there would have been no     disturbance but a cause was already in operation affecting the     supply of one of the metals—silver—wholly independent of     legislation and without correspondingly affecting gold      two periods of production of silver in which the production of     silver was great relatively to gold stand out prominently in the     history of that metal 1 one was the enormous yield from the     mines of the new world continuing from 1545 to about 1640 and     2 the only other period of great production at all comparable     with it that is as regards the production of silver relatively     to gold was that lasting from 1780 to 1820 due to the richness     of the mexican silvermines the first period of ninetyfive years     was longer than the second which was only forty years yet while     about fortyseven times as much silver as gold was produced on an     average during the first period the average annual amount of     silver produced relatively to gold was probably a little greater     from 1780 to 1820 the effect of the first period in lowering the     relation of silver to gold is well recognized in the history of     the precious metals see chart x for the fall in the value of     silver relatively to gold that the effect of the second period     on the value of silver has not been greater than was actually     caused—it has not been small—is explicable only by the laws of the     value of money if you let the same amount of water into a small     reservoir which you let into a large one the level of the former     will be raised more than the level of the latter the great     production of the first period was added to a very small existing     stock of silver that of the second period was added to a stock     increased by the great previous production just mentioned the     smallness of the annual product relatively to the total quantity     existing in the world requires some time even for a production of     silver fortyseven times greater than the gold production to take     its effect on the value of the total silver stock in existence     the effect of this process was beginning to be felt soon after the     united states decided on a double standard for this reason the     value of silver was declining about 1800 and although the annual     silver product fell off seriously after 1820 the value of silver     continued to decline even after that time because the increased     production dating back to 1780 was just beginning to make itself     felt thus we have the phenomenon—which seems very difficult for     some persons to understand—of a falling off in the annual     production of silver accompanied by a decrease in its value     relatively to gold      this diminishing value of silver began to affect the coinage of     the united states as early as 1811 and by 1820 the disappearance     of gold was everywhere commented upon the process by which this     result is produced is a simple one and is adopted as soon as a     margin of profit is seen arising from a divergence between the     mint and market ratios in 1820 the market ratio of gold to silver     was 1 to 157—that is the amount of gold in a dollar 24¾     grains would exchange for 157 times as many grains of silver in     the market in the form of bullion while at the mint in the form     of coin it would exchange for only 15 times as many grains of     silver a broker having 1000 gold dollars could buy with them in     the market silver bullion enough 1000 × 157 grains to have     coined when presented at the mint 1000 dollars in silver     pieces and yet have left over as a profit by the operation 700     grains of silver so long as this can be done silver the     cheapest money will be presented at the mint and gold the     dearest money will become an article of merchandise too valuable     to be used as money when the cheaper silver is legally as good     the best money therefore disappears from circulation as it did     in the united states before 1820 owing to the fall in the value     of silver it is to be said that it has been seriously urged by     some writers that silver did not fall but that gold rose in     value owing to the demand of england for resumption in 1819237     chronology kills this view for the change in the value of silver     began too early to have been due to english measures even if     conclusive reasons have not been given above why silver should     naturally have fallen in value                               illustration      chart x chart showing the changes in the relative values of gold         and silver from 1501 to 1880 from 1501 to 1680 a space is      allotted to each 20 years from 1681 to 1871 to each 10 years                      from 1876 to 1880 to each year       ii the change in the relative values of gold and silver finally     forced the united states to change their mint ratio in 1834 two     courses were open to us 1 either to increase the quantity of     silver in the dollar until the dollar of silver was intrinsically     worth the gold in the gold dollar or 2 debase the gold     dollarpiece until it was reduced in value proportionate to the     depreciation of silver since 1792 the latter expedient without     any seeming regard to the effect on contracts and the integrity of     our monetary standard was adopted 6589 per cent was taken out     of the gold dollar leaving it containing 2322 grains of pure     gold and as the silver dollar remained unchanged 371¼ grains     the mint ratio established was 1 to 15988 or as commonly     stated 1 to 16 did this correspond with the market ratio then     existing no having seen the former steady fall in silver and     believing that it would continue congress hoped to anticipate any     further fall by making the mint ratio of gold to silver a little     larger than the market ratio this was done by establishing the     mint ratio of 1 to 15988 while the market ratio in 1834 was 1 to     1573 here again appeared the difficulty arising from the     attempt to balance a ratio on a movable fulcrum it will be seen     that the act of 1834 set at work forces for another change in the     coinage—forces of a similar kind but working in exactly the     opposite direction to those previous to 1834 a dollar of gold     coin would now exchange for more grains of silver at the mint     1598 than it would in the form of bullion in the market     1573 therefore it would be more profitable to put gold into     coin than exchange it as bullion gold was sent to the mint while     silver began to be withdrawn from circulation silver now being     more valuable as bullion than as coin by 1840 a silver dollar was     worth 102 cents in gold238 this movement which was displacing     silver with gold received a surprising and unexpected impetus by     the gold discoveries of california and australia in 1849 before     mentioned and made gold less valuable relatively to silver by     lowering the value of gold here again was another natural     cause independent of legislation and not to be foreseen     altering the value of one of the precious metals and in exactly     the opposite direction from that in the previous period when     silver was lowered by the increase from the mexican mines in 1853     a silver dollar was worth 104 cents in gold ie of a gold     dollar containing 2322 grains but some years before all     silver dollars had disappeared from use and only gold was in     circulation for a large part of this period we had in reality a     single standard of gold the other metal not being able to stay in     the currency      iii after our previous experience the impossibility of retaining     both metals in the coinage together on equal terms now came to     be generally recognized and was accepted by congress in the     legislation of 1853 this act made no further changes intended to     adapt the mint to the market ratios but remained satisfied with     the gold circulation but hitherto no regard had been paid to the     principles on which a subsidiary coinage is based as explained by     mr mill in the last section § 2 the act of 1853 while     acquiescing in the single gold standard had for its purpose the     readjustment of the subsidiary coins which together with silver     dollarpieces had all gone out of circulation before this two     halves four quarters or ten dimes contained the same quantity of     pure silver as the dollarpiece 371¼ grains therefore when it     became profitable to withdraw the dollarpieces and substitute     gold it gave exactly the same profit to withdraw two halves or     four quarters in silver for this reason all the subsidiary silver     had gone out of circulation and there was no “small change” in     the country the legislation of 1853 rectified this error 1 by     reducing the quantity of pure silver in a dollar’s worth of     subsidiary coin to 3456 grains by making so much less an amount     of silver equal to a dollar of small coins it was more valuable     in that shape than as bullion and there was no reason for melting     it or withdrawing it since even if gold and silver changed     considerably in their relative values 3456 grains of silver     could not easily rise sufficiently to become equal in value to a     gold dollar when 371¼ grains were worth only 104 cents of the     gold dollar 2 this overvaluation of silver in subsidiary coin     would cause a great flow of silver to the mint since silver would     be more valuable in subsidiary coin than as bullion but this was     prevented by the provision section 4 of the act of 1853 that the     amount or the small coinage should be limited according to the     discretion of the secretary of the treasury and 3 in order     that the overvalued small coinage might not be used for purposes     other than for effecting change its legaltender power was     restricted to payments not exceeding five dollars this system a     single gold standard for large and silver for small payments     continued without question and with great convenience until the     days of the war when paper money 18621879 drove out by its     cheapness again both gold and silver paper was far cheaper than     the cheapest of the two metals                               illustration           relative values of gold and silver by months in 1876       the mere fact that the silver dollarpiece had not circulated     since even long before 1853 led the authorities to drop out the     provisions for the coinage of silver dollars and in 1873 remove it     from the list of legal coins at the ratio of 1 to 1598 the     obsolete ratio fixed as far back as 1834 this is what is known     as the “demonetization” of silver it had no effect on the     circulation of silver dollars since none were in use and had not     been for more than twentyfive years there had been no desire up     to this time to use silver since it was more expensive than gold     indeed it is somewhat humiliating to our sense of national honor     to reflect that it was not until silver fell so surprisingly in     value in 1876 that the agitation for its use in the coinage     arose when a silver dollar was worth 104 cents no one wanted it     as a means of liquidating debts when it came to be worth 86     cents it was capable of serving debtors even better than the then     appreciating greenbacks thus while from 1853 and even before     we had legally two standards of both gold and silver but really     only one that of gold from 1873 to 1878 we had both legally and     really only one standard that of gold      it might be here added that i have spoken of the silver dollar as     containing 371¼ grains of pure silver of course alloy is mixed     with the pure silver sufficient in 1792 to make the original     dollar weigh 416 grains in all its “standard” weight in 1837 the     amount of alloy was changed from 112 to 110 of the standard     weight which as the 371¼ grains of pure silver were unchanged     gave the total weight of the dollar as 412½ grains whence the     familiar name assigned to this piece in 1873 moreover the mint     was permitted to put its stamp and devices—to what was not money     at all but a “coined ingot”—on 378 grains of pure silver 420     grains standard known as the “tradedollar” it was intended by     this means to make united states silver more serviceable in the     asiatic trade oriental nations care almost exclusively for silver     in payments the mexican silver dollar contained 377¼ grains of     pure silver the japanese yen 374410 and the united states     dollar 371¼ by making the “tradedollar” slightly heavier than     any coin used in the eastern world it would give our silver a new     market and the united states government was simply asked to     certify to the fineness and weight by coining it provided the     owners of silver paid the expenses of coinage inadvertently the     tradedollar was included in the list of coins in the act of 1873     which were legal tender for payments of five dollars but when     this was discovered it was repealed in 1876 so that the     tradedollar was not a legal coin in any sense although it     contained more silver than the 412½grains dollar they ceased     to be coined in 1878 to which time there had been made     35959360      iv in february 1878 an indiscreet and unreasonable movement     induced congress to authorize the recoinage of the silver     dollarpiece at the obsolete ratio of 1834 1 to 1598 while the     market ratio was 1 to 1787 so extraordinary a reversal of all     sound principles and such blindness to our previous experience     could be explained only by a desire to force this country to use a     silver coinage only and had its origin with the owners of     silvermines aided by the desires of debtors for a cheap unit in     which to absolve themselves from their indebtedness there was no     pretense of setting up a double standard about it for it was     evident to the most ignorant that so great a disproportion between     the mint and market ratios must inevitably lead to the     disappearance of gold entirely this would happen if owners could     bring their silver freely in any amounts to the mint for coinage     “free coinage” and so exchange silver against gold coin for the     purpose of withdrawing gold since gold would exchange for less as     coin than as bullion this immediate result was prevented by a     provision in the law which prevented the “free coinage” of     silver and required the government itself to buy silver and coin     at least 2000000 in silver each month this retarded but will     not ultimately prevent the change from the present gold to a     single silver standard at the rate of 24000000 a year it is     only a question of time when the treasury will be obliged to pay     out for its regular disbursements on the public debt silver in     such amounts as will drive gold out of circulation in february     1884 it was feared that this was already at hand and was     practically reached in the august following unless a repeal of     the law is reached very soon the uncomfortable spectacle will be     seen of a gradual disarrangement of prices and consequently of     trade arising from a change of the standard      in order that the alternate movements of silver and gold to the     mint for coinage may be seen there is appended a statement of the     coinage239 during the above periods which well shows the     effects of gresham’s law      ratio in the mint and in     period   gold coinage   silver dollars     the market                                            coined

be seen that there has been an enforced coinage     by the treasury of almost twice as many silver dollars since 1878     as were coined in all the history of the mint before since the     establishment of the government      it may perhaps be asked why the silver dollar of 412½ grains     being worth intrinsically only from 86 to 89 cents does not     depreciate to that value the government buys the silver owns the     coin and holds all that it can not induce the public to receive     voluntarily so that but a part of the total coinage is out of the     treasury and most of the coins issued are returned for deposit     and silver certificates received in return there being no free     coinage and no greater amount in circulation than satisfies the     demand for change instead of small bills the dollarpieces will     circulate at their full value on the principle of subsidiary     coin even though overvalued and the silver certificates     practically go through a process of constant redemption by being     received for customs dues equally with gold when they become too     great in quantity to be needed for such purposes then we may look     for the depreciation with good reason240      there are then the following kinds of legal tender in the united     states in 1884 1 gold coins if not below tolerance 2 the     silver dollar of 412½ grains 3 united states notes except for     customs and interest on the public debt 4 subsidiary silver     coinage to the amount of five dollars and 5 minor coins to     the amount of twentyfive cents      the question of a double standard has provoked no little vehement     discussion and has called forth a considerable literature since     the fall of silver in 1876 a body of opinion exists best     represented in this country by f a walker and s d horton that     the relative values of gold and silver may be kept unchanged in     spite of all natural causes by the force of law which provided     that enough countries join in the plan shall fix the ratio of     exchange in the coinage for all great commercial countries and by     this means keep the coinage ratio equivalent to the bullion ratio     the difficulty with this scheme even if it were wholly     sufficient has thus far been in the obstacles to international     agreement after several international monetary conferences in     1867 1878 and 1881 the project seems now to have been     practically abandoned by all except the most sanguine for a     fuller list of authorities on bimetallism see appendix i     chapter viii of credit as a substitute for money    § 1 credit not a creation but a transfer of the means of production   credit has a great but not as many people seem to suppose a magical power it can not make something out of nothing how often is an extension of credit talked of as equivalent to a creation of capital or as if credit actually were capital it seems strange that there should be any need to point out that credit being only permission to use the capital of another person the means of production can not be increased by it but only transferred if the borrower’s means of production and of employing labor are increased by the credit given him the lender’s are as much diminished the same sum can not be used as capital both by the owner and also by the person to whom it is lent it can not supply its entire value in wages tools and materials to two sets of laborers at once it is true that the capital which a has borrowed from b and makes use of in his business still forms a part of the wealth of b for other purposes he can enter into arrangements in reliance on it and can borrow when needful an equivalent sum on the security of it so that to a superficial eye it might seem as if both b and a had the use of it at once but the smallest consideration will show that when b has parted with his capital to a the use of it as capital rests with a alone and that b has no other service from it than in so far as his ultimate claim upon it serves him to obtain the use of another capital from a third person c    § 2 in what manner it assists production   but though credit is never anything more than a transfer of capital from hand to hand it is generally and naturally a transfer to hands more competent to employ the capital efficiently in production if there were no such thing as credit or if from general insecurity and want of confidence it were scantily practiced many persons who possess more or less of capital but who from their occupations or for want of the necessary skill and knowledge can not personally superintend its employment would derive no benefit from it their funds would either lie idle or would be perhaps wasted and annihilated in unskillful attempts to make them yield a profit all this capital is now lent at interest and made available for production capital thus circumstanced forms a large portion of the productive resources of any commercial country and is naturally attracted to those producers or traders who being in the greatest business have the means of employing it to most advantage because such are both the most desirous to obtain it and able to give the best security although therefore the productive funds of the country are not increased by credit they are called into a more complete state of productive activity as the confidence on which credit is grounded extends itself means are developed by which even the smallest portions of capital the sums which each person keeps by him to meet contingencies are made available for productive uses the principal instruments for this purpose are banks of deposit where these do not exist a prudent person must keep a sufficient sum unemployed in his own possession to meet every demand which he has even a slight reason for thinking himself liable to when the practice however has grown up of keeping this reserve not in his own custody but with a banker many small sums previously lying idle become aggregated in the banker’s hands and the banker being taught by experience what proportion of the amount is likely to be wanted in a given time and knowing that if one depositor happens to require more than the average another will require less is able to lend the remainder that is the far greater part to producers and dealers thereby adding the amount not indeed to the capital in existence but to that in employment and making a corresponding addition to the aggregate production of the community  while credit is thus indispensable for rendering the whole capital of the country productive it is also a means by which the industrial talent of the country is turned to better account for purposes of production many a person who has either no capital of his own or very little but who has qualifications for business which are known and appreciated by some possessors of capital is enabled to obtain either advances in money or more frequently goods on credit by which his industrial capacities are made instrumental to the increase of the public wealth  such are in the most general point of view the uses of credit to the productive resources of the world but these considerations only apply to the credit given to the industrious classes—to producers and dealers credit given by dealers to unproductive consumers is never an addition but always a detriment to the sources of public wealth it makes over in temporary use not the capital of the unproductive classes to the productive but that of the productive to the unproductive    § 3 function of credit in economizing the use of money   but a more intricate portion of the theory of credit is its influence on prices the chief cause of most of the mercantile phenomena which perplex observers in a state of commerce in which much credit is habitually given general prices at any moment depend much more upon the state of credit than upon the quantity of money for credit though it is not productive power is purchasing power and a person who having credit avails himself of it in the purchase of goods creates just as much demand for the goods and tends quite as much to raise their price as if he made an equal amount of purchases with ready money  the credit which we are now called upon to consider as a distinct purchasing power independent of money is of course not credit in its simplest form that of money lent by one person to another and paid directly into his hands for when the borrower expends this in purchases he makes the purchases with money not credit and exerts no purchasing power over and above that conferred by the money the forms of credit which create purchasing power are those in which no money passes at the time and very often none passes at all the transaction being included with a mass of other transactions in an account and nothing paid but a balance this takes place in a variety of ways which we shall proceed to examine beginning as is our custom with the simplest  first suppose a and b to be two dealers who have transactions with each other both as buyers and as sellers a buys from b on credit b does the like with respect to a at the end of the year the sum of a’s debts to b is set against the sum of b’s debts to a and it is ascertained to which side a balance is due this balance which may be less than the amount of many of the transactions singly and is necessarily less than the sum of the transactions is all that is paid in money and perhaps even this is not paid but carried over in an account current to the next year a single payment of a hundred pounds may in this manner suffice to liquidate a long series of transactions some of them to the value of thousands  but secondly the debts of a to b may be paid without the intervention of money even though there be no reciprocal debts of b to a a may satisfy b by making over to him a debt due to himself from a third person c this is conveniently done by means of a written instrument called a bill of exchange which is in fact a transferable order by a creditor upon his debtor and when accepted by the debtor that is authenticated by his signature becomes an acknowledgment of debt    § 4 bills of exchange   bills of exchange were first introduced to save the expense and risk of transporting the precious metals from place to place  the trade between new york and liverpool affords a constant illustration of the uses of a bill of exchange suppose that a in new york ships a cargo of wheat worth 100000 or £20000 to b in liverpool also suppose that c in liverpool independently of the negotiations of a and b ships about the same time a cargo of steel rails to d in new york also worth £20000 without the use of bills of exchange b would have been obliged to send £20000 in gold across the atlantic and so would d at the risk of loss to both by the device of bills of exchange the goods are really bartered against each other and all transmission of money saved                               illustration  a has money due to him in liverpool and he sells his claim to this money to any one who wants to make a payment in liverpool going to his banker the middleman between exporters and importers and the one who deals in such bills he finds there d inquiring for some one who has a claim to money in liverpool since d owes c in liverpool for his cargo of steel rails a makes out a paper title to the £20000 which b owes him ie a bill of exchange and by selling it to d gets immediately his £20000 there in new york the form in which this is done is as follows       new york january 1 1884      at sight or sixty days after date of this first bill of exchange     second and third unpaid pay to the order of d the importer of     steel rails £20000 value received and charge the same to the     account of      signed a exporter of wheat     to b buyer of wheat     liverpool eng   d has now paid 100000 or £20000 to a for a title to money across the atlantic in liverpool and with this title he can pay his debt to c for the rails d indorses the bill of exchange as follows       pay to the order of c the seller of steel rails liverpool     value in account d importer of steel rails      to b the buyer of wheat   by this means d transfers his title to the £20000 to c sends the bill across by mail “first” in one steamer “second” in another to insure certain transmission to c who then calls upon b to pay him the £20000 instead of b sending it across the atlantic to a and all four persons have made their payments the more safely by the use of this convenient device this is the simplest form of the transaction and it does not change the principle on which it is based when as is the case a banker buys the bills of a and sells the bills to d—since a typifies all exporters and d all importers  bills of exchange having been found convenient as means of paying debts at distant places without the expense of transporting the precious metals their use was afterward greatly extended from another motive it is usual in every trade to give a certain length of credit for goods bought three months six months a year even two years according to the convenience or custom of the particular trade a dealer who has sold goods for which he is to be paid in six months but who desires to receive payment sooner draws a bill on his debtor payable in six months and gets the bill discounted by a banker or other moneylender that is transfers the bill to him receiving the amount minus interest for the time it has still to run it has become one of the chief functions of bills of exchange to serve as a means by which a debt due from one person can thus be made available for obtaining credit from another       bills of exchange are drawn between the various cities of the     united states in the west the factor who is purchasing grain or     wool for a new york firm draws on his new york correspondents and     this bill usually certified to by the bill of lading is     presented for discount at the western banks and if there are     many bills funds are possibly sent westward to meet these     demands but the purchases of the west in new york will serve     even if a little later in time somewhat to offset this drain and     the funds will again move eastward as goods move westward     practically bartered against each other by the use of bills there     is however less movement of funds of late now that western     cities have accumulated more capital of their own   the notes given in consequence of a real sale of goods can not be considered as on that account certainly representing any actual property suppose that a sells £100 worth of goods to b at six months’ credit and takes a bill at six months for it and that b within a month after sells the same goods at a like credit to c taking a like bill and again that c after another month sells them to d taking a like bill and so on there may then at the end of six months be six bills of £100 each existing at the same time and every one of these may possibly have been discounted of all these bills then only one represents any actual property  the extent of a man’s actual sales forms some limit to the amount of his real notes and as it is highly desirable in commerce that credit should be dealt out to all persons in some sort of regular and due proportion the measure of a man’s actual sales certified by the appearance of his bills drawn in virtue of those sales is some rule in the case though a very imperfect one in many respects when a bill drawn upon one person is paid to another or even to the same person in discharge of a debt or a pecuniary claim it does something for which if the bill did not exist money would be required it performs the functions of currency this is a use to which bills of exchange are often applied  many bills both domestic and foreign are at last presented for payment quite covered with indorsements each of which represents either a fresh discounting or a pecuniary transaction in which the bill has performed the functions of money    § 5 promissory notes   a third form in which credit is employed as a substitute for currency is that of promissory notes       the difference between a bill of exchange and a promissory note     is that the former is an order for the payment of money while     the latter is a promise to pay money in a note the promissor is     primarily liable in a bill the drawer becomes liable only after     an ineffectual resort to the drawee      in the united states a western merchant who buys 1000 worth of     cotton goods for instance of a boston commissionhouse on     credit customarily gives his note for the amount and this note     is put upon the market or presented at a bank for discount this     plan however puts all risk upon the one who discounted the note     in the united states such promissory notes are the forms of credit     most used between merchants and buyers the custom however is     quite different in england and germany and generally it is     stated on the continent where bills of exchange are employed in     cases where we use a promissory note a house in london sells     1000 worth of cotton goods to a in carlisle on a credit of     sixty days draws a bill of exchange on a which is a demand upon     a to pay in a given time eg sixty days and if “accepted” by     him is a legal obligation the london house takes this bill     perhaps adding its own firm name as indorsers to the paper and     presents it for discount at a london bank this now explains why     it is that when a particular industry is prosperous and many     goods are sold there is more “paper” offered for discount at the     banks cf p 222 and why capital flows readily in that     direction   it is chiefly in the latter form promissory notes that it has become in commercial countries an express occupation to issue such substitutes for money dealers in money wish to lend not their capital merely but their credit and not only such portion of their credit as consists of funds actually deposited with them but their power of obtaining credit from the public generally so far as they think they can safely employ it this is done in a very convenient manner by lending their own promissory notes payable to bearer on demand—the borrower being willing to accept these as so much money because the credit of the lender makes other people willingly receive them on the same footing in purchases or other payments these notes therefore perform all the functions of currency and render an equivalent amount of money which was previously in circulation unnecessary as however being payable on demand they may be at any time returned on the issuer and money demanded for them he must on pain of bankruptcy keep by him as much money as will enable him to meet any claims of that sort which can be expected to occur within the time necessary for providing himself with more and prudence also requires that he should not attempt to issue notes beyond the amount which experience shows can remain in circulation without being presented for payment  the convenience of this mode of as it were coining credit having once been discovered governments have availed themselves of the same expedient and have issued their own promissory notes in payment of their expenses a resource the more useful because it is the only mode in which they are able to borrow money without paying interest    § 6 deposits and checks   a fourth mode of making credit answer the purposes of money by which when carried far enough money may be very completely superseded consists in making payments by checks the custom of keeping the spare cash reserved for immediate use or against contingent demands in the hands of a banker and making all payments except small ones by orders on bankers is in this country spreading to a continually larger portion of the public if the person making the payment and the person receiving it keep their money with the same banker the payment takes place without any intervention of money by the mere transfer of its amount in the banker’s books from the credit of the payer to that of the receiver if all persons in new york kept their cash at the same banker’s and made all their payments by means of checks no money would be required or used for any transactions beginning and terminating in new york this ideal limit is almost attained in fact so far as regards transactions between wholesale dealers it is chiefly in the retail transactions between dealers and consumers and in the payment of wages that money or banknotes now pass and then only when the amounts are small as for the merchants and larger dealers they habitually make all payments in the course of their business by checks they do not however all deal with the same banker and when a gives a check to b b usually pays it not into the same but into some other bank but the convenience of business has given birth to an arrangement which makes all the bankinghouses of a city for certain purposes virtually one establishment a banker does not send the checks which are paid into his bankinghouse to the banks on which they are drawn and demand money for them there is a building called the clearinghouse to which every member of the association sends each afternoon all the checks on other bankers which he has received during the day and they are there exchanged for the checks on him which have come into the hands of other bankers the balances only being paid in money or even these not in money but in checks       a clearinghouse is simply a circular railing containing as many     openings as there are banks in the association a clerk from each     bank presents in the form of a bundle of checks at his opening     all the claims of his bank against all others and notes the total     amount a clerk inside takes the checks distributes each check to     the clerk of the bank against whom it is drawn and all that are     left at his opening constitute the total demands of all the other     banks against itself and this sum total is set off against the     given bank’s demands upon the others the difference for or     against the bank as the case may be may then be settled by a     check241      the total amount of exchanges made through the new york     clearinghouse in 1883 was 40293165258 or about twentyfive     times the total of our national debt in that year and the     balances paid in money were only 39 per cent of the     exchanges242 for valuable explanations on this subject consult     jevons “money and the mechanism of exchange” chapters xixxxiii     the explanation of the functions of a bank chapter xx is very     good     chapter ix influence of credit on prices    § 1 what acts on prices is credit in whatever shape given   having now formed a general idea of the modes in which credit is made available as a substitute for money we have to consider in what manner the use of these substitutes affects the value of money or what is equivalent the prices of commodities it is hardly necessary to say that the permanent value of money—the natural and average prices of commodities—are not in question here these are determined by the cost of producing or of obtaining the precious metals an ounce of gold or silver will in the long run exchange for as much of every other commodity as can be produced or imported at the same cost with itself and an order or note of hand or bill payable at sight for an ounce of gold while the credit of the giver is unimpaired is worth neither more nor less than the gold itself  it is not however with ultimate or average but with immediate and temporary prices that we are now concerned these as we have seen may deviate very widely from the standard of cost of production among other causes of fluctuation one we have found to be the quantity of money in circulation other things being the same an increase of the money in circulation raises prices a diminution lowers them if more money is thrown into circulation than the quantity which can circulate at a value conformable to its cost of production the value of money so long as the excess lasts will remain below the standard of cost of production and general prices will be sustained above the natural rate  but we have now found that there are other things such as banknotes bills of exchange and checks which circulate as money and perform all the functions of it and the question arises do these various substitutes operate on prices in the same manner as money itself i apprehend that banknotes bills or checks as such do not act on prices at all what does act on prices is credit in whatever shape given and whether it gives rise to any transferable instruments capable of passing into circulation or not    § 2 credit a purchasing power similar to money   money acts upon prices in no other way than by being tendered in exchange for commodities the demand which influences the prices of commodities consists of the money offered for them money not in circulation has no effect on prices  in the case however of payment by checks the purchases are at any rate made though not with the money in the buyer’s possession yet with money to which he has a right but he may make purchases with money which he only expects to have or even only pretends to expect he may obtain goods in return for his acceptances payable at a future time or on his note of hand or on a simple bookcredit—that is on a mere promise to pay all these purchases have exactly the same effect on price as if they were made with ready money the amount of purchasing power which a person can exercise is composed of all the money in his possession or due to him and of all his credit for exercising the whole of this power he finds a sufficient motive only under peculiar circumstances but he always possesses it and the portion of it which he at any time does exercise is the measure of the effect which he produces on price  suppose that in the expectation that some commodity will rise in price he determines not only to invest in it all his ready money but to take up on credit from the producers or importers as much of it as their opinion of his resources will enable him to obtain every one must see that by thus acting he produces a greater effect on price than if he limited his purchases to the money he has actually in hand he creates a demand for the article to the full amount of his money and credit taken together and raises the price proportionally to both and this effect is produced though none of the written instruments called substitutes for currency may be called into existence though the transaction may give rise to no bill of exchange nor to the issue of a single banknote the buyer instead of taking a mere bookcredit might have given a bill for the amount or might have paid for the goods with banknotes borrowed for that purpose from a banker thus making the purchase not on his own credit with the seller but on the banker’s credit with the seller and his own with the banker had he done so he would have produced as great an effect on price as by a simple purchase to the same amount on a bookcredit but no greater effect the credit itself not the form and mode in which it is given is the operating cause    § 3 great extensions and contractions of credit phenomena of a commercial crisis analyzed   the inclination of the mercantile public to increase their demand for commodities by making use of all or much of their credit as a purchasing power depends on their expectation of profit when there is a general impression that the price of some commodity is likely to rise from an extra demand a short crop obstructions to importation or any other cause there is a disposition among dealers to increase their stocks in order to profit by the expected rise this disposition tends in itself to produce the effect which it looks forward to—a rise of price and if the rise is considerable and progressive other speculators are attracted who so long as the price has not begun to fall are willing to believe that it will continue rising these by further purchases produce a further advance and thus a rise of price for which there were originally some rational grounds is often heightened by merely speculative purchases until it greatly exceeds what the original grounds will justify after a time this begins to be perceived the price ceases to rise and the holders thinking it time to realize their gains are anxious to sell then the price begins to decline the holders rush into the market to avoid a still greater loss and few being willing to buy in a falling market the price falls much more suddenly than it rose those who have bought at a higher price than reasonable calculation justified and who have been overtaken by the revulsion before they had realized are losers in proportion to the greatness of the fall and to the quantity of the commodity which they hold or have bound themselves to pay for  this is the ideal extreme case of what is called a commercial crisis there is said to be a commercial crisis when a great number of merchants and traders at once either have or apprehend that they shall have a difficulty in meeting their engagements the most usual cause of this general embarrassment is the recoil of prices after they have been raised by a spirit of speculation intense in degree and extending to many commodities when after such a rise the reaction comes and prices begin to fall though at first perhaps only through the desire of the holders to realize speculative purchases cease but were this all prices would only fall to the level from which they rose or to that which is justified by the state of the consumption and of the supply they fall however much lower for as when prices were rising and everybody apparently making a fortune it was easy to obtain almost any amount of credit so now when everybody seems to be losing and many fail entirely it is with difficulty that firms of known solidity can obtain even the credit to which they are accustomed and which it is the greatest inconvenience to them to be without because all dealers have engagements to fulfill and nobody feeling sure that the portion of his means which he has intrusted to others will be available in time no one likes to part with ready money or to postpone his claim to it to these rational considerations there is superadded in extreme cases a panic as unreasoning as the previous overconfidence money is borrowed for short periods at almost any rate of interest and sales of goods for immediate payment are made at almost any sacrifice thus general prices during a commercial revulsion fall as much below the usual level as during the previous period of speculation they have risen above it the fall as well as the rise originating not in anything affecting money but in the state of credit       professor jevons seriously advanced a theory that inasmuch as the     harvests of the world were the causes of good or bad trade and     that their deficiency would regularly be followed by commercial     distress then a periodic cause of bad harvests if found would     explain the constant recurrence of commercial crises this cause     he claimed to have found in the sunspots which periodically     deprive the crops of that source of growth which is usually     furnished by the sun when no spots appear243 it has not     received general acceptance      in the united states financial disasters have occurred in 1814     1819 1825 18371839 1857 and 1873 those of 1837 and 1873 seem     to have been the most serious in their effects but this field so     far as scientific study is concerned has not been fully worked     and much remains to be learned about these crises in the united     states the crisis of 1873 was due to excessive railwaybuilding     it was testified244 concerning the new york banks in 1873 that     “their capital needed for legitimate purposes was practically lent     out on certain iron rails railroadties bridges and     rollingstock called railroads many of them laid down in     places where these materials were practically useless”      under the effects due to swift communication by steam but     especially to the electric telegraph modern credit is a very     different thing from what it was fifty years ago now a shock on     the bourse at vienna is felt the same day at paris london and     new york a commercial crisis in one great moneycenter is felt at     every other point in the world which has business connections with     it moreover as cherbuliez245 says “a country is more subject     to crises the more advanced is its economical development there     are certain maladies which attack only grownup persons who have     reached a certain degree of vigor and maturity”    § 4 influence of the different forms of credit on prices   it does not indeed follow that credit will be more used because it can be when the state of trade holds out no particular temptation to make large purchases on credit dealers will use only a small portion of the creditpower and it will depend only on convenience whether the portion which they use will be taken in one form or in another one single exertion of the creditpower in the form of 1 bookcredit is only the foundation of a single purchase but if 2 a bill is drawn that same portion of credit may serve for as many purchases as the number of times the bill changes hands while 3 every banknote issued renders the credit of the banker a purchasing power to that amount in the hands of all the successive holders without impairing any power they may possess of effecting purchases on their own credit credit in short has exactly the same purchasing power with money and as money tells upon prices not simply in proportion to its amount but to its amount multiplied by the number of times it changes hands so also does credit and credit transferable from hand to hand is in that proportion more potent than credit which only performs one purchase  there is a form of credit transactions 4 by checks on bankers and transfers in a banker’s books which is exactly parallel in every respect to banknotes giving equal facilities to an extension of credit and capable of acting on prices quite as powerfully a bank instead of lending its notes to a merchant or dealer might open an account with him and credit the account with the sum it had agreed to advance on an understanding that he should not draw out that sum in any other mode than by drawing checks against it in favor of those to whom he had occasion to make payments these checks might possibly even pass from hand to hand like banknotes more commonly however the receiver would pay them into the hands of his own banker and when he wanted the money would draw a fresh check against it and hence an objector may urge that as the original check would very soon be presented for payment when it must be paid either in notes or in coin notes or coin to an equal amount must be provided as the ultimate means of liquidation it is not so however the person to whom the check is transferred may perhaps deal with the same banker and the check may return to the very bank on which it was drawn  this is very often the case in country districts if so no payment will be called for but a simple transfer in the banker’s books will settle the transaction if the check is paid into a different bank it will not be presented for payment but liquidated by setoff against other checks and in a state of circumstances favorable to a general extension of banking credits a banker who has granted more credit and has therefore more checks drawn on him will also have more checks on other bankers paid to him and will only have to provide notes or cash for the payment of balances for which purpose the ordinary reserve of prudent bankers one third of their liabilities will abundantly suffice    § 5 on what the use of credit depends   the credit given to any one by those with whom he deals does not depend on the quantity of banknotes or coin in circulation at the time but on their opinion of his solvency if any consideration of a more general character enters into their calculation it is only in a time of pressure on the loan market when they are not certain of being themselves able to obtain the credit on which they have been accustomed to rely and even then what they look to is the general state of the loan market and not preconceived theory apart the amount of banknotes so far as to the willingness to give credit and the willingness of a dealer to use his credit depends on his expectations of gain that is on his opinion of the probable future price of his commodity an opinion grounded either on the rise or fall already going on or on his prospective judgment respecting the supply and the rate of consumption when a dealer extends his purchases beyond his immediate means of payment engaging to pay at a specified time he does so in the expectation either that the transaction will have terminated favorably before that time arrives or that he shall then be in possession of sufficient funds from the proceeds of his other transactions the fulfillment of these expectations depends upon prices but not specially upon the amount of banknotes it is obvious however that prices do not depend on money but on purchases money left with a banker and not drawn against or drawn against for other purposes than buying commodities has no effect on prices any more than credit which is not used credit which is used to purchase commodities affects prices in the same manner as money money and credit are thus exactly on a par in their effect on prices       it is often seen in our large cities that money is very     plentiful but no one seems to wish its use that is no one with     safe securities inability to find investments and to find     industries in which the rate of profit is satisfactory—all of     which depends on the business character and activity of the     people—will prevent credit from being used no matter how many     banknotes or greenbacks or how much gold there is in the     country it is impossible to make people invest simply by     increasing the number of counters by which commodities are     exchanged against each other that is by increasing the money     the reason why more credit is wanted is because men see that     increased production is possible of a kind that will find other     commodities ready to be offered ie demand in exchange for     that production normal credit therefore on a healthy basis     increases and slackens with the activity or dullness of trade     speculation or the wild extension of credit on the other hand     is apt to be begotten by a plethora of money which has induced     low rates for loans and moves with the uncertain waves of popular     impression by normal credit we mean that the wealth represented     by the credit is really at the disposal of the borrowers in a     crisis the quantity of wealth supposed to be represented by     credit is very much greater than that at the disposal of the     lenders246    § 6 what is essential to the idea of money   there has been a great amount of discussion and argument on the question whether several of these forms of credit and in particular whether banknotes ought to be considered as money it seems to be an essential part of the idea of money that it be legal tender an inconvertible paper which is legal tender is universally admitted to be money in the french language the phrase papiermonnaie actually means inconvertibility convertible notes being merely billets à porteur an instrument which would be deprived of all value by the insolvency of a corporation can not be money in any sense in which money is opposed to credit it either is not money or it is money and credit too       it would seem from all study of the essentials of money book     iii chapter iv that the necessary part of the idea of money is     that it should have value in itself no one parts with valuable     commodities for a medium of exchange which does not possess value     and we have seen that legislatures can not control the natural     value of even the precious metals by giving them legaltender     power much less could it be done for paper money paper     therefore may as an instrument of credit be a substitute for     money but in accordance with the above test it can not properly     be considered as money in the full sense of course paper money     checks etc perform some of the functions of money equally well     with the precious metals f a walker holds that anything is     money which performs moneywork but he excludes checks from his     catalogue of things which may serve as money it is practically of     little importance however what we include under money so long     as its functions are well understood it is merely a question of     nomenclature and need not disturb us     chapter x of an inconvertible paper currency    § 1 what determines the value of an inconvertible paper money   after experience had shown that pieces of paper of no intrinsic value by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to a certain number of francs dollars or pounds could be made to circulate as such and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent governments began to think that it would be a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper substitutes for money were subject of giving when required for the sign the thing signified they determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound by merely calling it a pound and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes  in the case supposed the functions of money are performed by a thing which derives its power of performing them solely from convention but convention is quite sufficient to confer the power since nothing more is needful to make a person accept anything as money and even at any arbitrary value than the persuasion that it will be taken from him on the same terms by others the only question is what determines the value of such a currency since it can not be as in the case of gold and silver or paper exchangeable for them at pleasure the cost of production  we have seen however that even in the case of metallic currency the immediate agency in determining its value is its quantity if the quantity instead of depending on the ordinary mercantile motives of profit and loss could be arbitrarily fixed by authority the value would depend on the fiat of that authority not on cost of production the quantity of a paper currency not convertible into the metals at the option of the holder can be arbitrarily fixed especially if the issuer is the sovereign power of the state the value therefore of such a currency is entirely arbitrary       the value of paper money is of course primarily and mainly     dependent on the quantity issued the general level of value     depends on the quantity but we also find that deviations from     this general level in the direction of further depreciation than     could be due to quantity alone is caused by any event which     shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing     value for his paper the “convention” by which real value the     essential idea of money was associated with this paper in the     minds of all is thereby broken fiat money—that is a piece of     paper not containing a promise to pay a dollar but a simple     declaration that this is a dollar—therefore separates the paper     from any connection with value and yet we see that fiat money     has some although a fluctuating value at certain times if the     state receives it for taxes if it is a legal acquittal of     obligations then to that extent a certain quantity of it is     given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes or the     debts jevons remarks on this point247 that if “the quantity of     notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one     wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some     one wanting to pay taxes and therefore willing to give coin for     notes” stability of value might be secured if there is more in     circulation than performs these functions it will depreciate in     the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses     assigned to it so that the relation of quantity to uses is the     only thing which can give value to fiat money but beyond a     certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin     to affect the value although the paper is not even a promise to     pay value the form of expression on its face or the term used as     its designation generally tends under the force of convention     and habit to give a popular value to paper      although the state may not promise to pay a dollar yet wherever     such paper money carries any purchasing power with it which has     very seldom happened and then only for short periods it will be     found that there is a vague popular understanding that the state     intends at some time or other to redeem the notes with value in     coin to some amount in the early cases of irredeemable money in     our colonies the income of taxes or similar resources were     promised as a means of redemption to some—although a     slight—extent the idea of value was associated with such paper     the actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation the     paper did depreciate with increased issues but only in so far as     the increased issues proved to the community that there was less     and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they     depreciate in other words we come to the familiar experience     known to many of a paper money depending for its value on the     opinions of men in the country this was partially true even of     our own greenbacks which were not fiat money but promises to     pay although not then redeemable as may be seen by the movement     of the line in chart xii p 359 which represents the     fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war the upward     movement of the line which indicates the premium on gold during     our late war of course represents correspondingly the     depreciation of the paper every victory or defeat of the union     arms raised or lowered the premium on gold it was the register of     the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with     the paper the second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks     were regarded as confessions of financial distress it was this     which produced the effect on their value it was not only the     quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity it     is of course clear that the value of a paper money like the     greenbacks which were the promises to pay of a rich country     would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued and     this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on     the chart showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the     issues increased but the thing which weighed largely in people’s     minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption and the premium     on gold was practically a register of the “betting” on this     possibility in 1878 when secretary sherman’s reserve was seen to     be increasing to an effective amount and when it became evident     that he would have the means ie the value represented by all     the paper that was likely to be presented to resume on the day     set january 1 1879 the premium gradually faded away the     general shifting of the level to a lower stage in this later     period was not due to any decrease in the quantity outstanding     because the contraction had been stopped in 1868 and that     consequent on the resumption act in may 1878   suppose that in a country of which the currency is wholly metallic a paper currency is suddenly issued to the amount of half the metallic circulation not by a banking establishment or in the form of loans but by the government in payment of salaries and purchase of commodities the currency being suddenly increased by one half all prices will rise and among the rest the prices of all things made of gold and silver an ounce of manufactured gold will become more valuable than an ounce of gold coin by more than that customary difference which compensates for the value of the workmanship and it will be profitable to melt the coin for the purpose of being manufactured until as much has been taken from the currency by the subtraction of gold as had been added to it by the issue of paper then prices will relapse to what they were at first and there will be nothing changed except that a paper currency has been substituted for half of the metallic currency which existed before suppose now a second emission of paper the same series of effects will be renewed and so on until the whole of the metallic money has disappeared see chart no xiv chap xv for the exportation of gold from the united states after the issue of our paper money in 1862 that is if paper be issued of as low a denomination as the lowest coin if not as much will remain as convenience requires for the smaller payments the addition made to the quantity of gold and silver disposable for ornamental purposes will somewhat reduce for a time the value of the article and as long as this is the case even though paper has been issued to the original amount of the metallic circulation as much coin will remain in circulation along with it as will keep the value of the currency down to the reduced value of the metallic material but the value having fallen below the cost of production a stoppage or diminution of the supply from the mines will enable the surplus to be carried off by the ordinary agents of destruction after which the metals and the currency will recover their natural value we are here supposing as we have supposed throughout that the country has mines of its own and no commercial intercourse with other countries for in a country having foreign trade the coin which is rendered superfluous by an issue of paper is carried off by a much prompter method       mr mill’s statement that if paper be not issued of as low a     denomination as the lowest coin “as much will remain as     convenience requires for the smaller payments” will not hold     true during our recent experiment of depreciated paper the     depreciation was such as to drive out the subsidiary silver coins     by july 1862 and we were forced to supply their place by a     fractional paper currency by an amendment inserted june 17 1862     into the act authorizing a second issue of 150000000 of     greenbacks it was ordered “that no note shall be issued for the     fractional part of a dollar and not more than 35000000 shall     be of lower denominations than five dollars” act finally passed     july 11 1862 although there were no fractional notes yet     onedollar notes drove out subsidiary silver simply because the     paper had depreciated to a value below that of the 3456 grains of     silver in two halves or four quarters of a dollar by july 2d the     disappearance of small coin was distinctly noted let the value of     gold be represented by 100 and a dollar of small silver coin     3456 grains relatively to a gold dollar by 96 now if paper     depreciates to 90 relatively to gold it will drive out the     subsidiary silver at 96 in accordance with gresham’s law   up to this point the effects of a paper currency are substantially the same whether it is convertible into specie or not it is when the metals have been completely superseded and driven from circulation that the difference between convertible and inconvertible paper begins to be operative when the gold or silver has all gone from circulation and an equal amount of paper has taken its place suppose that a still further issue is superadded the same series of phenomena recommences prices rise among the rest the prices of gold and silver articles and it becomes an object as before to procure coin in order to convert it into bullion there is no longer any coin in circulation but if the paper currency is convertible coin may still be obtained from the issuers in exchange for notes all additional notes therefore which are attempted to be forced into circulation after the metals have been completely superseded will return upon the issuers in exchange for coin and they will not be able to maintain in circulation such a quantity of convertible paper as to sink its value below the metal which it represents it is not so however with an inconvertible currency to the increase of that if permitted by law there is no check the issuers may add to it indefinitely lowering its value and raising prices in proportion they may in other words depreciate the currency without limit  such a power in whomsoever vested is an intolerable evil all variations in the value of the circulating medium are mischievous they disturb existing contracts and expectations and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious the person who buys for himself or gives to another an annuity of one hundred dollars does not know whether it will be equivalent to two hundred or to fifty dollars a few years hence great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible each issue being in itself a source of profit—not to add that the issuers may have and in the case of a government paper always have a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed       the united states supreme court had decided in december 1870 by     the second legaltender decision that the issue of greenbacks     inconvertible from 1862 to 1879 was constitutional during a time     of war but it was thought that the reissue of these notes since     the war when no war emergency could be pleaded was     unconstitutional this view however was met by the unfortunate     decision of the supreme court delivered by justice gray march     1884 which announced the doctrine that the expediency of an issue     of legaltender paper money was to be determined solely by     congress and that if congress judged the issue expedient it was     within the limits of those provisions of the constitution section     8 which gave congress the means to do whatever was “necessary     and proper” to carry out the powers expressly granted to it     nothing now can prevent congress should it choose to do so from     issuing paper money of any description whatever even if of     absolutely no value the disaster that might be brought upon the     country by a rising tide of repudiation among debtors taking its     effect through a facile and plastic congress as in the case of     the silver coinage in 1878 is appalling to reflect upon    § 2 if regulated by the price of bullion as inconvertible currency might be safe but not expedient   in order that the value of the currency may be secure from being altered by design and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value the precious metals have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating inconvertible paper if they have not as they generally have professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time they have at least by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins made a virtual though generally a false profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins this is not impracticable even with an inconvertible paper there is not indeed the selfacting check which convertibility brings with it but there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated and to what extent that indication is the price of the precious metals when holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion and when there is none left in circulation bullion rises and falls in price like other things and if it is above the mint price—if an ounce of gold which would be coined into the equivalent of 1860 is sold for 20 or 25 in paper—the value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be if therefore the issue of inconvertible paper were subjected to strict rules one rule being that whenever bullion rose above the mint price the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an inconvertible paper  but also such a system of currency would have no advantages sufficient to recommend it to adoption an inconvertible currency regulated by the price of bullion would conform exactly in all its variations to a convertible one and the only advantage gained would be that of exemption from the necessity of keeping any reserve of the precious metals which is not a very important consideration especially as a government so long as its good faith is not suspected need not keep so large a reserve as private issuers being not so liable to great and sudden demands since there never can be any real doubt of its solvency       the united states since 1879 finds that a reserve of from     130000000 to 140000000 is a sufficient reserve for     outstanding notes to the amount of 346000000 and greenbacks     are now at a par with gold   against this small advantage is to be set in the first place the possibility of fraudulent tampering with the price of bullion for the sake of acting on the currency in the manner of the fictitious sales of corn to influence the averages so much and so justly complained of while the corn laws were in force but a still stronger consideration is the importance of adhering to a simple principle intelligible to the most untaught capacity everybody can understand convertibility every one sees that what can be at any moment exchanged for five dollars is worth five dollars regulation by the price of bullion is a more complex idea and does not recommend itself through the same familiar associations there would be nothing like the same confidence by the public generally in an inconvertible currency so regulated as in a convertible one and the most instructed person might reasonably doubt whether such a rule would be as likely to be inflexibly adhered to the grounds of the rule not being so well understood by the public opinion would probably not enforce it with as much rigidity and in any circumstances of difficulty would be likely to turn against it while to the government itself a suspension of convertibility would appear a much stronger and more extreme measure than a relaxation of what might possibly be considered a somewhat artificial rule there is therefore a great preponderance of reasons in favor of a convertible in preference to even the best regulated inconvertible currency the temptation to overissue in certain financial emergencies is so strong that nothing is admissible which can tend in however slight a degree to weaken the barriers that restrain it       the french government in the francoprussian war 1870 issued     inconvertible paper on this plan as explained by mr mill but     acting through the bank of france they conducted their issues so     successfully that the notes never depreciated more than about one     half of one per cent but this was a very rare management of     inconvertible paper since the issues were actually limited as the     price of gold in paper rose above par    § 3 examination of the doctrine that an inconvertible current is safe if representing actual property   projectors every now and then start up with plans for curing all the economical evils of society by means of an unlimited issue of inconvertible paper there is in truth a great charm in the idea to be able to pay off the national debt defray the expenses of government without taxation and in fine to make the fortunes of the whole community is a brilliant prospect when once a man is capable of believing that printing a few characters on bits of paper will do it the philosopher’s stone could not be expected to do more248  as these projects however often slain always resuscitate it is not superfluous to examine one or two of the fallacies by which the schemers impose upon themselves one of the commonest is that a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note issued represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on these phrases of representing and resting seldom convey any distinct or welldefined idea when they do their meaning is no more than this—that the issuers of the paper must have property either of their own or intrusted to them to the value of all the notes they issue though for what purpose does not very clearly appear for if the property can not be claimed in exchange for the notes it is difficult to divine in what manner its mere existence can serve to uphold their value i presume however it is intended as a guarantee that the holders would be finally reimbursed in case any untoward event should cause the whole concern to be wound up on this theory there have been many schemes for “coining the whole land of the country into money” and the like  in so far as this notion has any connection at all with reason it seems to originate in confounding two entirely distinct evils to which a paper currency is liable one is the insolvency of the issuers which if the paper is grounded on their credit—if it makes any promise of payment in cash either on demand or at any future time—of course deprives the paper of any value which it derives from the promise to this evil paper credit is equally liable however moderately used and against it a proviso that all issues should be “founded on property” as for instance that notes should only be issued on the security of some valuable thing expressly pledged for their redemption would really be efficacious as a precaution but the theory takes no account of another evil which is incident to the notes of the most solvent firm company or government that of being depreciated in value from being issued in excessive quantity the assignats during the french revolution were an example of a currency grounded on these principles the assignats “represented” an immense amount of highly valuable property namely the lands of the crown the church the monasteries and the emigrants amounting possibly to half the territory of france they were in fact orders or assignments on this mass of land the revolutionary government had the idea of “coining” these lands into money but to do them justice they did not originally contemplate the immense multiplication of issues to which they were eventually driven by the failure of all other financial resources they imagined that the assignats would come rapidly back to the issuers in exchange for land and that they should be able to reissue them continually until the lands were all disposed of without having at any time more than a very moderate quantity in circulation their hope was frustrated the land did not sell so quickly as they expected buyers were not inclined to invest their money in possessions which were likely to be resumed without compensation if the revolution succumbed the bits of paper which represented land becoming prodigiously multiplied could no more keep up their value than the land itself would have done if it had all been brought to market at once and the result was that it at last required an assignat of five hundred francs to pay for a cup of coffee  the example of the assignats has been said not to be conclusive because an assignat only represented land in general but not a definite quantity of land to have prevented their depreciation the proper course it is affirmed would have been to have made a valuation of all the confiscated property at its metallic value and to have issued assignats up to but not beyond that limit giving to the holders a right to demand any piece of land at its registered valuation in exchange for assignats to the same amount there can be no question about the superiority of this plan over the one actually adopted had this course been followed the assignats could never have been depreciated to the inordinate degree they were for—as they would have retained all their purchasing power in relation to land however much they might have fallen in respect to other things—before they had lost very much of their market value they would probably have been brought in to be exchanged for land it must be remembered however that their not being depreciated would presuppose that no greater number of them continued in circulation than would have circulated if they had been convertible into cash however convenient therefore in a time of revolution this currency convertible into land on demand might have been as a contrivance for selling rapidly a great quantity of land with the least possible sacrifice it is difficult to see what advantage it would have as the permanent system of a country over a currency convertible into coin while it is not at all difficult to see what would be its disadvantages since land is far more variable in value than gold and silver and besides land to most persons being rather an incumbrance than a desirable possession except to be converted into money people would submit to a much greater depreciation before demanding land than they will before demanding gold or silver249       it has been said that the assignats circulated without     legaltender power they were received by the french treasury and     a law was passed condemning a man to six years in irons for     exchanging gold or silver for assignats at a greater than the     nominal or face value of the latter the subsequent issues called     mandats did not represent land but were directly     exchangeable for the land even that kind of money is no more     valuable than a proportional amount of tax receipts for land in a     very short time mandats were worth 11000 of their face value     and assignats very much less the assignats moreover were not     limited in quantity to the money value of the lands they     represented by 1796 45000000000 francs of assignats had been     issued    § 4 experiments with paper money in the united states       the experience of the colonies before our revolution is rich in     warning examples of the overissue of inconvertible paper money     those of rhode island250 and the province of massachusetts251     are the most conspicuous perhaps because we have better     knowledge of them but other colonies suffered in as great a     degree the experience of the latter illustrates as well as any     perhaps not only the general theory of inconvertible paper but     the device of supporting the paper by paying interest upon the     notes although the issues since 1690 had depreciated in 1702     £10000 more notes were issued because as it was said there was     a scarcity of money it is always noticeable that the more issues     of paper money there are made the more there is a cry of     scarcity much like the thirst of a hard drinker after the first     exhilaration has passed off on the new issues five per cent     interest was paid and even excises and imposts were set aside as     security for their payment the year 1709 saw a new expedition to     canada and saw also the broken promises of the province when     £20000 more notes were put out the collection of the taxes with     which to pay the notes was deferred in 1707 for two years in 1709     deferred for four years in 1710 for five years in 1711 for six     years by 1712 they had depreciated thirty per cent when the     charm of legal tender was thrown around them but to no purpose     the idea of value was not associated with them in people’s minds     and they put no faith in promises the usual result took place     people divided politically on the money question and parties     began to agitate for banks which should issue notes based on real     estate or for loans from the state to private persons at interest     to be paid annually such facts show the train of evils following     the first innocent departure from the maintenance of a currency     equivalent to coin the people forgot or did not know the nature     of money or the offices it performed they did not understand     that creating paper money did not create wealth this experiment     closed only in 1750 march 31st when the province had courage     enough to resume specie payments the effect was to transfer the     west india trade from paperissuing colonies to massachusetts and     to produce a steady prosperity in her business interests                          illustration chart xi           chart xi continental currency issue and depreciation       the issue of paper money as a means of making a forced loan from     the people when there seem to be no other means of getting funds     has been fully illustrated in our country by the continental     currency issued during our revolution it is not however     considered that this is also accompanied by a process by which     every debtor takes “a forced contribution from his creditor”     congress had no power to tax and the separate states would not do     it and this has been considered as the excuse for making issues     of that wellknown paper money which has given rise to the     familiar byword for absence of value “not worth a continental”     without going into details252 in one year 1779 congress     issued 140000000 worth in coin only 7000000 they however     bravely declared that paper had not depreciated but that the     price of coin had gone up legal attempts were made to repress the     premium on silver but resolutions do not create wealth as fast as     money can be printed the depreciation went on more rapidly than     the issues see chart no xi in which the black line represents     the amounts of issues and the broken line the depreciation of     paper starting at 100 and finally march 18 1780 congress     decided to admit a depreciation and resumed in silver at the rate     of one dollar in silver for forty in paper      the question of government issues253 of paper money again came     up in the united states in 1862 during the civil war and part of     our present currency is the result of the policy then adopted the     first step—the one that generally costs—however was taken july     17 1861 when the treasury issued 50000000 of “demand notes”     not bearing interest these notes however were not made legal     tender they could be used in payment of salaries and other dues     from the united states it may be well to state that the treasury     balanced the arguments for and against the issues of paper at the     beginning of the experiment and we can see how these views were     realized as we go along in favor of paper issues it was urged     that we could borrow a large amount without interest as in the     case of the continental currency that there would be no expense     beyond the coin necessary for keeping the paper at par and that     the country would gain a uniform currency on the other hand it     was seen that there might be temptations to issue without     provisions for redemption that even if a fund were kept a     disturbance of the money market would precipitate a demand for     coin and all upon this single fund and lastly that there were     all the dangers of overissue secretary chase254 then decided     against paper issues government bonds however did not sell and     the attempt of the banks toward the end of 1861 to carry     150000000 of bonds brought on a suspension of specie payments     december 31 1861 without any taxation policy the country     drifted along until in a spasm of dread at seeing an empty     treasury congress passed the legaltender act february 25     1862 issuing 150000000 of paper in the form of promises to     pay a committee of bankers showed that the issue could have been     avoided by selling bonds at their market price but congress would     not sell them below par no necessity for the issues of paper need     have arrived in four months another issue of 150000000 was     authorized july 11 1862 and a third issue of a like amount     march 3 1863 in all 450000000 the depreciation took place     see chart no xii for as secretary chase anticipated no     provision was made for redemption they were made legal tender     but this “essential idea” did not preserve their value nor did     the provision that they be received for taxes except customs     avail for this purpose      the effects of the depreciation were as evil as can well be     imagined 1 the expenses of the government were increased by the     rise in prices so that 2 our national debt became hundreds of     millions larger than it need have been 3 a vicious speculation     in gold began leading to the unsettling of legitimate trade and     to greater variations in prices 4 the existence of depreciated     paper later gave rise to all the dishonest schemes for paying the     coin obligations of the united states in cheap issues to the ruin     of its credit and honor and 5 it has practically become a     settled part of our circulation and a possible source of danger      of the whole 450000000 50000000 were set aside as a reserve     for temporary deposits but in july 1864 431000000 were in     circulation at this time june 30 1864 congress retaining     distinctly the feeling that the issue of paper was but a temporary     measure forbade any further issues secretary mcculloch     immediately on the close of the war began to contract and by a     resolution of the lower branch in congress december 18 1865 a     cordial concurrence in the measures for contraction was     manifested of course the return from the path of inflated credit     and high prices was painful and congress began to feel the     pressure of its constituents had they not yielded much of the     severity of the crisis of 1873 might have been avoided but april     12 1866 they forbade any greater contraction than 4000000 a     month here was a lack of courage not foreseen by secretary chase     this was again shown february 4 1868 by a law which absolutely     forbade the secretary to further reduce the currency which now     stood at 356000000 this marks an important change in the     attitude of the government as compared with 1862 after the panic     of 1873 the paper evil produced its usual effect in the cry for     more money and as in the province of massachusetts in 1712     parties divided on the question of inflation or contraction a     bill to expand the government issues to 400000000 and the     nationalbank notes also to 400000000 actually passed both     houses of congress and we were fortunately saved from it only by     the veto of president grant april 22 1874 this was another     landmark in the history of our paper money secretary richardson     however had already without authority reissued 26000000 of     the 44000000 withdrawn by secretary mcculloch and the amount     outstanding was thus 382000000 a compromise measure was passed     june 20 1874 which retained this amount in the circulation      when the resumption act was passed january 14 1875 the     provision that for every 100 of new nationalbank notes issued     80 of united states notes should be retired resulted in a     contraction of the latter from 382000000 to 346000000 the     reason of this was that there was no provision for the increase     of united states notes when national banks withdrew their own     issues and after the crisis many banks naturally did so the     culmination of the policy of congress came in a law may 31 1878     which absolutely forbade all further retirement of united states     notes and we are now left at the present time with an inelastic     limit of 346000000 finally in 1877 and 1878 secretary     sherman aided by a most fortunate state of foreign trade began     to accumulate gold in order to carry out the provisions of the     resumption act which required him to resume specie payments on     january 1 1879 he successfully collected 133000000 of gold     and on december 17 1878 the premium on gold disappeared and     resumption was accomplished quietly on the day appointed without     a jar to business      but it is a significant fact that even after all the evils     inflicted on our country by overissues in spite of the     temptation to misuse paper money if it is in any way permitted in     spite of all the warnings of history there seems to be a     dangerous acquiescence in the presence of government paper money     in our currency it is an open pitfall tempting to evils whenever     sudden emergencies arise it ought not to be allowed to remain any     longer    § 5 examination of the gain arising from the increase and issue of paper currency   another of the fallacies from which the advocates of an inconvertible currency derive support is the notion that an increase of the currency quickens industry mr attwood maintained that a rise of prices produced by an increase of paper currency stimulates every producer to his utmost exertions and brings all the capital and labor of the country into complete employment and that this has invariably happened in all periods of rising prices when the rise was on a sufficiently great scale i presume however that the inducement which according to mr attwood excited this unusual ardor in all persons engaged in production must have been the expectation of getting more of commodities generally more real wealth in exchange for the produce of their labor and not merely more pieces of paper this expectation however must have been by the very terms of the supposition disappointed since all prices being supposed to rise equally no one was really better paid for his goods than before it calculates on finding the whole world persisting forever in the belief that more pieces of paper are more riches and never discovering that with all their paper they can not buy more of anything than they could before at the periods which mr attwood mistook for times of prosperity and which were simply as all periods of high prices under a convertible currency must be times of speculation the speculators did not think they were growing rich because the high prices would last but because they would not last and because whoever contrived to realize while they did last would find himself after the recoil in possession of a greater number of dollars without their having become of less value  hume’s version of the doctrine differed in a slight degree from mr attwood’s he thought that all commodities would not rise in price simultaneously and that some persons therefore would obtain a real gain by getting more money for what they had to sell while the things which they wished to buy might not yet have risen and those who would reap this gain would always be he seems to think the first comers it seems obvious however that for every person who thus gains more than usual there is necessarily some other person who gains less the loser if things took place as hume supposes would be the seller of the commodities which are slowest to rise who by the supposition parts with his goods at the old prices to purchasers who have already benefited by the new this seller has obtained for his commodity only the accustomed quantity of money while there are already some things of which that money will no longer purchase as much as before if therefore he knows what is going on he will raise his price and then the buyer will not have the gain which is supposed to stimulate his industry but if on the contrary the seller does not know the state of the case and only discovers it when he finds in laying his money out that it does not go so far he then obtains less than the ordinary remuneration for his labor and capital and if the other dealer’s industry is encouraged it should seem that his must from the opposite cause be impaired  an issue of notes is a manifest gain to the issuers who until the notes are returned for payment obtain the use of them as if they were a real capital and so long as the notes are no permanent addition to the currency but merely supersede gold or silver to the same amount the gain of the issuer is a loss to no one it is obtained by saving to the community the expense of the more costly material but if there is no gold or silver to be superseded—if the notes are added to the currency instead of being substituted for the metallic part of it—all holders of currency lose by the depreciation of its value the exact equivalent of what the issuer gains a tax is virtually levied on them for his benefit  but besides the benefit reaped by the issuers or by others through them at the expense of the public generally there is another unjust gain obtained by a larger class—namely by those who are under fixed pecuniary obligations all such persons are freed by a depreciation of the currency from a portion of the burden of their debts or other engagements in other words part of the property of their creditors is gratuitously transferred to them on a superficial view it may be imagined that this is an advantage to industry since the productive classes are great borrowers and generally owe larger debts to the unproductive if we include among the latter all persons not actually in business than the unproductive classes owe to them especially if the national debt be included it is only thus that a general rise of prices can be a source of benefit to producers and dealers by diminishing the pressure of their fixed burdens and this might be accounted an advantage if integrity and good faith were of no importance to the world and to industry and commerce in particular    § 6 résumé of the subject of money       before passing on to another branch of our subject it may be a     gain to clearer ideas to collect in the form of the following     classification the main points discussed in chaps iv to x under     money and credit in continuance of a similar classification of     value      money measures and transfers value     1 hence best served by the precious metals on account of their                 peculiar qualities     2 depends for its value in the long run on the cost of                 production at the worst mine worked class iii but                 practically on demand and supply class i and if no                 credit exists its value changes exactly with the                 supply which is expressed by v  1q × r     3 under two legal standards obeys gresham’s law—eg                 experience of japan and the united states     4 substitutes for money called credit which is not capital                 but calls out inactive capital      of these substitutes for money 1 use of credit depends not on     quality of coin and notes and 2 various kinds of credit      of those various kinds of credit there are 1 book credits 2     bills of exchange 3 promissory notes and 4 checks processed     via clearinghouse      of the promissory notes they are of either 1 individuals 2     banks coin banks or land banks etc or 3 governments      of government notes there are 1 convertible or 2     inconvertible     chapter xi of excess of supply    § 1 the theory of a general oversupply of commodities stated   after the elementary exposition of the theory of money contained in the last few chapters we shall return to a question in the general theory of value which could not be satisfactorily discussed until the nature and operations of money were in some measure understood because the errors against which we have to contend mainly originate in a misunderstanding of those operations  because the phenomenon of oversupply and consequent inconvenience or loss to the producer or dealer may exist in the case of any one commodity whatever many persons including some distinguished political economists255 have thought that it may exist with regard to all commodities that there may be a general overproduction of wealth a supply of commodities in the aggregate surpassing the demand and a consequent depressed condition of all classes of producers  the doctrine appears to me to involve so much inconsistency in its very conception that i feel considerable difficulty in giving any statement of it which shall be at once clear and satisfactory to its supporters they agree in maintaining that there may be and sometimes is an excess of productions in general beyond the demand for them that when this happens purchasers can not be found at prices which will repay the cost of production with a profit that there ensues a general depression of prices or values they are seldom accurate in discriminating between the two so that producers the more they produce find themselves the poorer instead of richer and dr chalmers accordingly inculcates on capitalists the practice of a moral restraint in reference to the pursuit of gain while sismondi deprecates machinery and the various inventions which increase productive power they both maintain that accumulation of capital may proceed too fast not merely for the moral but for the material interest of those who produce and accumulate and they enjoin the rich to guard against this evil by an ample unproductive consumption    § 2 the supply of commodities in general can not exceed the power of purchase   when these writers speak of the supply of commodities as outrunning the demand it is not clear which of the two elements of demand they have in view—the desire to possess or the means of purchase whether their meaning is that there are in such cases more consumable products in existence than the public desires to consume or merely more than it is able to pay for in this uncertainty it is necessary to examine both suppositions       it will be here noticed that mr mill uses demand in the sense for     which we contended it should be used book iii chap i § 3 and     not as “quantity demanded” the present discussion of     overproduction should also be connected by the student with the     former reference to it book i chap iv § 2   first let us suppose that the quantity of commodities produced is not greater than the community would be glad to consume is it in that case possible that there should be a deficiency of demand for all commodities for want of the means of payment those who think so can not have considered what it is which constitutes the means of payment for commodities it is simply commodities each person’s means of paying for the productions of other people consists of those which he himself possesses all sellers are inevitably and ex vi termini buyers could we suddenly double the productive powers of the country we should double the supply of commodities in every market but we should by the same stroke double the purchasing power  everybody would bring a double demand as well as supply everybody would be able to buy twice as much because every one would have twice as much to offer in exchange it is probable indeed that there would now be a superfluity of certain things although the community would willingly double its aggregate consumption it may already have as much as it desires of some commodities and it may prefer to do more than double its consumption of others or to exercise its increased purchasing power on some new thing if so the supply will adapt itself accordingly and the values of things will continue to conform to their cost of production at any rate it is a sheer absurdity that all things should fall in value and that all producers should in consequence be insufficiently remunerated if values remain the same what becomes of prices is immaterial since the remuneration of producers does not depend on how much money but on how much of consumable articles they obtain for their goods besides money is a commodity and if all commodities are supposed to be doubled in quantity we must suppose money to be doubled too and then prices would no more fall than values would    § 3 there can never be a lack of demand arising from lack of desire to consume   a general oversupply or excess of all commodities above the demand so far as demand consists in means of payment is thus shown to be an impossibility but it may perhaps be supposed that it is not the ability to purchase but the desire to possess that falls short and that the general produce of industry may be greater than the community desires to consume—the part at least of the community which has an equivalent to give  this is much the most plausible form of the doctrine and does not like that which we first examined involve a contradiction there may easily be a greater quantity of any particular commodity than is desired by those who have the ability to purchase and it is abstractedly conceivable that this might be the case with all commodities the error is in not perceiving that though all who have an equivalent to give might be fully provided with every consumable article which they desire the fact that they go on adding to the production proves that this is not actually the case assume the most favorable hypothesis for the purpose that of a limited community every member of which possesses as much of necessaries and of all known luxuries as he desires and since it is not conceivable that persons whose wants were completely satisfied would labor and economize to obtain what they did not desire suppose that a foreigner arrives and produces an additional quantity of something of which there was already enough here it will be said is overproduction true i reply overproduction of that particular article the community wanted no more of that but it wanted something the old inhabitants indeed wanted nothing but did not the foreigner himself want something when he produced the superfluous article was he laboring without a motive he has produced—but the wrong thing instead of the right he wanted perhaps food and has produced watches with which everybody was sufficiently supplied the newcomer brought with him into the country a demand for commodities equal to all that he could produce by his industry and it was his business to see that the supply he brought should be suitable to that demand if he could not produce something capable of exciting a new want or desire in the community for the satisfaction of which some one would grow more food and give it to him in exchange he had the alternative of growing food for himself either on fresh land if there was any unoccupied or as a tenant or partner or servant of some former occupier willing to be partially relieved from labor he has produced a thing not wanted instead of what was wanted and he himself perhaps is not the kind of producer who is wanted—but there is no overproduction production is not excessive but merely illassorted we saw before that whoever brings additional commodities to the market brings an additional power of purchase we now see that he brings also an additional desire to consume since if he had not that desire he would not have troubled himself to produce neither of the elements of demand therefore can be wanting when there is an additional supply though it is perfectly possible that the demand may be for one thing and the supply may unfortunately consist of another       it is not sufficiently borne in mind also that the whole     progress of civilization results in a differentiation of new wants     and desires to take but a single instance with the growth of the     artistic sense the articles of common use change their entire     form and the advances in the arts disclose new commodities which     satisfy the world’s desires and for these new satisfactions     people are willing to work and produce in order to attain them     with education also comes a wider horizon and a more refined     perception of taste which creates wants for new things for which     the mind before had no desires a little reflection therefore     must inevitably lead us to see that no person no community ever     had or probably ever will have all its wants satisfied so far     as we know man it does not seem possible that there will ever be     a falling off in demand because of a satiety of all material     satisfactions    § 4 origin and explanation of the notion of general oversupply   i have already described the state of the markets for commodities which accompanies what is termed a commercial crisis at such times there is really an excess of all commodities above the money demand in other words there is an undersupply of money from the sudden annihilation of a great mass of credit every one dislikes to part with ready money and many are anxious to procure it at any sacrifice almost everybody therefore is a seller and there are scarcely any buyers so that there may really be though only while the crisis lasts an extreme depression of general prices from what may be indiscriminately called a glut of commodities or a dearth of money but it is a great error to suppose with sismondi that a commercial crisis is the effect of a general excess of production it is simply the consequence of an excess of speculative purchases it is not a gradual advent of low prices but a sudden recoil from prices extravagantly high its immediate cause is a contraction of credit and the remedy is not a diminution of supply but the restoration of confidence it is also evident that this temporary derangement of markets is an evil only because it is temporary the fall being solely of money prices if prices did not rise again no dealer would lose since the smaller price would be worth as much to him as the larger price was before in no matter does this phenomenon answer to the description which these celebrated economists have given of the evil of overproduction that permanent decline in the circumstances of producers for want of markets which those writers contemplate is a conception to which the nature of a commercial crisis gives no support  the other phenomenon from which the notion of a general excess of wealth and superfluity of accumulation seems to derive countenance is one of a more permanent nature namely the fall of profits and interest which naturally takes place with the progress of population and production the cause of this decline of profit is the increased cost of maintaining labor which results from an increase of population and of the demand for food outstripping the advance of agricultural improvement this important feature in the economical progress of nations will receive full consideration and discussion in the succeeding book256 it is obviously a totally different thing from a want of market for commodities though often confounded with it in the complaints of the producing and trading classes the true interpretation of the modern or present state of industrial economy is that there is hardly any amount of business which may not be done if people will be content to do it on small profits and this all active and intelligent persons in business perfectly well know but even those who comply with the necessities of their time grumble at what they comply with and wish that there were less capital257 or as they express it less competition in order that there might be greater profits low profits however are a different thing from deficiency of demand and the production and accumulation which merely reduce profits can not be called excess of supply or of production what the phenomenon really is and its effects and necessary limits will be seen when we treat of that express subject     chapter xii of some peculiar cases of value    § 1 values of commodities which have a joint cost of production   the general laws of value in all the more important cases of the interchange of commodities in the same country have now been investigated we examined first the case of monopoly in which the value is determined by either a natural or an artificial limitation of quantity that is by demand and supply secondly the case of free competition when the article can be produced in indefinite quantity at the same cost in which case the permanent value is determined by the cost of production and only the fluctuations by supply and demand thirdly a mixed case that of the articles which can be produced in indefinite quantity but not at the same cost in which case the permanent value is determined by the greatest cost which it is necessary to incur in order to obtain the required supply and lastly we have found that money itself is a commodity of the third class that its value in a state of freedom is governed by the same laws as the values of other commodities of its class and that prices therefore follow the same laws as values  from this it appears that demand and supply govern the fluctuations of values and prices in all cases and the permanent values and prices of all things of which the supply is determined by any agency other than that of free competition but that under the régime of competition things are on the average exchanged for each other at such values and sold at such prices as afford equal expectation of advantage to all classes of producers which can only be when things exchange for one another in the ratio of their cost of production       here again is a distinct recognition of the true meaning of cost     of production and its ruling influence within a competing group     which has been seen in its full significance by mr cairnes   it sometimes happens however that two different commodities have what may be termed a joint cost of production they are both products of the same operation or set of operations and the outlay is incurred for the sake of both together not part for one and part for the other the same outlay would have to be incurred for either of the two if the other were not wanted or used at all there are not a few instances of commodities thus associated in their production for example coke and coalgas are both produced from the same material and by the same operation in a more partial sense mutton and wool are an example beef hides and tallow calves and dairy produce chickens and eggs cost of production can have nothing to do with deciding the value of the associated commodities relatively to each other it only decides their joint value cost of production does not determine their prices but the sum of their prices a principle is wanting to apportion the expenses of production between the two  since cost of production here fails us we must revert to a law of value anterior to cost of production and more fundamental the law of demand and supply the law is that the demand for a commodity varies with its value and that the value adjusts itself so that the demand shall be equal to the supply this supplies the principle of repartition which we are in quest of  suppose that a certain quantity of gas is produced and sold at a certain price and that the residuum of coke is offered at a price which together with that of the gas repays the expenses with the ordinary rate of profit suppose too that at the price put upon the gas and coke respectively the whole of the gas finds an easy market without either surplus or deficiency but that purchasers can not be found for all the coke corresponding to it the coke will be offered at a lower price in order to force a market but this lower price together with the price of the gas will not be remunerating the manufacture as a whole will not pay its expenses with the ordinary profit and will not on these terms continue to be carried on the gas therefore must be sold at a higher price to make up for the deficiency on the coke the demand consequently contracting the production will be somewhat reduced and prices will become stationary when by the joint effect of the rise of gas and the fall of coke so much less of the first is sold and so much more of the second that there is now a market for all the coke which results from the existing extent of the gasmanufacture  or suppose the reverse case that more coke is wanted at the present prices than can be supplied by the operations required by the existing demand for gas coke being now in deficiency will rise in price the whole operation will yield more than the usual rate of profit and additional capital will be attracted to the manufacture the unsatisfied demand for coke will be supplied but this can not be done without increasing the supply of gas too and as the existing demand was fully supplied already an increased quantity can only find a market by lowering the price equilibrium will be attained when the demand for each article fits so well with the demand for the other that the quantity required of each is exactly as much as is generated in producing the quantity required of the other  when therefore two or more commodities have a joint cost of production their natural values relatively to each other are those which will create a demand for each in the ratio of the quantities in which they are sent forth by the productive process    § 2 values of the different kinds of agricultural produce   another case of value which merits attention is that of the different kinds of agricultural produce the case would present nothing peculiar if different agricultural products were either grown indiscriminately and with equal advantage on the same soils or wholly on different soils the difficulty arises from two things first that most soils are fitter for one kind of produce than another without being absolutely unfit for any and secondly the rotation of crops  for simplicity we will confine our supposition to two kinds of agricultural produce for instance wheat and oats if all soils were equally adapted for wheat and for oats both would be grown indiscriminately on all soils and their relative cost of production being the same everywhere would govern their relative value if the same labor which grows three quarters of wheat on any given soil would always grow on that soil five quarters of oats the three and the five quarters would be of the same value the fact is that both wheat and oats can be grown on almost any soil which is capable of producing either  it is evident that each grain will be cultivated in preference on the soils which are better adapted for it than for the other and if the demand is supplied from these alone the values of the two grains will have no reference to one another but when the demand for both is such as to require that each should be grown not only on the soils peculiarly fitted for it but on the medium soils which without being specifically adapted to either are about equally suited for both the cost of production on those medium soils will determine the relative value of the two grains while the rent of the soils specifically adapted to each will be regulated by their productive power considered with reference to that one grain alone to which they are peculiarly applicable thus far the question presents no difficulty to any one to whom the general principles of value are familiar                    illustration agricultural produce       this may be easily shown by a diagram in which a represents the     grade of land best adapted for oats b c d respectively lands     of diminishing productiveness for oats until e is reached which     is perhaps equally good for oats or wheat a b c d     and e likewise represent the wheatlands the best beginning with     a the rent of a or b is determined by a comparison with     whatever grade of land planted in oats is cultivated at the least     return as e for example so if all the wheatlands are     cultivated land a or b is compared with e but in regard to     the capacity of e to produce wheat   it may happen however that the demand for one of the two as for example wheat may so outstrip the demand for the other as not only to occupy the soils specially suited for wheat but to engross entirely those equally suitable to both and even encroach upon those which are better adapted to oats to create an inducement for this unequal apportionment of the cultivation wheat must be relatively dearer and oats cheaper than according to the cost of their production on the medium land their relative value must be in proportion to the cost on that quality of land whatever it may be on which the comparative demand for the two grains requires that both of them should be grown if from the state of the demand the two cultivations meet on land more favorable to one than to the other that one will be cheaper and the other dearer in relation to each other and to things in general than if the proportional demand were as we at first supposed       as in the diagram just mentioned if the demand for wheat forces     its cultivation downward not only on to land e suited to either     indifferently but still farther on to lands still less adapted     for wheat although good land for oats wheat may be pushed down     one stem of the v and up the other to d or even to c then the     value of wheat will be regulated by the cost of production on c     and the rent will be determined by a comparison between the     productiveness of a b etc running downward through e     with c the price of wheat will be high relatively to oats which     are now cultivated only on lands a b better suited to growing     oats and whose cost of production on c is much less than on d or     e   here then we obtain a fresh illustration in a somewhat different manner of the operation of demand not as an occasional disturber of value but as a permanent regulator of it conjoined with or supplementary to cost of production     chapter xiii of international trade    § 1 cost of production not a regulator of international values extension of the word “international”   some things it is physically impossible to produce except in particular circumstances of heat soil water or atmosphere but there are many things which though they could be produced at home without difficulty and in any quantity are yet imported from a distance the explanation which would be popularly given of this would be that it is cheaper to import than to produce them and this is the true reason but this reason itself requires that a reason be given for it of two things produced in the same place if one is cheaper than the other the reason is that it can be produced with less labor and capital or in a word at less cost is this also the reason as between things produced in different places are things never imported but from places where they can be produced with less labor or less of the other element of cost time than in the place to which they are brought does the law that permanent value is proportioned to cost of production hold good between commodities produced in distant places as it does between those produced in adjacent places  we shall find that it does not a thing may sometimes be sold cheapest by being produced in some other place than that at which it can be produced with the smallest amount of labor and abstinence  this could not happen between adjacent places if the north bank of the thames possessed an advantage over the south bank in the production of shoes no shoes would be produced on the south side the shoemakers would remove themselves and their capitals to the north bank or would have established themselves there originally for being competitors in the same market with those on the north side they could not compensate themselves for their disadvantage at the expense of the consumer the amount of it would fall entirely on their profits and they would not long content themselves with a smaller profit when by simply crossing a river they could increase it but between distant places and especially between different countries profits may continue different because persons do not usually remove themselves or their capitals to a distant place without a very strong motive if capital removed to remote parts of the world as readily and for as small an inducement as it moves to another quarter of the same town—if people would transport their manufactories to america or china whenever they could save a small percentage in their expenses by it—profits would be alike or equivalent all over the world and all things would be produced in the places where the same labor and capital would produce them in greatest quantity and of best quality a tendency may even now be observed toward such a state of things capital is becoming more and more cosmopolitan there is so much greater similarity of manners and institutions than formerly and so much less alienation of feeling among the more civilized countries that both population and capital now move from one of those countries to another on much less temptation than heretofore but there are still extraordinary differences both of wages and of profits between different parts of the world  between all distant places therefore in some degree but especially between different countries whether under the same supreme government or not there may exist great inequalities in the return to labor and capital without causing them to move from one place to the other in such quantity as to level those inequalities the capital belonging to a country will to a great extent remain in the country even if there be no mode of employing it in which it would not be more productive elsewhere yet even a country thus circumstanced might and probably would carry on trade with other countries it would export articles of some sort even to places which could make them with less labor than itself because those countries supposing them to have an advantage over it in all productions would have a greater advantage in some things than in others and would find it their interest to import the articles in which their advantage was smallest that they might employ more of their labor and capital on those in which it was greatest       it might seem that a special theory of value is required for     international trade as compared with domestic trade for the     particular reason that in the former there exists no free     movement of labor and capital from one trading country to     another but we shall see that no new theory is necessary as     before pointed out258 commodities exchange for each other at     their relative costs wherever there is that free competition which     insures perfect facility of movement for labor and capital it has     been usually assumed that capital and labor move freely as between     different parts of the same country but not between different     countries this however is not consistent with the facts we saw     that there were noncompeting industrial groups within the same     nation mr mill here in a pointed way suggests this when he     speaks of “distant places” the addition therefore made to mr     mill’s exposition by mr cairnes259 is that the word     “international” in default of a better term should be applied to     those conditions either within a country or between two     countries which because of the actual immobility of labor and     capital from one occupation to another furnishes a substantial     interference with industrial competition the obstacles to the     free movement of labor and capital which produce the conditions     called “international” are 1 “geographical distance 2     difference in political institutions 3 difference in language     religion and social customs—in a word in forms of civilization”     these differences exist between maine and montana or even between     two adjoining states ohio and kentucky one a free and the other     an old slave state labor and capital have not in the past moved     freely even across mason and dixon’s line there is therefore no     treatment of international trade and values separate from the laws     of value already laid down concerning noncompeting groups since     there is also no free competition between all the industrial     groups within a country    § 2 interchange of commodities between distance places determined by differences not in their absolute but in the comparative costs of production   as i have said elsewhere260 after ricardo the thinker who has done most toward clearing up this subject261 “it is not a difference in the absolute cost of production which determines the interchange but a difference in the comparative cost it may be to our advantage to procure iron from sweden in exchange for cottons even although the mines of england as well as her manufactories should be more productive than those of sweden for if we have an advantage of one half in cottons and only an advantage of a quarter in iron and could sell our cottons to sweden at the price which sweden must pay for them if she produced them herself we should obtain our iron with an advantage over sweden of one half as well as our cottons we may often by trading with foreigners obtain their commodities at a smaller expense of labor and capital than they cost to the foreigners themselves the bargain is still advantageous to the foreigner because the commodity which he receives in exchange though it has cost us less would have cost him more”       this may be illustrated as follows   articles        england             sweden interchanged cotton         10 days’ labor       15 days’ labor                 produces x yds    produces x yds iron           12 days’ labor       15 days’ labor                 produces y cwts   produces y cwts       here england has the advantage over sweden in both cotton and     iron since she can produce x yards of cotton in ten days’ labor     to fifteen days in sweden and y cwts of iron in twelve days’     labor to fifteen days in sweden the ship which takes x yards of     cotton to sweden and there exchanges it as may be done for y     cwts of iron brings back to england that which cost sweden     fifteen days’ labor while the cotton with which the iron was     bought cost england only ten days’ labor so that england also got     her iron at an advantage over sweden of one half of ten days’     labor and yet england had an absolute advantage over sweden in     iron of a less amount ie of one fourth of twelve days’ labor     it is to be distinctly understood that by difference in     comparative cost we mean a difference in the comparative cost of     producing two or more articles in the same country and not the     difference of cost of the same article in the different trading     countries in this example for instance it is the difference in     the comparative costs in england of both cotton and iron not the     different costs of cotton in england and sweden which gives the     reason for the existence of the foreign trade   to illustrate the cases in which interchange of commodities will not and those in which it will take place between two countries the supposition may be made that the united states has an advantage over england in the production both of iron and of corn it may first be supposed that the advantage is of equal amount in both commodities the iron and the corn each of which required 100 days’ labor in the united states requiring each 150 days’ labor in england it would follow that the iron of 150 days’ labor in england if sent to the united states would be equal to the iron of 100 days’ labor in the united states if exchanged for corn therefore it would exchange for the corn of only 100 days’ labor but the corn of 100 days’ labor in the united states was supposed to be the same quantity with that of 150 days’ labor in england with 150 days’ labor in iron therefore england would only get as much corn in the united states as she could raise with 150 days’ labor at home and she would in importing it have the cost of carriage besides in these circumstances no exchange would take place in this case the comparative costs of the two articles in england and in the united states were supposed to be the same though the absolute costs were different on which supposition we see that there would be no labor saved to either country by confining its industry to one of the two productions and importing the other  it is otherwise when the comparative and not merely the absolute costs of the two articles are different in the two countries if while the iron produced with 100 days’ labor in the united states was produced with 150 days’ labor in england the corn which was produced in the united states with 100 days’ labor could not be produced in england with less than 200 days’ labor an adequate motive to exchange would immediately arise with a quantity of iron which england produced with 150 days’ labor she would be able to purchase as much corn in the united states as was there produced with 100 days’ labor but the quantity which was there produced with 100 days’ labor would be as great as the quantity produced in england with 200 days’ labor by importing corn therefore from the united states and paying for it with iron england would obtain for 150 days’ labor what would otherwise cost her 200 being a saving of 50 days’ labor on each repetition of the transaction and not merely a saving to england but a saving absolutely for it is not obtained at the expense of the united states who with corn that cost her 100 days’ labor has purchased iron which if produced at home would have cost her the same the united states therefore on this supposition loses nothing but also she derives no advantage from the trade the imported iron costing her as much as if it were made at home to enable the united states to gain anything by the interchange something must be abated from the gain of england the corn produced in the united states by 100 days’ labor must be able to purchase from england more iron than the united states could produce by that amount of labor more therefore than england could produce by 150 days’ labor england thus obtaining the corn which would have cost her 200 days at a cost exceeding 150 though short of 200 england therefore no longer gains the whole of the labor which is saved to the two jointly by trading with one another262       the case in which both england and the united states would gain     from the trade may be thus briefly shown      articles        united states       england     interchanged     corn           100 days’ labor      200 days’ labor                     produces x bus    produces x bus     iron           125 days’ labor      150 days’ labor                     produces y tons   produces y tons      the ship which carries x bushels of corn from the united states     to england can there exchange it for at least y tons of iron     costing england 150 days’ labor since x bushels in england     would cost 200 days’ labor and bring it home gaining for the     united states the difference between the 100 days’ labor in corn     paid for the y tons of iron and the 125 days which the iron     would have cost here if produced at home in this case the united     states has an advantage over england in both corn and iron but     still an international trade will spring up because the united     states will derive a gain owing to the less cost of corn as     compared with the cost of iron our comparative advantage is in     corn england also by sending to the united states y tons of     iron gets in return for it x bushels of corn to produce the     corn herself would have cost her 200 days’ labor but she bought     that corn by only 150 days’ labor spent on iron england’s     comparative advantage is in iron then both countries will gain      mr bowen263 gives an instance of international trade where one     country has the advantage in both of the commodities entering into     the exchange “the inhabitants of barbadoes favored by their     tropical climate and fertile soil can raise provisions cheaper     than we can in the united states and yet barbadoes buys nearly     all her provisions from this country why is this so because     though barbadoes has the advantage over us in the ability to raise     provisions cheaply she has a still greater advantage over us in     her power to produce sugar and molasses if she has an advantage     of one fourth in raising provisions she has an advantage of one     half in regard to products exclusively tropical and it is better     for her to employ all her labor and capital in that branch of     production in which her advantage is greatest she can thus by     trading with us obtain our breadstuffs and meat at a smaller     expense of labor and capital than they cost ourselves if for     instance a barrel of flour costs ten days’ labor in the united     states and only eight days’ labor in barbadoes the people of     barbadoes can still profitably buy the flour from this country if     they can pay for it with sugar which cost them only six days’     labor and the people of this country can profitably sell them the     flour or buy from them the sugar provided the sugar if raised     in the united states would cost eleven days’ labor the united     states receive sugar which would have cost them eleven days’     labor by paying for it with flour which costs them but ten days     barbadoes receives flour which would have cost her eight days’     labor by paying for it with sugar which costs her but six days     if barbadoes produced both commodities with greater facility but     greater in precisely the same degree there would be no motive for     interchange”      it may be said however that in practice no businessman     considers the question of “comparative cost” in making shipments     of goods abroad that all he thinks of is whether the price here     for example is less than it is in london and yet the very fact     that the prices are less here implies that gold is of high value     relatively to the given commodity while in london if money is to     be sent back in payment and if prices are high there that     implies that gold is there of less comparative value than     commodities and consequently that gold is the cheapest article to     send to the united states the doctrine then is as true of gold     or the precious metals as it is of other commodities264 it may     be stated in the following language of mr cairnes “the proximate     condition determining international exchange is the state of     comparative prices in the exchanging countries as regards the     commodities which form the subject of the trade but comparative     prices within the limits of each country are determined by two     distinct principles—within the range of effective industrial     competition by cost of production outside that range by     reciprocal demand”265    § 3 the direct benefits of commerce consist in increased efficiency of the productive powers of the world   from this exposition we perceive in what consists the benefit of international exchange or in other words foreign commerce setting aside its enabling countries to obtain commodities which they could not themselves produce at all its advantage consists in a more efficient employment of the productive forces of the world if two countries which traded together attempted as far as was physically possible to produce for themselves what they now import from one another the labor and capital of the two countries would not be so productive the two together would not obtain from their industry so great a quantity of commodities as when each employs itself in producing both for itself and for the other the things in which its labor is relatively most efficient the addition thus made to the produce of the two combined constitutes the advantage of the trade it is possible that one of the two countries may be altogether inferior to the other in productive capacities and that its labor and capital could be employed to greatest advantage by being removed bodily to the other the labor and capital which have been sunk in rendering holland habitable would have produced a much greater return if transported to america or ireland the produce of the whole world would be greater or the labor less than it is if everything were produced where there is the greatest absolute facility for its production but nations do not at least in modern times emigrate en masse and while the labor and capital of a country remain in the country they are most beneficially employed in producing for foreign markets as well as for its own the things in which it lies under the least disadvantage if there be none in which it possesses an advantage       the fundamental ground on which all trade or all exchange of     commodities rests is division of labor or separation of     employments beyond the ordinary gain from division of labor     arising from increased dexterity there exist gains arising from     the development of “the special capacities or resources possessed     by particular individuals or localities” international exchanges     call out chiefly the special advantages offered by particular     localities for the prosecution of particular industries      “the only case indeed in which personal aptitudes go for much     in the commerce of nations is where the nations concerned occupy     different grades in the scale of civilization the most     striking example which the world has ever seen of a foreign trade     determined by the peculiar personal qualities of those engaged in     ministering to it is that which was furnished by the southern     states of the american union previous to the abolition of slavery     the effect of that institution was to give a very distinct     industrial character to the laboring population of those states     which unfitted them for all but a very limited number of     occupations but gave them a certain special fitness for these     almost the entire industry of the country was consequently turned     to the production of two or three crude commodities in raising     which the industry of slaves was found to be effective and these     were used through an exchange with foreign countries as the     means of supplying the inhabitants with all other requisites     in the main however it would seem that this cause personal     aptitudes does not go for very much in international     commerce”266      in brief then international trade is but an extension of the     principle of division of labor and the gains to increased     productiveness arising from the latter are exactly the same as     those from the former    § 4 —not in a vent for exports nor in the gains of merchants   according to the doctrine now stated the only direct advantage of foreign commerce consists in the imports a country obtains things which it either could not have produced at all or which it must have produced at a greater expense of capital and labor than the cost of the things which it exports to pay for them it thus obtains a more ample supply of the commodities it wants for the same labor and capital or the same supply for less labor and capital leaving the surplus disposable to produce other things the vulgar theory disregards this benefit and deems the advantage of commerce to reside in the exports as if not what a country obtains but what it parts with by its foreign trade was supposed to constitute the gain to it an extended market for its produce—an abundant consumption for its goods—a vent for its surplus—are the phrases by which it has been customary to designate the uses and recommendations of commerce with foreign countries this notion is intelligible when we consider that the authors and leaders of opinion on mercantile questions have always hitherto been the selling class it is in truth a surviving relic of the mercantile theory according to which money being the only wealth selling or in other words exchanging goods for money was to countries without mines of their own the only way of growing rich—and importation of goods that is to say parting with money was so much subtracted from the benefit  the notion that money alone is wealth has been long defunct but it has left many of its progeny behind it adam smith’s theory of the benefit of foreign trade was that it afforded an outlet for the surplus produce of a country and enabled a portion of the capital of the country to replace itself with a profit the expression surplus produce seems to imply that a country is under some kind of necessity of producing the corn or cloth which it exports so that the portion which it does not itself consume if not wanted and consumed elsewhere would either be produced in sheer waste or if it were not produced the corresponding portion of capital would remain idle and the mass of productions in the country would be diminished by so much either of these suppositions would be entirely erroneous the country produces an exportable article in excess of its own wants from no inherent necessity but as the cheapest mode of supplying itself with other things if prevented from exporting this surplus it would cease to produce it and would no longer import anything being unable to give an equivalent but the labor and capital which had been employed in producing with a view to exportation would find employment in producing those desirable objects which were previously brought from abroad or if some of them could not be produced in producing substitutes for them these articles would of course be produced at a greater cost than that of the things with which they had previously been purchased from foreign countries but the value and price of the articles would rise in proportion and the capital would just as much be replaced with the ordinary profit from the returns as it was when employed in producing for the foreign market the only losers after the temporary inconvenience of the change would be the consumers of the heretofore imported articles who would be obliged either to do without them consuming in lieu of them something which they did not like as well or to pay a higher price for them than before  if it be said that the capital now employed in foreign trade could not find employment in supplying the home market i might reply that this is the fallacy of general overproduction discussed in a former chapter but the thing is in this particular case too evident to require an appeal to any general theory we not only see that the capital of the merchant would find employment but we see what employment there would be employment created equal to that which would be taken away exportation ceasing importation to an equal value would cease also and all that part of the income of the country which had been expended in imported commodities would be ready to expend itself on the same things produced at home or on others instead of them commerce is virtually a mode of cheapening production and in all such cases the consumer is the person ultimately benefited the dealer in the end is sure to get his profit whether the buyer obtains much or little for his money       e converso if for any reason such as a removal of duties     capital should be withdrawn from the production of articles     consumed at home and imported commodities should entirely take     their place the very importation of the foreign commodities would     imply that an increased corresponding production was going on in     this country with which to pay for the imported goods the capital     thus thrown out of employment in an industry in which we had no     comparative advantage when competition became free would     necessarily be employed in the industries in which we had an     advantage and would supply—and the transferred capital would be     the only means of supplying—the commodities which would be sent     abroad to pay for those which by the supposition are now     imported but were formerly produced at home the result is a     greater productiveness of industry and so a greater sum from     which both labor and capital may be rewarded whenever capital     unrestrained by artificial support leaves one employment as     unprofitable it means that that employment is naturally and in     itself less productive than the usual run of other industries in     the country and so less profitable to both labor and capital than     the majority of other occupations    § 5 indirect benefits of commerce economical and moral still greater than the direct   such then is the direct economical advantage of foreign trade but there are besides indirect effects which must be counted as benefits of a high order 1 one is the tendency of every extension of the market to improve the processes of production a country which produces for a larger market than its own can introduce a more extended division of labor can make greater use of machinery and is more likely to make inventions and improvements in the processes of production whatever causes a greater quantity of anything to be produced in the same place tends to the general increase of the productive powers of the world267 there is 2 another consideration principally applicable to an early stage of industrial advancement the opening of a foreign trade by making them acquainted with new objects or tempting them by the easier acquisition of things which they had not previously thought attainable sometimes works a sort of industrial revolution in a country whose resources were previously undeveloped for want of energy and ambition in the people inducing those who were satisfied with scanty comforts and little work to work harder for the gratification of their new tastes and even to save and accumulate capital for the still more complete satisfaction of those tastes at a future time  but 3 the economical advantages of commerce are surpassed in importance by those of its effects which are intellectual and moral it is hardly possible to overrate the value in the present low state of human improvement of placing human beings in contact with persons dissimilar to themselves and with modes of thought and action unlike those with which they are familiar commerce is now what war once was the principal source of this contact such communication has always been and is peculiarly in the present age one of the primary sources of progress finally 4 commerce first taught nations to see with goodwill the wealth and prosperity of one another before the patriot unless sufficiently advanced in culture to feel the world his country wished all countries weak poor and illgoverned but his own he now sees in their wealth and progress a direct source of wealth and progress to his own country it is commerce which is rapidly rendering war obsolete by strengthening and multiplying the personal interests which are in natural opposition to it and it may be said without exaggeration that the great extent and rapid increase of international trade in being the principal guarantee of the peace of the world is the great permanent security for the uninterrupted progress of the ideas the institutions and the character of the human race     chapter xiv of international values    § 1 the values of imported commodities depend on the terms of international interchange   the values of commodities produced at the same place or in places sufficiently adjacent for capital to move freely between them—let us say for simplicity of commodities produced in the same country—depend temporary fluctuations apart upon their cost of production but the value of a commodity brought from a distant place especially from a foreign country does not depend on its cost of production in the place from whence it comes on what then does it depend the value of a thing in any place depends on the cost of its acquisition in that place which in the case of an imported article means the cost of production of the thing which is exported to pay for it  if then the united states imports wine from spain giving for every pipe of wine a bale of cloth the exchange value of a pipe of wine in the united states will not depend upon what the production of the wine may have cost in spain but upon what the production of the cloth has cost in the united states though the wine may have cost in spain the equivalent of only ten days’ labor yet if the cloth costs in the united states twenty days’ labor the wine when brought to the united states will exchange for the produce of twenty days’ american labor plus the cost of carriage including the usual profit on the importer’s capital during the time it is locked up and withheld from other employment268  the value then in any country of a foreign commodity depends on the quantity of home produce which must be given to the foreign country in exchange for it in other words the values of foreign commodities depend on the terms of international exchange what then do these depend upon what is it which in the case supposed causes a pipe of wine from spain to be exchanged with the united states for exactly that quantity of cloth we have seen that it is not their cost of production if the cloth and the wine were both made in spain they would exchange at their cost of production in spain if they were both made in the united states they would possibly exchange at their cost of production in the united states but all the cloth being made in the united states and all the wine in spain they are in circumstances to which we have already determined that the law of cost of production is not applicable we must accordingly as we have done before in a similar embarrassment fall back upon an antecedent law that of supply and demand and in this we shall again find the solution of our difficulty    § 2 the values of foreign commodities depend not upon cost of production but upon reciprocal demand and supply       it has been previously explained that the conditions called     “international” are those either within a nation or those     existing between two separate nations which are such as to     prevent the free movement of labor and capital from one group of     industries to another or from one locality to another distant     one even if woolen cloth could be made cheaper in england than in     the united states we know that neither capital nor labor would     easily leave the united states for england although it might go     from rhode island to massachusetts under similar inducements if     shoes can be made with less advantage in providence than in lynn     the shoe industry will come to lynn but it does not follow that     the english shoe industry would come to lynn even if the     advantages of the latter were greater than those in england if     there be no obstacle to the free movement of labor and capital     between places or occupations and if some place or occupation can     produce at a less cost than another place or occupation then     there will be a migration of the instruments of production since     there is no free movement of labor and capital between one country     and another then two countries stand in the same relation as that     of two “noncompeting groups” within the same country as before     explained when this fact is once fully grasped the subject of     international values becomes very simple it does not differ from     the question of those domestic values for which we found269 that     the dependence on cost of production would not hold but that     their values were governed by reciprocal demand and supply      attention should be drawn to the real nature of the present     inquiry it is not here a question as to what causes international     trade between two countries that has been treated in the     preceding chapter and has been found to be a difference in the     comparative cost the question now is one of exchange value     that is for how much of other commodities a given commodity will     exchange the reasons for the trade are supposed to exist but we     now want to know what the law is which determines the proportions     of the exchange why does one article exchange for more or less of     another not as we have seen because one costs more or less to     produce than the other      in the trade between the united states and england in iron and     corn formerly referred to p 383 it was seen that a 100 days’     labor of corn buys from england iron which would have cost the     united states 125 days’ labor england sends 150 days’ labor of     iron and buys from the united states corn which would have cost     her 200 days’ labor but what rule fixes the proportions between     100 and 125 for the united states and between 150 and 200 for     england at which the exchanges will take place the trade     increases the productiveness of both countries but in what ratio     will the two countries share this gain the answer is briefly in     the ratio set by reciprocal demand and supply that is the     relative strength as compared with each other of the demands of     the two countries respectively for iron and corn this however     may be capable of explanation in a simple form      a has spades and b has oats to dispose of and each wishes to     get the article belonging to the other will a give one spade for     one bushel of oats or for two will b give two bushels of oats     for one spade that depends upon how strong a desire a has for     oats the intensity of his demand may induce him to give two     spades for one bushel but the exchange also depends upon b if he     has no great need for spades and a has a strong desire for oats     b will get more spades for oats than otherwise possibly two     spades for one bushel of oats that is oats will have a larger     exchange value if on the other hand a cares less for oats than     b does for spades then the exchange will result in an increased     value of spades relatively to oats when two commodities exchange     against each other their exchange values will depend entirely     upon the relative intensity of the demand on each side for the     other commodity and this simple form of the statement of     reciprocal demand and supply is also the law of international     values      if instead of spades and oats we substitute iron and corn and let     the trade be between england and the united states the quantity     of corn required to buy a given quantity of iron will depend upon     the relative demands of england for corn and of the united states     for iron something may cut off england’s demand for our     breadstuffs and they will then have a less exchange value     relatively to iron if we keep up our demand and their prices     will fall but if on the other hand england has poor harvests     and consequently a great demand for corn and if our demand for     iron is not excessive at the same time then our breadstuffs will     rise in value and this was precisely what happened from 1877 to     1879 now in the above illustration of corn and iron how can we     know whether or not x bushels of corn the produce of 100 days’     labor in the united states will exchange for exactly y tons of     english iron that again will depend upon the reciprocal demands     of the two countries for corn and iron respectively moreover it     will have been already observed that the ratio of exchange is not     capable of being ascertained exactly since it varies with     changing conditions namely the desires of the people of the two     countries together with their means of purchase      but yet these variations are capable of ascertainment as regards     their extreme limits the reciprocal demand can not carry the     exchange value in either country beyond the line set by the cost     of production of the article for instance an urgent need in     england for corn if the united states has a light demand for     english iron can not carry the ratio of exchange to a point such     that england will offer so much more than 150 days’ labor in iron     for x bushels of american corn that it will go beyond 200 days’     labor in iron it will be seen at once then if that were the     case that england would produce the corn herself and that she     would then have no gain whatever from the trade the ratio of     exchange will thus be limited by the reciprocal demand on one side     to the cost of production 200 days’ labor of english corn on     the other hand if the supposition were reversed and the united     states had a great demand for iron but england had little need     for our corn then we would not offer more than 125 days’ labor of     corn for y tons of iron because for that expenditure of labor     we could produce the iron ourselves      in the above examples we have considered the case of a trade in     corn and iron only if corn were to typify all our goods wanted by     england and iron all english goods wanted by the united states     the conclusions would be exactly the same the ratios of a myriad     of things each governed by its particular reciprocal demand     exchanging against each other give a general result by which the     goods sent out exchange against the goods brought back at such     rates as are fixed by the reciprocal demands acting on all the     goods goods are payments for goods the ratio of exchange depends     on reciprocal demand and supply if we now add more countries to     the example we simply increase the number of persons although in     different countries wanting our goods as set off against our     demands for the goods of this greater number of persons if     france germany and england all want our corn we must have some     demand for the goods of france germany and england also and the     same law of reciprocal demand gives the ratio of interchange that     this explanation is consistent with the facts is to be seen when     we notice how eagerly the exporters of american staples watch the     conditions which increase or diminish the foreign demand for these     commodities looking at them as the causes which directly affect     their exchange value or price   when cost of carriage is added it will increase the price of corn to england and of iron to the united states but as every one knows an increase of price affects the demand and as the demand on each side is affected a new ratio of exchange will finally be reached consistent with the strength of desires on each side who therefore will pay the most of the cost of carriage england or the united states that will again depend on whether england has the greatest relative demand for american goods as compared with the demand of the united states for english goods  no absolute rule therefore can be laid down for the division of the cost no more than for the division of the advantage and it does not follow that in whatever ratio the one is divided the other will be divided in the same it is impossible to say if the cost of carriage could be annihilated whether the producing or the importing country would be most benefited this would depend on the play of international demand  cost of carriage has one effect more but for it every commodity would if trade be supposed free be either regularly imported or regularly exported a country would make nothing for itself which it did not also make for other countries but in consequence of cost of carriage there are many things especially bulky articles which every or almost every country produces within itself after exporting the things in which it can employ itself most advantageously and importing those in which it is under the greatest disadvantage there are many lying between of which the relative cost of production in that and in other countries differs so little that the cost of carriage would absorb more than the whole saving in cost of production which would be obtained by importing one and exporting another this is the case with numerous commodities of common consumption including the coarser qualities of many articles of food and manufacture of which the finer kinds are the subject of extensive international traffic    § 3 —as illustrated by trade in cloth and linen between england and germany       mr mill still further illustrates the operation of the law of     reciprocal demand by the case of a trade between england and     germany in cloth and linen as follows   “suppose that ten yards of broadcloth cost in england as much labor as fifteen yards of linen and in germany as much as twenty” this supposition then being made it would be the interest of england to import linen from germany and of germany to import cloth from england “when each country produced both commodities for itself ten yards of cloth exchanged for fifteen yards of linen in england and for twenty in germany they will now exchange for the same number of yards of linen in both for what number if for fifteen yards england will be just as she was and germany will gain all if for twenty yards germany will be as before and england will derive the whole of the benefit if for any number intermediate between fifteen and twenty the advantage will be shared between the two countries if for example ten yards of cloth exchange for eighteen of linen england will gain an advantage of three yards on every fifteen germany will save two out of every twenty the problem is what are the causes which determine the proportion in which the cloth of england and the linen of germany will exchange for each other let us suppose then that by the effect of what adam smith calls the higgling of the market ten yards of cloth in both countries exchange for seventeen yards of linen  “the demand for a commodity that is the quantity of it which can find a purchaser varies as we have before remarked according to the price in germany the price of ten yards of cloth is now seventeen yards of linen or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in germany to seventeen yards of linen now that being the price there is some particular number of yards of cloth which will be in demand or will find purchasers at that price there is some given quantity of cloth more than which could not be disposed of at that price less than which at that price would not fully satisfy the demand let us suppose this quantity to be 1000 times ten yards  “let us now turn our attention to england there the price of seventeen yards of linen is ten yards of cloth or whatever quantity of money is equivalent in england to ten yards of cloth there is some particular number of yards of linen which at that price will exactly satisfy the demand and no more let us suppose that this number is 1000 times seventeen yards  “as seventeen yards of linen are to ten yards of cloth so are 1000 times seventeen yards to 1000 times ten yards at the existing exchange value the linen which england requires will exactly pay for the quantity of cloth which on the same terms of interchange germany requires the demand on each side is precisely sufficient to carry off the supply on the other the conditions required by the principle of demand and supply are fulfilled and the two commodities will continue to be interchanged as we supposed them to be in the ratio of seventeen yards of linen for ten yards of cloth  “but our suppositions might have been different suppose that at the assumed rate of interchange england had been disposed to consume no greater quantity of linen than 800 times seventeen yards it is evident that at the rate supposed this would not have sufficed to pay for the 1000 times ten yards of cloth which we have supposed germany to require at the assumed value germany would be able to procure no more than 800 times ten yards at that price to procure the remaining 200 which she would have no means of doing but by bidding higher for them she would offer more than seventeen yards of linen in exchange for ten yards of cloth let us suppose her to offer eighteen at this price perhaps england would be inclined to purchase a greater quantity of linen she would consume possibly at that price 900 times eighteen yards on the other hand cloth having risen in price the demand of germany for it would probably have diminished if instead of 1000 times ten yards she is now contented with 900 times ten yards these will exactly pay for the 900 times eighteen yards of linen which england is willing to take at the altered price the demand on each side will again exactly suffice to take off the corresponding supply and ten yards for eighteen will be the rate at which in both countries cloth will exchange for linen  “the converse of all this would have happened if instead of 800 times seventeen yards we had supposed that england at the rate of ten for seventeen would have taken 1200 times seventeen yards of linen in this case it is england whose demand is not fully supplied it is england who by bidding for more linen will alter the rate of interchange to her own disadvantage and ten yards of cloth will fall in both countries below the value of seventeen yards of linen by this fall of cloth or what is the same thing this rise of linen the demand of germany for cloth will increase and the demand of england for linen will diminish till the rate of interchange has so adjusted itself that the cloth and the linen will exactly pay for one another and when once this point is attained values will remain without further alteration”    § 4 the conclusion states in the equation of international demand   “it may be considered therefore as established that when two countries trade together in two commodities the exchange value of these commodities relatively to each other will adjust itself to the inclinations and circumstances of the consumers on both sides in such manner that the quantities required by each country of the articles which it imports from its neighbor shall be exactly sufficient to pay for one another as the inclinations and circumstances of consumers can not be reduced to any rule so neither can the proportions in which the two commodities will be interchanged we know that the limits within which the variation is confined are the ratio between their costs of production in the one country and the ratio between their costs of production in the other ten yards of cloth can not exchange for more than twenty yards of linen nor for less than fifteen but they may exchange for any intermediate number the ratios therefore in which the advantage of the trade may be divided between the two nations are various the circumstances on which the proportionate share of each country more remotely depends admit only of a very general indication”  if therefore it be asked what country draws to itself the greatest share of the advantage of any trade it carries on the answer is the country for whose productions there is in other countries the greatest demand and a demand the most susceptible of increase from additional cheapness in so far as the productions of any country possess this property the country obtains all foreign commodities at less cost it gets its imports cheaper the greater the intensity of the demand in foreign countries for its exports it also gets its imports cheaper the less the extent and intensity of its own demand for them the market is cheapest to those whose demand is small a country which desires few foreign productions and only a limited quantity of them while its own commodities are in great request in foreign countries will obtain its limited imports at extremely small cost that is in exchange for the produce of a very small quantity of its labor and capital  the law which we have now illustrated may be appropriately named the equation of international demand it may be concisely stated as follows the produce of a country exchanges for the produce of other countries at such values as are required in order that the whole of her exports may exactly pay for the whole of her imports this law of international values is but an extension of the more general law of value which we called the equation of supply and demand270 we have seen that the value of a commodity always so adjusts itself as to bring the demand to the exact level of the supply but all trade either between nations or individuals is an interchange of commodities in which the things that they respectively have to sell constitute also their means of purchase the supply brought by the one constitutes his demand for what is brought by the other so that supply and demand are but another expression for reciprocal demand and to say that value will adjust itself so as to equalize demand with supply is in fact to say that it will adjust itself so as to equalize the demand on one side with the demand on the other       the tendency of imports to balance exports may be seen from     chart no xiii on the next page which shows the relation between     the exports and imports solely of merchandise and exclusive of     specie to and from the united states from 1850 to 1860 after     the discoveries of the precious metals in this country we sent     great quantities of gold and silver out of the country purely as     merchandise so that if we should include the precious metals     among the exports in those years the total exports would more     nearly equal the total imports the transmission of gold at that     time was effected exactly as that of other merchandise so that to     the date of the civil war there was a very evident equilibrium     between exports and imports then came the war with the period of     extravagance and speculation following which led to great     purchases abroad and which was closed only by the panic of 1873     since then more exports than imports were needed to pay for the     great purchases of the former period and the epoch of great     exports from 1875 to 1883 balanced the opposite conditions in     the period preceding it would seem therefore that we had     reached a normal period about the year 1882271 a fuller     statement as to the fluctuations of exports and imports about the     equilibrium will be given when the introduction of money in     international trade is made the full statement must also include     the financial account                          illustration chart xiii     chart xiii value of merchandise imported into dotted line and     exported from black line the united states from 1835 to 1883    § 5 the cost to a country of its imports depends not only on the ratio of exchange but on the efficiency of its labor   we now pass to another essential part of the theory of the subject there are two senses in which a country obtains commodities cheaper by foreign trade in the sense of value and in the sense of cost 1 it gets them cheaper in the first sense by their falling in value relatively to other things the same quantity of them exchanging in the country for a smaller quantity than before of the other produce of the country to revert to our original figures of the trade with germany in cloth and linen in england all consumers of linen obtained after the trade was opened seventeen or some greater number of yards for the same quantity of all other things for which they before obtained only fifteen the degree of cheapness in this sense of the term depends on the laws of international demand so copiously illustrated in the preceding sections 2 but in the other sense that of cost a country gets a commodity cheaper when it obtains a greater quantity of the commodity with the same expenditure of labor and capital in this sense of the term cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature a country gets its imports cheaper in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry to the general efficiency of its labor the labor of one country may be as a whole much more efficient than that of another all or most of the commodities capable of being produced in both may be produced in one at less absolute cost than in the other which as we have seen will not necessarily prevent the two countries from exchanging commodities the things which the more favored country will import from others are of course those in which it is least superior but by importing them it acquires even in those commodities the same advantage which it possesses in the articles it gives in exchange for them what her imports cost to her is a function of two variables 1 the quantity of her own commodities which she gives for them and 2 the cost of those commodities of these the last alone depends on the efficiency of her labor the first depends on the law of international values that is on the intensity and extensibility of the foreign demand for her commodities compared with her demand for foreign commodities       the great productiveness of any industry in our country has thus     two results 1 it gives a larger total out of which labor and     capital at home can receive greater rewards and 2 the     commodities being cheaper in comparison than other commodities not     so easily produced furnish the very articles which are most     likely to be sent abroad in accordance with the doctrine of     comparative cost in the united states those things in the     production of which labor and capital are most efficient and so     earn the largest rewards are precisely the articles entering most     largely into our foreign trade that is we get foreign articles     cheaper precisely because these exports cost us less in labor and     capital these of course since we inhabit a country whose     natural resources are not yet fully worked are largely the     products of the extractive industries as may be seen by the     following table of the value of goods entering to the greatest     extent into our foreign export trade in 1883      raw cotton               247328721     breadstuffs              208040850     provisions and animals   118177555     mineral oils             40555492     wood                     26793708     tobacco                  22095229      these six classes of commodities are arranged in the order in     which they enter into our export trade and are the six which come     first and highest in the list     chapter xv of money considered as an imported commodity    § 1 money imported on two modes as a commodity and as a medium of exchange   the degree of progress which we have now made in the theory of foreign trade puts it in our power to supply what was previously deficient in our view of the theory of money and this when completed will in its turn enable us to conclude the subject of foreign trade  money or the material of which it is composed is in great britain and in most other countries a foreign commodity its value and distribution must therefore be regulated not by the law of value which obtains in adjacent places but by that which is applicable to imported commodities—the law of international values  in the discussion into which we are now about to enter i shall use the terms money and the precious metals indiscriminately this may be done without leading to any error it having been shown that the value of money when it consists of the precious metals or of a paper currency convertible into them on demand is entirely governed by the value of the metals themselves from which it never permanently differs except by the expense of coinage when this is paid by the individual and not by the state  money is brought into a country in two different ways it is imported chiefly in the form of bullion like any other merchandise as being an advantageous article of commerce it is also imported in its other character of a medium of exchange to pay some debt due to the country either for goods exported or on any other account the existence of these two distinct modes in which money flows into a country while other commodities are habitually introduced only in the first of these modes occasions somewhat more of complexity and obscurity than exists in the case of other commodities and for this reason only is any special and minute exposition necessary    § 2 as a commodity it obeys the same laws of value as other imported commodities   in so far as the precious metals are imported in the ordinary way of commerce their value must depend on the same causes and conform to the same laws as the value of any other foreign production it is in this mode chiefly that gold and silver diffuse themselves from the mining countries into all other parts of the commercial world they are the staple commodities of those countries or at least are among their great articles of regular export and are shipped on speculation in the same manner as other exportable commodities the quantity therefore which a country say england will give of its own produce for a certain quantity of bullion will depend if we suppose only two countries and two commodities upon the demand in england for bullion compared with the demand in the mining country which we will call the united states272 for what england has to give  the bullion required by england must exactly pay for the cottons or other english commodities required by the united states if however we substitute for this simplicity the degree of complication which really exists the equation of international demand must be established not between the bullion wanted in england and the cottons or broadcloth wanted in the united states but between the whole of the imports of england and the whole of her exports the demand in foreign countries for english products must be brought into equilibrium with the demand in england for the products of foreign countries and all foreign commodities bullion among the rest must be exchanged against english products in such proportions as will by the effect they produce on the demand establish this equilibrium  there is nothing in the peculiar nature or uses of the precious metals which should make them an exception to the general principles of demand so far as they are wanted for purposes of luxury or the arts the demand increases with the cheapness in the same irregular way as the demand for any other commodity so far as they are required for money the demand increases with the cheapness in a perfectly regular way the quantity needed being always in inverse proportion to the value this is the only real difference in respect to demand between money and other things  money then if imported solely as a merchandise will like other imported commodities be of lowest value in the countries for whose exports there is the greatest foreign demand and which have themselves the least demand for foreign commodities to these two circumstances it is however necessary to add two others which produce their effect through cost of carriage the cost of obtaining bullion is compounded of two elements the goods given to purchase it and the expense of transport of which last the bullion countries will bear a part though an uncertain part in the adjustment of international values the expense of transport is partly that of carrying the goods to the bullion countries and partly that of bringing back the bullion both these items are influenced by the distance from the mines and the former is also much affected by the bulkiness of the goods countries whose exportable produce consists of the finer manufactures obtain bullion as well as all other foreign articles cæteris paribus at less expense than countries which export nothing but bulky raw produce  to be quite accurate therefore we must say the countries whose exportable productions 1 are most in demand abroad and 2 contain greatest value in smallest bulk 3 which are nearest to the mines and 4 which have least demand for foreign productions are those in which money will be of lowest value or in other words in which prices will habitually range the highest if we are speaking not of the value of money but of its cost that is the quantity of the country’s labor which must be expended to obtain it we must add 5 to these four conditions of cheapness a fifth condition namely “whose productive industry is the most efficient” this last however does not at all affect the value of money estimated in commodities it affects the general abundance and facility with which all things money and commodities together can be obtained273       the accompanying chart no xiv on the next page gives the     excess of exports from the united states of gold and silver coin     and bullion over imports and the excess of imports over exports     the movement of the line above the horizontal baseline shows     distinctly how largely we have been sending the precious metals     abroad from our mines simply as a regular article of export like     merchandise from 1850 to 1879 the exports are clearly not in the     nature of payments for trade balances since it indicates a steady     movement out of the country with the exception of the first year     of the war when gold came to this country the phenomenal     increase of specie exports during the war and until 1879 was due     to the fact that we had a depreciated paper currency which sent     the metals out of the country as merchandise this chart should be     studied in connection with chart no xiii                           illustration chart xiv   chart xiv chart showing the excess of exports and imports of gold and   silver coin and bullion from and into the united states from 1835 to 1883 the line when above the baseline shows the excess of exports when                       below the excess of imports   from the preceding considerations it appears that those are greatly in error who contend that the value of money in countries where it is an imported commodity must be entirely regulated by its value in the countries which produce it and can not be raised or lowered in any permanent manner unless some change has taken place in the cost of production at the mines on the contrary any circumstance which disturbs the equation of international demand with respect to a particular country not only may but must affect the value of money in that country—its value at the mines remaining the same the opening of a new branch of export trade from england an increase in the foreign demand for english products either by the natural course of events or by the abrogation of duties a check to the demand in england for foreign commodities by the laying on of import duties in england or of export duties elsewhere these and all other events of similar tendency would make the imports of england bullion and other things taken together no longer an equivalent for the exports and the countries which take her exports would be obliged to offer their commodities and bullion among the rest on cheaper terms in order to reestablish the equation of demand and thus england would obtain money cheaper and would acquire a generally higher range of prices a country which from any of the causes mentioned gets money cheaper obtains all its other imports cheaper likewise  it is by no means necessary that the increased demand for english commodities which enables england to supply herself with bullion at a cheaper rate should be a demand in the mining countries england might export nothing whatever to those countries and yet might be the country which obtained bullion from them on the lowest terms provided there were a sufficient intensity of demand in other foreign countries for english goods which would be paid for circuitously with gold and silver from the mining countries the whole of its exports are what a country exchanges against the whole of its imports and not its exports and imports to and from any one country     chapter xvi of the foreign exchanges    § 1 money passes from country to country as a medium of exchange through the exchanges   we have thus far considered the precious metals as a commodity imported like other commodities in the common course of trade and have examined what are the circumstances which would in that case determine their value but those metals are also imported in another character that which belongs to them as a medium of exchange not as an article of commerce to be sold for money but as themselves money to pay a debt or effect a transfer of property  money is sent from one country to another for various purposes the most usual purpose however is that of payment for goods to show in what circumstances money actually passes from country to country for this or any of the other purposes mentioned it is necessary briefly to state the nature of the mechanism by which international trade is carried on when it takes place not by barter but through the medium of money  in practice the exports and imports of a country not only are not exchanged directly against each other but often do not even pass through the same hands each is separately bought and paid for with money we have seen however that even in the same country money does not actually pass from hand to hand each time that purchases are made with it and still less does this happen between different countries the habitual mode of paying and receiving payment for commodities between country and country is by bills of exchange  a merchant in the united states a has exported american commodities consigning them to his correspondent b in england another merchant in england c has exported english commodities suppose of equivalent value to a merchant d in the united states it is evidently unnecessary that b in england should send money to a in the united states and that d in the united states should send an equal sum of money to c in england the one debt may be applied to the payment of the other and the double cost and risk of carriage be thus saved a draws a bill on b for the amount which b owes to him d having an equal amount to pay in england buys this bill from a and sends it to c who at the expiration of the number of days which the bill has to run presents it to b for payment thus the debt due from england to the united states and the debt due from the united states to england are both paid without sending an ounce of gold or silver from one country to the other274                               illustration  this implies if we exclude for the present any other international payments than those occurring in the course of commerce that the exports and imports exactly pay for one another or in other words that the equation of international demand is established when such is the fact the international transactions are liquidated without the passage of any money from one country to the other but if there is a greater sum due from the united states to england than is due from england to the united states or vice versa the debts can not be simply written off against one another after the one has been applied as far as it will go toward covering the other the balance must be transmitted in the precious metals in point of fact the merchant who has the amount to pay will even then pay for it by a bill when a person has a remittance to make to a foreign country he does not himself search for some one who has money to receive from that country and ask him for a bill of exchange in this as in other branches of business there is a class of middlemen or brokers who bring buyers and sellers together or stand between them buying bills from those who have money to receive and selling bills to those who have money to pay when a customer comes to a broker for a bill on paris or amsterdam the broker sells to him perhaps the bill he may himself have bought that morning from a merchant perhaps a bill on his own correspondent in the foreign city and to enable his correspondent to pay when due all the bills he has granted he remits to him all those which he has bought and has not resold in this manner these brokers take upon themselves the whole settlement of the pecuniary transactions between distant places being remunerated by a small commission or percentage on the amount of each bill which they either sell or buy now if the brokers find that they are asked for bills on the one part to a greater amount than bills are offered to them on the other they do not on this account refuse to give them but since in that case they have no means of enabling the correspondents on whom their bills are drawn to pay them when due except by transmitting part of the amount in gold or silver they require from those to whom they sell bills an additional price sufficient to cover the freight and insurance of the gold and silver with a profit sufficient to compensate them for their trouble and for the temporary occupation of a portion of their capital this premium as it is called the buyers are willing to pay because they must otherwise go to the expense of remitting the precious metals themselves and it is done cheaper by those who make doing it a part of their especial business but though only some of those who have a debt to pay would have actually to remit money all will be obliged by each other’s competition to pay the premium and the brokers are for the same reason obliged to pay it to those whose bills they buy the reverse of all this happens if on the comparison of exports and imports the country instead of having a balance to pay has a balance to receive the brokers find more bills offered to them than are sufficient to cover those which they are required to grant bills on foreign countries consequently fall to a discount and the competition among the brokers which is exceedingly active prevents them from retaining this discount as a profit for themselves and obliges them to give the benefit of it to those who buy the bills for purposes of remittance  when the united states had the same number of dollars to pay to england which england had to pay to her one set of merchants in the united states would want bills and another set would have bills to dispose of for the very same number of dollars and consequently a bill on england for 1000 would sell for exactly 1000 or in the phraseology of merchants the exchange would be at par as england also on this supposition would have an equal number of dollars to pay and to receive bills on the united states would be at par in england whenever bills on england were at par in the united states  if however the united states had a larger sum to pay to england than to receive from her there would be persons requiring bills on england for a greater number of dollars than there were bills drawn by persons to whom money was due a bill on england for 1000 would then sell for more than 1000 and bills would be said to be at a premium the premium however could not exceed the cost and risk of making the remittance in gold together with a trifling profit because if it did the debtor would send the gold itself in preference to buying the bill  if on the contrary the united states had more money to receive from england than to pay there would be bills offered for a greater number of dollars than were wanted for remittance and the price of bills would fall below par a bill for 1000 might be bought for somewhat less than 1000 and bills would be said to be at a discount  when the united states has more to pay than to receive england has more to receive than to pay and vice versa when therefore in the united states bills on england bear a premium then in england bills on the united states are at a discount and when bills on england are at a discount in the united states bills on the united states are at a premium in england if they are at par in either country they are so as we have already seen in both275  thus do matters stand between countries or places which have the same currency so much of barbarism however still remains in the transactions of the most civilized nations that almost all independent countries choose to assert their nationality by having to their own inconvenience and that of their neighbors a peculiar currency of their own to our present purpose this makes no other difference than that instead of speaking of equal sums of money we have to speak of equivalent sums by equivalent sums when both currencies are composed of the same metal are meant sums which contain exactly the same quantity of the metal in weight and fineness       the quantity of gold in the english pound is equivalent to     48666 of our gold coins if the bills offered are about equal     to those wanted a claim to a pound in england will sell for     486 if many are wanted and but few to be had their price will     go up of course but it can not go more than a small fraction     beyond 490 since about 3¼ cents is sufficient to cover the     brokerage insurance and freight per pound sterling in a shipment     of gold to london therefore in order to get money to a creditor     in london no one will pay more for a pound in the form of a bill     than he will be obliged to pay for sending it across in the form     of bullion bills of exchange then can not rise in price beyond     the point 490  since rather than pay a higher sum for a     bill gold will be sent this point is called the “shippingpoint”     of gold when the exchanges are at 490 it will be found that     gold is going abroad on the other hand when the supply of bills     is greater than the demand their price will fall a man having a     bill on london to sell—ie a claim to a pound in london—will not     sell it at a price here lower than 486 by more than the expense     of bringing the gold itself across since this expense is about     3¼ cents bills can not fall below about 483 when exchange is     at that price it will be found that gold is coming to the united     states from england this price is the “shippingpoint” for     imports of gold this of course applies to sightbills only      formerly we computed exchange on a scale of percentages the real     par being about 109 this was given up after the war   when bills on foreign countries are at a premium it is customary to say that the exchanges are against the country or unfavorable to it in order to understand these phrases we must take notice of what “the exchange” in the language of merchants really means it means the power which the money of the country has of purchasing the money of other countries supposing 486 to be the exact par of exchange then when it requires more than 1000 to buy a bill of £205 1000 of american money are worth less than their real equivalent of english money and this is called an exchange unfavorable to the united states the only persons in the united states however to whom it is really unfavorable are those who have money to pay in england for they come into the bill market as buyers and have to pay a premium but to those who have money to receive in england the same state of things is favorable for they come as sellers and receive the premium the premium however indicates that a balance is due by the united states which must be eventually liquidated in the precious metals and since according to the old theory the benefit of a trade consisted in bringing money into the country this prejudice introduced the practice of calling the exchange favorable when it indicated a balance to receive and unfavorable when it indicated one to pay and the phrases in turn tended to maintain the prejudice    § 2 distinction between variations in the exchanges which are selfadjusting and those which can only be rectified through prices   it might be supposed at first sight that when the exchange is unfavorable or in other words when bills are at a premium the premium must always amount to a full equivalent for the cost of transmitting money but a small excess of imports above exports or any other small amount of debt to be paid to foreign countries does not usually affect the exchanges to the full extent of the cost and risk of transporting bullion the length of credit allowed generally permits on the part of some of the debtors a postponement of payment and in the mean time the balance may turn the other way and restore the equality of debts and credits without any actual transmission of the metals and this is the more likely to happen as there is a selfadjusting power in the variations of the exchange itself bills are at a premium because a greater money value has been imported than exported but the premium is itself an extra profit to those who export besides the price they obtain for their goods they draw for the amount and gain the premium it is on the other hand a diminution of profit to those who import besides the price of the goods they have to pay a premium for remittance so that what is called an unfavorable exchange is an encouragement to export and a discouragement to import and if the balance due is of small amount and is the consequence of some merely casual disturbance in the ordinary course of trade it is soon liquidated in commodities and the account adjusted by means of bills without the transmission of any bullion not so however when the excess of imports above exports which has made the exchange unfavorable arises from a permanent cause in that case what disturbed the equilibrium must have been the state of prices and it can only be restored by acting on prices it is impossible that prices should be such as to invite to an excess of imports and yet that the exports should be kept permanently up to the imports by the extra profit on exportation derived from the premium on bills for if the exports were kept up to the imports bills would not be at a premium and the extra profit would not exist it is through the prices of commodities that the correction must be administered  disturbances therefore of the equilibrium of imports and exports and consequent disturbances of the exchange may be considered as of two classes the one casual or accidental which if not on too large a scale correct themselves through the premium on bills without any transmission of the precious metals the other arising from the general state of prices which can not be corrected without the subtraction of actual money from the circulation of one of the countries or an annihilation of credit equivalent to it  it remains to observe that the exchanges do not depend on the balance of debts and credits with each country separately but with all countries taken together the united states may owe a balance of payments to england but it does not follow that the exchange with england will be against the united states and that bills on england will be at a premium because a balance may be due to the united states from holland or hamburg and she may pay her debts to england with bills on those places which is technically called arbitration of exchange there is some little additional expense partly commission and partly loss of interest in settling debts in this circuitous manner and to the extent of that small difference the exchange with one country may vary apart from that with others       a common use of bills of exchange is that by which when three     countries are concerned two of them may strike a balance through     the third if both countries have dealings with that third     country new york merchants may buy of china but china may not be     buying of new york although both may have dealings with london                               illustration      a we will suppose is a buyer of £1000 worth of tea from f in     hongkong b is an exporter of wheat £1000 to c in london d     has sent £1000 worth of cotton goods to e in hongkong a can now     pay f through london without the transmission of coin a buys b’s     claim on c for £1000 and sends it to f e wishes to pay d in     london for the cotton goods he bought of him therefore he buys     from f for £1000 the claim he now holds ie a bill of exchange     on london against c for £1000 e sends it to d and when d     collects it from c the whole circle of exchanges is completed     without the transmission of the precious metals     chapter xvii of the distribution of the precious metals through the commercial world    § 1 the substitution of money for barter makes no difference in exports and imports nor in the law of international values   having now examined the mechanism by which the commercial transactions between nations are actually conducted we have next to inquire whether this mode of conducting them makes any difference in the conclusions respecting international values which we previously arrived at on the hypothesis of barter  the nearest analogy would lead us to presume the negative we did not find that the intervention of money and its substitutes made any difference in the law of value as applied to adjacent places things which would have been equal in value if the mode of exchange had been by barter are worth equal sums of money the introduction of money is a mere addition of one more commodity of which the value is regulated by the same laws as that of all other commodities we shall not be surprised therefore if we find that international values also are determined by the same causes under a money and bill system as they would be under a system of barter and that money has little to do in the matter except to furnish a convenient mode of comparing values  all interchange is in substance and effect barter whoever sells commodities for money and with that money buys other goods really buys those goods with his own commodities and so of nations their trade is a mere exchange of exports for imports and whether money is employed or not things are only in their permanent state when the exports and imports exactly pay for each other when this is the case equal sums of money are due from each country to the other the debts are settled by bills and there is no balance to be paid in the precious metals the trade is in a state like that which is called in mechanics a condition of stable equilibrium  but the process by which things are brought back to this state when they happen to deviate from it is at least outwardly not the same in a barter system and in a money system under the first the country which wants more imports than its exports will pay for must offer its exports at a cheaper rate as the sole means of creating a demand for them sufficient to reestablish the equilibrium when money is used the country seems to do a thing totally different she takes the additional imports at the same price as before and as she exports no equivalent the balance of payments turns against her the exchange becomes unfavorable and the difference has to be paid in money this is in appearance a very distinct operation from the former let us see if it differs in its essence or only in its mechanism  let the country which has the balance to pay be the united states276 and the country which receives it england by this transmission of the precious metals the quantity of the currency is diminished in the united states and increased in england this i am at liberty to assume we are now supposing that there is an excess of imports over exports arising from the fact that the equation of international demand is not yet established that there is at the ordinary prices a permanent demand in the united states for more english goods than the american goods required in england at the ordinary prices will pay for when this is the case if a change were not made in the prices there would be a perpetually renewed balance to be paid in money the imports require to be permanently diminished or the exports to be increased which can only be accomplished through prices and hence even if the balances are at first paid from hoards or by the exportation of bullion they will reach the circulation at last for until they do nothing can stop the drain  when therefore the state of prices is such that the equation of international demand can not establish itself the country requiring more imports than can be paid for by the exports it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals or their substitutes in circulation than can permanently circulate and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored the currency is accordingly contracted prices fall and among the rest the prices of exportable articles for which accordingly there arises in foreign countries a greater demand while imported commodities have possibly risen in price from the influx of money into foreign countries and at all events have not participated in the general fall but until the increased cheapness of american goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value or until the increased dearness positive or comparative of foreign goods makes the united states take a less pecuniary value the exports of the united states will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the united states will still flow on this efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the united states brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the united states did not previously send thither or until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a demand abroad for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports aided perhaps by a reduction of the american demand for foreign goods through their enhanced price either positive or comparative  now this is the very process which took place on our original supposition of barter not only therefore does the trade between nations tend to the same equilibrium between exports and imports whether money is employed or not but the means by which this equilibrium is established are essentially the same the country whose exports are not sufficient to pay for her imports offers them on cheaper terms until she succeeds in forcing the necessary demand in other words the equation of international demand under a money system as well as under a barter system is the law of international trade every country exports and imports the very same things and in the very same quantity under the one system as under the other in a barter system the trade gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports exactly exchanges for the sum of the exports in a money system it gravitates to the point at which the sum of the imports and the sum of the exports exchange for the same quantity of money and since things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another the exports and imports which are equal in money price would if money were not used precisely exchange for one another277    § 2 the preceding theorem further illustrated   let us proceed to examine to what extent the benefit of an improvement in the production of an exportable article is participated in by the countries importing it  the improvement may either consist in the cheapening of some article which was already a staple production of the country or in the establishment of some new branch of industry or of some process rendering an article exportable which had not till then been exported at all it will be convenient to begin with the case of a new export as being somewhat the simpler of the two  the first effect is that the article falls in price and a demand arises for it abroad this new exportation disturbs the balance turns the exchanges money flows into the country which we shall suppose to be the united states and continues to flow until prices rise this higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the united states was in the habit of exporting the exports will thus be diminished while at the same time the american public having more money will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities if they make use of this increased power of purchase there will be an increase of imports and by this and the check to exportation the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored the result to foreign countries will be that they have to pay dearer than before for their other imports and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before but not so much cheaper as the united states herself does i say this being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price cost of carriage excepted in the united states and in other countries the cheapness however of the article is not measured solely by the moneyprice but by that price compared with the moneyincomes of the consumers the price is the same to the american and to the foreign consumers but the former pay that price from moneyincomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals while the latter have had their moneyincomes probably diminished by the same cause the trade therefore has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole but only a portion of the benefit which the american consumer has derived from the improvement while the united states has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities thus then any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place but by a general cheapening of all imported products  let us now change the hypothesis and suppose that the improvement instead of creating a new export from the united states cheapens an existing one let the commodity in which there is an improvement be cotton cloth the first effect of the improvement is that its price falls and there is an increased demand for it in the foreign market but this demand is of uncertain amount suppose the foreign consumers to increase their purchases in the exact ratio of the cheapness or in other words to lay out in cloth the same sum of money as before the same aggregate payment as before will be due from foreign countries to the united states the equilibrium of exports and imports will remain undisturbed and foreigners will obtain the full advantage of the increased cheapness of cloth but if the foreign demand for cloth is of such a character as to increase in a greater ratio than the cheapness a larger sum than formerly will be due to the united states for cloth and when paid will raise american prices the price of cloth included this rise however will affect only the foreign purchaser american incomes being raised in a corresponding proportion and the foreign consumer will thus derive a less advantage than the united states from the improvement if on the contrary the cheapening of cloth does not extend the foreign demand for it in a proportional degree a less sum of debts than before will be due to the united states for cloth while there will be the usual sum of debts due from the united states to foreign countries the balance of trade will turn against the united states money will be exported prices that of cloth included will fall and cloth will eventually be cheapened to the foreign purchaser in a still greater ratio than the improvement has cheapened it to the united states these are the very conclusions which would be deduced on the hypothesis of barter278  the result of the preceding discussion can not be better summed up than in the words of ricardo279 “gold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of circulation they are by the competition of commerce distributed in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter” of this principle so fertile in consequences previous to which the theory of foreign trade was an unintelligible chaos mr ricardo though he did not pursue it into its ramifications was the real originator       on the principles of trade which we have before explained the     same rule will apply to the distribution of money in different     parts of the same country especially of a large country with     various kinds of production like the united states the medium of     exchange will by the competition of commerce be distributed in     such proportions among the different parts of the united states     by natural laws as to accommodate itself to the number of     transactions which would take place if no such medium existed for     this reason we find more money in the socalled great financial     centers because there are more exchanges of goods there in     sparsely settled parts of the west there will be less money     precisely because there are fewer transactions than in the older     and more settled districts so that there could be no worse folly     than the following legislation of congress to distribute the     nationalbank circulation “that 150000000 of the entire amount     of circulating notes authorized to be issued shall be apportioned     to associations in the states in the district of columbia and in     the territories according to representative population” act of     march 3 1865    § 3 the precious metals as money are of the same value and distribute themselves according to the same law with the precious metals as a commodity   it is now necessary to inquire in what manner this law of the distribution of the precious metals by means of the exchanges affects the exchange value of money itself and how it tallies with the law by which we found that the value of money is regulated when imported as a mere article of merchandise  the causes which bring money into or carry it out of a country 1 through the exchanges to restore the equilibrium of trade and which thereby raise its value in some countries and lower it in others are the very same causes on which the local value of money would depend if it were never imported except 2 as a merchandise and never except directly from the mines when the value of money in a country is permanently lowered 1 as a medium of exchange by an influx of it through the balance of trade the cause if it is not diminished cost of production must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment more favorable to the country of the equation of international demand—namely either an increased demand abroad for her commodities or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries now an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities are the very causes which on the general principles of trade enable a country to purchase all imports and consequently 2 the precious metals at a lower value there is therefore no contradiction but the most perfect accordance in the results of the two different modes 1 as a medium of exchange and 2 as merchandise in which the precious metals may be obtained when money as a medium of exchange flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities and by so doing alters its own local value it merely realizes by a more rapid process the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals as merchandise flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries as therefore we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things either in the same country or internationally depend so neither does it alter the law of the value of the precious metals itself and there is in the whole doctrine of international values as now laid down a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth    § 4 international payments entering into the “financial account”   before closing this discussion it is fitting to point out in what manner and degree the preceding conclusions are affected by the existence of international payments not originating in commerce and for which no equivalent in either money or commodities is expected or received—such as a tribute or remittances or interest to foreign creditors or a government expenditure abroad  to begin with the case of barter the supposed annual remittances being made in commodities and being exports for which there is to be no return it is no longer requisite that the imports and exports should pay for one another on the contrary there must be an annual excess of exports over imports equal to the value of the remittance if before the country became liable to the annual payment foreign commerce was in its natural state of equilibrium it will now be necessary for the purpose of effecting the remittances that foreign countries should be induced to take a greater quantity of exports than before which can only be done by offering those exports on cheaper terms or in other words by paying dearer for foreign commodities the international values will so adjust themselves that either by greater exports or smaller imports or both the requisite excess on the side of exports will be brought about and this excess will become the permanent state the result is that a country which makes regular payments to foreign countries besides losing what it pays loses also something more by the less advantageous terms on which it is forced to exchange its productions for foreign commodities  the same results follow on the supposition of money commerce being supposed to be in a state of equilibrium when the obligatory remittances begin the first remittance is necessarily made in money this lowers prices in the remitting country and raises them in the receiving the natural effect is that more commodities are exported than before and fewer imported and that on the score of commerce alone a balance of money will be constantly due from the receiving to the paying country when the debt thus annually due to the tributary country becomes equal to the annual tribute or other regular payment due from it no further transmission of money takes place the equilibrium of exports and imports will no longer exist but that of payments will the exchange will be at par the two debts will be set off against one another and the tribute or remittance will be virtually paid in goods the result to the interests of the two countries will be as already pointed out—the paying country will give a higher price for all that it buys from the receiving country while the latter besides receiving the tribute obtains the exportable produce of the tributary country at a lower price       it has been seen as in chart no xiii that considering the     exports and imports merely as merchandise there is in fact no     actual equilibrium at any given time in accordance with the     equation of international demand another element the “financial     account” between the united states and foreign countries must be     considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring     about the equation if we had been borrowing largely of england     holland and germany we should owe a regular annual sum as     interest and our exports must as a rule be exactly that much     more under right and normal conditions than the imports or     take another case if capital is borrowed in europe for railways     in the united states this capital generally comes over in the     form of imports of various kinds but if our exports are not     sufficient at once to balance the increased imports we go in debt     for a time—or in other words in order to establish the balance     we send united states securities abroad instead of actual exports     this shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the     exports and so we find a period like that during and after the     war from 1862 to 1873 of a vast excess of imports since 1873     the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred     in the former period and there has been a vast excess of exports     over imports and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium but     our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to     us producing a return current to balance the excessive     exports280 in brief the use of securities and various forms of     indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred     so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an     excess of exports at another and generally a later time     moreover the large expenses of people traveling in europe will     require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would     ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the     travelers the financial operations therefore between the united     states and foreign countries must be well considered in striking     the equation between our exports and imports as formulated by mr     cairnes281 the equation of international demand should be     stated more broadly as follows “the state of international     demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when     the reciprocal demand of trading countries produces such a     relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country     by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign     liabilities” if we were a great lending instead of a great     borrowing country we should have as a rule a permanent excess     of imports     chapter xviii influence of the currency on the exchanges and on foreign trade    § 1 variations in the exchange which originate in the currency   in our inquiry into the laws of international trade we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter we next showed that the introduction of money as a medium of exchange makes no difference in the laws of exchanges and of values between country and country no more than between individual and individual since the precious metals under the influence of those same laws distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on and at the same values as would be the case under a system of barter we lastly considered how the value of money itself is affected by those alterations in the state of trade which arise from alterations either in the demand and supply of commodities or in their cost of production it remains to consider the alterations in the state of trade which originate not in commodities but in money  gold and silver may vary like other things though they are not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production the demand for them in foreign countries may also vary it may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament or because the increase of production and of transactions has created a greater amount of business to be done by the circulating medium it may diminish for the opposite reasons or from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with these changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries and upon the value of the precious metals according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness  what i propose to examine in the present chapter is not those circumstances affecting money which alter the permanent conditions of its value but the effects produced on international trade by casual or temporary variations in the value of money which have no connection with any causes affecting its permanent value    § 2 effect of a sudden increase of a metallic currency or of the sudden creation of banknotes or other substitutes for money   let us suppose in any country a circulating medium purely metallic and a sudden casual increase made to it for example by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder the natural effect would be a rise of prices this would check exports and encourage imports the imports would exceed the exports the exchanges would become unfavorable and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade and from them progressively through all parts of the commercial world the money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries for it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another and this as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective and the exports and imports though at a higher money valuation would be exactly the same as they were originally this diminished value of money throughout the world at least if the diminution was considerable would cause a suspension or at least a diminution of the annual supply from the mines since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production the annual waste would therefore not be fully made up and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the aggregate quantity of the precious metals to its former amount after which their production would recommence on its former scale the discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects namely a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world and then a temporary depression in the value of the metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries  the same effects which would thus arise from the discovery of a treasure accompany the process by which banknotes or any of the other substitutes for money take the place of the precious metals suppose282 that the united states possessed a currency wholly metallic of 200000000 and that suddenly 200000000 of banknotes were sent into circulation if these were issued by bankers they would be employed in loans or in the purchase of securities and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest which would probably send a great part of the 200000000 of gold out of the country as capital to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere before there had been time for any action on prices but we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers or moneylenders of any kind but by manufacturers in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials or by the government as eg greenbacks in its ordinary expenses so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities the following would be the natural order of consequences all prices would rise greatly exportation would almost cease importation would be prodigiously stimulated a great balance of payments would become due the exchanges would turn against the united states to the full extent of the cost of exporting money and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth over the various countries of the world in the order of their proximity geographically and commercially to the united states       a study of chart no xiv will show how exactly this description     fits the case of our country when the rise of prices stimulated     imports of merchandise see chart no xiii in 1862 and sent gold     out of the country   the efflux would continue until the currencies of all countries had come to a level by which i do not mean until money became of the same value everywhere but until the differences were only those which existed before and which corresponded to permanent differences in the cost of obtaining it when the rise of prices had extended itself in an equal degree to all countries exports and imports would everywhere revert to what they were at first would balance one another and the exchanges would return to par if such a sum of money as 200000000 when spread over the whole surface of the commercial world were sufficient to raise the general level in a perceptible degree the effect would be of no long duration no alteration having occurred in the general conditions under which the metals were procured either in the world at large or in any part of it the reduced value would no longer be remunerating and the supply from the mines would cease partially or wholly until the 200000000 were absorbed283  effects of another kind however will have been produced 200000000 which formerly existed in the unproductive form of metallic money have been converted into what is or is capable of becoming productive capital this gain is at first made by the united states at the expense of other countries who have taken her superfluity of this costly and unproductive article off her hands giving for it an equivalent value in other commodities by degrees the loss is made up to those countries by diminished influx from the mines and finally the world has gained a virtual addition of 200000000 to its productive resources adam smith’s illustration though so well known deserves for its extreme aptness to be once more repeated he compares the substitution of paper in the room of the precious metals to the construction of a highway through the air by which the ground now occupied by roads would become available for agriculture as in that case a portion of the soil so in this a part of the accumulated wealth of the country would be relieved from a function in which it was only employed in rendering other soils and capitals productive and would itself become applicable to production the office it previously fulfilled being equally well discharged by a medium which costs nothing  the value saved to the community by thus dispensing with metallic money is a clear gain to those who provide the substitute they have the use of 200000000 of circulating medium which have cost them only the expense of an engraver’s plate if they employ this accession to their fortunes as productive capital the produce of the country is increased and the community benefited as much as by any other capital of equal amount whether it is so employed or not depends in some degree upon the mode of issuing it if issued by the government and employed in paying off debt it would probably become productive capital the government however may prefer employing this extraordinary resource in its ordinary expenses may squander it uselessly or make it a mere temporary substitute for taxation to an equivalent amount in which last case the amount is saved by the taxpayers at large who either add it to their capital or spend it as income when a part of the paper currency is supplied as in our own country by banking companies the amount is almost wholly turned into productive capital for the issuers being at all times liable to be called upon to refund the value are under the strongest inducements not to squander it and the only cases in which it is not forthcoming are cases of fraud or mismanagement a banker’s profession being that of a moneylender his issue of notes is a simple extension of his ordinary occupation he lends the amount to farmers manufacturers or dealers who employ it in their several businesses so employed it yields like any other capital wages of labor and profits of stock the profit is shared between the banker who receives interest and a succession of borrowers mostly for short periods who after paying the interest gain a profit in addition or a convenience equivalent to profit the capital itself in the long run becomes entirely wages and when replaced by the sale of the produce becomes wages again thus affording a perpetual fund of the value of 200000000 for the maintenance of productive labor and increasing the annual produce of the country by all that can be produced through the means of a capital of that value to this gain must be added a further saving to the country of the annual supply of the precious metals necessary for repairing the wear and tear and other waste of a metallic currency  the substitution therefore of paper for the precious metals should always be carried as far as is consistent with safety no greater amount of metallic currency being retained than is necessary to maintain both in fact and in public belief the convertibility of the paper  but since gold wanted for exportation is almost invariably drawn from the reserves of the banks and is never likely to be taken directly from the circulation while the banks remain solvent the only advantage which can be obtained from retaining partially a metallic currency for daily purposes is that the banks may occasionally replenish their reserves from it    § 3 effect of the increase of an inconvertible paper currency real and nominal exchange   when metallic money had been entirely superseded and expelled from circulation by the substitution of an equal amount of banknotes any attempt to keep a still further quantity of paper in circulation must if the notes are convertible into gold be a complete failure       this brings up the whole question at issue between the “currency     principle” and the “banking principle” the latter maintained by     fullerton wilson price and tooke in his later writings held     that if notes were convertible the value of notes could not     differ from the value of the metal into which they were     convertible while the former advocated by lord overstone g w     norman colonel torrens tooke in his earlier writings and sir     robert peel implied that even a convertible paper was liable to     overissues this last school brought about the bank act of     1844284   a new issue would again set in motion the same train of consequences by which the gold coin had already been expelled the metals would as before be required for exportation and would be for that purpose demanded from the banks to the full extent of the superfluous notes which thus could not possibly be retained in circulation if indeed the notes were inconvertible there would be no such obstacle to the increase in their quantity an inconvertible paper acts in the same way as a convertible while there remains any coin for it to supersede the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation except what may be retained for the convenience of small change and the issues still go on increasing when the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded prices of course rise things which were worth 25 in metallic money become worth 30 in inconvertible paper or more as the case may be but this rise of price will not as in the cases before examined stimulate import and discourage export the imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things not by the paper prices and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond  let us suppose that the united states is the country which has the depreciated paper suppose that some american production could be bought while the currency was still metallic for 25 and sold in england for 2750 the difference covering the expense and risk and affording a profit to the merchant on account of the depreciation this commodity will now cost in the united states 30 and can not be sold in england for more than 2750 and yet it will be exported as before why because the 2750 which the exporter can get for it in england is not depreciated paper but gold or silver and since in the united states bullion has risen in the same proportion with other things—if the merchant brings the gold or silver to the united states he can sell his 2750 in coin for 33 in paper and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses  it thus appears that a depreciation of the currency does not affect the foreign trade of the country this is carried on precisely as if the currency maintained its value but though the trade is not affected the exchanges are when the imports and exports are in equilibrium the exchange in a metallic currency would be at par a bill on england for the equivalent of 25 would be worth 25 but 25 or the quantity of gold contained in them having come to be worth in the united states 30 it follows that a bill on england for 25 will be worth 30 when therefore the real exchange is at par there will be a nominal exchange against the country of as much per cent as the amount of the depreciation if the currency is depreciated 10 15 or 20 per cent then in whatever way the real exchange arising from the variations of international debts and credits may vary the quoted exchange will always differ 10 15 or 20 per cent from it however high this nominal premium may be it has no tendency to send gold out of the country for the purpose of drawing a bill against it and profiting by the premium because the gold so sent must be procured not from the banks and at par as in the case of a convertible currency but in the market at an advance of price equal to the premium in such cases instead of saying that the exchange is unfavorable it would be a more correct representation to say that the par has altered since there is now required a larger quantity of american currency to be equivalent to the same quantity of foreign the exchanges however continue to be computed according to the metallic par the quoted exchanges therefore when there is a depreciated currency are compounded of two elements or factors 1 the real exchange which follows the variations of international payments and 2 the nominal exchange which varies with the depreciation of the currency but which while there is any depreciation at all must always be unfavorable since the amount of depreciation is exactly measured by the degree in which the market price of bullion exceeds the mint valuation we have a sure criterion to determine what portion of the quoted exchange being referable to depreciation may be struck off as nominal the result so corrected expressing the real exchange  the same disturbance of the exchanges and of international trade which is produced by an increased issue of convertible banknotes is in like manner produced by those extensions of credit which as was so fully shown in a preceding chapter have the same effect on prices as an increase of the currency whenever circumstances have given such an impulse to the spirit of speculation as to occasion a great increase of purchases on credit money prices rise just as much as they would have risen if each person who so buys on credit had bought with money all the effects therefore must be similar as a consequence of high prices exportation is checked and importation stimulated though in fact the increase of importation seldom waits for the rise of prices which is the consequence of speculation inasmuch as some of the great articles of import are usually among the things in which speculative overtrading first shows itself there is therefore in such periods usually a great excess of imports over exports and when the time comes at which these must be paid for the exchanges become unfavorable and gold flows out of the country this efflux of gold takes effect on prices by withdrawing gold from the reserves of the banks and so by stopping loans and the use of credit or purchasing power its effect is to make them recoil downward the recoil once begun generally becomes a total rout and the unusual extension of credit is rapidly exchanged for an unusual contraction of it accordingly when credit has been imprudently stretched and the speculative spirit carried to excess the turn of the exchanges and consequent pressure on the banks to obtain gold for exportation are generally the proximate cause of the catastrophe       a glance at chart no xiii will give illustration to the situation     here described after the war and until 1873 while the united     states was under the influence of high prices and a speculation     which has been seldom equaled in our history the resulting great     excess of imports became very striking it was an unhealthy and     abnormal condition of trade the sudden reversal of the trade by     the crisis in 1873 is equally striking and as prices fell     exports began to increase the effect on international trade of a     collapse of credit is thus clearly marked by the lines on the     chart     chapter xix of the rate of interest    § 1 the rate of interest depends on the demand and supply of loans   the two topics of currency and loans though in themselves distinct are so intimately blended in the phenomena of what is called the money market that it is impossible to understand the one without the other and in many minds the two subjects are mixed up in the most inextricable confusion  in the preceding book285 we defined the relation in which interest stands to profit we found that the gross profit of capital might be distinguished into three parts which are respectively the remuneration for risk for trouble and for the capital itself and may be termed insurance wages of superintendence and interest after making compensation for risk that is after covering the average losses to which capital is exposed either by the general circumstances of society or by the hazards of the particular employment there remains a surplus which partly goes to repay the owner of the capital for his abstinence and partly the employer of it for his time and trouble how much goes to the one and how much to the other is shown by the amount of the remuneration which when the two functions are separated the owner of capital can obtain from the employer for its use this is evidently a question of demand and supply nor have demand and supply any different meaning or effect in this case from what they have in all others the rate of interest will be such as to equalize the demand for loans with the supply of them it will be such that exactly as much as some people are desirous to borrow at that rate others shall be willing to lend if there is more offered than demanded interest will fall if more is demanded than offered it will rise and in both cases to the point at which the equation of supply and demand is reestablished  the desire to borrow and the willingness to lend are more or less influenced by every circumstance which affects the state or prospects of industry or commerce either generally or in any of their branches the rate of interest therefore on good security which alone we have here to consider for interest in which considerations of risk bear a part may swell to any amount is seldom in the great centers of money transactions precisely the same for two days together as is shown by the neverceasing variations in the quoted prices of the funds and other negotiable securities nevertheless there must be as in other cases of value some rate which in the language of adam smith and ricardo may be called the natural rate some rate about which the market rate oscillates and to which it always tends to return this rate partly depends on the amount of accumulation going on in the hands of persons who can not themselves attend to the employment of their savings and partly on the comparative taste existing in the community for the active pursuits of industry or for the leisure ease and independence of an annuitant    § 2 circumstances which determine the permanent demand and supply of loans   in ordinary circumstances the more thriving producers and traders have their capital fully employed and many are able to transact business to a considerably greater extent than they have capital for these are naturally borrowers and the amount which they desire to borrow and can give security for constitutes the demand for loans on account of productive employment to these must be added the loans required by government and by landowners or other unproductive consumers who have good security to give this constitutes the mass of loans for which there is an habitual demand  now it is conceivable that there might exist in the hands of persons disinclined or disqualified for engaging personally in business 1 a mass of capital equal to and even exceeding this demand in that case there would be an habitual excess of competition on the part of lenders and the rate of interest would bear a low proportion to the rate of profit interest would be forced down to the point which would either tempt borrowers to take a greater amount of loans than they had a reasonable expectation of being able to employ in their business or would so discourage a portion of the lenders as to make them either forbear to accumulate or endeavor to increase their income by engaging in business on their own account and incurring the risks if not the labors of industrial employment       the low rates of interest rather tempt people to take some     additional risk and enter into investments which offer a higher     rate of dividends so that a period of low interest is a time when     speculative enterprises find victims and then by bad and     worthless investments much of the loanable funds is actually lost     thereby reducing the total quantity of loans more nearly to that     demand which will give an ordinary rate of interest   2 on the other hand the capital owned by persons who prefer lending it at interest or whose avocations prevent them from personally superintending its employment may be short of the habitual demand for loans it may be in great part absorbed by the investments afforded by the public debt and by mortgages and the remainder may not be sufficient to supply the wants of commerce if so the rate of interest will be raised so high as in some way to reestablish the equilibrium when there is only a small difference between interest and profit many borrowers may no longer be willing to increase their responsibilities and involve their credit for so small a remuneration or some who would otherwise have engaged in business may prefer leisure and become lenders instead of borrowers or others under the inducement of high interest and easy investment for their capital may retire from business earlier and with smaller fortunes than they otherwise would have done  or lastly instead of capital being afforded by persons not in business the affording it may itself become a business a portion of the capital employed in trade may be supplied by a class of professional moneylenders these moneylenders however must have more than a mere interest they must have the ordinary rate of profit on their capital risk and all other circumstances being allowed for for it can never answer to any one who borrows for the purposes of his business to pay a full profit for capital from which he will only derive a full profit and moneylending as an employment for the regular supply of trade can not therefore be carried on except by persons who in addition to their own capital can lend their credit or in other words the capital of other people a bank which lends its notes lends capital which it borrows from the community and for which it pays no interest       of late years however banks are generally not permitted to issue     notes on their simple credit that privilege has been so often     abused in this country that now in the national banking system a     separate part of the resources are set aside for the security of     the circulating notes as is also true of the bank of england     since 1844 it is not generally true then that banks now create     the means to make loans by issuing notes by which they borrow     capital from the community without paying interest they do     however depend almost entirely on deposits   a bank of deposit lends capital which it collects from the community in small parcels sometimes without paying any interest and if it does pay interest it still pays much less than it receives for the depositors who in any other way could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for are glad to receive even a little having this subsidiary resource bankers are enabled to obtain by lending at interest the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital the disposable capital deposited in banks together with the funds belonging to those who either from necessity or preference live upon the interest of their property constitute the general loan fund of the country and the amount of this aggregate fund when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers and those of the government and of unproductive consumers determines the permanent or average rate of interest which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another286 but while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which is in the hands of bankers for it is that portion almost exclusively which being lent for short times only is continually in the market seeking an investment the capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some fixed investment such as the public funds mortgages or the bonds of public companies which investment except under peculiar temptations or necessities is not changed    § 3 circumstances which determine the fluctuations   fluctuations in the rate of interest arise from variations either in the demand for loans or in the supply the supply is liable to variation though less so than the demand the willingness to lend is greater than usual at the commencement of a period of speculation and much less than usual during the revulsion which follows in speculative times moneylenders as well as other people are inclined to extend their business by stretching their credit they lend more than usual just as other classes of dealers and producers employ more than usual of capital which does not belong to them accordingly these are the times when the rate of interest is low though for this too as we shall immediately see there are other causes during the revulsion on the contrary interest always rises inordinately because while there is a most pressing need on the part of many persons to borrow there is a general disinclination to lend287  this disinclination when at its extreme point is called a panic it occurs when a succession of unexpected failures has created in the mercantile and sometimes also in the nonmercantile public a general distrust in each other’s solvency disposing every one not only to refuse fresh credit except on very onerous terms but to call in if possible all credit which he has already given deposits are withdrawn from banks notes are returned on the issuers in exchange for specie bankers raise their rate of discount and withhold their customary advances merchants refuse to renew mercantile bills at such times the most calamitous consequences were formerly experienced from the attempt of the law to prevent more than a certain limited rate of interest from being given or taken persons who could not borrow at five per cent had to pay not six or seven but ten or fifteen per cent to compensate the lender for risking the penalties of the law or had to sell securities or goods for ready money at a still greater sacrifice       the pernicious and hurtful custom exists in various states in this     country of making any interest beyond a certain rate illegal when     it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on     credit—until the proceeds of goods sold on credit are     collected—the rate of interest from day to day is very important     to trade so when there is a sudden demand for loans a rate     higher than the legal one will certainly be paid and the law     violated if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save     the borrower from commercial ruin the effect of a legal rate is     to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to     the business public it would be far better to adopt such a     sliding scale as exists at great european banks which allows the     rate of interest to rise with the demand no one then with good     security need want loans if he is willing to pay the high rates     and those not really in need will defer their demand until the     sudden emergency is past already in new york the legal penalty     has been removed for loaning at higher than the legal rates when     charged upon callloans and it has mitigated the extreme     fluctuations of the rate in a market when financial necessity is     contending against the law   except at such periods the amount of capital disposable on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation which process however in the great commercial countries is sufficiently rapid to account for the almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation since when a few years have elapsed without a crisis and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an increase of capital seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return  the demand for loans varies much more largely than the supply and embraces longer cycles of years in its aberrations a time of war for example is a period of unusual draughts on the loan market the government at such times generally incurs new loans and as these usually succeed each other rapidly as long as the war lasts the general rate of interest is kept higher in war than in peace without reference to the rate of profit and productive industry is stinted of its usual supplies       the united states during the late war found that it could not     borrow at even six or seven per cent by receiving depreciated     paper at par for its bonds it really agreed to pay six gold     dollars on each loan of one hundred dollars in paper worth     perhaps at the worst only forty gold dollars which was     equivalent to fifteen per cent this high rate was largely due to     the weakened credit of the government but still it remains true     that the rate was higher because the united states was in the     market as a competitor for large loans now the government can     refund its bonds at three per cent   nor does the influence of these loans altogether cease when the government ceases to contract others for those already contracted continue to afford an investment for a greatly increased amount of the disposable capital of the country which if the national debt were paid off would be added to the mass of capital seeking investment and independently of temporary disturbance could not but to some extent permanently lower the rate of interest       the rapid payment of the public debt by the united states     137823253 in 18821883 and more than 100000000 in     18831884 has taken away the former investment for enormous sums     of loanable funds and to the same extent increased the supply in     the market without doubt this aids in making the present rate of     interest a very low one whether the rate will remain “permanently     lower” however will depend upon whether the field of investment     in the united states is already practically occupied we believe     it is not   the same effect on interest which is produced by government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment the only instance of the kind in recent history on a scale comparable to that of the war loans is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways this capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks or from savings which would have gone into deposit and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchasemoney in discounts or other loans at interest in either case it was a draft on the general loan fund it is in fact evident that unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business    § 4 the rate of interest not really connected with the value of money but often confounded with it   from the preceding considerations it would be seen even if it were not otherwise evident how great an error it is to imagine that the rate of interest bears any necessary relation to the quantity or value of the money in circulation an increase of the currency has in itself no effect and is incapable of having any effect on the rate of interest a paper currency issued by government in the payment of its ordinary expenses in however great excess it may be issued affects the rate of interest in no manner whatever it diminishes indeed the power of money to buy commodities but not the power of money to buy money if a hundred dollars will buy a perpetual annuity of four dollars a year a depreciation which makes the hundred dollars worth only half as much as before has precisely the same effect on the four dollars and therefore can not alter the relation between the two unless indeed it is known and reckoned upon that the depreciation will only be temporary for people certainly might be willing to lend the depreciated currency on cheaper terms if they expected to be repaid in money of full value  in considering the effect produced by the proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes but until of late hardly any attention was paid to the management of their deposits though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues says mr tooke “supposing all the deposits received by a banker to be in coin is he not just as much as the issuing banker exposed to the importunity of customers whom it may be impolitic to refuse for loans or discounts or to be tempted by a high interest and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him under not improbable circumstances unable to meet the demands of his depositors”       in truth the most difficult questions of banking center around     the functions of discount and deposit the separation of the issue     from the banking department by the act of 1844 which renewed the     charter of the bank of england makes this perfectly clear after     entirely removing from their effect on credit all influences due     to issues england has had the same difficulties to encounter as     before which shows that the real question is concerned with the     two essential functions of banking—discount and deposit since     1844 there have been the commercial disturbances of 1847 1857     1866 and 1873 although no expansion of notes without a     corresponding deposit of specie is possible    § 5 the rate of interest determines the price of land and of securities   before quitting the general subject of this chapter i will make the obvious remark that the rate of interest determines the value and price of all those salable articles which are desired and bought not for themselves but for the income which they are capable of yielding the public funds shares in jointstock companies and all descriptions of securities are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low they are sold at the price which will give the market rate of interest on the purchasemoney with allowance for all differences in the risk incurred or in any circumstance of convenience  the price of land mines and all other fixed sources of income depends in like manner on the rate of interest land usually sells at a higher price in proportion to the income afforded by it than the public funds not only because it is thought even in england to be somewhat more secure but because ideas of power and dignity are associated with its possession but these differences are constant or nearly so and in the variations of price land follows cæteris paribus the permanent though of course not the daily variations of the rate of interest when interest is low land will naturally be dear when interest is high land will be cheap       a lot of land which fifty years ago gave an annual return of     100 if ten per cent was then the common rate of interest would     sell for 1000 if the return from the land remains the same     100 today and if the usual rate of interest is now five per     cent the same piece of land therefore would sell for 2000     since 100 is five per cent of 2000      the price of a bond it may be said also varies with the time it     has to run at the same rate of interest a bond running for a     long term of years is better for an investment than one for a     short term the lumberman who looks at two trees of equal     diameter at the base estimates the total value of each according     to the height of the tree then again a bond running for a     short term may be worth less than one for a long term even though     the first bears a higher rate of interest that is to resume the     illustration one tree not rising very high although larger at     the bottom may not contain so many square feet as another with     perhaps a less diameter at the bottom but which stretches much     higher up into the air     chapter xx of the competition of different countries in the same market    § 1 causes which enable one country to undersell another   in the phraseology of the mercantile system there is no word of more frequent recurrence or more perilous import than the word underselling to undersell other countries—not to be undersold by other countries—were spoken of and are still very often spoken of almost as if they were the sole purposes for which production and commodities exist       nations may like individual dealers be competitors with     opposite interests in the markets of some commodities while in     others they are in the more fortunate relation of reciprocal     customers the benefit of commerce does not consist as it was     once thought to do in the commodities sold but since the     commodities sold are the means of obtaining those which are     bought a nation would be cut off from the real advantage of     commerce the imports if it could not induce other nations to     take any of its commodities in exchange and in proportion as the     competition of other countries compels it to offer its commodities     on cheaper terms on pain of not selling them at all the imports     which it obtains by its foreign trade are procured at greater     cost   one country a can only undersell another b in a given market to the extent of entirely expelling her from it on two conditions 1 in the first place she a must have a greater advantage than the second country b in the production of the article exported by both meaning by a greater advantage as has been already so fully explained not absolutely but in comparison with other commodities and 2 in the second place such must be her a’s relation with the customercountry in respect to the demand for each other’s products and such the consequent state of international values as to give away to the customercountry more than the whole advantage possessed by the rival country b otherwise the rival will still be able to hold her ground in the market       let us suppose a trade between england and the united states in     iron and wheat england being capable of producing ten cwts of     iron at the same cost as fifteen bushels of wheat the united     states at the same cost as twenty bushels and the two commodities     being exchanged between the two countries cost of carriage apart     at some intermediate rate say ten for seventeen the united     states could not be permanently undersold in the english market     and expelled from it unless by a country such as india which     offered not merely more than seventeen but more than twenty     bushels of wheat for ten cwts of iron short of that the     competition would only oblige the united states to pay dearer for     iron but would not disable her from exporting wheat the country     therefore which could undersell the united states must in the     first place be able to produce wheat at less cost compared with     iron than the united states herself and in the next place must     have such a demand for iron or other english commodities as     would compel her even when she became sole occupant of the     market to give a greater advantage to england than the united     states could give by resigning the whole of hers to give for     example twentyone bushels for ten cwts for if not—if for     example the equation of international demand after the united     states was excluded gave a ratio of eighteen for ten—the united     states would be now the underselling nation and there would be a     point perhaps nineteen for ten at which both countries would be     able to maintain their ground and to sell in england enough wheat     to pay for the iron or other english commodities for which on     these newly adjusted terms of interchange they had a demand in     like manner england as an exporter of iron could only be driven     from the american market by some rival whose superior advantages     in the production of iron enabled her and the intensity of whose     demand for american produce compelled her to offer ten cwts of     iron not merely for less than seventeen bushels of wheat but for     less than fifteen in that case england could no longer carry on     the trade without loss but in any case short of this she would     merely be obliged to give to the united states more iron for less     wheat than she had previously given288   it thus appears that the alarm of being permanently undersold may be taken much too easily may be taken when the thing really to be anticipated is not the loss of the trade but the minor inconvenience of carrying it on at a diminished advantage an inconvenience chiefly falling on the consumers of foreign commodities and not on the producers or sellers of the exported article it is no sufficient ground of apprehension to the american producers to find that some other country can sell wheat in foreign markets at some particular time a trifle cheaper than they can themselves afford to do in the existing state of prices in the united states suppose them to be temporarily unsold and their exports diminished the imports will exceed the exports there will be a new distribution of the precious metals prices will fall and as all the money expenses of the american producers will be diminished they will be able if the case falls short of that stated in the preceding paragraph again to compete with their rivals  the loss which the united states will incur will not fall upon the exporters but upon those who consume imported commodities who with money incomes reduced in amount will have to pay the same or even an increased price for all things produced in foreign countries       but the business world would regard what was going on under     economic laws as a great and dreaded disaster if it meant that     prices were to fall and gold leave the country those holding     large stocks of goods would for that time suffer and so at     first it might really happen that “exporters” in the sense of     exporting agents not the producers perhaps of the exportable     article would incur a loss in the end of course the consumers     of imports suffer but temporarily and on the face of it     exporters do lose    § 2 high wages do not prevent one country from underselling another   according to the preceding doctrine a country can not be undersold in any commodity unless the rival country has a stronger inducement than itself for devoting its labor and capital to the production of the commodity arising from the fact that by doing so it occasions a greater saving of labor and capital to be shared between itself and its customers—a greater increase of the aggregate produce of the world the underselling therefore though a loss to the undersold country is an advantage to the world at large the substituted commerce being one which economizes more of the labor and capital of mankind and adds more to their collective wealth than the commerce superseded by it the advantage of course consists in being able to produce the commodity of better quality or with less labor compared with other things or perhaps not with less labor but in less time with a less prolonged detention of the capital employed this may arise from greater natural advantages such as soil climate richness of mines superior capability either natural or acquired in the laborers better division of labor and better tools or machinery but there is no place left in this theory for the case of lower wages this however in the theories commonly current is a favorite cause of underselling we continually hear of the disadvantage under which the american producer labors both in foreign markets and even in his own through the lower wages paid by his foreign rivals these lower wages we are told enable or are always on the point of enabling them to sell at lower prices and to dislodge the american manufacturer from all markets in which he is not artificially protected       it will be remembered that as we have before seen international     trade in actual practice depends on comparative prices within     the same country even though the exporter may not consciously     make a comparison we send wheat abroad because it is low in     price relatively to certain manufactured goods that is we send     the wheat but we do not send the manufactured goods but so far     this is considering only the comparative prices in the same     country yet we shall fail to realize in actual practice the     application of the above principles when we use the terms prices     and money if we do not admit that there is in the matter of     underselling a comparison also between the absolute price of the     goods in one country and the absolute price of the same goods in     the competing country for example wheat is not shipped to     england unless the price is lower here than there if india or     morocco were to send wheat into the english market in close     competition with the united states and the price were to fall in     london it would mean that if we continued our shipments of wheat     to england we must part with our wheat at a less advantage in the     international exchange in the illustration already used we must     for example offer more than seventeen bushels of wheat for ten     cwts of iron the fall in the price of wheat without any change     in that of iron implies the necessity of offering a greater     quantity of wheat for the same quantity of iron perhaps nineteen     or twenty bushels for ten cwts of iron if the price went so low     as to require twentyone bushels to pay for ten cwts of iron     then we should be entirely undersold and the price here as     compared with the price in london would be an indication of the     fact so that the comparison of prices here with prices abroad is     merely a register of the terms at which our international     exchanges are performed but not the cause of the existence of the     international trade if the price falls so low in a foreign market     that we can not sell wheat there it simply means that we have     reached in the exchange ratios the limit of our comparative     advantages in wheat and iron so that we are obliged to offer     twenty or more bushels of wheat for ten cwts of iron      but in all this it must be noted that this price must include the     return to capital also and that it must be equal to the usual     reward for capital in other competing industries that is the     ordinary rate of profit in exporting wheat from the united states     the capital engaged will insist on getting the rate of profit to     be found in other occupations to which the capital can go in the     united states now the price if it stands for the value which     is supposed to be governed by cost of production in this case is     the sum out of which wages and profits are paid if the price were     to fall in the foreign market then there might not be the means     with which to pay the usual rate of wages and the usual rate of     profit also then we should probably hear of complaints by the     shippers that there is no profit in the exportation of wheat and     of a falling off in the trade in other words as the capitalist     is the one who manages the operation and is the one first     affected the diminution of advantage in foreign trade arising     from competition generally shows itself first in lessened     profits the price then is the means by which we determine     whether a certain article gives us that comparative advantage     which will insure a gain from international trade      an exportable article whose price in this country is low—since it     is for this reason selected as an export—is one whose cost is low     if the cost be low it means that the industry is very productive     that the same capital and labor produce more for their exertion in     this than in other industries and yet it is precisely in the most     productive industries that higher wages and profits can be and     are paid although each article is sold at a low price the great     quantity produced makes the total sum or value out of which the     industrial rewards profits and wages are paid large that is     the price may be very low lower also in direct comparison with     prices abroad and yet pay the rate of wages and profits current     in this country consequently although wages and profits may be     very high relatively to older countries in those industries of     the united states whose productiveness is great yet the very fact     of this low cost and consequently this low price where     competition is effective is that which fits the commodity for     exportation we are therefore inevitably led to a position in     which we see that high wages and low prices naturally go together     in an exportable commodity in practice certainly the high wages     do not by raising the price prevent us by comparing our price     with english prices from sending goods abroad—because we send     goods abroad from our most productive employments as an     illustration of this principle it is found that the leading     exports of the united states in 1883 were cotton breadstuffs     provisions tobacco mineral oils and wood      but since a direct comparison is in practice made between prices     here and prices in england for example in order to determine     whether the trade can be a profitable one we constantly hear it     said that we can not send goods abroad because our labor is so     dear it need scarcely be observed that we do not hear this from     those engaged in any of the extractive industries just mentioned     as furnishing large exports which are admittedly very productive     it is generally heard in regard to certain kinds of manufactured     goods the difficulty arises not with regard to articles in which     we have the greatest advantage in productiveness but those in     which we have a less advantage if the majority of occupations are     so productive as to assure a generally high reward to labor and     capital throughout the country these less advantageously situated     industries—not being so productive as others either from lack of     skill or good management or high cost of machinery and materials     or peculiarities of climate or heavy taxation—can not pay the     usual high reward to labor and at the same time get for the     capitalist the same high reward he can everywhere else receive at     home for at a price low enough to warrant an exportation the     quantity made by a given amount of labor and capital does not     yield a total value so great as is given in the majority of other     occupations to the same amount of labor and capital and out of     which the usual high wages and profits can be paid the less     productiveness of an industry compared with other industries in     the same country then is the real cause which prevents it from     competing with foreign countries consistently with receiving the     ordinary rate of profit it is the high rate of profits as well as     the high rate of wages common in the country which prevents     selling abroad it is absurd to say that it is only high wages it     is just as much high profits of course if the less productive     industries wish to compete with england and if they pay—as we     know they must—the high rate of wages due to the general     productiveness of our country’s industries they must submit to     less profits for the pleasure of having that particular desire it     is not possible that we should produce everything equally well     here nor is it possible that england should produce everything     equally well if we wish to send any goods at all to england we     must receive some goods from her in order to get the gain arising     from our productiveness we must earnestly wish that england     should have some commodity also in which she has a comparative     advantage in order that any trade whatever may exist it is not     however worth while in my opinion to go on in this discussion     to consider the position of those who would shut us off from any     and all foreign trade      our present high wages should be a cause for congratulation     because they are due to the generally high productiveness of our     resources or in other words due to low cost and it is to be     hoped that they may long continue high we do not seem to be in     imminent danger of not having goods which we can export in     quantities which will buy for us all we may wish to import from     abroad see chart no xiii and note the vast increase of exports     at the same time that wages are known to be higher in this country     than abroad so long as wages continue high we may possibly be     unwilling to see gratified that false and ignorant desire which     leads some people to think that we ought to produce equally well     with any competitor in the world everything that is made if as     was pointed out under the discussion on cost of labor289 we     must necessarily connect with efficiency of labor all natural     advantages under which labor works it is easy to see that high     wages are entirely consistent with low prices and that high wages     do not prevent us today from having an hitherto unequaled export     trade even if all wages and all profits were lower it would     however affect all industries alike and some would still be more     productive relatively to others and the same inequality would     remain if however we learn to use our materials better use     machinery with more effect on the quantity produced adapt our     industries to our climate get the raw products more cheaply free     ourselves from excessive and unreasonable taxation it would be     difficult to say what commodities we might not be able eventually     to manufacture in competition with the rest of the world for we     have scarcely ever as a country had the advantage of such     conditions to aid us in our foreign trade      mr mill now goes on to consider the suggestive fact that wages     are higher in england than on the continent and yet that the     english have no difficulty in underselling their continental     rivals   before examining this opinion on grounds of principle it is worth while to bestow a moment’s consideration upon it as a question of fact is it true that the wages of manufacturing labor are lower in foreign countries than in england in any sense in which low wages are an advantage to the capitalist the artisan of ghent or lyons may earn less wages in a day but does he not do less work degrees of efficiency considered does his labor cost less to his employer though wages may be lower on the continent is not the cost of labor which is the real element in the competition very nearly the same that it is so seems the opinion of competent judges and is confirmed by the very little difference in the rate of profit between england and the continental countries but if so the opinion is absurd that english producers can be undersold by their continental rivals from this cause it is only in america that the supposition is prima facie admissible in america wages are much higher than in england if we mean by wages the daily earnings of a laborer but the productive power of american labor is so great—its efficiency combined with the favorable circumstances in which it is exerted makes it worth so much to the purchaser—that the cost of labor is lower in america than in england as is proved by the fact that the general rate of profits and of interest is very much higher    § 3 low wages enable a country to undersell another when peculiar to certain branches of industry   but is it true that low wages even in the sense of low cost of labor enable a country to sell cheaper in the foreign market i mean of course low wages which are common to the whole productive industry of the country  if wages in any of the departments of industry which supply exports are kept artificially or by some accidental cause below the general rate of wages in the country this is a real advantage in the foreign market it lessens the comparative cost of production of those articles in relation to others and has the same effect as if their production required so much less labor take for instance the case of the united states in respect to certain commodities in that country tobacco and cotton two great articles of export are produced by slavelabor while food and manufactures generally are produced by free laborers who either work on their own account or are paid by wages in spite of the inferior efficiency of slavelabor there can be no reasonable doubt that in a country where the wages of free labor are so high the work executed by slaves is a better bargain to the capitalist to whatever extent it is so this smaller cost of labor being not general but limited to those employments is just as much a cause of cheapness in the products both in the home and in the foreign market as if they had been made by a less quantity of labor if the slaves in the southern states were emancipated and their wages rose to the general level of the earnings of free labor in america that country might be obliged to erase some of the slavegrown articles from the catalogue of its exports and would certainly be unable to sell any of them in the foreign market at the present price their cheapness is partly an artificial cheapness which may be compared to that produced by a bounty on production or on exportation or considering the means by which it is obtained an apter comparison would be with the cheapness of stolen goods                          illustration chart xv                                  chart xv       how far mr mill was in error may be seen by chart no xv which     shows the enormous increase of cotton production under the     régime of free labor as compared with that of slavelabor in the     united states the abolition of slavery has been an economic gain     to the south moreover the exports of raw cotton have increased     from 644327921 pounds in 1869 to 2288075062 pounds in 1883     while for corresponding years the exports of tobacco increased     from 181527630 to 235628360 pounds in other words exports of     tobacco were increased by 30 per cent and those of raw cotton by     no less than 255 per cent besides the prices of cotton and     tobacco are no higher now than before 1850   an advantage of a similar economical though of a very different moral character is that possessed by domestic manufactures fabrics produced in the leisure hours of families partially occupied in other pursuits who not depending for subsistence on the produce of the manufacture can afford to sell it at any price however low for which they think it worth while to take the trouble of producing the workman of zürich is today a manufacturer tomorrow again an agriculturist and changes his occupations with the seasons in a continual round manufacturing industry and tillage advance hand in hand in inseparable alliance and in this union of the two occupations the secret may be found why the simple and unlearned swiss manufacturer can always go on competing and increasing in prosperity in the face of those extensive establishments fitted out with great economic and what is still more important intellectual resources  in the case of these domestic manufactures the comparative cost of production on which the interchange between countries depends is much lower than in proportion to the quantity of labor employed the workpeople looking to the earnings of their loom for a part only if for any part of their actual maintenance can afford to work for a less remuneration than the lowest rate of wages which can permanently exist in the employments by which the laborer has to support the whole expense of a family working as they do not for an employer but for themselves they may be said to carry on the manufacture at no cost at all except the small expense of a loom and of the material and the limit of possible cheapness is not the necessity of living by their trade but that of earning enough by the work to make that social employment of their leisure hours not disagreeable    § 4 —but not when common to all   these two cases of slavelabor and of domestic manufactures exemplify the conditions under which low wages enable a country to sell its commodities cheaper in foreign markets and consequently to undersell its rivals or to avoid being undersold by them but no such advantage is conferred by low wages when common to all branches of industry general low wages never caused any country to undersell its rivals nor did general high wages ever hinder it from doing so  to demonstrate this we must turn to an elementary principle which was discussed in a former chapter290 general low wages do not cause low prices nor high wages high prices within the country itself general prices are not raised by a rise of wages any more than they would be raised by an increase of the quantity of labor required in all production expenses which affect all commodities equally have no influence on prices if the maker of broadcloth or cutlery and nobody else had to pay higher wages the price of his commodity would rise just as it would if he had to employ more labor because otherwise he would gain less profit than other producers and nobody would engage in the employment but if everybody has to pay higher wages or everybody to employ more labor the loss must be submitted to as it affects everybody alike no one can hope to get rid of it by a change of employment each therefore resigns himself to a diminution of profits and prices remain as they were in like manner general low wages or a general increase in the productiveness of labor does not make prices low but profits high if wages fall meaning here by wages the cost of labor why on that account should the producer lower his price he will be forced it may be said by the competition of other capitalists who will crowd into his employment but other capitalists are also paying lower wages and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already the rate then at which labor is paid as well as the quantity of it which is employed affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity and not common to commodities generally       however without there being any change in the productiveness of     any industry if the price of the article should rise for     instance from an increased demand that would make the total     value arising from the products of the industry larger in its     purchasing power and so there would be a larger sum to be divided     among labor and capital if there be free competition more     capital would move into this one industry under the hope of larger     profits and so wages would rise therefore it is possible that     high wages and high prices may go together but not as cause and     effect in fact the change in price generally precedes the change     in wages on the other hand while low wages are not the cause of     low prices nor high wages of high prices yet the two may be found     together as both due to a common cause viz the small or great     value of the total product291   since low wages are not a cause of low prices in the country itself so neither do they cause it to offer its commodities in foreign markets at a lower price it is quite true that if the cost of labor is lower in america than in england america could sell her cottons to cuba at a lower price than england and still gain as high a profit as the english manufacturer but it is not with the profit of the english manufacturer that the american cottonspinner will make his comparison it is with the profits of other american capitalists these enjoy in common with himself the benefit of a low cost of labor and have accordingly a high rate of profit this high profit the cottonspinner must also have he will not content himself with the english profit it is true he may go on for a time at that lower rate rather than change his employment and a trade may be carried on sometimes for a long period at a much lower profit than that for which it would have been originally engaged in countries which have a low cost of labor and high profits do not for that reason undersell others but they do oppose a more obstinate resistance to being undersold because the producers can often submit to a diminution of profit without being unable to live and even to thrive by their business but this is all which their advantage does for them and in this resistance they will not long persevere when a change of times which may give them equal profits with the rest of their countrymen has become manifestly hopeless    § 5 low profits as affecting the carrying trade   it is worth while also to notice a third class of small but in this case mostly independent communities which have supported and enriched themselves almost without any productions of their own except ships and marine equipments by a mere carryingtrade and commerce of entrepot by buying the produce of one country to sell it at a profit in another such were venice and the hanse towns  when the venetians became the agents of the general commerce of southern europe they had scarcely any competitors the thing would not have been done at all without them and there was really no limit to their profits except the limit to what the ignorant feudal nobility could and would give for the unknown luxuries then first presented to their sight at a later period competition arose and the profit of this operation like that of others became amenable to natural laws the carryingtrade was taken up by holland a country with productions of its own and a large accumulated capital the other nations of europe also had now capital to spare and were capable of conducting their foreign trade for themselves but holland having from the variety of circumstances a lower rate of profit at home could afford to carry for other countries at a smaller advance on the original cost of the goods than would have been required by their own capitalists and holland therefore engrossed the greatest part of the carryingtrade of all those countries which did not keep it to themselves by navigation laws292 constructed like those of england for the express purpose       in the united states early in the century a retaliatory policy     against england gave us a body of navigation laws copied after the     mediæval statutes of england and the continent which still remain     on the statutebook they do not permit an american to buy a     vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous     duties a provision which is intended to foster shipbuilding in     the united states even with this legislation ships as a fact     are not built here for the foreign trade and our shipbuilders     practically supply the coastingtrade only which is not open to     foreigners the ability to buy ships anywhere and enter them to     registry under our flag free of duty is what is meant by the     demand for “free ships” this however has to do with     shipbuilding but shipowning or shipsailing is quite distinct     from it the ability to get as great a return from capital and     labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to     americans is another thing even if we had “free ships” the     higher returns in other industries in our country particularly as     regards profits might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a     less for a more productive business in 1884 congress has very     properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships which     diminished the returns from shipsailing and it remains to be     seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign     carryingtrade at present we have a very small tonnage even in     that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods     chapter xxi of distribution as affected by exchange    § 1 exchange and money make no difference in the law of wages   the division of the produce among the three classes laborers capitalists and landlords when considered without any reference to exchange appeared to depend on certain general laws it is fit that we should now consider whether these same laws still operate when the distribution takes place through the complex mechanism of exchange and money or whether the properties of the mechanism interfere with and modify the presiding principles  the primary division of the produce of human exertion and frugality is as we have seen into three shares—wages profits and rents and these shares are portioned out to the persons entitled to them in the form of money and by a process of exchange or rather the capitalist with whom in the usual arrangements of society the produce remains pays in money to the other two sharers the market value of their labor and land if we examine on what the pecuniary value of labor and the pecuniary value of the use of land depend we shall find that it is on the very same causes by which we found that wages and rent would be regulated if there were no money and no exchange of commodities  it is evident in the first place that the law of wages is not affected by the existence or nonexistence of exchange or money wages depend on the ratio between population and capital taking into account the nature of a country’s industries and would do so if all the capital in the world were the property of one association or if the capitalists among whom it is shared maintained each an establishment for the production of every article consumed in the community exchange of commodities having no existence as the ratio between capital and population everywhere but in new colonies depends on the strength of the checks by which the too rapid increase of population is restrained it may be said popularly speaking that wages depend on the checks to population that when the check is not death by starvation or disease wages depend on the prudence of the laboring people and that wages in any country are habitually at the lowest rate to which in that country the laborer will suffer them to be depressed rather than put a restraint upon multiplication  what is here meant however by wages is the laborer’s real scale of comfort the quantity he obtains of the things which nature or habit has made necessary or agreeable to him wages in the sense in which they are of importance to the receiver in the sense in which they are of importance to the payer they do not depend exclusively on such simple principles wages in the first sense the wages on which the laborer’s comfort depends we will call real wages or wages in kind wages in the second sense we may be permitted to call for the present money wages assuming as it is allowable to do that money remains for the time an invariable standard no alteration taking place in the conditions under which the circulating medium itself is produced or obtained if money itself undergoes no variation in cost the money price of labor is an exact measure of the cost of labor and may be made use of as a convenient symbol to express it if the efficiency of labor also be supposed to remain the same  the money wages of labor are a compound result of two elements first real wages or wages in kind or in other words the quantity which the laborer obtains of the ordinary articles of consumption and secondly the money prices of those articles in all old countries—all countries in which the increase of population is in any degree checked by the difficulty of obtaining subsistence—the habitual money price of labor is that which will just enable the laborers one with another to purchase the commodities without which they either can not or will not keep up the population at its customary rate of increase their standard of comfort being given and by the standard of comfort in a laboring class is meant that rather than forego which they will abstain from multiplication money wages depend on the money price and therefore on the cost of production of the various articles which the laborers habitually consume because if their wages can not procure them a given quantity of these their increase will slacken and their wages rise of these articles food and other agricultural produce are so much the principal as to leave little influence to anything else  it is at this point that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the principles which have been laid down in this third part the cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter it depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land or of the least productively employed portion of capital which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes the cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines as we have seen the exchange value and money price of the whole in any given state therefore of the laborers’ habits their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land or least productive agricultural capital on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progress—in its encroachments on the barren lands and its gradually increased strain upon the powers of the more fertile now the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people while the counterforce which checks the descent is the improvement of agricultural science and practice enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns the costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state at any given moment of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other       it will be noted in this exposition that mr mill has in view an     old country with a population so dense that numbers are always     pressing close upon subsistence that their wages are so low as to     give the laborers little more than the necessary wants of life     that these are not the economic conditions in the united states     goes without saying first of all the margin of cultivation is     high only soils of high productiveness are in cultivation and     the returns to labor and capital are consequently very large     high wages are found together with low prices of food the     existing population is not so numerous as to require for the     cultivation of food any but lands of a very high grade of     fertility the ability to command a high reward for labor as     compared with european industries owing to the general     prevalence of high returns in the united states has resulted in     the establishment of a higher standard for our laborers the     standard being relatively so high there is no intimate connection     between the increase of population here and the price of food     for as a rule wages are not so low that any change in the cost     of producing food would require checks upon population there is a     considerable margin above necessaries in the laborer’s real wages     in the united states which may go for comforts decencies and     amusements    § 2 in the law of rent   the degree of productiveness of this extreme margin is an index to the existing state of the distribution of the produce among the three classes of laborers capitalists and landlords when the demand of an increasing population for more food can not be satisfied without extending cultivation to less fertile land or incurring additional outlay with a less proportional return on land already in cultivation it is a necessary condition of this increase of agricultural produce that the value and price of that produce must first rise the price of food will always on the average be such that the worst land and the least productive installment of the capital employed on the better lands shall just replace the expenses with the ordinary profit if the least favored land and capital just do thus much all other land and capital will yield an extra profit equal to the proceeds of the extra produce due to their superior productiveness and this extra profit becomes by competition the prize of the landlords exchange and money therefore make no difference in the law of rent it is the same as we originally293 found it rent is the extra return made to agricultural capital when employed with peculiar advantages the exact equivalent of what those advantages enable the producers to economize in the cost of production the value and price of the produce being regulated by the cost of production to those producers who have no advantages by the return to that portion of agricultural capital the circumstances of which are the least favorable    § 3 —nor in the law of profits   wages and rent being thus regulated by the same principles when paid in money as they would be if apportioned in kind it follows that profits are so likewise for the surplus after replacing wages and paying rent constitutes profits  we found in the last chapter of the second book that the advances of the capitalist when analyzed to their ultimate elements consist either in the purchase or maintenance of labor or in the profits of former capitalists and that therefore profits in the last resort depend upon the cost of labor falling as that rises and rising as it falls let us endeavor to trace more minutely the operation of this law  there are two modes in which the cost of labor which is correctly represented money being supposed invariable as well as efficiency by the money wages of the laborer may be increased the laborer may obtain greater comforts wages in kind—real wages—may rise or the progress of population may force down cultivation to inferior soils and more costly processes thus raising the cost of production the value and the price of the chief articles of the laborer’s consumption on either of these suppositions the rate of profit will fall  if the laborer obtains more abundant commodities only by reason of their greater cheapness if he obtains a greater quantity but not on the whole a greater cost real wages will be increased but not money wages and there will be nothing to affect the rate of profit but if he obtains a greater quantity of commodities of which the cost of production is not lowered he obtains a greater cost his money wages are higher the expense of these increased money wages falls wholly on the capitalist there are no conceivable means by which he can shake it off it may be said—it used formerly to be said—that he will get rid of it by raising his price but this opinion we have already and more than once fully refuted294  the doctrine indeed that a rise of wages causes an equivalent rise of prices is as we formerly observed selfcontradictory for if it did so it would not be a rise of wages the laborer would get no more of any commodity than he had before let his money wages rise ever so much a rise of real wages would be an impossibility this being equally contrary to reason and to fact it is evident that a rise of money wages does not raise prices that high wages are not a cause of high prices a rise of general wages falls on profits there is no possible alternative  having disposed of the case in which the increase of money wages and of the cost of labor arises from the laborer’s obtaining more ample wages in kind let us now suppose it to arise from the increased cost of production of the things which he consumes owing to an increase of population unaccompanied by an equivalent increase of agricultural skill the augmented supply required by the population would not be obtained unless the price of food rose sufficiently to remunerate the farmer for the increased cost of production the farmer however in this case sustains a twofold disadvantage he has to carry on his cultivation under less favorable conditions of productiveness than before for this as it is a disadvantage belonging to him only as a farmer and not shared by other employers he will on the general principles of value be compensated by a rise of the price of his commodity indeed until this rise has taken place he will not bring to market the required increase of produce but this very rise of price involves him in another necessity for which he is not compensated he must pay higher money wages to his laborers if they retain the same quantity of real wages this necessity being common to him with all other capitalists forms no ground for a rise of price the price will rise until it has placed him in as good a situation in respect of profits as other employers of labor it will rise so as to indemnify him for the increased labor which he must now employ in order to produce a given quantity of food but the increased wages of that labor are a burden common to all and for which no one can be indemnified it will be paid wholly from profits  thus we see that increased wages when common to all descriptions of productive laborers and when really representing a greater cost of labor are always and necessarily at the expense of profits and by reversing the cases we should find in like manner that diminished wages when representing a really diminished cost of labor are equivalent to a rise of profits but the opposition of pecuniary interest thus indicated between the class of capitalists and that of laborers is to a great extent only apparent real wages are a very different thing from the cost of labor and are generally highest at the times and places where from the easy terms on which the land yields all the produce as yet required from it the value and price of food being low the cost of labor to the employer notwithstanding its ample remuneration is comparatively cheap and the rate of profit consequently high as at present in the united states we thus obtain a full confirmation of our original theorem that profits depend on the cost of labor or to express the meaning with still greater accuracy the rate of profit and the cost of labor vary inversely as one another and are joint effects of the same agencies or causes      book iv influence of the progress of society on production and distribution     chapter i influence of the progress of industry and population on values and prices    § 1 tendency of the progress of society toward increased command over the powers of nature increased security and increased capacity of cooperation   in the leading countries of the world and in all others as they come within the influence of those leading countries there is at least one progressive movement which continues with little interruption from year to year and from generation to generation—a progress in wealth an advancement in what is called material prosperity all the nations which we are accustomed to call civilized increase gradually in production and in population and there is no reason to doubt that not only these nations will for some time continue so to increase but that most of the other nations of the world including some not yet founded will successively enter upon the same career it will therefore be our first object to examine the nature and consequences of this progressive change the elements which constitute it and the effects it produces on the various economical facts of which we have been tracing the laws and especially on wages profits rents values and prices  of the features which characterize this progressive economical movement of civilized nations that which first excites attention through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production is the perpetual and so far as human foresight can extend 1 the unlimited growth of man’s power over nature our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries it is advancing more rapidly and in a greater number of directions at once than in any previous age or generation and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with nature is still almost in its infancy  another change which has always hitherto characterized and will assuredly continue to characterize the progress of civilized society is 2 a continual increase of the security of person and property of this increased security one of the most unfailing effects is a great increase both of production and of accumulation industry and frugality can not exist where there is not a preponderant probability that those who labor and spare will be permitted to enjoy  one of the changes which most infallibly attend the progress of modern society is 3 an improvement in the business capacities of the general mass of mankind i do not mean that the practical sagacity of an individual human being is greater than formerly what is lost in the separate efficiency of each is far more than made up by the greater capacity of united action works of all sorts impracticable to the savage or the halfcivilized are daily accomplished by civilized nations not by any greatness of faculties in the actual agents but through the fact that each is able to rely with certainty on the others for the portion of the work which they respectively undertake the peculiar characteristic in short of civilized beings is the capacity of cooperation and this like other faculties tends to improve by practice and becomes capable of assuming a constantly wider sphere of action  this progress affords space and scope for an indefinite increase of capital and production and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment that the growth of population will overpass the increase of production there is not much reason to apprehend it is however quite possible that there might be a great progress in industrial improvement and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity a great increase of aggregate wealth and even in some respects a better distribution of it that not only the rich might grow richer but many of the poor might grow rich that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only and not in comfort nor in cultivation we must therefore in considering the effects of the progress of industry admit as a supposition however greatly we deprecate as a fact an increase of population as longcontinued as indefinite and possibly even as rapid as the increase of production and accumulation    § 2 tendency to a decline of the value and cost of production of all commodities   the changes which the progress of industry causes or presupposes in the circumstances of production are necessarily attended with changes in the values of commodities  the permanent values of all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend as we have seen on their cost of production 1 but the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion or in other words diminishes cost of production all inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor or the same quantity with less labor or which abridge the process so that the capital employed needs not be advanced for so long a time lessen the cost of production of the commodity as however value is relative if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities and all in the same degree there would be no alteration in values  as for prices in these circumstances they would be affected or not according as the improvements in production did or did not extend to the precious metals if the materials of money were an exception to the general diminution of cost of production the values of all other things would fall in relation to money—that is there would be a fall of general prices throughout the world but if money like other things and in the same degree as other things were obtained in greater abundance and cheapness prices would be no more affected than values would       as regards the precious metals it is to be said that since 1850     there has been a vast increase in their amount and probably in     greater proportion than the need arising from increased     transactions this is certainly true of silver and it is admitted     to be true of gold as late as about 1865 it has been asserted by     mr goschen that since then especially since 1873 gold has not     existed in a quantity that would permit it to keep its former     proportions to commodities and that it had appreciated an     appreciation of course would show itself in lower gold prices     on the other hand gold has as i think not appreciated prices     even in the collapse of credit after the panic of 1873 down to     1879 were not quite so low as in 18451850 as is seen by the     following table taken from the london “economist”—2200 indicating     the price of a given number of articles in 18451850 as the basis     of the table with which the prices of other years are compared      year               index numbers     18451850           2200     1857 july 1        2996     1858 january 1     2612     1865                3575     1866                3564     1867                3024     1868                2682     1869                2666     1870                2689     1871                2590     1872                2835     1873                2947     1874 depression   2891     1875 depression   2778     1876 depression   2711     1877 depression   2723     1878 depression   2529     1879 depression   2202     1880                2538     1881                2376     1882                2435     1883                2343      but the progress of society particularly in the direction of     improved and cheapened processes of manufacturing has vastly     lowered the cost of a great number of articles of common     consumption the process has been already seen in the diminished     charge for railway transportation see chart no v moreover the     years of a depression are exactly those in which there is always a     forced economy and generally form a period in which cheapening     goes on at its best hence if prices have had a tendency to fall     owing to the lowered cost of production consequent on     improvements—and if they are not as a rule lower than in 1850—it     shows that they are still supported by the high tide of the great     gold production of this century and even the access to more     fertile land in the world has acted to prevent an increase in the     prices of agricultural products such as would offset the fall of     manufactured goods that is the fact that prices have not fallen     as much as might be expected indicates that the gold has     prevented the lower costs due to the progress of industry from     being fully seen   improvements in production are not the only circumstance accompanying the progress of industry which tends to diminish the cost of producing or at least of obtaining commodities 2 another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world as commerce extends and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind 3 much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth of which the soil climate and situation are found by the ample means of exploration now possessed to promise not only a large return to industry but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries much as the collective industry of the earth is likely to be increased in efficiency by the extension of science and of the industrial arts a still more active source of increased cheapness of production will be found probably for some time to come in the gradually unfolding consequences of free trade and in the increasing scale on which emigration and colonization will be carried on  from the causes now enumerated unless counteracted by others the progress of things enables a country to obtain at less and less of real cost not only its own productions but those of foreign countries indeed whatever diminishes the cost of its own productions when of an exportable character enables it as we have already seen to obtain its imports at less real cost    § 3 —except the products of agriculture and mining which have a tendency to rise   are no causes of an opposite character brought into operation by the same progress sufficient in some cases not only to neutralize but to overcome the former and convert the descending movement of cost of production into an ascending movement we are already aware that there are such causes and that in the case of the most important classes of commodities food and materials there is a tendency diametrically opposite to that of which we have been speaking the cost of production of these commodities tends to increase  this is not a property inherent in the commodities themselves if population were stationary and the produce of the earth never needed to be augmented in quantity there would be no cause for greater cost of production295 the only products of industry which if population did not increase would be liable to a real increase of cost of production are those which depending on a material which is not renewed are either wholly or partially exhaustible such as coal and most if not all metals for even iron the most abundant as well as most useful of metallic products which forms an ingredient of most minerals and of almost all rocks is susceptible of exhaustion so far as regards its richest and most tractable ores  when however population increases as it has never yet failed to do then comes into effect that fundamental law of production from the soil on which we have so frequently had occasion to expatiate the law that increased labor in any given state of agricultural skill is attended with a less than proportional increase of produce the cost of production of the fruits of the earth increases cæteris paribus with every increase of the demand       mr cairnes has made some essential contributions to the     discussion of changes of value arising from the progress of     society296 “when a colony establishes itself in a new country     the course of its industrial development naturally follows the     character of the opportunities offered to industrial enterprise by     the environment these will of course vary a good deal     according to the part of the world in which the new society     happens to be placed but speaking broadly they will be such as     to draw the bulk of the industrial activity of the new people into     some one or more of those branches of industry which have been     conveniently designated ‘extractive’ agriculture pastoral and     mining pursuits and the cutting of lumber are among the     principal of such industries” to these pursuits apply “that law     of political economy or more properly of physical nature which     mr mill has rightly characterized as the most important     proposition in economic science—the law as he phrased it of     ‘diminishing productiveness’ it may be thus briefly stated in     any given state of the arts of production the returns to human     industry employed upon natural agents will up to a certain point     be the maximum which those natural agents cultivated with the     degree of skill brought to bear upon them are capable of     yielding but after this point has been passed though an     increased application of labor and capital will obtain an     increased return it will not obtain a proportionally increased     return on the contrary every further increase of outlay—always     assuming that the skill employed in applying it continues the same     as before—will be attended with a return constantly     diminishing what i am now concerned to show is the manner in     which with the progress of society the law in question affects     the course of normal297 values in all commodities coming under     its influence      “the class of commodities in the production of which the     facilities possessed by new communities as compared with old     attain their greatest height are those of which timber and meat     may be taken as the type and comprises such articles as wool     game furs hides horns pitch resin etc the circumstance     which most powerfully affects the course of values in the products     of extractive industry and in the commodities just referred to     among the rest is the degree in which they admit of being     transported from place to place—that is to say their     portableness—depending as it does partly on their durability     and partly on their bulk” it is found that taking timber and     meat as a type—one possessing portableness in a vastly greater     degree than the other—in the early settlement of a new country     the portable article like timber at once rises in price “to a     level lower than that prevailing in old countries only by the cost     of transport” on the other hand perishable articles like meat     are “confined for a market if not to the immediate locality where     it is produced at least to the bordering countries and being     raised in new countries at very low cost their value during the     early stages of their growth is necessarily low but as     population advances and agriculture encroaches on the natural     pasturelands originally available for the rearing of cattle     still more as it becomes necessary to cultivate land for the     purpose of pasture the cost of meat constantly rises” as     population increases there will be an increased demand for     dairyproducts eggs small fruits fresh vegetables milk etc     and thereby it becomes more profitable to employ land near     populous centers for such perishable products than for the     products of large farming almost every one who knows the high     prices of butter eggs and vegetables in large cities as compared     with their prices in country districts is familiar with the     phenomena which illustrate this principle moreover as a denser     population settles on our western prairies now given over to     ranches and vast pasturinggrounds for cattle—since cattle in     general require a large extent of land—the cost of meat will rise     the prices of perishable articles therefore will rise without     any limit except that set by increasing numbers and can not be     kept down by the force of competition from other distant places     as is the case with such easily transportable things as timber and     wool what has been said of the transportableness of meat     however is to be modified somewhat by the introduction of     improved processes of transporting meat in refrigeratorcars but     there still exist commodities of which meat was only taken as a     type   no tendency of a like kind exists with respect to manufactured articles the tendency is in the contrary direction the larger the scale on which manufacturing operations are carried on the more cheaply they can in general be performed as manufactures however depend for their materials either upon agriculture or mining or the spontaneous produce of the earth manufacturing industry is subject in respect of one of its essentials to the same law as agriculture but the crude material generally forms so small a portion of the total cost that any tendency which may exist to a progressive increase in that single item is much overbalanced by the diminution continually taking place in all the other elements to which diminution it is impossible at present to assign any limit  it follows that the exchange values of manufactured articles compared with the products of agriculture and of mines have as population and industry advance a certain and decided tendency to fall money being a product of mines it may also be laid down as a rule that manufactured articles tend as society advances to fall in money price the industrial history of modern nations especially during the last hundred years fully bears out this assertion       in regard to manufactures as opposed to raw products it is to be     remarked “that as the course of price in the field of raw     products is on the whole upward so in that of manufactured     goods the course is not less strikingly in the opposite     direction the reasons of this are exceedingly plain in the first     place division of labor—the first and most powerful of all     cheapeners of production but for which there is in extractive     industry but very limited scope—finds in manufacturing industry an     almost unbounded range for its application and secondly it is     in manufacturing industry also that machinery the other great     cheapener of production admits of being employed on the largest     scale and has in fact been employed with the most signal     success it follows at once from these facts taken in connection     with the further fact that industrial invention does not take     place per saltum but gradually—one invention ever treading on     the heels of another—and that its advance seems to be subject to     no limitation it follows i say from these considerations that     that portion of the cost of manufactured goods which properly     belongs to the manufacturing process must with the progress of     society undergo constant diminution in all the great branches     of manufacturing industry the portion of the cost incurred in the     manufacturing process bears in general a large proportion to that     represented by the raw material while the influence of industrial     invention in reducing this portion of the cost is as every one     knows great and unremitting in its action”      as has been said “the two great cheapeners of production are     division of labor and machinery and the degree in which these     admit of being applied to manufacture is mainly dependent upon the     scale on which the manufacturing process is carried on those     manufactures therefore that are produced upon a large scale are     the sort of manufactures in which we may expect the greatest     reduction in cost in which therefore the fall in price with     the progress of society will be most marked but the manufactures     which are produced upon the largest scale are those for which     there exists the largest demand—that is to say are those which     enter most extensively into the consumption of the great mass of     people they are also i may add those in which a fall in price     is apt to stimulate a great increase of demand all the common     kinds of clothing furniture and utensils fall within the scope     of this remark and it is in these rather than in the commodities     consumed exclusively or mainly by the richer classes that we     should accordingly expect to find the greatest marvels of     cheapening” but the articles of common consumption are those in     which “the amount of manufacture bestowed upon them bears a     smaller proportion to the raw material than is the case with the     more elaborate manufactures such coarser manufactures therefore     would feel the effects of the advancing cost of the raw material     more sensibly than the refined sorts nevertheless it can not be     supposed to compensate the advantages due to the causes i have     pointed out which fall to the share of the commoner sorts it is     in this class of goods that the most remarkable reductions in     price have been accomplished in the past and it is in them     probably that we shall witness in the future the greatest results     of the same kind”    § 4 —that tendency from time to time counteracted by improvements in production   whether agricultural produce increases in absolute as well as comparative cost of production depends on the conflict of the two antagonist agencies—increase of population and improvement in agricultural skill in some perhaps in most states of society looking at the whole surface of the earth both agricultural skill and population are either stationary or increase very slowly and the cost of production of food therefore is nearly stationary in a society which is advancing in wealth population generally increases faster than agricultural skill and food consequently tends to become more costly but there are times when a strong impulse sets in toward agricultural improvement such an impulse has shown itself in great britain during the last fifteen or twenty years before 1847 in england and scotland agricultural skill has of late increased considerably faster than population insomuch that food and other agricultural produce notwithstanding the increase of people can be grown at less cost than they were thirty years ago and the abolition of the corn laws has given an additional stimulus to the spirit of improvement in some other countries and particularly in france the improvement of agriculture gains ground still more decidedly upon population because though agriculture except in a few provinces advances slowly population advances still more slowly and even with increasing slowness its growth being kept down not by poverty which is diminishing but by prudence       moreover the cheapened cost of transportation has admitted to     england and the continent the wheat supplies of our western states     at a low price even after having been carried to transatlantic     markets new methods of getting foodsupplies from foreign     countries act equally with improvements at home    § 5 effect of the progress of society in moderating fluctuations of value   thus far of the effect of the progress of society on the permanent or average values and prices of commodities it remains to be considered in what manner the same progress affects their fluctuations concerning the answer to this question there can be no doubt it tends in a very high degree to diminish them  in poor and backward societies as in the east and in europe during the middle ages extraordinary differences in the price of the same commodity might exist in places not very distant from each other because the want of roads and canals the imperfection of marine navigation and the insecurity of communications generally prevented things from being transported from the places where they were cheap to those where they were dear the things most liable to fluctuations in value those directly influenced by the seasons and especially food were seldom carried to any great distances in most years accordingly there was in some part or other of any large country a real dearth while a deficiency at all considerable extending to the whole world is now a thing almost unknown in modern times therefore there is only dearth where there formerly would have been famine and sufficiency everywhere when anciently there would have been scarcity in some places and superfluity in others  the same change has taken place with respect to all other articles of commerce the safety and cheapness of communications which enable a deficiency in one place to be supplied from the surplus of another at a moderate or even a small advance on the ordinary price render the fluctuations of prices much less extreme than formerly this effect is much promoted by the existence of large capitals belonging to what are called speculative merchants whose business it is to buy goods in order to resell them at a profit these dealers naturally buying things when they are cheapest and storing them up to be brought again into the market when the price has become unusually high the tendency of their operations is to equalize price or at least to moderate its inequalities the prices of things are neither so much depressed at one time nor so much raised at another as they would be if speculative dealers did not exist       mr mill uses the term “speculative” in a different sense from     that which is customary in this country merchants who buy     outright and store up grain are not speculators in the sense in     which the word is used with us but those gamblers who purchase     “for future delivery” grain which they never see and which they     sell in the same way are here known as speculators   it appears then that the fluctuations of values and prices arising from variations of supply or from alterations in real as distinguished from speculative demand may be expected to become more moderate as society advances with regard to those which arise from miscalculation and especially from the alternations of undue expansion and excessive contraction of credit which occupy so conspicuous a place among commercial phenomena the same thing can not be affirmed with equal confidence such vicissitudes beginning with irrational speculation and ending with a commercial crisis have not hitherto become either less frequent or less violent with the growth of capital and extension of industry rather they may be said to have become more so in consequence as is often said of increased competition but as i prefer to say of a lower rate of profits and interest which makes capitalists dissatisfied with the ordinary course of safe mercantile gains the connection of this low rate of profit with the advance of population and accumulation is one of the points to be illustrated in the ensuing chapters       mr cairnes also adds some investigations as to the fluctuations     of value “hitherto i have examined the derivative laws of value     in so far only as they are exemplified in the movements of     normal prices it will be interesting now to consider whether it     is possible to discover in the movements of market prices any     corresponding phenomena      “taking manufactures first it is evident at once that as regards     conditions of protection the circumstances of the case are such     as to secure in general 1 great rapidity and great certainty     in bringing commodities to market a deal table may be made in a     few hours a piece of cloth in a few weeks and a moderatesized     house in a month or little more tables cloth and houses may be     produced with certainty in any quantity required it results from     this that it is scarcely possible that under ordinary     circumstances the selling price of a product of manufacture     should for any long time much exceed its normal price 2 the     nature of manufactures is in general such as to fit them     admirably for distant transport any considerable elevation of     price therefore is pretty certain to attract supplies from     remote sources 3 further considered in their relation to     human needs i think it may be said of manufactured goods that     either the need for them is not very urgent or where it happens     to be so substitutes  may easily be found from all these     circumstances it results that an advance in the price  either     attracts supplies or deters purchasers  preventing any great     departure from the usual terms of the market      “turning now to the products of agricultural pastoral or more     generally ‘extractive’ industry we find the circumstances under     which this class of goods is brought to market in all respects     extremely different from those which we have just examined and     such as to permit a much wider margin of deviation for the market     from the normal price here the period of production is longer     the result of the process much more uncertain the commodity at     once more perishable and less portable and human requirements in     relation to it are mostly of a more urgent kind 1 the shortest     period within which additions can be made to the supply of food     and raw material of the vegetable kind is in general a year and     if the commodity be of animal origin the minimum is considerably     larger 2 again the farmer may decide upon the breadth of     ground to be devoted to a particular crop or upon the number of     cattle he will maintain but the actual returns will vary     according to the season and may prove far in excess or far in     defect of his calculations these circumstances all present     obstacles to the adjustment of supply and demand and consequently     tend to produce frequent and extensive deviations of the market     from the normal price nor are the other conditions of the case     such as to neutralize the influence of such disturbing agencies     3 the nature indeed of some of the principal agricultural     products fits them sufficiently well for distant transport and so     far tends to correct fluctuations of price but on the other     hand 4 the relation of these products to human wants is such     as greatly to enhance that tendency to violent fluctuation     incident to the conditions of their production more especially is     this the case with the commodity whatever it may be which forms     the staple food of a people for observe the peculiar nature of     human requirements with reference to such a commodity they are of     this kind that given the number of a population the quantity of     the staple food required is nearly a fixed quantity and this     almost irrespective of price except among the poorest increased     cheapness will not stimulate a larger consumption while on the     other hand all at any cost within the range of their means will     obtain their usual supply the consequence is that when even a     moderate deficiency or excess occurs in the supply of the staple     food of a people in the one case a the competition of     consumers for their usual quantum of food rapidly forces up the     price far out of proportion to the diminution in the supply in     the other b no one being inclined to increase his usual     consumption the competition of sellers in their eagerness to     find a market for the superfluous portion of the supply is     equally powerful to depress it”     chapter ii influence of the progress of industry and population on rents profits and wages    § 1 characteristic features of industrial progress   continuing the inquiry into the nature of the economical changes taking place in a society which is in a state of industrial progress we shall next consider what is the effect of that progress on the distribution of the produce among the various classes who share in it we may confine our attention to the system of distribution which is the most complex and which virtually includes all others—that in which the produce of manufactures is shared between two classes laborers and capitalists and the produce of agriculture among three laborers capitalists and landlords  the characteristic features of what is commonly meant by industrial progress resolve themselves mainly into three increase of capital increase of population and improvements in production understanding the last expression in its widest sense to include the process of procuring commodities from a distance as well as that of producing them it will be convenient to set out by considering each of the three causes as operating separately after which we can suppose them combined in any manner we think fit298    § 2 first two cases population and capital increasing the arts of production stationary       for the sake of clearness we will form two general groups of these     causes      a the influence of population and capital improvements     remaining stationary      b the influence of improvements population and capital     remaining stationary      we will first take up a and under this division make for     convenience two separate suppositions      i the first is that while population is advancing capital is     stationary by this means we can study separately the operation of     one of the factors of societary progress population and see its     influence on rents profits and wages there being only the same     given quantity of wealth in the form of capital to be now     distributed among more laborers 1 real wages must fall     whereupon if the same capital purchases more labor and obtains     more produce 2 profits rise now if the laborers were so well     off before as to suffer the reduction of wages to take place not     in their food but in their other comforts then if each laborer     uses as much food as before and if as by the supposition there     are more laborers an increased quantity of food will be required     from the soil this supply can be produced only at a greater cost     and as inferior soils are called into cultivation 3 rents will     rise this last action 3 however will have an influence on the     rise of profits 2 for it was only by a reduction of real wages     that profits rose but if the cost of food that is the real     wages have since risen then one of the elements entering into     cost of labor has risen and in so far will offset the fall of     real wages so that profits will not gain so much as if rents had     not risen the result of this first supposition then is that     the landlord is the chief gainer      i 1 wages fall     2 profits rise less if rents rise     3 rents rise      ii we will now take up the second supposition under a that while     capital is advancing population remains stationary then of     course 1 wages will rise and as there is no improvement to     cheapen the cost of their real wages there will be an increase in     cost of labor to the capitalist and 2 profits will fall if     now the laborers being better off demand more food the new     food would cost more as the margin of cultivation was pushed     down and 3 rents would inevitably rise but not only have the     laborers received more real wages but since that change the cost     as just described of these real wages has increased therefore     2 profits would fall still more than by the rise of real wages     in this supposition consequently while the laborer gains so     does the landlord      ii 1 wages rise     2 profits fall more if rents rise     3 rents rise      a it is easy for us now to take into our view the total effects     under a and see what the combined action of i and ii would be     that is if both capital and population improvements remaining     stationary increase what will be the effect on wages profits     and rent of course we must suppose that capital and population     just keep pace with each other and in that case 1 real wages     remain the same each laborer receiving the same quantity and same     quality of commodities as before hence if each laborer receives     the same quantity as before and there are many more laborers     there will be an increased demand put upon the soil for food     poorer soils will be cultivated and the cost of the products will     rise so 3 rents rise but if each laborer receives the same     quantity of real wages as before and the cost of them has risen     as just explained an increased cost of labor will result which     must come out of profits 2 profits will fall so that the     results of a upon distribution taken separately from b are that     the owner of capital loses but the owner of land again gains      a 1 wages the same     2 profits fall     3 rents rise    § 3 the arts of production advancing capital and population stationary       now let us go back to our first general group of causes b—an     advance in the arts of production while capital and population     remain stationary we can now study by themselves the effect of     improvements on wages profits and rent the general effects     arising from the extended introduction of machinery into     agriculture and manufactures the lowered cost of transportation     by steam have been to lessen the value of articles consumed     chiefly by the laboringclasses for the sake of clearness     imagine that the improvement comes suddenly the first effect will     be to lower the value and price of articles entering into the real     wages of the laborers and if those consist mostly of food there     will be a rise in the margin of cultivation and a fall in rents     3 it has been previously shown299 that improvements retard     or put back the law of diminishing returns from land or in     manufactures compensate for it and so lower rents the poorest     soil cultivated is now of a better grade than before and the     produce is yielded at a less cost and value so that the land with     which the best grades are compared to determine the rent is not     separated from the best grades by so wide a gap it would at first     blush seem then that the interests of the landlord were     antagonistic to improvements since they lower rents but in     practice it is not so as we shall soon see      we have seen that improvements cheapen the price of articles     entering into the real wages of the laborer having had a given     sum as money wages before the change then when the sudden change     of improvements came it lowered prices to the laborer and the     same money wages bought more 1 real wages if nothing more     happened we could see that improvements raised real wages—without     lowering 2 profits because cost of labor remains the same     since the lowered cost of the articles consumed was exactly in     proportion to the increase of real wages and if the laborers     chose to retain this higher standard this would be the situation     sadly enough however in practice they are apt to be satisfied     with the old standard and the amount of real wages to give the     old standard of living can be had now for less money wages while     only the same number without any increase can live at the new     higher standard a larger number can live at the old lower     standard in short the obstacles to an increase of population     will be removed by the possession of higher money wages after a     generation it is very probable that a larger number of laborers     will be in existence living at the same or possibly a slightly     higher standard of real wages and money wages will have fallen      now we can understand better than before what would be the     practical result of the causes under b 3 rent has fallen     money wages have fallen even if 2 real wages have not and     since real wages have not fallen in the proportion that their cost     has been reduced 2 profits will have risen the general result     of the causes under b alone acting as just described will then     be      b 1 real wages remain the same money wages less     2 profits rise     3 rents fall    § 4 theoretical results if all three elements progressive       we have considered on the one hand under a the manner in which     the distribution of the produce into rent profits and wages is     affected by the ordinary increase of population and capital and     on the other under b how it is affected by improvements in     production and more especially in agriculture as follows      a 1 wages the same b 1 real wages the same money wages     less     a 2 profits fall b 2 profits rise     a 3 rents rise b 3 rents fall      the effects are clearly contrasted under a we see a tendency to     a rise of rents 3 an increased cost of labor and a fall of     profits 2 under b a fall of rents 3 a diminished cost of     labor and a rise of profits 2 we have therefore analyzed the     forces belonging to the progress of industry and found two     distinct and antagonistic forces working against each other if     at any period improvements b advance faster than population and     capital a rent and money wages will tend downward and profits     upward if on the other hand population advances faster than     improvements b either the laborers will submit to a reduction in     the quantity or quality of their food or if not rent and money     wages will progressively rise and profits will fall    § 5 practical results       this however is not the final and practical result we have     hitherto supposed that improvements b come suddenly in point of     fact agricultural skill is slowly diffused and inventions and     discoveries are in general only occasional not continuous in     their action as is the increase of capital and population     inasmuch as it seldom happens that improvement has so much the     start of population and capital as actually to lower rent or     raise the rate of profits population almost everywhere “treads     close on the heels of agricultural improvement” and effaces its     effects as fast as they are produced   the reason why agricultural improvement seldom lowers rent is that it seldom cheapens food but only prevents it from growing dearer and seldom if ever throws land out of cultivation but only enables worse and worse land to be taken in for the supply of an increasing demand what is sometimes called the natural state of a country which is but half cultivated namely that the land is highly productive and food obtained in great abundance by little labor is only true of unoccupied countries colonized by a civilized people in the united states the worst land in cultivation is of a high quality except sometimes in the immediate vicinity of markets or means of conveyance where a bad quality is compensated by a good situation and even if no further improvements were made in agriculture or locomotion cultivation would have many steps yet to descend before the increase of population and capital would be brought to a stand but in europe five hundred years ago though so thinly peopled in comparison to the present population it is probable that the worst land under the plow was from the rude state of agriculture quite as unproductive as the worst land now cultivated and that cultivation had approached as near to the ultimate limit of profitable tillage in those times as in the present what the agricultural improvements since made have really done is by increasing the capacity of production of land in general to enable tillage to extend downward to a much worse natural quality of land than the worst which at that time would have admitted of cultivation by a capitalist for profit thus rendering a much greater increase of capital and population possible and removing always a little and a little further off the barrier which restrains them population meanwhile always pressing so hard against the barrier that there is never any visible margin left for it to seize every inch of ground made vacant for it by improvement being at once filled up by its advancing columns agricultural improvement may thus be considered to be not so much a counterforce conflicting with increase of population as a partial relaxation of the bonds which confine that increase       now since improvements enable a much poorer quality of land to be     ultimately cultivated under the constant pressure of the increase     of population and capital improvements enable rent 3 in the end     to rise gradually to a much higher limit than it could otherwise     have attained   if a great agricultural improvement were suddenly introduced it might throw back rent for a considerable space leaving it to regain its lost ground by the progress of population and capital and afterward to go on further but taking place as such improvement always does very gradually it causes no retrograde movement of either rent or cultivation it merely enables the one to go on rising and the other extending long after they must otherwise have stopped       inasmuch as in point of fact b never gets the start of a but     follows along with a the general result will be that which we     found true under a—a rise of rents 3 and increased cost of     labor to the capitalist arising from an increased cost of     laborers’ subsistence and a fall of profits 2 the effect of a     more rapid advance of improvements at any one time will     temporarily better the condition of the laborers and also raise     profits but if it is followed immediately by an increase of     population the landowners will reap the benefits of the     improvement in the rise of rent the final result then is as     follows      1 real wages probably higher     2 profits fall     3 rents rise      it is possible that a different combination from the above may     sometimes occur in the causes which underlie the progress of     society 1 there may be a period in which capital is increasing     more rapidly than population and when there seems to be an era of     industrial improvements also then both wages and profits will be     high and it will be a period of general satisfaction 2 if     capital goes on increasing but improvements are few wages will     rise but profits must suffer a fall in this country where     population has not yet increased so as to press seriously against     subsistence and where capital increases with incredible     swiftness these cases are often exemplified the extraordinary     resources of the newer states have permitted an unlimited increase     of population and capital has found no difficulty in finding an     investment but yet those states which have been burdened with the     disabilities of the old slave régime are far behind the others     the changes in the rank of the states in respect of population     at each decade as seen in chart no xvi are suggestive                          illustration chart xvi        chart xvi changes of the rank of the states in the scale of                  relative population from 1790 to 1880     chapter iii of the tendency of profits to a minimum    § 1 different theories as to the fall of profits   the tendency of profits to fall as society advances which has been brought to notice in the preceding chapter was early recognized by writers on industry and commerce but the laws which govern profits not being then understood the phenomenon was ascribed to a wrong cause adam smith considered profits to be determined by what he called the competition of capital in adam smith’s opinion the manner in which the competition of capital lowers profits is by lowering prices that being usually the mode in which an increased investment of capital in any particular trade lowers the profits of that trade but if this was his meaning he overlooked the circumstance that the fall of price which if confined to one commodity really does lower the profits of the producer ceases to have that effect as soon as it extends to all commodities because when all things have fallen nothing has really fallen except nominally and even computed in money the expenses of every producer have diminished as much as his returns unless indeed labor be the one commodity which has not fallen in money price when all other things have if so what has really taken place is a rise of wages and it is that and not the fall of prices which has lowered the profits of capital there is another thing which escaped the notice of adam smith that the supposed universal fall of prices through increased competition of capitals is a thing which can not take place prices are not determined by the competition of the sellers only but also by that of the buyers by demand as well as supply the demand which affects money prices consists of all the money in the hands of the community destined to be laid out in commodities and as long as the proportion of this to the commodities is not diminished there is no fall of general prices now howsoever capital may increase and give rise to an increased production of commodities a full share of the capital will be drawn to the business of producing or importing money and the quantity of money will be augmented in an equal ratio with the quantity of commodities for if this were not the case and if money therefore were as the theory supposes perpetually acquiring increased purchasing power those who produced or imported it would obtain constantly increasing profits and this could not happen without attracting labor and capital to that occupation from other employments if a general fall of prices and increased value of money were really to occur it could only be as a consequence of increased cost of production from the gradual exhaustion of the mines  it is not tenable therefore in theory that the increase of capital produces or tends to produce a general decline of money prices neither is it true that any general decline of prices as capital increased has manifested itself in fact the only things observed to fall in price with the progress of society are those in which there have been improvements in production greater than have taken place in the production of the precious metals as for example all spun and woven fabrics other things again instead of falling have risen in price because their cost of production compared with that of gold and silver has increased among these are all kinds of food comparison being made with a much earlier period of history the doctrine therefore that competition of capital lowers profits by lowering prices is incorrect in fact as well as unsound in principle  mr wakefield in his commentary on adam smith and his important writings on colonization takes a much clearer view of the subject and arrives through a substantially correct series of deductions at practical conclusions which appear to me just and important mr wakefield’s explanation of the fall of profits is briefly this production is limited not solely by the quantity of capital and of labor but also by the extent of the “field of employment” the field of employment for capital is twofold the land of the country and the capacity of foreign markets to take its manufactured commodities on a limited extent of land only a limited quantity of capital can find employment at a profit as the quantity of capital approaches this limit profit falls when the limit is attained profit is annihilated and can only be restored through an extension of the field of employment either by the acquisition of fertile land or by opening new markets in foreign countries from which food and materials can be purchased with the products of domestic capital300    § 2 what determines the minimum rate of profit   there is at every time and place some particular rate of profit which is the lowest that will induce the people of that country and time to accumulate savings and to employ those savings productively this minimum rate of profit varies according to circumstances it depends on two elements one is the strength of the effective desire of accumulation the comparative estimate made by the people of that place and era of future interests when weighed against present this element chiefly affects the inclination to save the other element which affects not so much the willingness to save as the disposition to employ savings productively is the degree of security of capital engaged in industrial operations in employing any funds which a person may possess as capital on his own account or in lending it to others to be so employed there is always some additional risk over and above that incurred by keeping it idle in his own custody this extra risk is great in proportion as the general state of society is insecure it may be equivalent to twenty thirty or fifty per cent or to no more than one or two something however it must always be and for this the expectation of profit must be sufficient to compensate  there would be adequate motives for a certain amount of saving even if capital yielded no profit there would be an inducement to lay by in good times a provision for bad to reserve something for sickness and infirmity or as a means of leisure and independence in the latter part of life or a help to children in the outset of it savings however which have only these ends in view have not much tendency to increase the amount of capital permanently in existence the savings by which an addition is made to the national capital usually emanate from the desire of persons to improve what is termed their condition in life or to make a provision for children or others independent of their exertions now to the strength of these inclinations it makes a very material difference how much of the desired object can be effected by a given amount and duration of selfdenial which again depends on the rate of profit and there is in every country some rate of profit below which persons in general will not find sufficient motive to save for the mere purpose of growing richer or of leaving others better off than themselves any accumulation therefore by which the general capital is increased requires as its necessary condition a certain rate of profit—a rate which an average person will deem to be an equivalent for abstinence with the addition of a sufficient insurance against risk  i have already observed that this minimum rate of profit less than which is not consistent with the further increase of capital is lower in some states of society than in others and i may add that the kind of social progress characteristic of our present civilization tends to diminish it 1 in the first place one of the acknowledged effects of that progress is an increase of general security destruction by wars and spoliation by private or public violence are less and less to be apprehended the risks attending the investment of savings in productive employment require therefore a smaller rate of profit to compensate for them than was required a century ago and will hereafter require less than at present 2 in the second place it is also one of the consequences of civilization that mankind become less the slaves of the moment and more habituated to carry their desires and purposes forward into a distant future this increase of providence is a natural result of the increased assurance with which futurity can be looked forward to and is besides favored by most of the influences which an industrial life exercises over the passions and inclinations of human nature in proportion as life has fewer vicissitudes as habits become more fixed and great prizes are less and less to be hoped for by any other means than long perseverance mankind become more willing to sacrifice present indulgence for future objects but though the minimum rate of profit is liable to vary and though to specify exactly what it is would at any given time be impossible such a minimum always exists and whether it be high or low when once it is reached no further increase of capital can for the present take place the country has then attained what is known to political economists under the name of the stationary state    § 3 in old and opulent countries profits habitually near to the minimum   we now arrive at the fundamental proposition which this chapter is intended to inculcate when a country has long possessed a large production and a large net income to make savings from and when therefore the means have long existed of making a great annual addition to capital the country not having like america a large reserve of fertile land still unused it is one of the characteristics of such a country that the rate of profit is habitually within as it were a hand’s breadth of the minimum and the country therefore on the very verge of the stationary state my meaning is that it would require but a short time to reduce profits to the minimum if capital continued to increase at its present rate and no circumstances having a tendency to raise the rate of profit occurred in the mean time  in england the ordinary rate of interest on government securities in which the risk is next to nothing may be estimated at a little more than three per cent in all other investments therefore the interest or profit calculated upon exclusively of what is properly a remuneration for talent or exertion must be as much more than this amount as is equivalent to the degree of risk to which the capital is thought to be exposed let us suppose that in england even so small a net profit as one per cent exclusive of insurance against risk would constitute a sufficient inducement to save but that less than this would not be a sufficient inducement i now say that the mere continuance of the present annual increase of capital if no circumstance occurred to counteract its effect would suffice in a small number of years to reduce the rate of net profit to one per cent  to fulfill the conditions of the hypothesis we must suppose an entire cessation of the exportation of capital for foreign investment we must suppose the entire savings of the community to be annually invested in really productive employment within the country itself and no new channels opened by industrial inventions or by a more extensive substitution of the bestknown processes for inferior ones  the difficulty in finding remunerative employment every year for so much new capital would not consist in any want of a market if the new capital were duly shared among many varieties of employment it would raise up a demand for its own produce and there would be no cause why any part of that produce should remain longer on hand than formerly what would really be not merely difficult but impossible would be to employ this capital without submitting to a rapid reduction of the rate of profit  as capital increased population either would also increase or it would not if it did not wages would rise and a greater capital would be distributed in wages among the same number of laborers there being no more labor than before and no improvements to render the labor more efficient there would not be any increase of the produce and as the capital however largely increased would only obtain the same gross return the whole savings of each year would be exactly so much subtracted from the profits of the next and of every following year                               illustration       this can be illustrated by supposing that the whole capital is     handed out to the producers in a vessel which is returned full at     the end of the period of production with the original outlay plus     an advance called profit b c represents the total outlay a c the     total produce and a b the profit on b c now since the     conditions of production remain the same the same number of     laborers can produce as before no more than a c even though in     the second year some of last year’s profit represented by d b is     saved and added to the outlay by the capitalist if d c is now the     outlay of capital the profit can only be a c minus d c or a d     that is the profit of the second year is diminished by d b     exactly the amount of savings of the year before and this would     be repeated each successive year each saving added to b c being     “exactly so much subtracted from the profits of the next and of     every following year”   it is hardly necessary to say that in such circumstances profits would very soon fall to the point at which further increase of capital would cease an augmentation of capital much more rapid than that of population must soon reach its extreme limit unless accompanied by increased efficiency of labor through inventions and discoveries or improved mental and physical education or unless some of the idle people or of the unproductive laborers became productive  if population did increase with the increase of capital and in proportion to it the fall of profits would still be inevitable increased population implies increased demand for agricultural produce in the absence of industrial improvements this demand can only be supplied at an increased cost of production either by cultivating worse land or by a more elaborate and costly cultivation of the land already under tillage the cost of the laborer’s subsistence is therefore increased and unless the laborer submits to a deterioration of his condition profits must fall in an old country like england if in addition to supposing all improvement in domestic agriculture suspended we suppose that there is no increased production in foreign countries for the english market the fall of profits would be very rapid if both these avenues to an increased supply of food were closed and population continued to increase as it is said to do at the rate of a thousand a day all waste land which admits of cultivation in the existing state of knowledge would soon be cultivated and the cost of production and price of food would be so increased that if the laborers received the increased money wages necessary to compensate for their increased expenses profits would very soon reach the minimum the fall of profits would be retarded if money wages did not rise or rose in a less degree but the margin which can be gained by a deterioration of the laborers’ condition is a very narrow one in general they can not bear much reduction when they can they have also a higher standard of necessary requirements and will not on the whole therefore we may assume that in such a country as england if the present annual amount of savings were to continue without any of the counteracting circumstances which now keep in check the natural influence of those savings in reducing profit the rate of profit would speedily attain the minimum and all further accumulation of capital would for the present cease       mr carey on the other hand asserts the existence of a law of     increasing returns from land and that while wages are constantly     increasing with the progress of society there is a diminution in     the rate of profit although the increasing returns permit an     increase of absolute if not of proportional profit that is     although wages increase more in proportion than profit there is     still a larger gross amount to be divided among capitalists as     profit out of a larger product    § 4 —prevented from reaching it by commercial revulsions   what then are these counteracting circumstances which in the existing state of things maintain a tolerably equal struggle against the downward tendency of profits and prevent the great annual savings which take place in this country from depressing the rate of profit much nearer to that lowest point to which it is always tending and which left to itself it would so promptly attain the resisting agencies are of several kinds  first among them is the waste of capital in periods of overtrading and rash speculation and in the commercial revulsions by which such times are always followed mines are opened railways or bridges made and many other works of uncertain profit commenced and in these enterprises much capital is sunk which yields either no return or none adequate to the outlay factories are built and machinery erected beyond what the market requires or can keep in employment even if they are kept in employment the capital is no less sunk it has been converted from circulating into fixed capital and has ceased to have any influence on wages or profits besides this there is a great unproductive consumption of capital during the stagnation which follows a period of general overtrading establishments are shut up or kept working without any profit such are the effects of a commercial revulsion and that such revulsions are almost periodical is a consequence of the very tendency of profits which we are considering by the time a few years have passed over without a crisis so much additional capital has been accumulated that it is no longer possible to invest it at the accustomed profit all public securities rise to a high price the rate of interest on the best mercantile security falls very low and the complaint is general among persons in business that no money is to be made but the diminished scale of all safe gains inclines persons to give a ready ear to any projects which hold out though at the risk of loss the hope of a higher rate of profit and speculations ensue which with the subsequent revulsions destroy or transfer to foreigners a considerable amount of capital produce a temporary rise of interest and profit make room for fresh accumulations and the same round is recommenced  this doubtless is one considerable cause which arrests profits in their descent to the minimum by sweeping away from time to time a part of the accumulated mass by which they are forced down but this is not as might be inferred from the language of some writers the principal cause if it were the capital of the country would not increase but in england it does increase greatly and rapidly this is shown by the increasing productiveness of almost all taxes by the continual growth of all the signs of national wealth and by the rapid increase of population while the condition of the laborers certainly is not on the whole declining301    § 5 —by improvements in production   this brings us to the second of the counteragencies namely improvements in production these evidently have the effect of extending what mr wakefield terms the field of employment that is they enable a greater amount of capital to be accumulated and employed without depressing the rate of profit provided always that they do not raise to a proportional extent the habits and requirements of the laborer if the laboringclass gain the full advantage of the increased cheapness in other words if money wages do not fall profits are not raised nor their fall retarded but if the laborers people up to the improvement in their condition and so relapse to their previous state profits will rise all inventions which cheapen any of the things consumed by the laborers unless their requirements are raised in an equivalent degree in time lower money wages and by doing so enable a greater capital to be accumulated and employed before profits fall back to what they were previously  improvements which only affect things consumed exclusively by the richer classes do not operate precisely in the same manner the cheapening of lace or velvet has no effect in diminishing the cost of labor and no mode can be pointed out in which it can raise the rate of profit so as to make room for a larger capital before the minimum is attained it however produces an effect which is virtually equivalent it lowers or tends to lower the minimum itself in the first place increased cheapness of articles of consumption promotes the inclination to save by affording to all consumers a surplus which they may lay by consistently with their accustomed manner of living in the next place whatever enables people to live equally well on a smaller income inclines them to lay by capital for a lower rate of profit if people can live on an independence of 1000 a year in the same manner as they formerly could on one of 2000 some persons will be induced to save in hopes of the one who would have been deterred by the more remote prospect of the other all improvements therefore in the production of almost any commodity tend in some degree to widen the interval which has to be passed before arriving at the stationary state    § 6 —by the importation of cheap necessaries and implements   equivalent in effect to improvements in production is the acquisition of any new power of obtaining cheap commodities from foreign countries if necessaries are cheapened whether they are so by improvements at home or importation from abroad is exactly the same thing to wages and profits unless the laborer obtains and by an improvement of his habitual standard keeps the whole benefit the cost of labor is lowered and the rate of profit raised as long as food can continue to be imported for an increasing population without any diminution of cheapness so long the declension of profits through the increase of population and capital is arrested and accumulation may go on without making the rate of profit draw nearer to the minimum and on this ground it is believed by some that the repeal of the corn laws has opened to england a long era of rapid increase of capital with an undiminished rate of profit  before inquiring whether this expectation is reasonable one remark must be made which is much at variance with commonly received notions foreign trade does not necessarily increase the field of employment for capital when foreign trade makes room for more capital at the same profit it is by enabling the necessaries of life or the habitual articles of the laborer’s consumption to be obtained at smaller cost it may do this in two ways by the importation either of those commodities themselves or of the means and appliances for producing them cheap iron has in a certain measure the same effect on profits and the cost of labor as cheap corn because cheap iron makes cheap tools for agriculture and cheap machinery for clothing but a foreign trade which neither directly nor by any indirect consequence increases the cheapness of anything consumed by the laborers does not any more than an invention or discovery in the like case tend to raise profits or retard their fall it merely substitutes the production of goods for foreign markets in the room of the home production of luxuries leaving the employment for capital neither greater nor less than before  it must of course be supposed that with the increase of capital population also increases for if it did not the consequent rise of wages would bring down profits in spite of any cheapness of food suppose then that the population of great britain goes on increasing at its present rate and demands every year a supply of imported food considerably beyond that of the year preceding this annual increase in the food demanded from the exporting countries can only be obtained either by great improvements in their agriculture or by the application of a great additional capital to the growth of food the former is likely to be a very slow process from the rudeness and ignorance of the agricultural classes in the foodexporting countries of europe while the british colonies and the united states are already in possession of most of the improvements yet made so far as suitable to their circumstances there remains as a resource the extension of cultivation and on this it is to be remarked that the capital by which any such extension can take place is mostly still to be created in poland russia hungary spain the increase of capital is extremely slow in america it is rapid but not more rapid than the population the principal fund at present available for supplying this country with a yearly increasing importation of food is that portion of the annual savings of america which has heretofore been applied to increasing the manufacturing establishments of the united states and which free trade in corn may possibly divert from that purpose to growing food for our market this limited source of supply unless great improvements take place in agriculture can not be expected to keep pace with the growing demand of so rapidly increasing a population as that of great britain and if our population and capital continue to increase with their present rapidity the only mode in which food can continue to be supplied cheaply to the one is by sending the other abroad to produce it  chart xvii graincrops of the united states  year   bushels 1865    1127499187 1866    1343027868 1867    1329729400 1868    1450789000 1869    1491412100 1870    1629027600

the     crops of late years with those just succeeding the war as seen in     chart no xvii shows a very suggestive increase since it     indicates where employment has been given to vast numbers of     laborers and where investment has been found for our rapidly     growing capital302    § 7 —by the emigration of capital   this brings us to the last of the counterforces which check the downward tendency of profits in a country whose capital increases faster than that of its neighbors and whose profits are therefore nearer to the minimum this is the perpetual overflow of capital into colonies or foreign countries to seek higher profits than can be obtained at home i believe this to have been for many years one of the principal causes by which the decline of profits in england has been arrested it has a twofold operation in the first place it does what a fire or an inundation or a commercial crisis would have done—it carries off a part of the increase of capital from which the reduction of profits proceeds secondly the capital so carried off is not lost but is chiefly employed either in founding colonies which become large exporters of cheap agricultural produce or in extending and perhaps improving the agriculture of older communities  in countries which are further advanced in industry and population and have therefore a lower rate of profit than others there is always long before the actual minimum is reached a practical minimum viz when profits have fallen so much below what they are elsewhere that were they to fall lower all further accumulations would go abroad as long as there are old countries where capital increases very rapidly and new countries where profit is still high profits in the old countries will not sink to the rate which would put a stop to accumulation the fall is stopped at the point which sends capital abroad     chapter iv consequences of the tendency of profits to a minimum and the stationary state    § 1 abstraction of capital not necessarily a national loss   the theory of the effect of accumulation on profits must greatly abate or rather altogether destroy in countries where profits are low the immense importance which used to be attached by political economists to the effects which an event or a measure of government might have in adding to or subtracting from the capital of the country we have now seen that the lowness of profits is a proof that the spirit of accumulation is so active and that the increase of capital has proceeded at so rapid a rate as to outstrip the two counteragencies improvements in production and increased supply of cheap necessaries from abroad a sudden abstraction of capital unless of inordinate amount would not have any real effect in impoverishing the country after a few months or years there would exist in the country just as much capital as if none had been taken away the abstraction by raising profits and interest would give a fresh stimulus to the accumulative principle which would speedily fill up the vacuum probably indeed the only effect that would ensue would be that for some time afterward less capital would be exported and less thrown away in hazardous speculation  in the first place then this view of things greatly weakens in a wealthy and industrious country the force of the economical argument against the expenditure of public money for really valuable even though industriously unproductive purposes in poor countries the capital of the country requires the legislator’s sedulous care he is bound to be most cautious of encroaching upon it and should favor to the utmost its accumulation at home and its introduction from abroad but in rich populous and highly cultivated countries it is not capital which is the deficient element but fertile land and what the legislator should desire and promote is not a greater aggregate saving but a greater return to savings either by improved cultivation or by access to the produce of more fertile lands in other parts of the globe  the same considerations enable us to throw aside as unworthy of regard one of the common arguments against emigration as a means of relief for the laboringclass emigration it is said can do no good to the laborers if in order to defray the cost as much must be taken away from the capital of the country as from its population if one tenth of the laboring people of england were transferred to the colonies and along with them one tenth of the circulating capital of the country either wages or profits or both would be greatly benefited by the diminished pressure of capital and population upon the fertility of the land the landlords alone would sustain some loss of income and even they only if colonization went to the length of actually diminishing capital and population but not if it merely carried off the annual increase    § 2 in opulent countries the extension of machinery not detrimental but beneficial to laborers   from the same principles we are now able to arrive at a final conclusion respecting the effects which machinery and generally the sinking of capital for a productive purpose produce upon the immediate and ultimate interests of the laboringclass the characteristic property of this class of industrial improvements is the conversion of circulating capital into fixed and it was shown in the first book303 that in a country where capital accumulates slowly the introduction of machinery permanent improvements of land and the like might be for the time extremely injurious since the capital so employed might be directly taken from the wages fund the subsistence of the people and the employment for labor curtailed and the gross annual produce of the country actually diminished but in a country of great annual savings and low profits no such effects need be apprehended it merely draws off at one orifice what was already flowing out at another or if not the greater vacant space left in the reservoir does but cause a greater quantity to flow in accordingly in spite of the mischievous derangements of the money market which have been occasioned by the great sums in process of being sunk in railways i can not agree with those who apprehend any mischief from this source to the productive resources of the country not on the absurd ground which to any one acquainted with the elements of the subject needs no confutation that railway expenditure is a mere transfer of capital from hand to hand by which nothing is lost or destroyed this is true of what is spent in the purchase of the land a portion too of what is paid to agents counsels engineers and surveyors is saved by those who receive it and becomes capital again but what is laid out in the bona fide construction of the railway itself is lost and gone when once expended it is incapable of ever being paid in wages or applied to the maintenance of laborers again as a matter of account the result is that so much food and clothing and tools have been consumed and the country has got a railway instead  it already appears from these considerations that the conversion of circulating capital into fixed whether by railways or manufactories or ships or machinery or canals or mines or works of drainage and irrigation is not likely in any rich country to diminish the gross produce or the amount of employment for labor there is hardly any increase of fixed capital which does not enable the country to contain eventually a larger circulating capital than it otherwise could possess and employ within its own limits for there is hardly any creation of fixed capital which when it proves successful does not cheapen the articles on which wages are habitually expended       as regards the effects upon the material condition of the     wagesreceiving class since it seems clear that capital increases     faster than improvements and probably faster even than     population it follows that in countries where the     laboringclasses are evidently growing in intelligence they gain     in wages with the progress of society such certainly seems to be     the teaching of mr giffen’s late studies see book iv chap iii     § 5    § 3 stationary state of wealth and population dreaded by some writers but not in itself undesirable   toward what ultimate point is society tending by its industrial progress when the progress ceases in what condition are we to expect that it will leave mankind  it must always have been seen more or less distinctly by political economists that the increase of wealth is not boundless that at the end of what they term the progressive state lies the stationary state that all progress in wealth is but a postponement of this and that each step in advance is an approach to it we have now been led to recognize that this ultimate goal is at all times near enough to be fully in view that we are always on the verge of it and that if we have not reached it long ago it is because the goal itself flies before us the richest and most prosperous countries would very soon attain the stationary state if no further improvements were made in the productive arts and if there were a suspension of the overflow of capital from those countries into the uncultivated or illcultivated regions of the earth adam smith always assumes that the condition of the mass of the people though it may not be positively distressed must be pinched and stinted in a stationary condition of wealth and can only be satisfactory in a progressive state the doctrine that to however distant a time incessant struggling may put off our doom the progress of society must “end in shallows and in miseries” far from being as many people still believe a wicked invention of mr malthus was either expressly or tacitly affirmed by his most distinguished predecessors and can only be successfully combated on his principles  even in a progressive state of capital in old countries a conscientious or prudential restraint on population is indispensable to prevent the increase of numbers from outstripping the increase of capital and the condition of the classes who are at the bottom of society from being deteriorated where there is not in the people or in some very large proportion of them a resolute resistance to this deterioration—a determination to preserve an established standard of comfort—the condition of the poorest class sinks even in a progressive state to the lowest point which they will consent to endure the same determination would be equally effectual to keep up their condition in the stationary state and would be quite as likely to exist  i can not therefore regard the stationary state of capital and wealth with the unaffected aversion so generally manifested toward it by political economists of the old school i am inclined to believe that it would be on the whole a very considerable improvement on our present condition  it is only in the backward countries of the world that increased production is still an important object in those most advanced what is economically needed is a better distribution of which one indispensable means is a stricter restraint on population on the other hand we may suppose this better distribution of property attained by the joint effect of the prudence and frugality of individuals and of a system of legislation favoring equality of fortunes so far as is consistent with the just claim of the individual to the fruits whether great or small of his or her own industry we may suppose for instance according to the suggestion thrown out in a former chapter304 a limitation of the sum which any one person may acquire by gift or inheritance to the amount sufficient to constitute a moderate independence under this twofold influence society would exhibit these leading features a wellpaid and affluent body of laborers no enormous fortunes except what were earned and accumulated during a single lifetime but a much larger body of persons than at present not only exempt from the coarser toils but with sufficient leisure both physical and mental from mechanical details to cultivate freely the graces of life and afford examples of them to the classes less favorably circumstanced for their growth this condition of society so greatly preferable to the present is not only perfectly compatible with the stationary state but it would seem more naturally allied with that state than with any other  there is room in the world no doubt and even in old countries for a great increase of population supposing the arts of life to go on improving and capital to increase but even if innocuous i confess i see very little reason for desiring it the density of population necessary to enable mankind to obtain in the greatest degree all the advantages both of cooperation and of social intercourse has in all the most populous countries been attained if the earth must lose that great portion of its pleasantness which it owes to things that the unlimited increase of wealth and population would extirpate from it for the mere purpose of enabling it to support a larger but not a better or a happier population i sincerely hope for the sake of posterity that they will be content to be stationary long before necessity compels them to it  it is scarcely necessary to remark that a stationary condition of capital and population implies no stationary state of human improvement even the industrial arts might be as earnestly and as successfully cultivated with this sole difference that instead of serving no purpose but the increase of wealth industrial improvements would produce their legitimate effect that of abridging labor hitherto it is questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the day’s toil of any human being they have enabled a greater population to live the same life of drudgery and imprisonment and an increased number of manufacturers and others to make fortunes they have increased the comforts of the middle classes       the statement that inventions have not “lightened the day’s toil     of any human being” has been persistently misquoted by many     persons and has been taken out of its connection mr mill     distinctly holds that the laborer’s lot could have been improved     had there been any limitation of population that it is the     constant growth of population as society progresses which destroys     the gains afforded to the laboringclasses by improvements but it     is quite certain that the material facts of mr mill’s statement     are no longer true in the united states wages have risen with an     additional gain in lower prices and mr giffen shows the same     progress in england moreover travelers on the continent speak of     a similar movement already noticeable there mr giffen’s     statement in his comparison305 with fifty years ago is as     follows      “while the money wages have increased as we have seen the hours     of labor have diminished it is difficult to estimate what the     extent of this diminution has been but collecting one or two     scattered notices i should be inclined to say very nearly 20 per     cent there has been at least this reduction in the textile     engineering and housebuilding trades the workman gets from 50     to 100 per cent more money for 20 per cent less work in round     figures he has gained from 70 to 120 per cent in fifty years in     money return it is just possible of course that the workman may     do as much or nearly as much in the shorter period as he did in     his longer hours still there is the positive gain in his being     less time at his task which many of the classes still tugging     lengthily day by day at the oar would appreciate”     chapter v on the possible futurity of the laboringclasses    § 1 the possibility of improvement while laborers remain merely receivers of wages       there has probably never been a time when more attention has been     called to the material and social conditions of the     workingclasses than in the last few years the great increase of     literature and the extension of the newspaper has brought to every     reader even where public and private charities have not sent     eyewitnesses into direct contact with distress a more explicit     knowledge of the workingclasses than ever before the revelation     of existing poverty and misery is often wrongly taken to be a     proof of the increasing degradation of the workingmen and the     cause has been ascribed to the grasping cruelty of capitalists     instances of injustice arising from the relations of employers and     employed will occur so long as human nature remains imperfect but     the world hopes that some other relation than that of master and     workman may be evolved in which not only many admitted wrongs may     be avoided but also new forces may be applied to raise the     laborer out of his dependence on other classes in the community      we are at present living under a régime of private property     and competition but certainly the progress of the laborer is not     that which can excite enthusiastic hopes for the future so long     as he remains a mere receiver of wages the progress of industrial     improvements has resulted says mr cairnes in “a temporary     improvement of the laborer’s condition followed by an increase of     population and an enlarged demand for the cheapened commodity     laborers’ commodities however are for the most part commodities     of raw produce or in which the raw material constitutes the chief     element of the value clothing is in truth the only important     exception and of all such commodities it is the wellknown law     that an augmentation of quantity can only be obtained other     things being the same at an increasing proportional cost thus     it has happened that the gain in productiveness obtained by     improved processes has after a generation to a great extent been     lost—lost that is to say for any benefit that can be derived     from it in favor of wages and profits the large addition to     the wealth of the country has gone neither to profits nor to     wages nor yet to the public at large as consumers but to swell     a fund ever growing even while its proprietors sleep—the rentroll     of the owners of the soil the aggregate return from the land     has immensely increased but the cost of the costliest portion of     the produce which is that which determines the price of the     whole remains pretty nearly as it was profits therefore have     not risen at all and the real remuneration of the laborer taking     the whole field of labor in but a slight degree—at all events in     a degree very far from commensurate with the general progress of     industry”306      under these conditions it seems that the only hope of an     improvement for the laboringclasses lies in the limitation of     population—or at least in an increase of numbers less than the     increase of capital and improvements it is possible however     that mr cairnes with many others has failed to recognize the     full extent of the improvement which is taking place in the wages     of the laborer under the existing social order although we hear     much of the wrongs of the workingmen—and they no doubt exist—yet     it is unquestionable that their condition has vastly improved     within the last fifty years largely in my opinion because     improvements have outstripped population and because wide areas     of fertile land in new and peaceful countries have drawn off the     surplus population in the older countries and because the     available spots in the newer countries like the united states have     not yet been covered over with a population sufficiently dense to     keep real wages anything below a relatively high standard the     facts to substantiate this opinion so far as regards great     britain are to be found in a recent investigation307 by mr     giffen the statistician of the english board of trade for a very     considerable reduction in hours of daily labor the workman now     receives wages on an average about 70 per cent higher than fifty     years ago as may be seen by the following table   occupation       place            wages        wages

 with increased wages prices are not much higher than fifty years     ago but the clearest evidence as to their bettered material     condition is to be found in the following table which shows the     amount of food consumed per head by the total population of great     britain      articles              1840   1881     bacon and hams        001    1393     pounds     butter pounds        105

191312      the question then at once arises whether capital has been shown     by the statistics to have gained accordingly or whether there has     been a proportionally less increase than in wages says mr     giffen “if the return to capital had doubled as the wages of the     workingclasses appear to have doubled the aggregate income of     the capitalist classes returned to the incometax would now be     £800000000 instead of £400000000 the capitalist as such     gets a low interest for his money and the aggregate returns to     capital is not a third part of the aggregate income of the     country which may be put at not less than £1200000000” it is     found moreover—as a suggestion that property is more generally     diffused—that while there were 25368 estates entered to probate     in 1838 of an average value of £2160 each there were 55359     estates in 1882 of an average value of £2500 each      but yet the vast increase of wealth made possible by improvements     and the growth of capital would have bettered the condition of all     still more had population been somewhat more limited as it is     the material gain has been large in spite of an increase in the     population from 16500000 in 1831 to nearly 30000000 in 1881     in other words the landlords have been great gainers while the     laborers have intercepted much more than mr cairnes supposed      there are at hand some very striking data relating to the united     states which point in the same direction as those of mr giffen     charts no xix and xx show vividly how far the increased     productiveness of an industry arising from greater skill and     greater efficiency of labor in the connection of improved     machinery has enabled manufacturers to steadily lower the price     of their goods and yet increase the wages paid to their     operatives what was true of these two cottonmills was true of     others within new england for the rate of wages paid by these     mills was the rate current in the country in 1830 and in 1884     while each spindle and loom has become vastly more effective we     see by chart no xix that the average production of each operative     constantly increased from 4321 yards per year in 1830 to 28032     yards in 1884 and this it was which made possible the     corresponding increase in the rate of wages from 164 in 1830 to     290 in 1884 the sum of 290 a year as an average for each     operative is a stipend too small to cause any general     satisfaction but he must be gloomy indeed who does not see that     290 is a cheerful possession as compared with 164 there is     then abundant ground for believing that in the past fifty years     the condition of the workingclasses in the united states has been     materially improved the diminishing proportion of the price which     goes to the capital is a significant fact and illustrates the     tendency of profits to fall with the increase of capital313 the     same truth seems to be seen in the table given in a previous     chapter314 where the wages have been increased but the hours     have fallen per day from thirteen to eleven since 1840    § 2—through small holdings by which the landlord’s gain is shared       so far we have considered the chances for improvement in an     industrial order in which the present separation of capitalists     from laborers is maintained but this does not take into account     that future time when cultivation in the united states shall be     forced down upon inferior land and no more remains to be     occupied and when capital may no longer increase as fast as     population what must be the ultimate outlook for wagesreceivers     or more practically what is the outlook now for those who are     wagesreceivers and for whom a more equitable distribution of the     product seems desirable how can they escape the thralldom of     dependence on the accumulations of others      in this connection and of primary importance is the avenue     opened to all holders of small properties to share in the increase     which goes to owners of land it has been seen that owners of the     soil constantly gain from the inevitable tendencies of industrial     progress if one large owner gains why should not the increment     be the same if ten owners held the property instead of one the     more the land is subdivided the more the vast increase arising     from rent will be shared by a larger number this in my opinion     is the strongest reason for the encouragement of small holdings in     every country the greater the extension of small properties among     the workingclass the more will they gain a share of that part of     the product which goes to the owner of land by the persistent     increase of population if then the gain arising from     improvements is largely passed to the credit of landowners as     mr cairnes believes it should be absolutely necessary to spread     among the workingclasses the doctrine that if they own their own     homes and buy the land they live on to that extent will they     “grow rich while they sleep” independently of their other     exertions land worth 500 today when bought by the savings of a     laborer besides the selfrespect315 it gives him will increase     in value with the density of population and become worth 600 or     more without other sacrifice of his    § 3 —through cooperation by which the manager’s wages are shared       it will be found however that of the various industrial     rewards profits tend to diminish meaning by “profits” only the     interest and insurance given for abstinence and risk in the use of     capital but that the manager’s wages wages of superintendence     are larger than is commonly supposed in relation to other     industrial rewards owing to the position of monopoly practically     held by such executive ability as is competent to successfully     manage large business interests to the laborer this large payment     to the manager seems to be paid for the possession of capital     this we now know to be wrong the manager’s wages are payments of     exactly the same nature as any laborer’s wages it makes no     difference whether wages are paid for manual or mental labor the     payment to capital purely as such known as interest with     insurance for risk is unmistakably decreasing even in the     united states and yet we see men gain by industrial operations     enormous rewards but these returns are in their essence solely     manager’s wages for in many instances as hitherto discussed we     have seen that the manager is not the owner of the capital he     employs to what does this lead us inevitably to the conclusion     that the laborer if he would become something more than a     receiver of wages in the ordinary sense must himself move up in     the scale of laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to     command manager’s wages the importance of this principle to the     workingman can not be exaggerated and there flows from it     important consequences to the whole social condition of the lower     classes it leads us directly to the means by which the lower     classes may raise themselves to a higher position—the actual     details of which of course are difficult but as they are not     included in political economy they must be left to sociology—and     forms the essential basis of hope for any proper extension of     productive cooperation in short cooperation owes its existence     to the possibility of dividing the manager’s wages to a greater     or less degree among the socalled wagesreceivers or the     “laboringclass” and it is from this point of view that     cooperation is seen more truly and fitly than in any other way     for it is to be said that in some of its forms cooperation gives     the most promising economic results as regards the condition of     the laborer which have yet been reached in the long discussion     upon the relations of labor and capital    § 4  distributive cooperation       it will be my object then to describe the chief forms in which     the cooperative principle has manifested itself these may be     said in general to be four 1 distributive cooperation by     which goods already produced are bought and sold to members     without the aid of retail dealers 2 productive cooperation by     which associations are formed for producing and manufacturing     goods for the market 3 partial productive cooperation in the     form of industrial partnerships between laborers and employers     without dispensing with the latter and 4 cooperative or     people’s banks there are of course many other forms in which     the principle of cooperation has been applied but these four are     probably the most characteristic      distributive cooperation is at once the simplest and the most     successful form not merely because it requires less for capital     than any other for its inception but also because it calls for     less business and executive capacity the number of persons     capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than     the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties     involved in the care of wholesale houses—or at all events of     mills and factories distributive cooperation has its origin in     the fact that the expenses of a middleman between the producer     and consumer may be entirely dispensed with and in the fact that     more capital had collected in the business of distribution than     could economically be so employed its educating power on the men     concerned in teaching them to save in showing the need of     business methods and in instilling the elements of industrial     management is of no little importance it is therefore the best     gateway to any further or more difficult cooperative     experiments—such experiments as can be attempted only after the     proper capital is saved and the necessary executive capacity is     discovered or developed by training in england cooperation     began its history in distributive stores and has finally led to     such a stimulus of selfhelp in the laborer that now cooperative     gymnasiums libraries gardens and other results have proved the     wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions under     the system which separates employers and the employed high wages     are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish     for it is sometimes found that the bestpaid workmen are the most     unwise and intemperate316 for the most ignorant and unskilled     of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to     give not merely more wages but give more in such a way as might     excite new and better motives a desire as well as a possibility     of improvement selfhelp must be stimulated not deadened by     stifling dependence on a class of superiors or on the state the     extraordinary growth of cooperation is one of the most cheering     signs of modern times distributive cooperation originated in     rochdale in england about 1844 with a few laborers desirous of     saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions     by uniting they purchased tea by the chest sugar by the     hogshead which they sold to each member at market prices they     were surprised to find a large profit by the operation which they     divided proportionally to the capital subscribed others soon     joined them they took a storeroom and in 1882 there were 10894     members with a share capital of 1576215 and with realized     profits in that year of 162885 they have erected expensive     steam flourmills and the society occupies eighteen branch     establishments in rochdale libraries containing more than 15000     volumes and classes in science language and the technical arts     attended by 500 students have been maintained the extension of     the rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale     establishment of their own it is now a large institution with     branches in london and newcastle “it owns manufactories in     london manchester newcastle leicester durham and crumpsall     and it has depots in cork limerick kilmallock waterford     tipperary tralee and armagh for the purchase of butter     potatoes and eggs it has buyers in new york and copenhagen and     it owns two steamships it has a banking department with a     turnover of more than £12000000 annually”317      the following figures for england and wales tell their own story     as to the progress of cooperation318                          1862       1881     number of members   90000      525000     capital share      428000     5881000     capital loan       55000      1267000     sales               2333000   20901000     net profit          165000     1617000      several persons each subscribe a sum to make up the share capital     of a store and a person is selected to take charge of the     purchase and care of the goods the advantages of the plan are     1 a division among the cooperators of all the net profits of     the retail trade 2 a saving in advertisements since members     are always purchasers without solicitation 3 no loss by bad     debts since only cash sales are permitted and 4 security     against fraud as to the character of the goods because there is     no inducement to make gains by adulterations it is often found     that the capital is turned over ten times in the course of a year     while the cost of management in the wholesale rochdale stores does     not amount to one per cent on the returns      the arrangement of obligations in due order of their priority     which has been recommended by mr holyoake319 is as follows of     funds in the store payment should be made 1 of the expenses of     management 2 of interest due on all loans 3 of an amount     equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the fixed stock to     cover the annual depreciation from wear and tear 4 of dividends     on the subscribed capital of the members320 5 of such a sum     as may be necessary for an extension of the business 6 of two     and a half per cent of the remaining profit after all the above     items are provided for for educational purposes 7 of the     residue and that only among all the persons employed and     members of the store in proportion to the amount of their wages     or of their respective purchases during the quarter321 the     payment of dividends to customers on their purchases seems now to     be considered an essential element of success    § 5 productive cooperation       productive cooperation presents many serious difficulties the     chief of which is the need of managing ability some one in the     association must know the wholesale markets well the expectation     of crops connected with his materials used the proper time to     buy he must know the processes of the special production     thoroughly the best machinery the best adaptation of labor to     the given end he must know the whims of purchasers and be ready     to change his products accordingly—in short a man eminently     fitted for success in his own factory is essential to the     profitable management of one belonging to a body of cooperators     it has been already seen how large a variation in profit is due to     manager’s wages and it is very often only his skill prudence     and experience that make the difference between a failure and a     success in business unless cooperators are willing to pay as     large a sum for the services of a good manager as he could get in     his own establishment they can not secure the talent which will     make their venture succeed322      in france the national workshops of louis blanc established in     1848 were a failure nowhere has it been more clearly seen that     state help has been disastrous than in france where the     constituent assembly voted 3000000 francs for cooperative     experiments all of which failed curiously enough distributive     cooperation has not succeeded in france because owing to a     widespread dislike of the wages system workmen will try nothing     less than productive schemes and their success in this has been     no greater than might be expected when inexperience is put to a     task beyond its powers323      in great britain and the united states there have been some     successful experiments in production and mr holyoake324 holds     that although workmen certainly do begrudge the manager’s salary     productive associations are possible when managed by a board of     elected directors he urges moreover that as in distributive     cooperation if profits are shared with customers there will be     insured both popularity and continuity of custom without the cost     of advertising and such expenses as those of travelers and     commissions the plan of actual operations upon which successes     have been reached in england seems to be briefly this 1 to save     capital chiefly through cooperative associations 2 to     purchase or lease premises 3 to engage managers accountants     and officers at the ordinary salaries which such men can command     in the market according to their ability 4 to borrow capital on     the credit of the association 5 to pay upon capital subscribed     by members the same rate of interest as that upon borrowed     capital 6 to regard as profit only that which remains after     making payment for rent materials wages all business outlays     and interest on capital and 7 to divide the profits according     to the salaries of all officers wages of workmen and purchases     of customers those mills and factories which have sprung out of     the extension of distributive associations as at rochdale seem     and naturally so to have been most successful they have     gradually trained themselves somewhat for the work and their     customers were beforehand secured that is where the difficulties     of the manager’s function have been lessened they have a better     chance of success and yet it must be said that productive     associations will gain largely from the efficiency of the labor     when working for its own interest and this is an important     consideration to be urged in favor of such associations      the sun mill325 at oldham england was established for     spinning cotton in 1861 by the exertions of some cooperative     bodies beginning with a share capital of 250000 and a loan     capital of a like amount it set 80000 spindles in operation in     1874 they had a share capital of 375000 all subscribed except     1000 and an equal amount of loan capital while the whole     plant was estimated as worth 615000 two and a half per cent per     annum has been set apart for the depreciation in the value of the     mill and seven and a half per cent for the machinery so that in     the first ten years a total sum of 160000 was set aside for     depreciation of the property the profits have varied from two to     forty per cent and while only five per cent interest was paid on     the loan capital large dividends were made on the share capital     during the last few years the sun mill has on an average realized     a profit of 12½ per cent although it is known that the cotton     trade has suffered during this time from a serious depression      many experiments however have proved failures and sometimes     when they are successful as in the case of the hatters’     association in newark new jersey326 the workmen have no     desire to share their benefits with others and practically form a     corporation by themselves the mere fact that they do sometimes     succeed is an important thing then too they have an opportunity     of securing by salaries that executive ability in the community     which exists separate from the possession of capital and in these     days in large corporations the manager is not necessarily     although he often is a large owner of capital the last annual     report of the cooperative congress 1882 shows the existence in     england and scotland of productive associations for the     manufacture of cloth flannel fustian hosiery quilts worsted     nails watches linen and silk as well as those for engineering     printing and quarrying and these were but a few of them327      in the united states there have been some successes as well as     failures in january 1872 a number of machinists and other     workingmen organized in the town of beaver falls pennsylvania a     cooperative foundry association for the manufacture of stoves     hollowware and fine castings on a small capital of only 4000     they have steadily prospered paid the market rate of wages and     also paid annual dividends over and above all expenses and     interest on the plant of from twelve to fifteen per cent in 1867     thirty workmen started a cooperative foundry in somerset     massachusetts with a capital of about 14000 in the years     18741875 the company spent 5400 for new flasks and patterns     and yet showed a net gain of 11914 in 1876 it had a capital of     30000 and a surplus fund of 28924328    § 6 industrial partnership       the difficulties of productive cooperation arising from the need     of skilled management together with the existing unsatisfactory     relation between employers and laborers when wholly separate from     each other have led to a most promising plan of industrial     partnership by which the manager retains the control of the     business operations but shares his profits with the workmen the     gain through increased efficiency greater economy and superior     workmanship recoups the manager for the voluntary subtraction     from his share and yet the laborers receive an additional share     but more than this it educates the laborer in industrial methods     discloses the difficulties of management and stimulates him to     saving habits and greater regularity of work this system is     particularly adapted to reaching those laborers who would not     themselves rise to the demands of productive cooperation      the principle was tried on one of the belgian railways     “ninetyfive kilogrammes of coke were consumed for every league of     distance run but this was known to be more than necessary but     how to remedy the evil was the problem a bonus of 3½d on     every hectolitre of coke saved on this average of ninetyfive to     the league was offered to the men concerned and this trifling     bonus worked the miracle the work was done equally well or     better with fortyeight kilogrammes of coke instead of     ninetyfive just one half or nearly saved by careful work at     an expense of probably less than one tenth of the saving”329      the experiment which has attracted most attention in the past has     been that of the messrs briggs at their collieries in yorkshire     england330 the relations between the owners and the laborers     were as bad as they could well be “all coalmasters is devils     and briggs is the prince of devils” ran the talk of the miners     when they did not choose to send letters threatening to shoot the     owners in 1865 messrs briggs tried the plan of an industrial     partnership with their men purely from business considerations     seventy per cent of the cost of raising coal consisted of wages     and fully fifteen per cent of materials which were habitually     wasted the whole property was valued and divided into shares of     50 each of which the owners retained two thirds together with     the control of the business the remaining one third of the shares     was offered to the employés if any subscriber was too poor to pay     50 for a share the subsequent dividends and payments were to be     applied to purchasing the share after reserving a fair allowance     for expenses like the redemption of capital whenever the     remaining profits exceeded ten per cent on the capital that     excess was to be divided into two equal parts one of which was to     be distributed among all persons employed by the company in     proportion to their wages and the other was to be retained by the     capital in previous years but once had they made ten per cent     profit on their capital and twice only five per cent in the     first year after the new system came into operation the total     profits were fourteen per cent and the four per cent of excess     was divided two to the laborers’ bonus and two to the capital     so that capital received twelve per cent in the second year the     profits were sixteen per cent in the third year seventeen per     cent the first year the workpeople received in addition to their     wages 9000 in the second 13500 in the third 15750 the     moral effect was striking work was done regularly forbearance     was exercised habits improved and the faces of the men were set     toward improvement in life the scheme worked successfully for     years but was finally ended by the pressure of the outside     tradesunions who compelled the workmen to give up the     arrangement      a similar experiment was tried by the messrs brewster     carriagemanufacturers of new york they offered to their workmen     ten per cent of their profits before any allowance was made for     interest on the capital invested or before any payment was made     for the services of the firm as managers in one year as much as     11000 was divided among the laborers again as in the case of     the briggs colliery the experiment was brought to an end by an     unreasoning submission to the pressure of outside workmen during a     strike331      but all in all industrial partnership332 offers a great field     for that kind of improvement which is worth more than a mere     increase of wages and seems to make it possible to reach the     heavy weight of sluggishness among the lower and more hopeless     strata of society and it is possible that it will stir in them     the powers which may afterward find employment in the harder     problems of productive cooperation333    § 7 people’s banks       in germany the struggle between the two theories—selfhelp and     statehelp—was fought out by schultzedelitsch—that is schultze     of delitsch a town in saxony—and lasalle and the victory given     to the former schultzedelitsch as a consequence was successful     in directing the cooperative principle in germany to giving     workmen credit in purchasing tools etc when he had no security     but his character this form of cooperation works to give the     energetic and industrious workmen a lever by which through the     possession of credit they can raise themselves to the position of     small capitalists and thus widen the field of possible     improvement while the former schemes of cooperation described     above have given the wagesreceivers a share of the unearned     increment from land and tend to give them a share of the     manager’s wages the plan of schultze was to assist them to gain a     share in the advantages belonging to the possession of capital     the capital was to be accumulated by their own exertions and in     his scheme depended on the principle of selfhelp the following     is the plan of banks adopted      “every member is obliged to make a certain weekly payment into the     common stock as soon as it reaches a certain sum he is allowed to     raise a loan exceeding his share in the inverse ratio of the     amount of his deposit for instance after he has deposited one     dollar he is allowed to borrow five or six but if he had     deposited twenty dollars he is allowed only to borrow thirty the     security he is compelled to offer is his own and that of two other     members of the association who become jointly and severally     liable he may have no assets whatever beyond the amount of his     deposits nor may his guarantors the bank relies simply on the     character of the three and the two securities rely on the     character of their principal and the remarkable fact is that the     security has been found sufficient that the interest of the men     in the institutions and the fear of the opinion of their fellows     has produced a display of honesty and punctuality such as perhaps     is not to be found in the history of any other banking     institutions such is the confidence inspired by these     institutions that they hold on deposit or as loans from third     parties an amount exceeding by more than three fourths the total     amount of their own capital the monthly contributions of the     members may be as low as ten cents but the amount which each     member is allowed to have in some banks is not more than seven or     eight dollars in none more than three hundred dollars he has a     right to borrow to the full amount of his deposit without giving     security if he desires to borrow a larger sum he must furnish     security in the manner we have described the liability of the     members is unlimited the plan of limiting the liability to the     amount of the capital deposited was tried at first but it     inspired no confidence and the enterprise did not succeed till     every member was made generally liable each member on entering     is obliged to pay a small fee which goes toward forming or     maintaining a reserve fund apart from the active capital the     profits are derived from the interest paid by borrowers which     amounts to from eight to ten per cent which may not sound very     large in our ears but in germany is very high not over five per     cent is paid on capital borrowed from outsiders all profits are     distributed in dividends among the members of the association in     the proportion of the amount of their deposits—after the payment     of the expenses of management of course—and the apportionment of     a certain percentage to the reservefund every member as we have     said has a right to borrow to the extent of his deposit without     security but then if he seeks to borrow more whether he shall     obtain any loan and if so how large a one is decided by the     board of management who are guided in making their decision just     as all bank officers are—by a consideration of the circumstances     of the bank as well as those of the borrower all the affairs of     the association are discussed and decided in the last resort by a     general assembly composed of all the members”334 the main part     of the capital loaned by the banks is obtained from outside     sources on the credit of the associations in 1865 there were 961     of these institutions in germany in 1877 there were 1827 with     over 1000000 members owning 40000000 of capital with     100000000 more on loan and doing a business of     550000000335      book v on the influence of government     chapter i on the general principles of taxation    § 1 four fundamental rules of taxation   one of the most disputed questions both in political science and in practical statesmanship at this particular period relates to the proper limits of the functions and agency of governments  we shall first consider the economical effects arising from the manner in which governments perform their necessary and acknowledged functions  we shall then pass to certain governmental interferences of what i have termed the optional kind ie overstepping the boundaries of the universally acknowledged functions which have heretofore taken place and in some cases still take place under the influence of false general theories  the first of these divisions is of an extremely miscellaneous character since the necessary functions of government and those which are so manifestly expedient that they have never or very rarely been objected to are too various to be brought under any very simple classification we commence under the first head with the theory of taxation  the qualities desirable economically speaking in a system of taxation have been embodied by adam smith in four maxims or principles which having been generally concurred in by subsequent writers may be said to have become classical and this chapter can not be better commenced than by quoting them336  “1 the subjects of every state ought to contribute to the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state in the observation or neglect of this maxim consists what is called the equality or inequality of taxation  “2 the tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to be certain and not arbitrary the time of payment the manner of payment the quantity to be paid ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor and to every other person the certainty of what each individual ought to pay is in taxation a matter of so great importance that a very considerable degree of inequality it appears i believe from the experience of all nations is not near so great an evil as a very small degree of uncertainty  “3 every tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner in which it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it taxes upon such consumable goods as are articles of luxury are all finally paid by the consumer and generally in a manner that is very convenient to him he pays them little by little as he has occasion to buy the goods as he is at liberty too either to buy or not to buy as he pleases it must be his own fault if he ever suffers any considerable inconvenience from such taxes  “4 every tax ought to be so contrived as both to take out and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little as possible over and above what it brings into the public treasury of the state a tax may either take out or keep out of the pockets of the people a great deal more than it brings into the public treasury in the four following ways first the levying of it may require a great number of officers whose salaries may eat up the greater part of the produce of the tax and whose perquisites may impose another additional tax upon the people” secondly it may divert a portion of the labor and capital of the community from a more to a less productive employment “thirdly by the forfeitures and other penalties which those unfortunate individuals incur who attempt unsuccessfully to evade the tax it may frequently ruin them and thereby put an end to the benefit which the community might have derived from the employment of their capitals an injudicious tax offers a great temptation to smuggling fourthly by subjecting the people to the frequent visits and the odious examination of the taxgatherers it may expose them to much unnecessary trouble vexation and oppression” to which may be added that the restrictive regulations to which trades and manufactures are often subjected to prevent evasion of a tax are not only in themselves troublesome and expensive but often oppose insuperable obstacles to making improvements in the processes    § 2 grounds of the principle of equality of taxation   the first of the four points equality of taxation requires to be more fully examined being a thing often imperfectly understood and on which many false notions have become to a certain degree accredited through the absence of any definite principles of judgment in the popular mind  for what reason ought equality to be the rule in matters of taxation for the reason that it ought to be so in all affairs of government a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it if any one bears less than his fair share of the burden some other person must suffer more than his share equality of taxation therefore as a maxim of politics means equality of sacrifice it means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his there are persons however who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received in the shape of service to himself and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives on an accurate calculation twice as much protection and ought on the principles of bargain and sale to pay twice as much for it since however the assumption that government exists solely for the protection of property is not one to be deliberately adhered to some consistent adherents of the quid pro quo principle go on to observe that protection being required for persons as well as property and everybody’s person receiving the same amount of protection a polltax of a fixed sum per head is a proper equivalent for this part of the benefits of government while the remaining part protection to property should be paid for in proportion to property but in the first place it is not admissible that the protection of persons and that of property are the sole purposes of government in the second place the practice of setting definite values on things essentially indefinite and making them a ground of practical conclusions is peculiarly fertile in the false views of social questions it can not be admitted that to be protected in the ownership of ten times as much property is to be ten times as much protected if we wanted to estimate the degrees of benefit which different persons derive from the protection of government we should have to consider who would suffer most if that protection were withdrawn to which question if any answer could be made it must be that those would suffer most who were weakest in mind or body either by nature or by position    § 3 should the same percentage be levied on all amounts of income   setting out then from the maxim that equal sacrifices ought to be demanded from all we have next to inquire whether this is in fact done by making each contribute the same percentage on his pecuniary means many persons maintain the negative saying that a tenth part taken from a small income is a heavier burden than the same fraction deducted from one much larger and on this is grounded the very popular scheme of what is called a graduated propertytax viz an incometax in which the percentage rises with the amount of the income  on the best consideration i am able to give to this question it appears to me that the portion of truth which the doctrine contains arises principally from the difference between a tax which can be saved from luxuries and one which trenches in ever so small a degree upon the necessaries of life to take a thousand a year from the possessor of ten thousand would not deprive him of anything really conducive either to the support or to the comfort of existence and if such would be the effect of taking five pounds from one whose income is fifty the sacrifice required from the last is not only greater than but entirely incommensurable with that imposed upon the first the mode of adjusting these inequalities of pressure which seems to be the most equitable is that recommended by bentham of leaving a certain minimum of income sufficient to provide the necessaries of life untaxed suppose 250 a year to be sufficient to provide the number of persons ordinarily supported from a single income with the requisites of life and health and with protection against habitual bodily suffering but not with any indulgence this then should be made the minimum and incomes exceeding it should pay taxes not upon their whole amount but upon the surplus if the tax be ten per cent an income of 300 should be considered as a net income of 50 and charged with 5 a year while an income of 5000 should be charged as one of 4750 an income not exceeding 250 should not be taxed at all either directly or by taxes on necessaries for as by supposition this is the smallest income which labor ought to be able to command the government ought not to be a party to making it smaller  both in england and on the continent a graduated propertytax l’impôt progressif has been advocated on the avowed ground that the state should use the instrument of taxation as a means of mitigating the inequalities of wealth i am as desirous as any one that means should be taken to diminish those inequalities but not so as to relieve the prodigal at the expense of the prudent to tax the larger incomes at a higher percentage than the smaller is to lay a tax on industry and economy to impose a penalty on people for having worked harder and saved more than their neighbors it is not the fortunes which are earned but those which are unearned that it is for the public good to place under limitation with respect to the large fortunes acquired by gift or inheritance the power of bequeathing is one of those privileges of property which are fit subjects for regulation on grounds of general expediency and i have already suggested337 as the most eligible mode of restraining the accumulation of large fortunes in the hands of those who have not earned them by exertion a limitation of the amount which any one person should be permitted to acquire by gift bequest or inheritance i conceive that inheritances and legacies exceeding a certain amount are highly proper subjects for taxation and that the revenue from them should be as great as it can be made without giving rise to evasions by donation inter vivos or concealment of property such as it would be impossible adequately to check the principle of graduation as it is called that is of levying a larger percentage on a larger sum though its application to general taxation would be in my opinion objectionable seems to me both just and expedient as applied to legacy and inheritance duties  the objection to a graduated propertytax applies in an aggravated degree to the proposition of an exclusive tax on what is called “realized property” that is property not forming a part of any capital engaged in business or rather in business under the superintendence of the owner as land the public funds money lent on mortgage and shares in stock companies except the proposal of applying a sponge to the national debt no such palpable violation of common honesty has found sufficient support in this country during the present generation to be regarded as within the domain of discussion it has not the palliation of a graduated propertytax that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it for “realized property” includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work and consists in great part of extremely small fractions i can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country that of merchants manufacturers farmers and shopkeepers should be exempted from its share of taxation that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether but even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition the burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on as land and those particular securities would thenceforth yield a smaller net income relatively to the general interest of capital and to the profits of trade the balance would rectify itself by a permanent depreciation of those kinds of property future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax which tax they would therefore escape from paying while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the feesimple of the tax its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax       the above proposition has been extended by those in the united     states who appeal to class prejudice to a proposal to tax the     incomes of those who hold government bonds it so happened that     for example the six dollars income on a onehundreddollar bond     of the united states was not in the war period deemed a     sufficient equivalent for the risk of loaning one hundred dollars     to the state and congress therefore agreed to relieve them of     taxation it is the same thing to a lender if he receive six per     cent directly from the government or if he receive seven per     cent and is obliged to pay back one per cent to the treasury in     the form of taxation but to the government it is another thing     because if it sell a taxed bond at seven per cent interest it     does not receive back the whole of the one per cent tax but the     one per cent tax less the expense of levying it in other words     the government in the latter case pays six per cent interest     plus the cost of levying the tax and consequently borrowed more     cheaply in the form of an untaxed bond as was the hope when the     provision was made if then a tax were now to be put upon the     bonds it would fall exclusively on the present holders of them     for since it diminishes the net income from the bond it lowers     the selling price of the bond itself as before explained338    § 4 should the same percentage be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes   whether the profits of trade may not rightfully be taxed at a lower rate than incomes derived from interest or rent is part of the more comprehensive question whether lifeincomes should be subjected to the same rate of taxation as perpetual incomes whether salaries for example or annuities or the gains of professions should pay the same percentage as the income from inheritable property  the existing tax in england treats all kinds of incomes exactly alike339 taking its fivepence in the pound as well from the person whose income dies with him as from the landholder stockholder or mortgagee who can transmit his fortune undiminished to his descendants this is a visible injustice yet it does not arithmetically violate the rule that taxation ought to be in proportion to means when it is said that a temporary income ought to be taxed less than a permanent one the reply is irresistible that it is taxed less for the income which lasts only ten years pays the tax only ten years while that which lasts forever pays forever the claim in favor of terminable incomes does not rest on grounds of arithmetic but of human wants and feelings it is not because the temporary annuitant has smaller means but because he has greater necessities that he ought to be assessed at a lower rate  in spite of the nominal equality of income a an annuitant of £1000 a year can not so well afford to pay £100 out of it as b who derives the same annual sum from heritable property a having usually a demand on his income which b has not namely to provide by saving for children or others to which in the case of salaries or professional gains must generally be added a provision for his own later years while b may expend his whole income without injury to his old age and still have it all to bestow on others after his death if a in order to meet these exigencies must lay by £300 of his income to take £100 from him as incometax is to take £100 from £700 since it must be retrenched from that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption were he to throw it ratably on what he spends and on what he saves abating £70 from his consumption and £30 from his annual saving then indeed his immediate sacrifice would be proportionally the same as b’s but then his children or his old age would be worse provided for in consequence of the tax the capital sum which would be accumulated for them would be one tenth less and on the reduced income afforded by this reduced capital they would be a second time charged with incometax while b’s heirs would only be charged once  the principle therefore of equality of taxation interpreted in its only just sense equality of sacrifice requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age or for those in whom he is interested except by saving from income should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose  if indeed reliance could be placed on the conscience of the contributors or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements by collateral precautions the proper mode of assessing an incometax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure exempting that which is saved for when saved and invested and all savings speaking generally are invested it thenceforth pays incometax on the interest or profit which it brings notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal unless therefore savings are exempted from incometax the contributors are twice taxed on what they save and only once on what they spend to tax the sum invested and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment is to tax the same portion of the contributor’s means twice over  no incometax is really just from which savings are not exempted and no incometax ought to be voted without that provision if the form of the returns and the nature of the evidence required could be so arranged as to prevent the exemption from being taken fraudulent advantage of by saving with one hand and getting into debt with the other or by spending in the following year what had been passed taxfree as saving in the year preceding but if no plan can be devised for the exemption of actual savings sufficiently free from liability to fraud it is necessary as the next thing in point of justice to take into account in assessing the tax what the different classes of contributors ought to save in fixing the proportion between the two rates there must inevitably be something arbitrary perhaps a deduction of one fourth in favor of lifeincomes would be as little objectionable as any which could be made  of the net profits of persons in business a part as before observed may be considered as interest on capital and of a perpetual character and the remaining part as remuneration for the skill and labor of superintendence the surplus beyond interest depends on the life of the individual and even on his continuance in business and is entitled to the full amount of exemption allowed to terminable incomes    § 5 the increase of the rent of land from natural causes a fit subject of peculiar taxation   suppose that there is a kind of income which constantly tends to increase without any exertion or sacrifice on the part of the owners those owners constituting a class in the community whom the natural course of things progressively enriches consistently with complete passiveness on their own part in such a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private property is grounded if the state should appropriate this increase of wealth or part of it as it arises this would not properly be taking anything from anybody it would merely be applying an accession of wealth created by circumstances to the benefit of society instead of allowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a particular class  now this is actually the case with rent the ordinary progress of a society which increases in wealth is at all times tending to augment the incomes of landlords to give them both a greater amount and a greater proportion of the wealth of the community independently of any trouble or outlay incurred by themselves they grow richer as it were in their sleep without working risking or economizing what claim have they on the general principle of social justice to this accession of riches in what would they have been wronged if society had from the beginning reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent to the highest amount required by financial exigencies the only admissible mode of proceeding would be by a general measure the first step should be a valuation of all the land in the country the present value of all land should be exempt from the tax but after an interval had elapsed during which society had increased in population and capital a rough estimate might be made of the spontaneous increase which had accrued to rent since the valuation was made of this the average price of produce would be some criterion if that had risen it would be certain that rent had increased and as already shown even in a greater ratio than the rise of price on this and other data an approximate estimate might be made how much value had been added to the land of the country by natural causes and in laying on a general landtax which for fear of miscalculation should be considerably within the amount thus indicated there would be an assurance of not touching any increase of income which might be the result of capital expended or industry exerted by the proprietor  with reference to such a tax perhaps a safer criterion than either a rise of rents or a rise of the price of corn would be a general rise in the price of land it would be easy to keep the tax within the amount which would reduce the market value of land below the original valuation and up to that point whatever the amount of the tax might be no injustice would be done to the proprietors       in 1870 mr mill became president of the land tenure association     one of whose objects was “to claim for the benefit of the state     the interception by taxation of the future unearned increase of     the rent of land so far as the same can be ascertained or a     great part of that increase which is continually taking place     without any effort or outlay by the proprietors merely through     the growth of population and wealth reserving to owners the     option of relinquishing their property to the state at the market     value which it may have acquired at the time when this principle     may be adopted by the legislature” it is urged against this plan     that if the government take for itself the increase from rent it     should also make compensation for loss arising from declining     rents whenever there happens to be any readjustment of values in     land340    § 6 taxes falling on capital not necessarily objectionable   in addition to the preceding rules another general rule of taxation is sometimes laid down—namely that it should fall on income and not on capital  to provide that taxation shall fall entirely on income and not at all on capital is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements there is no tax which is not partly paid from what would otherwise have been saved no tax the amount of which if remitted would be wholly employed in increased expenditure and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital all taxes therefore are in some sense partly paid out of capital and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth but in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong this effect of taxation is scarcely felt to take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove or a commercial crisis destroy is only to do what either of those causes would have done—namely to make a clear space for further saving  i can not therefore attach any importance in a wealthy country to the objection made against taxes on legacies and inheritances that they are taxes on capital it is perfectly true that they are so as ricardo observes if £100 are taken from any one in a tax on houses or on wine he will probably save it or a part of it by living in a cheaper house consuming less wine or retrenching from some other of his expenses but if the same sum be taken from him because he has received a legacy of £1000 he considers the legacy as only £900 and feels no more inducement than at any other time probably feels rather less inducement to economize in his expenditure the tax therefore is wholly paid out of capital and there are countries in which this would be a serious objection but in the first place the argument can not apply to any country which has a national debt and devotes any portion of revenue to paying it off since the produce of the tax thus applied still remains capital and is merely transferred from the taxpayer to the fundholder but the objection is never applicable in a country which increases rapidly in wealth     chapter ii of direct taxes    § 1 direct taxes either on income or expenditure   taxes are either direct or indirect a direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another such as the excise or customs the producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price  direct taxes are either on income or on expenditure most taxes on expenditure are indirect but some are direct being imposed not on the producer or seller of an article but immediately on the consumer a housetax for example is a direct tax on expenditure if levied as it usually is on the occupier of the house if levied on the builder or owner it would be an indirect tax a windowtax is a direct tax on expenditure so are the taxes on horses and carriages  the sources of income are rent profits and wages this includes every sort of income except gift or plunder taxes may be laid on any one of the three kinds of income or a uniform tax on all of them we will consider these in their order    § 2 taxes on rent   a tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord there are no means by which he can shift the burden upon any one else it does not affect the value or price of agricultural produce for this is determined by the cost of production in the most unfavorable circumstances and in those circumstances as we have so often demonstrated no rent is paid  this however is in strict exactness only true of the rent which is the result either of natural causes or of improvements made by tenants when the landlord makes improvements which increase the productive power of his land he is remunerated for them by an extra payment from the tenant and this payment which to the landlord is properly a profit on capital is blended and confounded with rent a tax on rent if extending to this portion of it would discourage landlords from making improvements but whatever hinders improvements from being made in the manner in which people prefer to make them will often prevent them from being made at all and on this account a tax on rent would be inexpedient unless some means could be devised of excluding from its operation that portion of the nominal rent which may be regarded as landlord’s profit    § 3 —on profits   a tax on profits like a tax on rent must at least in its immediate operation fall wholly on the payer all profits being alike affected no relief can be obtained by a change of employment if a tax were laid on the profits of any one branch of productive employment the tax would be virtually an increase of the cost of production and the value and price of the article would rise accordingly by which the tax would be thrown upon the consumers of the commodity and would not affect profits but a general and equal tax on all profits would not affect general prices and would fall at least in the first instance on capitalists alone  there is however an ulterior effect which in a rich and prosperous country requires to be taken into account it may operate in two different ways 1 the curtailment of profit and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the employment of capital may act as a stimulus to inventions and to the use of them when made if improvements in production are much accelerated and if these improvements cheapen directly or indirectly any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer profits may rise and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax in that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one the produce of the country being increased by an equal or what would in that case be a far greater amount the tax however must even in this case be considered as paid from profits because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off  but 2 though the artificial abstraction of a portion of profits would have a real tendency to accelerate improvements in production no considerable improvements might actually result or only of such a kind as not to raise general profits at all or not to raise them so much as the tax had diminished them if so the rate of profit would be brought closer to that practical minimum to which it is constantly approaching at its first imposition the tax falls wholly on profits but the amount of increase of capital which the tax prevents would if it had been allowed to continue have tended to reduce profits to the same level and at every period of ten or twenty years there will be found less difference between profits as they are and profits as they would in that case have been until at last there is no difference and the tax is thrown either upon the laborer or upon the landlord the real effect of a tax on profits is to make the country possess at any given period a smaller capital and a smaller aggregate production and to make the stationary state be attained earlier and with a smaller sum of national wealth  even in countries which do not accumulate so fast as to be always within a short interval of the stationary state it seems impossible that if capital is accumulating at all its accumulation should not be in some degree retarded by the abstraction of a portion of its profit and unless the effect in stimulating improvements be a full counterbalance it is inevitable that a part of the burden will be thrown off the capitalist upon the laborer or the landlord one or other of these is always the loser by a diminished rate of accumulation if population continues to increase as before the laborer suffers if not cultivation is checked in its advance and the landlords lose the accession of rent which would have accrued to them the only countries in which a tax on profits seems likely to be permanently a burden on capitalists exclusively are those in which capital is stationary because there is no new accumulation in such countries the tax might not prevent the old capital from being kept up through habit or from unwillingness to submit to impoverishment and so the capitalists might continue to bear the whole of the tax    § 4 —on wages   we now turn to taxes on wages the incidence of these is very different according as the wages taxed as those of ordinary unskilled labor or are the remuneration of such skilled or privileged employments whether manual or intellectual as are taken out of the sphere of competition by a natural or conferred monopoly  i have already remarked that in the present low state of popular education all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a monopoly price exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that which is due to the expense trouble and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment any tax levied on these gains which still leaves them above or not below their just proportion falls on those who pay it they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class the same thing is true of ordinary wages in cases like that of the united states or of a new colony where capital increasing as rapidly as population can increase wages are kept up by the increase of capital and not by the adherence of the laborers to a fixed standard of comforts in such a case some deterioration of their condition whether by a tax or otherwise might possibly take place without checking the increase of population the tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which on the same supposition with regard to their habits they would in any case have been reduced ultimately by the inevitable diminution in the rate of increase of capital through the occupation of all the fertile land  some will object that even in this case a tax on wages can not be detrimental to the laborers since the money raised by it being expended in the country comes back to the laborers again through the demand for labor without however reverting to general principles we may rely on an obvious reductio ad absurdum if to take money from the laborers and spend it in commodities is giving it back to the laborers then to take money from other classes and spend it in the same manner must be giving it to the laborers consequently the more a government takes in taxes the greater will be the demand for labor and the more opulent the condition of the laborers—a proposition the absurdity of which no one can fail to see  in the condition of most communities wages are regulated by the habitual standard of living to which the laborers adhere and on less than which they will not multiply where there exists such a standard a tax on wages will indeed for a time be borne by the laborers themselves but unless this temporary depression has the effect of lowering the standard itself the increase of population will receive a check which will raise wages and restore the laborers to their previous condition on whom in this case will the tax fall a rise of wages occasioned by a tax must like any other increase of the cost of labor be defrayed from profits to attempt to tax daylaborers in an old country is merely to impose an extra tax upon all employers of common labor unless the tax has the much worse effect of permanently lowering the standard of comfortable subsistence in the minds of the poorest class  we find in the preceding considerations an additional argument for the opinion already expressed that direct taxation should stop short of the class of incomes which do not exceed what is necessary for healthful existence these very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor and as we now see any tax imposed on these either permanently degrades the habits of the laboringclass or falls on profits and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax in addition to their share of the direct taxes which is doubly objectionable both as a violation of the fundamental rule of equality and for the reasons which as already shown render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever    § 5 —on income   we now pass from taxes on the separate kinds of income to a tax attempted to be assessed fairly upon all kinds in other words an incometax the discussion of the conditions necessary for making this tax consistent with justice has been anticipated in the last chapter we shall suppose therefore that these conditions are complied with they are first that incomes below a certain amount should be altogether untaxed this minimum should not be higher than the amount which suffices for the necessaries of the existing population the second condition is that incomes above the limit should be taxed only in proportion to the surplus by which they exceed the limit thirdly that all sums saved from income and invested should be exempt from the tax or if this be found impracticable that lifeincomes and incomes from business and professions should be less heavily taxed than inheritable incomes  an incometax fairly assessed on these principles would be in point of justice the least exceptionable of all taxes the objection to it in the present state of public morality is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors notwithstanding too what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors rents salaries annuities and all fixed incomes can be exactly ascertained but the variable gains of professions and still more the profits of business which the person interested can not always himself exactly ascertain can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a taxcollector the main reliance must be placed and always has been placed on the returns made by the person himself the tax therefore on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways falling heaviest on the most conscientious  it is to be feared therefore that the fairness which belongs to the principle of an incometax can not be made to attach to it in practice this consideration would lead us to concur in the opinion which until of late has usually prevailed—that direct taxes on income should be reserved as an extraordinary resource for great national emergencies in which the necessity of a large additional revenue overrules all objections  the difficulties of a fair incometax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax of so much per cent not on income but on expenditure the aggregate amount of each person’s expenditure being ascertained as the amount of income now is from statements furnished by the contributors themselves the only security would still be the veracity of individuals and there is no reason for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues the taxes on expenditure at present in force either in this or in other countries fall only on particular kinds of expenditure and differ no otherwise from taxes on commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article instead of being advanced by the producer or seller and reimbursed in the price the taxes on horses and carriages on dogs on servants are of this nature they evidently fall on the persons from whom they are levied—those who use the commodity taxed a tax of a similar description and more important is a housetax which must be considered at somewhat greater length    § 6 a housetax   the rent of a house consists of two parts the groundrent and what adam smith calls the buildingrent the first is determined by the ordinary principles of rent it is the remuneration given for the use of the portion of land occupied by the house and its appurtenances and varies from a mere equivalent for the rent which the ground would afford in agriculture to the monopoly rents paid for advantageous situations in populous thoroughfares the rent of the house itself as distinguished from the ground is the equivalent given for the labor and capital expended on the building the fact of its being received in quarterly or halfyearly payments makes no difference in the principles by which it is regulated it comprises the ordinary profit on the builder’s capital and an annuity sufficient at the current rate of interest after paying for all repairs chargeable on the proprietor to replace the original capital by the time the house is worn out or by the expiration of the usual term of a buildinglease  a tax of so much per cent on the gross rent falls on both those portions alike the more highly a house is rented the more it pays to the tax whether the quality of the situation or that of the house itself is the cause the incidence however of these two portions of the tax must be considered separately  as much of it as is a tax on buildingrent must ultimately fall on the consumer in other words the occupier for as the profits of building are already not above the ordinary rate they would if the tax fell on the owner and not on the occupier become lower than the profits of untaxed employments and houses would not be built it is probable however that for some time after the tax was first imposed a great part of it would fall not on the renter but on the owner of the house a large proportion of the consumers either could not afford or would not choose to pay their former rent with the tax in addition but would content themselves with a lower scale of accommodation houses therefore would be for a time in excess of the demand the consequence of such excess in the case of most other articles would be an almost immediate diminution of the supply but so durable a commodity as houses does not rapidly diminish in amount new buildings indeed of the class for which the demand had decreased would cease to be erected except for special reasons but in the mean time the temporary superfluity would lower rents and the consumers would obtain perhaps nearly the same accommodation as formerly for the same aggregate payment rent and tax together by degrees however as the existing houses wore out or as increase of population demanded a greater supply rents would again rise until it became profitable to recommence building which would not be until the tax was wholly transferred to the occupier in the end therefore the occupier bears that portion of a tax on rent which falls on the payment made for the house itself exclusively of the ground it stands on  the case is partly different with the portion which is a tax on groundrent as taxes on rent properly so called fall on the landlord a tax on groundrent one would suppose must fall on the groundlandlord at least after the expiration of the buildinglease it will not however fall wholly on the landlord unless with the tax on groundrent there is combined an equivalent tax on agricultural rent the lowest rent of land let for building is very little above the rent which the same ground would yield in agriculture since it is reasonable to suppose that land unless in case of exceptional circumstances is let or sold for building as soon as it is decidedly worth more for that purpose than for cultivation if therefore a tax were laid on groundrents without being also laid on agricultural rents it would unless of trifling amount reduce the return from the lowest groundrents below the ordinary return from land and would check further building quite as effectually as if it were a tax on buildingrents until either the increased demand of a growing population or a diminution of supply by the ordinary causes of destruction had raised the rent by a full equivalent for the tax but whatever raises the lowest groundrents raises all others since each exceeds the lowest by the market value of its peculiar advantages if therefore the tax on groundrents were a fixed sum per square foot the more valuable situations paying no more than those least in request this fixed payment would ultimately fall on the occupier suppose the lowest groundrent to be 50 per acre and the highest 5000 a tax of 5 per acre on groundrents would ultimately raise the former to 55 and the latter consequently to 5005 since the difference of value between the two situations would be exactly what it was before the annual 5 therefore would be paid by the occupier but a tax on groundrent is supposed to be a portion of a housetax which is not a fixed payment but a percentage on the rent the cheapest site therefore being supposed as before to pay 5 the dearest would pay 500 of which only the 5 could be thrown upon the occupier since the rent would still be only raised to 5005 consequently 495 of the 500 levied from the expensive site would fall on the groundlandlord341 a housetax thus requires to be considered in a double aspect as a tax on all occupiers of houses and a tax on groundrents  in the vast majority of houses the groundrent forms but a small proportion of the annual payment made for the house and nearly all the tax falls on the occupier it is only in exceptional cases like that of the favorite situations in large towns that the predominant element in the rent of the house is the groundrent and among the very few kinds of income which are fit subjects for peculiar taxation these groundrents hold the principal place being the most gigantic example extant of enormous accessions of riches acquired rapidly and in many cases unexpectedly by a few families from the mere accident of their possessing certain tracts of land without their having themselves aided in the acquisition by the smallest exertion outlay or risk so far therefore as a housetax falls on the groundlandlord it is liable to no valid objection  in so far as it falls on the occupier if justly proportioned to the value of the house it is one of the fairest and most unobjectionable of all taxes no part of a person’s expenditure is a better criterion of his means or bears on the whole more nearly the same proportion to them the equality of this tax can only be seriously questioned on two grounds the first is that a miser may escape it this objection applies to all taxes on expenditure nothing but a direct tax on income can reach a miser the second objection is that a person may require a larger and more expensive house not from having greater means but from having a larger family of this however he is not entitled to complain since having a large family is at a person’s own choice and so far as concerns the public interest is a thing rather to be discouraged than promoted342  a valuation should be made of the house not at what it would sell for but at what would be the cost of rebuilding it and this valuation might be periodically corrected by an allowance for what it had lost in value by time or gained by repairs and improvements the amount of the amended valuation would form a principal sum the interest of which at the current price of the public funds would form the annual value at which the building should be assessed to the tax  as incomes below a certain amount ought to be exempt from incometax so ought houses below a certain value from housetax on the universal principle of sparing from all taxation the absolute necessaries of healthful existence in order that the occupiers of lodgings as well as of houses might benefit as in justice they ought by this exemption it might be optional with the owners to have every portion of a house which is occupied by a separate tenant valued and assessed separately     chapter iii of taxes on commodities or indirect taxes    § 1 a tax on all commodities would fall on profits   by taxes on commodities are commonly meant those which are levied either on the producers or on the carriers or dealers who intervene between them and the final purchasers for consumption the phrase being by custom confined to indirect taxes—those which are advanced by one person to be as is expected and intended reimbursed by another  taxes on commodities are either on production within the country or on importation into it or on conveyance or sale within it and are classed respectively as excise customs or tolls and transit duties to whichever class they belong and at whatever stage in the progress of the community they may be imposed they are equivalent to an increase of the cost of production using that term in its most enlarged sense which includes the cost of transport and distribution or in common phrase of bringing the commodity to market  when the cost of production is increased artificially by a tax the effect is the same as when it is increased by natural causes if only one or a few commodities are affected their value and price rise so as to compensate the producer or dealer for the peculiar burden but if there were a tax on all commodities exactly proportioned to their value no such compensation would be obtained there would neither be a general rise of values which is an absurdity nor of prices which depend on causes entirely different there would however as mr mcculloch has pointed out be a disturbance of values some falling others rising owing to a circumstance the effect of which on values and prices we formerly discussed—the different durability of the capital employed in different occupations the gross produce of industry consists of two parts one portion serving to replace the capital consumed while the other portion is profit now equal capital in two branches of production must have equal expectations of profit but if a greater portion of the one than of the other is fixed capital or if that fixed capital is more durable there will be a less consumption of capital in the year and less will be required to replace it so that the profit if absolutely the same will form a greater proportion of the annual returns to derive from a capital of 1000 a profit of 100 the one producer may have to sell produce to the value of 1100 the other only to the value of 500 if on these two branches of industry a tax be imposed of five per cent ad valorem the last will be charged only with 25 the first with 55 leaving to the one 75 profit to the other only 45 to equalize therefore their expectation of profit the one commodity must rise in price or the other must fall or both343 commodities made chiefly by immediate labor must rise in value as compared with those which are chiefly made by machinery it is unnecessary to prosecute this branch of the inquiry any further    § 2 taxes on particular commodities fall on the consumer   a tax on any one commodity whether laid on its production its importation its carriage from place to place or its sale and whether the tax be a fixed sum of money for a given quantity of the commodity or an ad valorem duty will as a general rule raise the value and price of the commodity by at least the amount of the tax there are few cases in which it does not raise them by more than that amount in the first place there are few taxes on production on account of which it is not found or deemed necessary to impose restrictive regulations on the manufacturers or dealers in order to check evasions of the tax these regulations are always sources of trouble and annoyance and generally of expense for all of which being peculiar disadvantages the producers or dealers must have compensation in the price of their commodity these restrictions also frequently interfere with the processes of manufacture requiring the producer to carry on his operations in the way most convenient to the revenue though not the cheapest or most efficient for purposes of production any regulations whatever enforced by law make it difficult for the producer to adopt new and improved processes further the necessity of advancing the tax obliges producers and dealers to carry on their business with larger capitals than would otherwise be necessary on the whole of which they must receive the ordinary rate of profit though a part only is employed in defraying the real expenses of production or importation the price of the article must be such as to afford a profit on more than its natural value instead of a profit on only its natural value neither ought it to be forgotten that whatever renders a larger capital necessary in any trade or business limits the competition in that business and by giving something like a monopoly to a few dealers may enable them either to keep up the price beyond what would afford the ordinary rate of profit or to obtain the ordinary rate of profit with a less degree of exertion for improving and cheapening their commodity in these several modes taxes on commodities often cost to the consumer through the increased price of the article much more than they bring into the treasury of the state there is still another consideration the higher price necessitated by the tax almost always checks the demand for the commodity and since there are many improvements in production which to make them practicable require a certain extent of demand such improvements are obstructed and many of them prevented altogether it is a wellknown fact that the branches of production in which fewest improvements are made are those with which the revenueofficer interferes and that nothing in general gives a greater impulse to improvements in the production of a commodity than taking off a tax which narrowed the market for it    § 3 peculiar effects of taxes on necessaries   such are the effects of taxes on commodities considered generally but as there are some commodities those composing the necessaries of the laborer of which the values have an influence on the distribution of wealth among different classes of the community it is requisite to trace the effects of taxes on those particular articles somewhat further if a tax be laid say on corn and the price rises in proportion to the tax the rise of price may operate in two ways first it may lower the condition of the laboringclasses temporarily indeed it can scarcely fail to do so if it diminishes their consumption of the produce of the earth or makes them resort to a food which the soil produces more abundantly and therefore more cheaply it to that extent contributes to throw back agriculture upon more fertile lands or less costly processes and to lower the value and price of corn which therefore ultimately settles at a price increased not by the whole amount of the tax but by only a part of its amount secondly however it may happen that the dearness of the taxed food does not lower the habitual standard of the laborer’s requirements but that wages on the contrary through an action on population rise in shorter or longer periods so as to compensate the laborers for their portion of the tax the compensation being of course at the expense of profits taxes on necessaries must thus have one of two effects either they lower the condition of the laboringclasses or they exact from the owners of capital in addition to the amount due to the state on their own necessaries the amount due on those consumed by the laborers in the last case the tax on necessaries like a tax on wages is equivalent to a peculiar tax on profits which is like all other partial taxation unjust and is specially prejudicial to the increase of the national wealth  it remains to speak of the effect on rent assuming what is usually the fact that the consumption of food is not diminished the same cultivation as before will be necessary to supply the wants of the community the margin of cultivation to use dr chalmers’s expression remains where it was and the same land or capital which as the least productive already regulated the value and price of the whole produce will continue to regulate them the effect which a tax on agricultural produce will have on rent depends on its affecting or not affecting the difference between the return to this least productive land or capital and the returns to other lands and capitals now this depends on the manner in which the tax is imposed if it is an ad valorem tax or what is the same thing a fixed proportion of the produce such as tithe for example it evidently lowers cornrents for it takes more corn from the better lands than from the worse and exactly in the degree in which they are better land of twice the productiveness paying twice as much to the tithe whatever takes more from the greater of two quantities than from the less diminishes the difference between them the imposition of a tithe on corn would take a tithe also from cornrent for if we reduce a series of numbers by a tenth each the differences between them are reduced one tenth  for example let there be five qualities of land which severally yield on the same extent of ground and with the same expenditure 100 90 80 70 and 60 bushels of wheat the last of these being the lowest quality which the demand for food renders it necessary to cultivate the rent of these lands will be as follows  the land producing 100 bushels will yield a rent of 10060 or 40 bushels that producing 90 bushels a rent of 9060 or 30 bushels that producing 80 bushels a rent of 8060 or 20 bushels that producing 70 bushels a rent of 7060 or 10 bushels that producing 60 bushels will yield no rent  now let a tithe be imposed which takes from these five pieces of land 10 9 8 7 and 6 bushels respectively the fifth quality still being the one which regulates the price but returning to the farmer after payment of tithe no more than 54 bushels  the land producing 100 bushels reduced to 90 will yield a rent of 9054 or 36 bushels that producing 90 bushels reduced to 81 a rent of 8154 or 27 bushels that producing 80 bushels reduced to 72 a rent of 7254 or 18 bushels that producing 70 bushels reduced to 63 a rent of 6354 or 9 bushels  and that producing 60 bushels reduced to 54 will yield as before no rent so that the rent of the first quality of land has lost four bushels of the second three of the third two and of the fourth one that is each has lost exactly one tenth a tax therefore of a fixed proportion of the produce lowers in the same proportion cornrent  but it is only cornrent that is lowered and not rent estimated in money or in any other commodity for in the same proportion as cornrent is reduced in quantity the corn composing it is raised in value under the tithe 54 bushels will be worth in the market what 60 were before and nine tenths will in all cases sell for as much as the whole ten tenths previously sold for the landlords will therefore be compensated in value and price for what they lose in quantity and will suffer only so far as they consume their rent in kind or after receiving it in money expend it in agricultural produce that is they only suffer as consumers of agricultural produce and in common with all the other consumers considered as landlords they have the same income as before the tithe therefore falls on the consumer and not on the landlord  the same effect would be produced on rent if the tax instead of being a fixed proportion of the produce were a fixed sum per quarter or per bushel a tax which takes a shilling for every bushel takes more shillings from one field than from another just in proportion as it produces more bushels and operates exactly like tithe except that tithe is not only the same proportion on all lands but is also the same proportion at all times while a fixed sum of money per bushel will amount to a greater or less proportion according as corn is cheap or dear  there are other modes of taxing agriculture which would affect rent differently a tax proportioned to the rent would fall wholly on the rent and would not at all raise the price of corn which is regulated by the portion of the produce that pays no rent a fixed tax of so much per cultivated acre without distinction of value would have effects directly the reverse taking no more from the best qualities of land than from the worst it would leave the differences the same as before and consequently the same cornrents and the landlords would profit to the full extent of the rise of price to put the thing in another manner the price must rise sufficiently to enable the worst land to pay the tax thus enabling all lands which produce more than the worst to pay not only the tax but also an increased rent to the landlords these however are not so much taxes on the produce of land as taxes on the land itself taxes on the produce properly so called whether fixed or ad valorem do not affect rent but fall on the consumer profits however generally bearing either the whole or the greatest part of the portion which is levied on the consumption of the laboringclasses    § 4 —how modified by the tendency of profits to a minimum   the preceding is i apprehend a correct statement of the manner in which taxes on agricultural produce operate when first laid on when however they are of old standing their effect may be different now the effect of accumulation when attended by its usual accompaniment an increase of population is to increase the value and price of food to raise rent and to lower profits that is to do precisely what is done by a tax on agricultural produce except that this does not raise rent the tax therefore merely anticipates the rise of price and fall of profits which would have taken place ultimately through the mere progress of accumulation while it at the same time prevents or at least retards that progress if the rate of profit was such that the effect of the tithe reduces it to the practical minimum after a lapse of time which would have admitted of a rise of one tenth from the natural progress of wealth the consumer will be paying no more than he would have paid if the tithe had never existed he will have ceased to pay any portion of it and the person who will really pay it is the landlord whom it deprives of the increase of rent which would by that time have accrued to him at every successive point in this interval of time less of the burden will rest on the consumer and more of it on the landlord and in the ultimate result the minimum of profits will be reached with a smaller capital and population and a lower rental than if the course of things had not been disturbed by the imposition of the tax if on the other hand the tithe or other tax on agricultural produce does not reduce profits to the minimum but to something above the minimum accumulation will not be stopped but only slackened and if population also increases the twofold increase will continue to produce its effects—a rise of the price of corn and an increase of rent these consequences however will not take place with the same rapidity as if the higher rate of profit had continued at the end of twenty years the country will have a smaller population and capital than but for the tax it would by that time have had the landlords will have a smaller rent and the price of corn having increased less rapidly than it would otherwise have done will not be so much as a tenth higher than what if there had been no tax it would by that time have become a part of the tax therefore will already have ceased to fall on the consumer and devolved upon the landlord and the proportion will become greater and greater by lapse of time  but though tithes and other taxes on agricultural produce when of long standing either do not raise the price of food and lower profits at all or if at all not in proportion to the tax yet the abrogation of such taxes when they exist does not the less diminish price and in general raise the rate of profit the abolition of a tithe takes one tenth from the cost of production and consequently from the price of all agricultural produce and unless it permanently raises the laborer’s requirements it lowers the cost of labor and raises profits rent estimated in money or in commodities generally remains as before estimated in agricultural produce it is raised the country adds as much by the repeal of a tithe to the margin which intervenes between it and the stationary state as was cut off from that margin by the tithe when first imposed accumulation is greatly accelerated and if population also increases the price of corn immediately begins to recover itself and rent to rise thus gradually transferring the benefit of the remission from the consumer to the landlord    § 5 effects of discriminating duties   we have hitherto inquired into the effects of taxes on commodities on the assumption that they are levied impartially on every mode in which the commodity can be produced or brought to market another class of considerations is opened if we suppose that this impartiality is not maintained and that the tax is imposed not on the commodity but on some particular mode of obtaining it  suppose that a commodity is capable of being made by two different processes—as a manufactured commodity may be produced either by hand or by steampower—sugar may be made either from the sugarcane or from beetroot cattle fattened either on hay and green crops or on oilcake and the refuse of breweries it is the interest of the community that of the two methods producers should adopt that which produces the best article at the lowest price this being also the interest of the producers unless protected against competition and shielded from the penalties of indolence the process most advantageous to the community is that which if not interfered with by government they ultimately find it to their advantage to adopt suppose however that a tax is laid on one of the processes and no tax at all or one of smaller amount on the other if the taxed process is the one which the producers would not have adopted the measure is simply nugatory but if the tax falls as it is of course intended to do upon the one which they would have adopted it creates an artificial motive for preferring the untaxed process though the inferior of the two if therefore it has any effect at all it causes the commodity to be produced of worse quality or at a greater expense of labor it causes so much of the labor of the community to be wasted and the capital employed in supporting and remunerating that labor to be expended as uselessly as if it were spent in hiring men to dig holes and fill them up again this waste of labor and capital constitutes an addition to the cost of production of the commodity which raises its value and price in a corresponding ratio and thus the owners of the capital are indemnified the loss falls on the consumers though the capital of the country is also eventually diminished by the diminution of their means of saving and in some degree of their inducements to save  the kind of tax therefore which comes under the general denomination of a discriminating duty transgresses the rule that taxes should take as little as possible from the taxpayer beyond what they bring into the treasury of the state a discriminating duty makes the consumer pay two distinct taxes only one of which is paid to the government and that frequently the less onerous of the two if a tax were laid on sugar produced from the cane leaving the sugar from beetroot untaxed then in so far as canesugar continued to be used the tax on it would be paid to the treasury and might be as unobjectionable as most other taxes but if canesugar having previously been cheaper than beetroot sugar was now dearer and beetroot sugar was to any considerable amount substituted for it and fields laid out and manufactories established in consequence the government would gain no revenue from the beetroot sugar while the consumers of it would pay a real tax they would pay for beetroot sugar more than they had previously paid for canesugar and the difference would go to indemnify producers for a portion of the labor of the country actually thrown away in producing by the labor of say three hundred men what could be obtained by the other process with the labor of two hundred       an interesting illustration in late years of the operation of a     discriminating duty is to be found in the case of different grades     of sugar imported into the united states our tariff levied     certain duties on different grades of sugar classified by color     on the theory that color was a test of saccharine strength     cargoes were examined and compared with graded sugars hermetically     sealed in glass bottles and distributed by the dutch authorities     whence came the name of “dutch standard” grades from no 1     melado to no 10 must go to the refiner before consumption but     the grades to no 13 although some might have gone into immediate     consumption were usually sent to be manufactured into the highest     grades of soft and hard sugars so long as the sugar was secured     by evaporation in open coppers or by passing the molasses through     a layer of clay saccharine strength and color went fairly well     together but with the invention of the vacuumpan and the     centrifugal wheel by which the sugar is reduced through a shorter     and more effective process sugar of a certain grade of color by     the dutch standard contained a much greater degree of sweetness     than that produced by the old methods cuban planters therefore     were permitted to send sugar into this country at a duty which was     really levied on grades much inferior and so paid a less duty     than other sugars the products of one country were discriminated     against in favor of another the difficulty was settled by using     the polariscope which gave an absolute chemical test of the     sweetness irrespective of color   one of the commonest cases of discriminating duties is that of a tax on the importation of a commodity capable of being produced at home unaccompanied by an equivalent tax on the home production a commodity is never permanently imported unless it can be obtained from abroad at a smaller cost of labor and capital on the whole than is necessary for producing it if therefore by a duty on the importation it is rendered cheaper to produce the article than to import it an extra quantity of labor and capital is expended without any extra result the labor is useless and the capital is spent in paying people for laboriously doing nothing all custom duties which operate as an encouragement to the home production of the taxed article are thus an eminently wasteful mode of raising a revenue  this character belongs in a peculiar degree to custom duties on the produce of land unless countervailed by excise duties on the home production such taxes bring less into the public treasury compared with what they take from the consumers than any other imposts to which civilized nations are usually subject if the wheat produced in a country is twenty millions of quarters and the consumption twentyone millions a million being annually imported and if on this million a duty is laid which raises the price ten shillings per quarter the price which is raised is not that of the million only but of the whole twentyone millions taking the most favorable but extremely improbable supposition that the importation is not at all checked nor the home production enlarged the state gains a revenue of only half a million while the consumers are taxed ten millions and a half the ten millions being a contribution to the home growers who are forced by competition to resign it all to the landlords the consumer thus pays to the owners of land an additional tax equal to twenty times that which he pays to the state let us now suppose that the tax really checks importation suppose importation stopped altogether in ordinary years it being found that the million of quarters can be obtained by a more elaborate cultivation or by breaking up inferior land at a less advance than ten shillings upon the previous price—say for instance five shillings a quarter the revenue now obtains nothing except from the extraordinary imports which may happen to take place in a season of scarcity but the consumers pay every year a tax of five shillings on the whole twentyone millions of quarters amounting to £5250000 sterling of this the odd £250000 goes to compensate the growers of the last million of quarters for the labor and capital wasted under the compulsion of the law the remaining £5000000 go to enrich the landlords as before  such is the operation of what are technically termed corn laws when first laid on and such continues to be their operation so long as they have any effect at all in raising the price of corn the difference between a country without corn laws and a country which has long had corn laws is not so much that the last has a higher price or a larger rental but that it has the same price and the same rental with a smaller aggregate capital and a smaller population the imposition of corn laws raises rents but retards that progress of accumulation which would in no long period have raised them fully as much the repeal of corn laws tends to lower rents but it unchains a force which in a progressive state of capital and population restores and even increases the former amount  what we have said of duties on importation generally is equally applicable to discriminating duties which favor importation from one place or in one particular manner in contradistinction to others such as the preference given to the produce of a colony or of a country with which there is a commercial treaty or the higher duties formerly imposed by our navigation laws on goods imported in other than british shipping whatever else may be alleged in favor of such distinctions whenever they are not nugatory they are economically wasteful they induce a resort to a more costly mode of obtaining a commodity in lieu of one less costly and thus cause a portion of the labor which the country employs in providing itself with foreign commodities to be sacrificed without return    § 6 effects produced on international exchange by duties on exports and on imports   there is one more point relating to the operation of taxes on commodities conveyed from one country to another which requires notice the influences which they exert on international exchanges every tax on a commodity tends to raise its price and consequently to lessen the demand for it in the market in which it is sold all taxes on international trade tend therefore to produce a disturbance and a readjustment of what we have termed the equation of international demand  taxes on foreign trade are of two kinds—taxes on imports and on exports on the first aspect of the matter it would seem that both these taxes are paid by the consumers of the commodity that taxes on exports consequently fall entirely on foreigners taxes on imports wholly on the home consumer the true state of the case however is much more complicated  “by taxing exports we may in certain circumstances produce a division of the advantage of the trade more favorable to ourselves in some cases we may draw into our coffers at the expense of foreigners not only the whole tax but more than the tax in other cases we should gain exactly the tax in others less than the tax in this last case a part of the tax is borne by ourselves possibly the whole possibly even as we shall show more than the whole”  reverting to the supposititious case employed of a trade between england and the united states in iron and corn suppose that the united states taxes her export of corn the tax not being supposed high enough to induce england to produce corn for herself the price at which corn can be sold in england is augmented by the tax this will probably diminish the quantity consumed it may diminish it so much that even at the increased price there will not be required so great a money value as before or it may not diminish it at all or so little that in consequence of the higher price a greater money value will be purchased than before in this last case the united states will gain at the expense of england not only the whole amount of the duty but more for the money value of her exports to england being increased while her imports remain the same money will flow into the united states from england the price of corn will rise in the united states and consequently in england but the price of iron will fall in england and consequently in the united states we shall export less corn and import more iron till the equilibrium is restored it thus appears what is at first sight somewhat remarkable that by taxing her exports the united states would in some conceivable circumstances not only gain from her foreign customers the whole amount of the tax but would also get her imports cheaper she would get them cheaper in two ways for she would obtain them for less money and would have more money to purchase them with england on the other hand would suffer doubly she would have to pay for her corn a price increased not only by the duty but by the influx of money into the united states while the same change in the distribution of the circulating medium would leave her less money to purchase it with344  this however is only one of three possible cases if after the imposition of the duty england requires so diminished a quantity of corn that its total value is exactly the same as before the balance of trade would be undisturbed the united states will gain the duty england will lose it and nothing more if again the imposition of the duty occasions such a falling off in the demand that england requires a less pecuniary value than before our exports will no longer pay for our imports money must pass from the united states into england and england’s share of the advantage of the trade will be increased by the change in the distribution of money corn will fall in the united states and therefore it will of course fall in england thus england will not pay the whole of the tax from the same cause iron will rise in england and consequently in the united states when this alteration of prices has so adjusted the demand that the corn and the iron again pay for one another the result is that england has paid only a part of the tax and the remainder of what has been received into our treasury has come indirectly out of the pockets of our own consumers of iron who pay a higher price for that imported commodity in consequence of the tax on our exports while at the same time they in consequence of the efflux of money and the fall of prices have smaller money incomes wherewith to pay for the iron at that advanced price  it is not an impossible supposition that by taxing our exports we might not only gain nothing from the foreigner the tax being paid out of our own pockets but might even compel our own people to pay a second tax to the foreigner suppose as before that the demand of england for corn falls off so much on the imposition of the duty that she requires a smaller money value than before but that the case is so different with iron in the united states that when the price rises the demand either does not fall off at all or so little that the money value required is greater than before the first effect of laying on the duty is as before that the corn exported will no longer pay for the iron imported  money will therefore flow out of the united states into england one effect is to raise the price of iron in england and consequently in the united states but this by the supposition instead of stopping the efflux of money only makes it greater because the higher the price the greater the money value of the iron consumed the balance therefore can only be restored by the other effect which is going on at the same time namely the fall of corn in the american and consequently in the english market even when corn has fallen so low that its price with the duty is only equal to what its price without the duty was at first it is not a necessary consequence that the fall will stop for the same amount of exportation as before will not now suffice to pay the increased money value of the imports and although the english consumers have now not only corn at the old price but likewise increased money incomes it is not certain that they will be inclined to employ the increase of their incomes in increasing their purchases of corn the price of corn therefore must perhaps fall to restore the equilibrium more than the whole amount of the duty england may be enabled to import corn at a lower price when it is taxed than when it was untaxed and this gain she will acquire at the expense of the american consumers of iron who in addition will be the real payers of the whole of what is received at their own customhouse under the name of duties on the export of corn  in general however there could be little doubt that a country which imposed such taxes would succeed in making foreign countries contribute something to its revenue but unless the taxed article be one for which their demand is extremely urgent they will seldom pay the whole of the amount which the tax brings in345       the result of this investigation may then be generally     formulated as follows that country which has the strongest demand     for the commodities of other countries as compared with the demand     of other countries for its own commodities will pay the burden of     the export duty   thus far of duties on exports we now proceed to the more ordinary case of duties on imports “we have had an example of a tax on exports that is on foreigners falling in part on ourselves we shall therefore not be surprised if we find a tax on imports that is on ourselves partly falling upon foreigners  “instead of taxing the corn which we export suppose that we tax the iron which we import the duty which we are now supposing must not be what is termed a protecting duty that is a duty sufficiently high to induce us to produce the article at home if it had this effect it would destroy entirely the trade both in corn and in iron and both countries would lose the whole of the advantage which they previously gained by exchanging those commodities with one another we suppose a duty which might diminish the consumption of the article but which would not prevent us from continuing to import as before whatever iron we did consume  “the equilibrium of trade would be disturbed if the imposition of the tax diminished in the slightest degree the quantity of iron consumed for as the tax is levied at our own customhouse the english exporter only receives the same price as formerly though the american consumer pays a higher one if therefore there be any diminution of the quantity bought although a larger sum of money may be actually laid out in the article a smaller one will be due from the united states to england this sum will no longer be an equivalent for the sum due from england to the united states for corn the balance therefore must be paid in money prices will fall in england and rise in the united states iron will fall in the english market corn will rise in the american the english will pay a higher price for corn and will have smaller money incomes to buy it with while the americans will obtain iron cheaper that is its price will exceed what it previously was by less than the amount of the duty while their means of purchasing it will be increased by the increase of their money incomes  “if the imposition of the tax does not diminish the demand it will leave the trade exactly as it was before we shall import as much and export as much the whole of the tax will be paid out of our own pockets  “but the imposition of a tax on a commodity almost always diminishes the demand more or less and it can never or scarcely ever increase the demand it may therefore be laid down as a principle that a tax on imported commodities when it really operates as a tax and not as a prohibition either total or partial almost always falls in part upon the foreigners who consume our goods and that this is a mode in which a nation may appropriate to itself at the expense of foreigners a larger share than would otherwise belong to it of the increase in the general productiveness of the labor and capital of the world which results from the interchange of commodities among nations”  those are therefore in the right who maintain that taxes on imports are partly paid by foreigners but they are mistaken when they say that it is by the foreign producer it is not on the person from whom we buy but on all those who buy from us that a portion of our custom duties spontaneously falls it is the foreign consumer of our exported commodities who is obliged to pay a higher price for them because we maintain revenue duties on foreign goods  there are but two cases in which duties on commodities can in any degree or in any manner fall on the producer one is when the article is a strict monopoly and at a scarcity price the price in this case being only limited by the desires of the buyer—the sum obtained for the restricted supply being the utmost which the buyers would consent to give rather than go without it—if the treasury intercepts a part of this the price can not be further raised to compensate for the tax and it must be paid from the monopoly profits a tax on rare and highpriced wines will fall wholly on the growers or rather on the owners of the vineyards the second case in which the producer sometimes bears a portion of the tax is more important the case of duties on the produce of land or of mines these might be so high as to diminish materially the demand for the produce and compel the abandonment of some of the inferior qualities of land or mines supposing this to be the effect the consumers both in the country itself and in those which dealt with it would obtain the produce at smaller cost and a part only instead of the whole of the duty would fall on the purchaser who would be indemnified chiefly at the expense of the landowners or mineowners in the producing country  duties on importation may then be divided “into two classes 1 those which have the effect of encouraging some particular branch of domestic industry protective duties 2 and those which have not revenue duties the former are purely mischievous both to the country imposing them and to those with whom it trades they prevent a saving of labor and capital which if permitted to be made would be divided in some proportion or other between the importing country and the countries which buy what that country does or might export  “the other class of duties are those which do not encourage one mode of procuring an article at the expense of another but allow interchange to take place just as if the duty did not exist and to produce the saving of labor which constitutes the motive to international as to all other commerce of this kind are duties on the importation of any commodity which could not by any possibility be produced at home and duties not sufficiently high to counterbalance the difference of expense between the production of the article at home and its importation of the money which is brought into the treasury of any country by taxes of this last description a part only is paid by the people of that country the remainder by the foreign consumers of their goods  “nevertheless this latter kind of taxes are in principle as ineligible as the former though not precisely on the same ground a protecting duty can never be a cause of gain but always and necessarily of loss to the country imposing it just so far as it is efficacious to its end a nonprotecting duty on the contrary would in most cases be a source of gain to the country imposing it in so far as throwing part of the weight of its taxes upon other people is a gain but it would be a means which it could seldom be advisable to adopt being so easily counteracted by a precisely similar proceeding on the other side  “if the united states in the case already supposed sought to obtain for herself more than her natural share of the advantage of the trade with england by imposing a duty upon iron england would only have to impose a duty upon corn sufficient to diminish the demand for that article about as much as the demand for iron had been diminished in the united states by the tax things would then be as before and each country would pay its own tax—unless indeed the sum of the two duties exceeded the entire advantage of the trade for in that case the trade and its advantage would cease entirely  “there would be no advantage therefore in imposing duties of this kind with a view to gain by them in the manner which has been pointed out but when any part of the revenue is derived from taxes on commodities these may often be as little objectionable as the rest it is evident too that considerations of reciprocity which are quite unessential when the matter in debate is a protecting duty are of material importance when the repeal of duties of this other description is discussed a country can not be expected to renounce the power of taxing foreigners unless foreigners will in return practice toward itself the same forbearance the only mode in which a country can save itself from being a loser by the revenue duties imposed by other countries on its commodities is to impose corresponding revenue duties on theirs only it must take care that those duties be not so high as to exceed all that remains of the advantage of the trade and put an end to importation altogether causing the article to be either produced at home or imported from another and a dearer market”       by “reciprocity” is meant that when one country admits goods free     of duty from a second country this latter country will also admit     the commodities of the former free of duty or as is often the     case if not free of duty at a less than the usual rate until     the last few years we have had a reciprocity treaty with canada     but it is not now in force and an arrangement for closer     commercial relations with mexico is now under consideration     chapter iv comparison between direct and indirect taxation    § 1 arguments for and against direct taxation   are direct or indirect taxes the most eligible a man dislikes not so much the payment as the act of paying he dislikes seeing the face of the taxcollector and being subjected to his peremptory demand perhaps too the money which he is required to pay directly out of his pocket is the only taxation which he is quite sure that he pays at all that a tax of two shillings per pound on tea or of three shillings per bottle on wine raises the price of each pound of tea and bottle of wine which he consumes by that and more than that amount can not indeed be denied it is the fact and is intended to be so and he himself at times is perfectly aware of it but it makes hardly any impression on his practical feelings and associations serving to illustrate the distinction between what is merely known to be true and what is felt to be so the unpopularity of direct taxation contrasted with the easy manner in which the public consent to let themselves be fleeced in the prices of commodities has generated in many friends of improvement a directly opposite mode of thinking to the foregoing they contend that the very reason which makes direct taxation disagreeable makes it preferable under it every one knows how much he really pays and if he votes for a war or any other expensive national luxury he does so with his eyes open to what it costs him if all taxes were direct taxation would be much more perceived than at present and there would be a security which now there is not for economy in the public expenditure  although this argument is not without force its weight is likely to be constantly diminishing the real incidence of indirect taxation is every day more generally understood and more familiarly recognized the mere distinction between paying money directly to the taxcollector and contributing the same sum through the intervention of the teadealer or the winemerchant no longer makes the whole difference between dislike or opposition and passive acquiescence  if our present revenue of 400000000 in 1883 were all raised by direct taxes an extreme dissatisfaction would certainly arise at having to pay so much but while men’s minds are so little guided by reason as such a change of feeling from so irrelevant a cause would imply so great an aversion to taxation might not be an unqualified good of the 400000000 in question nearly 60000000 are pledged under the most binding obligations to those whose property has been borrowed and spent by the state and while this debt remains unredeemed a greatly increased impatience of taxation would involve no little danger of a breach of faith that part indeed of the public expenditure which is devoted to the maintenance of civil and military establishments 206000000 that is all except the interest of the national debt affords in many of its details ample scope for retrenchment if so great an addition were made to the public dislike of taxation as might be the consequence of confining it to the direct form the classes who profit by the misapplication of public money might probably succeed in saving that by which they profit at the expense of that which would only be useful to the public  there is however a frequent plea in support of indirect taxation which must be altogether rejected as grounded on a fallacy we are often told that taxes on commodities are less burdensome than other taxes because the contributor can escape from them by ceasing to use the taxed commodity he certainly can if that be his object deprive the government of the money but he does so by a sacrifice of his own indulgences which if he chose to undergo it would equally make up to him for the same amount taken from him by direct taxation suppose a tax laid on wine sufficient to add 25 to the price of the quantity of wine which he consumes in a year he has only we are told to diminish his consumption of wine by 25 and he escapes the burden true but if the 25 instead of being laid on wine had been taken from him by an incometax he could by expending 25 less in wine equally save the amount of the tax so that the difference between the two cases is really illusory if the government takes from the contributor 25 a year whether in one way or another exactly that amount must be retrenched from his consumption to leave him as well off as before and in either way the same amount of sacrifice neither more nor less is imposed on him  on the other hand it is some advantage on the side of indirect taxes that what they exact from the contributor is taken at a time and in a manner likely to be convenient to him it is paid at a time when he has at any rate a payment to make it causes therefore no additional trouble nor unless the tax be on necessaries any inconvenience but what is inseparable from the payment of the amount he can also except in the case of very perishable articles select his own time for laying in a stock of the commodity and consequently for payment of the tax the producer or dealer who advances these taxes is indeed sometimes subjected to inconvenience but in the case of imported goods this inconvenience is reduced to a minimum by what is called the warehousing system under which instead of paying the duty at the time of importation he is only required to do so when he takes out the goods for consumption which is seldom done until he has either actually found or has the prospect of immediately finding a purchaser  the strongest objection however to raising the whole or the greater part of a large revenue by direct taxes is the impossibility of assessing them fairly without a conscientious cooperation on the part of the contributors not to be hoped for in the present low state of public morality in the case of an incometax we have already seen that unless it be found practicable to exempt savings altogether from the tax the burden can not be apportioned with any tolerable approach to fairness upon those whose incomes are derived from business or professions and this is in fact admitted by most of the advocates of direct taxation who i am afraid generally get over the difficulty by leaving those classes untaxed and confining their projected incometax to “realized property” in which form it certainly has the merit of being a very easy form of plunder but enough has been said in condemnation of this expedient we have seen however that a housetax is a form of direct taxation not liable to the same objections as an incometax and indeed liable to as few objections of any kind as perhaps any of our indirect taxes but it would be impossible to raise by a housetax alone the greatest part of the revenue without producing a very objectionable overcrowding of the population through the strong motive which all persons would have to avoid the tax by restricting their house accommodation  a certain amount of revenue may as we have seen be obtained without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent besides 1 the landtax346 and 2 an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land some further taxation might i have contended at some future period be imposed 3 to enable the state to participate in the progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes 4 legacies and inheritances we have also seen ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue with these taxes and 5 a housetax of suitable amount we should i think have reached the prudent limits of direct taxation the remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption and the question is which of these are the least objectionable    § 2 what forms of indirect taxation are most eligible   there are some forms of indirect taxation which must be peremptorily excluded 1 taxes on commodities for revenue purposes must not operate as protecting duties but must be levied impartially on every mode in which the articles can be obtained whether produced in the country itself or imported 2 an exclusion must also be put upon all taxes on the necessaries of life or on the materials or instruments employed in producing those necessaries such taxes are always liable to encroach on what should be left untaxed the incomes barely sufficient for healthful existence and on the most favorable supposition namely that wages rise to compensate the laborers for the tax it operates as a peculiar tax on profits which is at once unjust and detrimental to national wealth347 what remain are taxes on luxuries and these have some properties which strongly recommend them in the first place they can never by any possibility touch those whose whole income is expended on necessaries while they do reach those by whom what is required for necessaries is expended on indulgences in the next place they operate in some cases as a useful and the only useful kind of sumptuary law a great portion of the expense of the higher and middle classes in most countries is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent but from regard to opinion and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them as an appendage of station and i can not but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation when a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness cheapness is no recommendation    § 3 practical rules for indirect taxation   in order to reduce as much as possible the inconveniences and increase the advantages incident to taxes on commodities the following are the practical rules which suggest themselves 1 to raise as large a revenue as conveniently may be from those classes of luxuries which have most connection with vanity and least with positive enjoyment such as the more costly qualities of all kinds of personal equipment and ornament but with regard to horses and carriages as there are many persons to whom from health or constitution these are not so much luxuries as necessaries the tax paid by those who have but one ridinghorse or but one carriage especially of the cheaper descriptions should be low while taxation should rise very rapidly with the number of horses and carriages and with their costliness 2 whenever possible to demand the tax not from the producer but directly from the consumer since when levied on the producer it raises the price always by more and often by much more than the mere amount of the tax 3 but as the only indirect taxes which yield a large revenue are those which fall on articles of universal or very general consumption and as it is therefore necessary to have some taxes on real luxuries that is on things which afford pleasure in themselves and are valued on that account rather than for their cost these taxes should if possible be so adjusted as to fall with the same proportional weight on small on moderate and on large incomes this is not an easy matter since the things which are the subjects of the more productive taxes are in proportion more largely consumed by the poorer members of the community than by the rich tea coffee sugar tobacco fermented drinks can hardly be so taxed that the poor shall not bear more than their due share of the burden something might be done by making the duty on the superior qualities which are used by the richer consumers much higher in proportion to the value but in some cases the difficulty of at all adjusting the duty to the value so as to prevent evasion is said with what truth i know not to be insuperable so that it is thought necessary to levy the same fixed duty on all the qualities alike 4 as far as is consistent with the preceding rules taxation should rather be concentrated on a few articles than diffused over many in order that the expenses of collection may be smaller and that as few employments as possible may be burdensomely and vexatiously interfered with 5 among luxuries of general consumption taxation should by preference attach itself to stimulants because these though in themselves as legitimate indulgences as any others are more liable than most others to be used in excess so that the check to consumption naturally arising from taxation is on the whole better applied to them than to other things 6 as far as other considerations permit taxation should be confined to imported articles since these can be taxed with a less degree of vexatious interference and with fewer incidental bad effects than when a tax is levied on the field or on the workshop custom duties are cæteris paribus much less objectionable than excise but they must be laid only on things which either can not or at least will not be produced in the country itself or else their production there must be prohibited as in england is the case with tobacco or subjected to an excise duty of equivalent amount 7 no tax ought to be kept so high as to furnish a motive to its evasion too strong to be counteracted by ordinary means of prevention and especially no commodity should be taxed so highly as to raise up a class of lawless characters—smugglers illicit distillers and the like       the experience of the united states is pregnant with lessons in     this direction during the war we imposed an internalrevenue tax     on distilled spirits of so large an amount that it not only     produced less revenue than a smaller tax would have done but it     created gigantic frauds public corruption and infinite devices     to escape the payment the following table will show how the     production as indicated by the tax fell off when the tax was     excessive it forced evasions by distillers it has been found by     various experiences that with a less rate the revenue is largely     increased      year       revenue     production

millions of     gallons or nearly one half the product the openness of the     frauds can be judged by the fact that proof spirits were “openly     sold in the market and even quoted in pricecurrents at from     five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the     average cost of manufacture”348   in what manner the finer articles of manufacture consumed by the rich might most advantageously be taxed i must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge the difficulty would be to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production in countries which like the united states import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume there is little difficulty in the matter and even where nothing is imported but the raw material that may be taxed especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers thus in england a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or linen yarn whether spun in the country itself or imported    § 4 taxation systems of the united states and other countries       it will now well repay study to examine chart no xxi which shows     in what manner the united states have raised their revenues and     to consider how far the right rules of taxation have been     followed      i for means of comparison i shall give the last annual budget of     the united states in order to make clear from what sources the     country

that of internal taxation being chiefly levied on     tobacco and distilled spirits and our customs falling on almost     all articles which can be imported materials as well as     manufactures      in the united states direct taxation on real and personal property     is very generally levied for state county and municipal     purposes in fact nearly all the perceptible taxation is the     property tax and inasmuch as the state and county tax is very     light the burden is almost always owing to municipal and town     expenditures people do not seem to be aware of the enormous     national burden because the taxes are indirect and only increase     the prices of commodities other countries it will be seen make     a greater use of direct taxation than the united states in fact     the comparison of the ways by which different countries collect     their revenues may naturally show us where we may gain by their     experience      ii the english system is especially interesting because after     having had an extended scheme of customs duties they abandoned     it and raised their revenue some on imported articles it is     true generally on those which could not be produced in england     but by the incometax and other forms350      in 1842 sir robert peel found 1200 articles subject to     customsduties he began 1 by removing all prohibitions 2 by     reducing duties on raw materials to 5 per cent or less 3 by     limiting the rates on partially manufactured goods to 12 per cent     and 4 those on wholly manufactured goods to 20 per cent now

after the manner of our classification and résumé of the subject of value and money it may be convenient to here insert a recapitulation of the various principles under the treatment of taxation354  comparison between direct and indirect taxation  adam smith’s “canons of taxation”—a tax should be i equal in amount of sacrifice entailed ii certain iii timely iv all for the state  a tax is either direct indirect on commodities  direct taxes are on income on expenditure  taxes on income are general special  general income taxes the best of taxes if people were all honest as it is it falls most heavily on the conscientious should be reserved for emergency all savings and a fixed amount in all incomes should be exempt  special taxes are on rent wages profits  taxes on rent agricultural rent is meant it falls entirely on the landlord and if not balanced by taxes on other classes is unjust may be blended with a tax on profits if on rent due to landlord’s improvements  taxes on wages are on skilled on unskilled  skilled wages are at a monopoly price and taxes on them are paid by the laborers so long as wages are not reduced below their just proportion  unskilled wages 1 population diminished by it paid by profits 2 population left stationary shared between profits and wages 3 population increasing in spite of it falls entirely on wages  taxes on profits may possible stimulate production and is then a good all round contributing to the state and leaving no one any poorer if not if profits are really diminished by the tax capital may be diminished also this a may or b may not diminish population if a then the margin of cultivation ceases to be extended and part of the tax pro tanto falls on the landlords if b then wages fall and part of the tax falls on the laborer total result is a nearer approach to the stationary state  taxes on expenditure are open to the same objections as the general incometax they may be assessed taxes housetax  assessed taxes such as on servants dogs etc these are rigidly direct  housetaxes are on buildingrent on groundrent  housetaxes on buildingrent are paid by occupier this tax is indirect  housetaxes on groundrent are 1 with or 2 without an equivalent tax on agricultural rent 1 are paid by ground landlord wholly and therefore direct 2 are part by occupier and therefore indirect  indirect taxes are excise customs or tolls  indirect taxes may be on 1 long or 2 short investments of capital  indirect taxes on long investments are always unadvisable in view of canon iv  indirect taxes on short investments are subject to the laws of indirect taxation 1 tax vanities rather than positive enjoyments eg liveries rather than servants 2 the consumer and not the producer should pay the tax collector canon iv that is collect the tax as near the actual consumer as possible 3 taxes on real enjoyments to be kept as equal as possible for large and small means 4 tax as few articles as possible england taxes only a very small number of imports the united states taxes nearly everything imported 5 tax stimulants freely the united states collect 91000000 from spirits and liquors and 42000000 from tobacco 1883 6 tax imports of commodities not made at home or whose home production is under an excise internal revenue duty equal to the customs tax 7 keep the rate of tax low in order to get most revenue     chapter v of a national debt    § 1 is it desirable to defray extraordinary public expenses by loans   the question must now be considered how far it is right or expedient to raise money for the purposes of government not by laying on taxes to the amount required but by taking a portion of the capital of the country in the form of a loan and charging the public revenue with only the interest  this question has already been touched upon in the first book355 we remarked that if the capital taken in loans is abstracted from funds either engaged in production or destined to be employed in it their diversion from that purpose is equivalent to taking the amount from the wages of the laboringclasses borrowing in this case is not a substitute for raising the supplies within the year a government which borrows does actually take the amount within the year and that too by a tax exclusively on the laboringclasses than which it could have done nothing worse if it had supplied its wants by avowed taxation and in that case the transaction and its evils would have ended with the emergency while by the circuitous mode adopted the value exacted from the laborers is gained not by the state but by the employers of labor the state remaining charged with the debt besides and with its interest in perpetuity the system of public loans in such circumstances may be pronounced the very worst which in the present state of civilization is still included in the catalogue of financial expedients  we however remarked that there are other circumstances in which loans are not chargeable with these pernicious consequences namely first when what is borrowed is foreign capital the overflowings of the general accumulation of the world or secondly when it is capital which either would not have been saved at all unless this mode of investment had been open to it or after being saved would have been wasted in unproductive enterprises or sent to seek employment in foreign countries when the progress of accumulation has reduced profits either to the ultimate or to the practical minimum—to the rate less than which would either put a stop to the increase of capital or send the whole of the new accumulations abroad—government may annually intercept these new accumulations without trenching on the employment or wages of the laboringclasses in the country itself or perhaps in any other country to this extent therefore the loan system may be carried without being liable to the utter and peremptory condemnation which is due to it when it overpasses this limit what is wanted is an index to determine whether in any given series of years as during the last great war for example the limit has been exceeded or not  such an index exists at once a certain and an obvious one did the government by its loan operations augment the rate of interest if it only opened a channel for capital which would not otherwise have been accumulated or which if accumulated would not have been employed within the country this implies that the capital which the government took and expended could not have found employment at the existing rate of interest so long as the loans do no more than absorb this surplus they prevent any tendency to a fall of the rate of interest but they can not occasion any rise but to the full extent to which the loans of government during the war caused the rate of interest to exceed what it was before and what it has been since those loans are chargeable with all the evils which have been described if it be objected that interest only rose because profits rose i reply that this does not weaken but strengthens the argument if the government loans produced the rise of profits by the great amount of capital which they absorbed by what means can they have had this effect unless by lowering the wages of labor it will perhaps be said that what kept profits high during the war was not the drafts made on the national capital by the loans but the rapid progress of industrial improvements this in a great measure was the fact and it no doubt alleviated the hardship to the laboringclasses and made the financial system which was pursued less actively mischievous but not less contrary to principle these very improvements in industry made room for a larger amount of capital and the government by draining away a great part of the annual accumulations did not indeed prevent that capital from existing ultimately for it started into existence with great rapidity after the peace but prevented it from existing at the time and subtracted just so much while the war lasted from distribution among productive laborers if the government had abstained from taking this capital by loan and had allowed it to reach the laborers but had raised the supplies which it required by a direct tax on the laboringclasses it would have produced in every respect but the expense and inconvenience of collecting the tax the very same economical effects which it did produce except that we should not now have had the debt the course it actually took was therefore worse than the very worst mode which it could possibly have adopted of raising the supplies within the year and the only excuse or justification which it admits of so far as that excuse could be truly pleaded was hard necessity the impossibility of raising so enormous an annual sum by taxation without resorting to taxes which from their odiousness or from the facility of evasion it would have been found impracticable to enforce356  when government loans are limited to the overflowings of the national capital or to those accumulations which would not take place at all unless suffered to overflow they are at least not liable to this grave condemnation in this case therefore the question really is what it is commonly supposed to be in all cases—namely a choice between a great sacrifice at once and a small one indefinitely prolonged on this matter it seems rational to think that the prudence of a nation will dictate the same conduct as the prudence of an individual to submit to as much of the privation immediately as can easily be borne and only when any further burden would distress or cripple them too much to provide for the remainder by mortgaging their future income it is an excellent maxim to make present resources suffice for present wants the future will have its own wants to provide for on the other hand it may reasonably be taken into consideration that in a country increasing in wealth the necessary expenses of government do not increase in the same ratio as capital or population any burden therefore is always less and less felt and since those extraordinary expenses of government which are fit to be incurred at all are mostly beneficial beyond the existing generation there is no injustice in making posterity pay a part of the price if the inconvenience would be extreme of defraying the whole of it by the exertions and sacrifices of the generation which first incurred it    § 2 not desirable to redeem a national debt by a general contribution   when a country wisely or unwisely has burdened itself with a debt is it expedient to take steps for redeeming that debt in principle it is impossible not to maintain the affirmative  two modes have been contemplated of paying off a national debt either at once by a general contribution or gradually by a surplus revenue the first would be incomparably the best if it were practicable and it would be practicable if it could justly be done by assessment on property alone if property bore the whole interest of the debt property might with great advantage to itself pay it off since this would be merely surrendering to a creditor the principal sum the whole annual proceeds of which were already his by law and would be equivalent to what a landowner does when he sells part of his estate to free the remainder from a mortgage but property it need hardly be said does not pay and can not justly be required to pay the whole interest of the debt whatever is the fitting contribution from property to the general expenses of the state in the same and in no greater proportion should it contribute toward either the interest or the repayment of the national debt this however if admitted is fatal to any scheme for the extinction of the debt by a general assessment on the community persons of property could pay their share of the amount by a sacrifice of property and have the same net income as before                               illustration       if a person owns a property a b which returns him 1000 income     and if he pays 10 a year in taxes as his share of interest on the     public debt suppose that part of his estate represented by x     which returns him annually 10 and which return he has annually     handed over to the state to be carved out of it and that he is     to be hereafter relieved of his share of taxes he would then     after having paid the capitalized value x of that which was his     share of the annual tax to the state on account of the public     debt have the same net income as before for he was never able to     enjoy the income of x   if those who have no accumulations but only incomes were required to make up by a single payment the equivalent of the annual charge laid on them by the taxes maintained to pay the interest of the debt they could only do so by incurring a private debt equal to their share of the public debt while from the insufficiency in most cases of the security which they could give the interest would amount to a much larger annual sum than their share of that now paid by the state besides a collective debt defrayed by taxes has over the same debt parceled out among individuals the immense advantage that it is virtually a mutual insurance among the contributors if the fortune of a contributor diminishes his taxes diminish if he is ruined they cease altogether and his portion of the debt is wholly transferred to the solvent members of the community if it were laid on him as a private obligation he would still be liable to it even when penniless  when the state possesses property in land or otherwise which there are not strong reasons of public utility for its retaining at its disposal this should be employed as far as it will go in extinguishing debt any casual gain or godsend is naturally devoted to the same purpose beyond this the only mode which is both just and feasible of extinguishing or reducing a national debt is by means of a surplus revenue    § 3 in what cases desirable to maintain a surplus revenue for the redemption of debt   the desirableness per se of maintaining a surplus for this purpose does not i think admit of a doubt  it is not however advisable in all cases to maintain a surplus revenue for the extinction of debt the advantage of paying off the national debt is that it would enable us to get rid of the worst half of our taxation but of this worst half some portions must be worse than others and to get rid of those would be a greater benefit proportionally than to get rid of the rest if renouncing a surplus revenue would enable us to dispense with a tax we ought to consider the very worst of all our taxes as precisely the one which we are keeping up for the sake of ultimately abolishing taxes not so bad as itself in a country advancing in wealth whose increasing revenue gives it the power of ridding itself from time to time of the most inconvenient portions of its taxation i conceive that the increase of revenue should rather be disposed of by taking off taxes than by liquidating debt as long as any very objectionable imposts remain in the present state of england therefore i hold it to be good policy in the government when it has a surplus of an apparently permanent character to take off taxes provided these are rightly selected even when no taxes remain but such as are not unfit to form part of a permanent system it is wise to continue the same policy by experimental reductions of those taxes until the point is discovered at which a given amount of revenue can be raised with the smallest pressure on the contributors after this such surplus revenue as might arise from any further increase of the produce of the taxes should not i conceive be remitted but applied to the redemption of debt eventually it might be expedient to appropriate the entire produce of particular taxes to this purpose since there would be more assurance that the liquidation would be persisted in if the fund destined to it were kept apart and not blended with the general revenues of the state the succession duties would be peculiarly suited to such a purpose since taxes paid as they are out of capital would be better employed in reimbursing capital than in defraying current expenditure if this separate appropriation were made any surplus afterward arising from the increasing produce of the other taxes and from the saving of interest on the successive portions of debt paid off might form a ground for a remission of taxation       the relative amount of the united states public debt may be seen     by chart no xxii from an early date down to 1880 since the war     the surplus revenue of the united states has been constantly     appropriated for the payment of the public debt incurred during     the late war until what with the reduction of debt and the fall     in the interest charge our income is now so much greater than     expenditure that we are 1884 actually in difficulties owing to     the surplus to the present time the treasury has been able to use     its excess of receipts in redeeming matured debt but the rapidity     of the payment has been such that in two years or more no matured     debt will exist to be redeemed 250000000 of 4½ per cent bonds     remain but they do not fall due until 1891 and the 4 per cent     bonds to the amount of 737620700 do not mature until 1907     having once raised a large revenue under war pressure it seems     very difficult for people to understand now why heavy duties were     originally levied and the extraordinary suggestion is often made     that the surplus should remain and new channels of expenditure     should be made such as enormous pensions simply in order to     keep up the heavy taxation the difficulty is however that the     unnecessary surplus exists because of customs duties levied for     war purposes but the heavy burden of war taxation ought not to be     continued adding to the cost of production in all industries     without doing a greater wrong than would be done by the     passing—and only possible—trouble of a redistribution of capital     in a few cases especially since that distribution of capital will     be one from less productive to more productive industries     otherwise no change would be made      the condition of foreign debts and the progress made in their     reduction may be studied in chart no xxiii that of the united     states is exceptional the interestbearing debt as given by the     last report of the secretary of the treasury 1883 has been     reduced to 1312446050 and the reduction is more striking than     is indicated in the chart for the year 1880                         illustration chart xxiii        chart xxiii reduction of national debts in various countries     chapter vi of an interference of government grounded on erroneous theories    § 1 the doctrine of protection to native industry   we proceed to the functions of government which belong to what i have termed for want of a better designation the optional class those which are sometimes assumed by governments and sometimes not and which it is not unanimously admitted that they ought to exercise we will begin by passing in review false theories which have from time to time formed the ground of acts of government more or less economically injurious  of these false theories the most notable is the doctrine of protection to native industry—a phrase meaning the prohibition or the discouragement by heavy duties of such foreign commodities as are capable of being produced at home if the theory involved in this system had been correct the practical conclusions grounded on it would not have been unreasonable the theory was that to buy things produced at home was a national benefit and the introduction of foreign commodities generally a national loss it being at the same time evident that the interest of the consumer is to buy foreign commodities in preference to domestic whenever they are either cheaper or better the interest of the consumer appeared in this respect to be contrary to the public interest he was certain if left to his own inclinations to do what according to the theory was injurious to the public  it was shown however in our analysis of the effects of international trade as it had been often shown by former writers that the importation of foreign commodities in the common course of traffic never takes place except when it is economically speaking a national good by causing the same amount of commodities to be obtained at a smaller cost of labor and capital to the country to prohibit therefore this importation or impose duties which prevent it is to render the labor and capital of the country less efficient in production than they would otherwise be and compel a waste of the difference between the labor and capital necessary for the home production of the commodity and that which is required for producing the things with which it can be purchased from abroad the amount of national loss thus occasioned is measured by the excess of the price at which the commodity is produced over that at which it could be imported in the case of manufactured goods the whole difference between the two prices is absorbed in indemnifying the producers for waste of labor or of the capital which supports that labor those who are supposed to be benefited namely the makers of the protected articles unless they form an exclusive company and have a monopoly against their own countrymen as well as against foreigners do not obtain higher profits than other people all is sheer loss to the country as well as to the consumer       of the industries in a country some are said to “need protection”     and others not—that is those industries which are carried on at a     relative disadvantage are the only ones which need protection in     order that they may continue in operation by relative     disadvantage is meant a greater relative cost or sacrifice to     the same amount of labor and capital those industries which can     not yield so great a value for the labor and capital engaged in     them as other more profitable industries are those which are said     to “need protection” wherever protective duties exist it is     implied by those who lay them on that there production is carried     on under more onerous conditions than in other competing places or     occupations after duties are thus supposed to have protected the     less advantageously situated occupations it may be said that all     industries will then have an equal chance “no doubt” as mr     cairnes says “they would be equalized just as by compelling every     one to move about with a weight attached to his leg the weight     would indeed be an impediment to locomotion but provided it     were in each case exactly proportioned to the strength of the limb     which drew it no one  would have any reason to complain no     one would walk as fast as if his limbs were free but then his     neighbor would be equally fettered and if it took him twice as     long to reach his destination as before he would at least have     company on his journey”357    § 2 —had its origin in the mercantile system   the restrictive and prohibitory policy was originally grounded on what is called the mercantile system which representing the advantage of foreign trade to consist solely in bringing money into the country gave artificial encouragement to exportation of goods and discountenanced their importation the only exceptions to the system were those required by the system itself the materials and instruments of production were the subject of a contrary policy directed however to the same end they were freely imported and not permitted to be exported in order that manufacturers being more cheaply supplied with the requisites of manufacture might be able to sell cheaper and therefore to export more largely for a similar reason importation was allowed and even favored when confined to the productions of countries which were supposed to take from the country still more than it took from them thus enriching it by a favorable balance of trade as part of the same system colonies were founded for the supposed advantage of compelling them to buy our commodities or at all events not to buy those of any other country in return for which restriction we were generally willing to come under an equivalent obligation with respect to the staple productions of the colonists the consequences of the theory were pushed so far that it was not unusual even to give bounties on exportation and induce foreigners to buy from england rather than from other countries by a cheapness which england artificially produced by paying part of the price for them out of their own taxes this is a stretch beyond the point yet reached by any private tradesman in his competition for business no shopkeeper i should think ever made a practice of bribing customers by selling goods to them at a permanent loss making it up to himself from other funds in his possession  the principle of the mercantile theory is now given up even by writers and governments who still cling to the restrictive system whatever hold that system has over men’s minds independently of the private interests exposed to real or apprehended loss by its abandonment is derived from fallacies other than the old notion of the benefits of heaping up money in the country the most effective of these is the specious plea of employing our own countrymen and our national industry instead of feeding and supporting the industry of foreigners the answer to this from the principles laid down in former chapters is evident without reverting to the fundamental theorem discussed in an early part of the present treatise358 respecting the nature and sources of employment for labor it is sufficient to say what has usually been said by the advocates of free trade that the alternative is not between employing our own people and foreigners but between employing one class and another of our own people the imported commodity is always paid for directly or indirectly with the produce of our own industry that industry being at the same time rendered more productive since with the same labor and outlay we are enabled to possess ourselves of a greater quantity of the article those who have not well considered the subject are apt to suppose that our exporting an equivalent in our own produce for the foreign articles we consume depends on contingencies—on the consent of foreign countries to make some corresponding relaxation of their own restrictions or on the question whether those from whom we buy are induced by that circumstance to buy more from us and that if these things or things equivalent to them do not happen the payment must be made in money now in the first place there is nothing more objectionable in a money payment than in payment by any other medium if the state of the market makes it the most advantageous remittance and the money itself was first acquired and would again be replenished by the export of an equivalent value of our own products but in the next place a very short interval of paying in money would so lower prices as either to stop a part of the importation or raise up a foreign demand for our produce sufficient to pay for the imports i grant that this disturbance of the equation of international demand would be in some degree to our disadvantage in the purchase of other imported articles and that a country which prohibits some foreign commodities does cæteris paribus obtain those which it does not prohibit at a less price than it would otherwise have to pay to express the same thing in other words a country which destroys or prevents altogether certain branches of foreign trade thereby annihilating a general gain to the world which would be shared in some proportion between itself and other countries does in some circumstances draw to itself at the expense of foreigners a larger share than would else belong to it of the gain arising from that portion of its foreign trade which it suffers to subsist but even this it can only be enabled to do if foreigners do not maintain equivalent prohibitions or restrictions against its commodities in any case the justice or expediency of destroying one of two gains in order to engross a rather larger share of the other does not require much discussion the gain too which is destroyed being in proportion to the magnitude of the transactions the larger of the two since it is the one which capital left to itself is supposed to seek by preference    § 3 —supported by pleas of national subsistence and national defense   defeated as a general theory the protectionist doctrine finds support in some particular cases from considerations which when really in point involve greater interests than mere saving of labor—the interests of national subsistence and of national defense359 the discussions on the corn laws have familiarized everybody with the plea that we ought to be independent of foreigners for the food of the people and the navigation laws were grounded in theory and profession on the necessity of keeping up a “nursery of seamen” for the navy on this last subject i at once admit that the object is worth the sacrifice and that a country exposed to invasion by sea if it can not otherwise have sufficient ships and sailors of its own to secure the means of manning on an emergency an adequate fleet is quite right in obtaining those means even at an economical sacrifice in point of cheapness of transport when the english navigation laws were enacted the dutch from their maritime skill and their low rate of profit at home were able to carry for other nations england included at cheaper rates than those nations could carry for themselves which placed all other countries at a great comparative disadvantage in obtaining experienced seamen for their ships of war the navigation laws by which this deficiency was remedied and at the same time a blow struck against the maritime power of a nation with which england was then frequently engaged in hostilities were probably though economically disadvantageous politically expedient but english ships and sailors can now navigate as cheaply as those of any other country maintaining at least an equal competition with the other maritime nations even in their own trade the ends which may once have justified navigation laws require them no longer and afford no reason for maintaining this invidious exception to the general rule of free trade       since the introduction of steamships and the advance of invention     in naval contrivances the plea for navigation laws on the ground     that they keep up a “nursery of seamen” for the navy is     practically obsolete the “seaman” employed on the modern naval     ships more nearly resembles the artisan in a manufacturing     establishment he need have but comparatively little knowledge of     the sea since the days of sailingvessels have passed by so far     as naval warfare is concerned steam and mechanical appliances now     do what was before done by wind and sail      while mr mill thinks navigation laws were economically—that is     so far as increase of wealth is concerned—disadvantageous yet he     believes that they may have been “politically expedient” it is     possible for example that retaliation by the united states and     other countries against england early in this century brought     about the remission of the english restrictions on foreign     shipping but it is quite another thing to say that such laws     produced an ability to sail ships more cheaply that the english     navigation acts of 1651 built up english shipping is not supported     by many proofs whereas it is very distinctly shown that english     shipping languished and suffered under them360 moreover under     the régime of steam and iron which drew out england’s peculiar     advantages in iron and coal in all its history english shipping     never prospered more than it has since the abolition in 1849 of     the navigation laws—events which have taken place since mr mill     wrote      the united states is still weighed down by navigation laws adapted     to mediæval conditions and the relics of a time when retaliation     was the cause of their enactment so long as wooden vessels did     the carryingtrade the natural advantages of the united states     gave us a proud position on the ocean now however when it is a     question of cheaper iron steel and coal for vessels of iron and     steel we are at a possible disadvantage and the bulk of     navigation laws proposed in these days are intended to draw     capital either by raising prices through duties on ships and     materials or by outright bounties and subsidies from industries     in which we have advantages to building ships and until of late     no distinction has been made between shipbuilding and shipowning     or shipsailing within the last year 1884 many burdens on     shipsailing have been removed but even when we are permitted to     sail ships on equal terms with foreigners we can not yet build     them with as small a cost as england which is proved by the very     demand of the builders of iron vessels for the retention of     protective duties and our laws do not as yet allow us to buy     ships abroad and sail them under our own flag361   with regard to subsistence the plea of the protectionists has been so often and so triumphantly met that it requires little notice here that country is the most steadily as well as the most abundantly supplied with food which draws its supplies from the largest surface it is ridiculous to found a general system of policy on so improbable a danger as that of being at war with all the nations of the world at once or to suppose that even if inferior at sea a whole country could be blockaded like a town or that the growers of food in other countries would not be as anxious not to lose an advantageous market as we should be not to be deprived of their corn  in countries in which the system of protection is declining but not yet wholly given up such as the united states a doctrine has come into notice which is a sort of compromise between free trade and restriction namely that protection for protection’s sake is improper but that there is nothing objectionable in having as much protection as may incidentally result from a tariff framed solely for revenue even in england regret is sometimes expressed that a “moderate fixed duty” was not preserved on corn on account of the revenue it would yield independently however of the general impolicy of taxes on the necessaries of life this doctrine overlooks the fact that revenue is received only on the quantity imported but that the tax is paid on the entire quantity consumed to make the public pay much that the treasury may receive a little is no eligible mode of obtaining a revenue in the case of manufactured articles the doctrine involves a palpable inconsistency the object of the duty as a means of revenue is inconsistent with its affording even incidentally any protection it can only operate as protection in so far as it prevents importation and to whatever degree it prevents importation it affords no revenue    § 4 —on the ground of encouraging young industries colonial policy   the only case in which on mere principles of political economy protecting duties can be defensible is when they are imposed temporarily especially in a young and rising nation in hopes of naturalizing a foreign industry in itself perfectly suitable to the circumstances of the country the superiority of one country over another in a branch of production often arises only from having begun it sooner there may be no inherent advantage on one part or disadvantage on the other but only a present superiority of acquired skill and experience a country which has this skill and experience yet to acquire may in other respects be better adapted to the production than those which were earlier in the field and besides it is a just remark of mr rae that nothing has a greater tendency to promote improvements in any branch of production than its trial under a new set of conditions but it can not be expected that individuals should at their own risk or rather to their certain loss introduce a new manufacture and bear the burden of carrying it on until the producers have been educated up to the level of those with whom the processes are traditional a protecting duty continued for a reasonable time will sometimes be the least inconvenient mode in which the nation can tax itself for the support of such an experiment but the protection should be confined to cases in which there is good ground of assurance that the industry which it fosters will after a time be able to dispense with it nor should the domestic producers ever be allowed to expect that it will be continued to them beyond the time necessary for a fair trial of what they are capable of accomplishing       the great difficulty with this proposal is that it introduces     what is inconsistent with mr mill’s general system the     socialistic basis of statehelp instead of selfhelp if     industries will never support themselves then of course it is a     misappropriation of the property of its citizens whenever a     government takes a slice by taxation from productive industries     and gives it to a less productive one to make up its deficiencies     the only possible theory of protection to young industries is     that if protected for a season the industries may soon grow     strong and stand alone mr mill never contemplated anything else     but the difficulty is constantly met with in putting this theory     into practice that the industry once that it has learned to     depend on the help of the state never reaches a stage when it is     willing to give up the assistance of the duties dependence on     legislation begets a want of selfreliance and destroys the     stimulus to progress and good management it is said “there has     never been an instance in the history of the country where the     representatives of such industries who have enjoyed protection     for a long series of years have been willing to submit to a     reduction of the tariff or have proposed it but on the     contrary their demands for still higher and higher duties are     insatiable and never intermitted”362 the question of fact as     to whether or not the united states is indebted for its present     manufacturing position to protection when our industries were     young seems to be capable of answer and an answer which shows     that protection was imposed generally after the industries got a     foothold and that very little assistance was derived from the     duties on imports363      the following explanation by mr mill364 of the meaning put upon     his argument of protection to young industries by those who have     applied it to the united states will be of no slight interest   “the passage has been made use of to show the inapplicability of free trade to the united states and for similar purpose in the australian colonies erroneously in my opinion but certainly with more plausibility than can be the case in the united states for australia really is a new country whose capabilities for carrying on manufactures can not yet be said to have been tested but the manufacturing parts of the united states—new england and pennsylvania—are no longer new countries they have carried on manufactures on a large scale and with the benefit of high protecting duties for at least two generations their operatives have had full time to acquire the manufacturing skill in which those of england had preceded them there has been ample experience to prove that the alleged inability of their manufactures to compete in the american market with those of great britain does not arise merely from the more recent date of their establishment but from the fact that american labor and capital can in the present circumstances of america be employed with greater return and greater advantage to the national wealth in the production of other articles i have never for a moment recommended or countenanced any protecting industry except for the purpose of enabling the protected branch of industry in a very moderate time to become independent of protection that moderate time in the united states has been exceeded and if the cotton and iron of america still need protection against those of the other hemisphere it is in my eyes a complete proof that they aught not to have it and that the longer it is continued the greater the injustice and the waste of national resources will be”  there is only one part of the protectionist scheme which requires any further notice its policy toward colonies and foreign dependencies that of compelling them to trade exclusively with the dominant country a country which thus secures to itself an extra foreign demand for its commodities undoubtedly gives itself some advantage in the distribution of the general gains of the commercial world since however it causes the industry and capital of the colony to be diverted from channels which are proved to be the most productive inasmuch as they are those into which industry and capital spontaneously tend to flow there is a loss on the whole to the productive powers of the world and the mothercountry does not gain so much as she makes the colony lose if therefore the mothercountry refuses to acknowledge any reciprocity of obligations she imposes a tribute on the colony in an indirect mode greatly more oppressive and injurious than the direct    § 5 —on the ground of high wages       the discussion by mr cairnes on the question of wages as affected     by the tariff is such that i have quoted it as fully as possible     “the position taken in the united states is that protection is     only needed and only asked for where american industry is placed     under a disadvantage as compared with the industry of foreign     countries the rates of wages measured in money are higher in     the united states than in europe and therefore it is argued     the cost of producing commodities is higher the high rates of     wages in the united states are not peculiar to any branch of     industry but are universal throughout its whole range if     therefore a high rate of wages proves a high cost of production     and a high cost of production proves a need of protection it     follows that the farmers of illinois and the cottonplanters of     the southern states stand in as much need of fostering legislation     as the cottonspinners of new england or the ironmasters of     pennsylvania a criterion which leads to such results must i     think be regarded as sufficiently condemned the fallacy is in     truth  that all industries are not in each country equally     favored or disfavored by nature and have not therefore equal     need of this protecting care if american protectionists are not     prepared to demand protective duties in favor of the illinois     farmer against the competition of his english rival they are     bound to admit either that a high cost of production is not     incompatible with effective competition or else that a high rate     of wages does not prove a high cost of production and if this is     not so in illinois then i wish to know why the case should be     different in pennsylvania or in new england if a high rate of     wages in the first of these states be consistent with a low cost     of production why may not a high rate of wages in pennsylvania be     consistent with a low cost of producing coal and iron      “the rate of wages whether measured in money or in the real     remuneration of the laborer affords an approximate criterion of     the cost of production365 either of money or of the     commodities that enter into the laborer’s real remuneration but     in a sense the inverse of that in which it is understood in the     argument under consideration in other words a high rate of     wages indicates not a high but a low cost of production366      thus in the united states the rate of wages is high whether     measured in gold or in the most important articles of the     laborer’s consumption—a fact which proves that the cost of     producing gold as well as that of producing those other     commodities is low in the united states i would ask     objectors to consider what are the true causes of the high     remuneration of american industry it will surely be admitted     that in the last resort these resolve themselves into the one     great fact of its high productive power i must therefore     contend that the high scale of industrial remuneration in america     instead of being evidence of a high cost of production in that     country is distinctly evidence of a low cost of production—of a     low cost of production that is to say in the first place of     gold and in the next of the commodities which mainly constitute     the real wages of labor—a description which embraces at once the     most important raw materials of industry and the most important     articles of general consumption as regards commodities not     included in this description the criterion of wages stands in no     constant relation of any kind to their cost and is therefore     simply irrelevant to the point at issue and now we may see what     this claim for protection to american industry founded on the     high scale of american remuneration really comes to it is a     demand for special legislative aid in consideration of the     possession of special industrial facilities—a complaint in short     against the exceptional bounty of nature      “perhaps i shall here be asked how if the case be so—if the high     rate of industrial remuneration in america be only evidence of a     low cost of production—the fact is to be explained since fact it     undoubtedly is that the people of the united states are unable to     compete in neutral markets in the sale of certain important     wares with england and other european countries367 no one will     say that the people of new england new york and pennsylvania     are deficient in any industrial qualities possessed by the workmen     of any country in the world how happens it then that enjoying     industrial advantages superior to other countries they are yet     unable to hold their own against them in the general markets of     commerce i shall endeavor to meet this objection fairly and in     the first place let me state what my contention is with regard to     the cost of production in america i do not contend that it is low     in the case of all commodities capable of being produced in the     country but only in that of a large very important but still     limited group with regard to commodities lying outside this     group i hold that the rate of wages is simply no evidence as to     the cost of their production one way or the other but secondly     i beg the reader to consider what is meant by the alleged     ‘inability’ of new england and pennsylvania to compete let us     say with manchester and sheffield in the manufacture of calico     and cutlery what it means and what it only can mean is that     they are unable to do so consistently with obtaining that rate of     remuneration on their industry which is current in the united     states if only american laborers and capitalists would be     content with the wages and profits current in great britain there     is nothing that i know of to prevent them from holding their own     in any markets to which manchester and sheffield can send their     wares and this brings us to the heart of the question over a     large portion of the great field of industry the people of the     united states enjoy as compared with those of europe 1     advantages of a very exceptional kind over the rest 2 the     advantage is less decided or 3 they stand on a par with     europeans or 4 possibly they are in some instances at a     disadvantage engaging in the branches of industry in which their     advantage over europe is great they reap industrial returns     proportionally great and so long as they confine themselves to     these occupations they can compete in neutral markets against all     the world and still secure the high rewards accruing from their     exceptionally rich resources but the people of the union decline     to confine themselves within these liberal bounds they would     cover the whole domain of industrial activity and think it hard     that they should not reap the same rich harvests from every part     of the field they must descend into the arena with sheffield and     manchester and yet secure the rewards of chicago and st louis     they must employ european conditions of production and obtain     american results what is this but to quarrel with the laws of     nature these laws have assigned to an extensive range of     industries carried on in the united states a high scale of return     far in excess of what europe can command to a few others a return     on a scale not exceeding the european proportion american     enterprise would engage in all departments alike and obtain upon     all the high rewards which nature has assigned only to some here     we find the real meaning of the ‘inability’ of americans to     compete with the ‘pauper labor’ of europe they can not do so and     at the same time secure the american rate of return on their work     the inability no doubt exists but it is one created not by the     drawbacks but by the exceptional advantages of their position it     is as if a skilled artisan should complain that he could not     compete with the hedger and ditcher let him only be content with     the hedger and ditcher’s rate of pay and there will be nothing to     prevent him from entering the lists even against this rival”368      it is often said that wages are kept at a high rate in the united     states by the existence of protected industries on the other     hand the truth is that the protected industries must pay the     current high rate of wages fixed by the general productiveness of     all industries in the country when the facts are investigated it     is surprising how small a portion of the laborers of the united     states are employed in occupations which owe their existence to     the tariff a general view of the relative numbers engaged in     different occupations may be seen by reference to chart no xxiv     based on the returns for the census of 1880 the data are well     worth examination369      1 agriculture                  7670493     2 manufacturing               3837112     mechanical and mining     3 trade and transportation     1810256     4 professional and personal    4074238     services     all occupations                  17392099                         illustration chart xxiv        chart xxiv chart showing for the united states in 1880 the      ratio between the total population over ten years of age and the      number of persons reported as engaged in each principal class of        gainful occupations compiled from the returns of the tenth      census by the editor note—the interior square represents the     proportion of the population which is accounted for as engaged in       gainful occupations the unshaded space between the inner and      outer squares represents the proportion of the population not so                               accounted for       of the second class less than 450000 workpeople are engaged in     the chief protected industries—cotton woolen and iron and steel     combined this class it is to be noted in the census returns     includes bakers blacksmiths brickmakers builders butchers     cabinetmakers carpenters carriagemakers and so on through the     whole list of similar occupations practically unaffected by the     tariff so far as protection to them is concerned so that at     the most there are less than a million laborers engaged in     industries directly dependent on the tariff and the number is     undoubtedly very much less than a million when some writers     assert therefore that the existence of customsduties allows     industries even including all those employed in producing cotton     wool iron and steel to employ less than a million laborers in     such a way that the remuneration is fixed for the remaining     16000000 laborers in the united states keeping wages high for     16000000 by paying current wages for less than a million the     extravagance and ignorance of the statement are at once apparent     while on the other hand it is distinctly seen that the causes     fixing the generally high rates of wages for the 16000000 are     those governing the majority of occupations and that the less     than one million must be paid the wages which can be obtained     elsewhere in the more productive industries the facts thus     strikingly bear out the principles as stated above      confirmation—if confirmation now seems necessary—may be found in a     study370 by our ablest statistician francis a walker upon the     causes which have operated on the growth of american manufactures     this growth has not been commensurate he finds with the     remarkable inventive and industrial capacity of our people and     with the richness of our national resources “i answer that the     cause of that comparative failure is found primarily and     principally in the extraordinary success of our agriculture as     already intimated in what has been said of the investment of     capital the enormous profits of cultivating a virgin soil without     the need of artificial fertilization the advantages which a     sparse population derives from the privilege of selecting for     tillage only the choicest spots371 those most accessible most     fertile most easily brought under the plow and the consequent     abundance of food and other necessaries enjoyed by the     agricultural class have tended continually to disparage     mechanical industries in the eyes alike of the capitalist     looking to the most remunerative investment of his savings and of     the laborer seeking that avocation which should promise the most     liberal and constant support      “it has been the competition of the farm with the shop which     throughout the entire century of our national independence has     most effectually hindered the growth of manufactures a people who     are privileged to cultivate a reasonably fertile soil under the     conditions indicated above can secure for themselves subsistence     up to the highest limit of physical wellbeing if that people     possess the added advantage of great skill in the use of tools     and great adroitness in meeting the large and the little     exigencies of the occupation and cultivation of the soil the     fruits of their labor will include not only everything which is     essential to health and comfort but much that is of the nature of     luxury”      it remains to be said in this connection that workmen are already     discerning the practical and real causes at work affecting their     wages—affecting them more directly than any tariff system possibly     could—by showing no small alarm at the immigration of foreigners     such as the hungarian miners and italian laborers who willingly     underbid them in other words they are beginning to realize in a     practical way the truth that increasing numbers are far more     potent than anything else in reducing wages so long as     immigration is free to any race or nationality there is no such     thing as “protection to home laborers” the only protection to     them—not that i am urging the desirability of such measures—can     come solely from forces which limit the number of workmen who     enter into competition with them any other protection to     laboringmen than the prohibition of immigration—which no one     thinks of except for the chinese—is an economic delusion     instead of “protecting” them to the extent of affording higher     wages the tariff increases the cost of woolen clothing and other     articles of their consumption in addition to forcing capital into     employments which yield a less return and so insure lower wages    § 6 —on the ground of creating a diversity of industries       it must be kept in mind that political economy deals only with the     phenomena of material wealth it does not supply ethical or     political grounds of action it is quite conceivable that a     legislator in coming to a decision may have to balance economic     gains against moral or political losses and may choose to give up     the former to prevent the latter but the economic truth remains     unchanged political economy for instance to the question is     there any gain in international trade answers unequivocally     yes would it be a loss of wealth to the community to have the     goods formerly bought abroad now produced at home the answer is     certainly it would but here it has been ably urged by intelligent     writers that a state has other ends to gain than the accumulation     of mere riches that it must aim to secure the greatest moral     social and elevating influences possible for the workingclasses     and that while free exchange of goods may add to wealth it may     injure the social and political wellbeing of a nation so far as     these are social and political questions they do not belong to     political economy but the commonest form of argument is that     under free exchange the united states would become purely an     “agricultural” country its social horizon would become narrowed     and a lower standard of industrial activity would then ensue     instead of which it is said we should by protection keep in     existence diversified industries by which the national mind may be     better stimulated and greater enterprise may be encouraged in all     branches of industry this argument for “diversity of industries”     however is not merely a sociological question it can only be     fully discussed from an economic standpoint and deserves even     more than the brief attention we can give it here      in the first place as soon as any purely agricultural country     gains even a slight density of population—a density only such as     to warrant the introduction of the principle of division of     labor—there comes an inevitable differentiation of pursuits     wholly outside of legislation and through the operation of     natural causes not all of any population is required in     agriculture to provide the whole with food by a division of     labor one man in agriculture can produce the sustenance of     himself and many others “the united states have at the present     time but five persons engaged in agriculture for each square mile     of settled area” by the side of the farm must early spring up a     wide circle of industries—the shoemaker the carpenter the     blacksmith the wagonmaker the painter the builder the mason     and all the ordinary employments which arise in any small     community from the earliest division of labor moreover     “agriculture” is often used in a too limited sense as confined to     producing food alone although even in that limited sense     employing nearly one half of the total number of our laborers in     a new country the natural field of employment is found in the     “extractive industries” which include the preparation for the     market not only of food but also of all ores coal minerals     oils hides leather wool lumber and the industries intimately     connected with them all the employments which transport these     from one part of the country to another employing at present over     one ninth of all our laborers and professional and personal     services of an extended variety even therefore if we were     obliged to forego manufactures entirely the “extractive     industries” would necessarily involve a very extensive diversity     of employments      the real question however for most persons centers in the next     stage of the industrial evolution—that of the manufactures of     these abovementioned products of the “extractive industries” it     will be remembered here that a country does not possess an equal     ability in producing each of these or any commodities the timber     formerly near great rivers may vanish into the interior the     oilsources may be more or less fertile or the oredeposits may     be more or less rich more or less accessible than those of other     countries this being understood then as soon as the demand in     the country calls for an increased quantity of a particular     article the cost may increase under the law of diminishing     returns until a foreign country—having inferior agents of     production as compared with our best—may be able to send supplies     into our markets it all depends on whether the united states     wants more articles than can be produced on grades of natural     agents superior to those possessed by foreigners taking cost of     carriage to this country into consideration even though foreign     competition appears when we reach poorer grades of natural agents     it does not follow that some of the particular articles will not     be produced what ought to be clear is that untrammeled exchange     between countries will not prevent the existence of various     industries but only limit production to those grades of agents     which are its best this may be better seen by a simple diagram      iron and coal england         7   6   5   4   3   2   1     iron and coal united states   4   3   2   1     wheat england                 4   3   2   1     wheat united states           7   6   5   4   3   2   1      england may have seven different grades of productiveness in her     iron and coal supplies of which her grades 1 2 and 3 are     superior to the best grade of the united states while grades 1     2 3 and 4 in the united states may compare only with grades 4     5 6 7 of england so long as england can supply herself and the     united states also with coal and iron from the three superior     grades the united states can not work grade 1 at home but if the     supply for england and the world requires grade 5 to be worked     then the united states can begin the industry on her best grade     although that is far inferior to the best grade in england     likewise if the united states has three grades of wheatland     superior to england’s best grade the ability of england to grow     wheat depends on whether the united states can or can not supply     both herself and england from grades 1 2 and 3 if we must     resort to grade 4 then england can begin to grow wheat as well as     we in short under a system of free exchange as great a     diversity as under protection is probably possible but only in     such a way that the best possible advantages in each particular     industry are employed smaller amounts in some branches and     greater amounts in others may be produced under a free than under     a restrictive system but with all the greater gain which arises     from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade the most poorly     endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up but not     the whole industry itself no class of persons feel the     competition of rivals more than english farmers since american     wheat has come into english markets and yet it does not follow     that england can not grow a bushel of wheat the fact is merely     that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation and a     readjustment made to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food     so with us we should not by the free exchange be forced to give     up the iron and coal industries entirely for the best mines would     still keep that occupation in existence to “diversify” the others      so far the explanation covers the “extractive industries” only or     those industries affected by the law of diminishing returns when a     larger quantity is demanded the real question arises as to the     manufactures of these materials but we count upon larger     industrial rewards in the form of wages and profits here than     in england we must get more from an industry than england in     order to satisfy us our grades of occupations therefore must be     more productive to a certain extent grade for grade than english     grades in order to allow of their remaining free from     competition but we have this superiority as regards our home     market owing to natural causes 1 cheap raw materials if we     except wool and other commodities whose price is raised by the     tariff 2 advantage over england in cost of transportation of     raw products and 3 in the cost of transportation again of the     finished goods in reaching our markets now the processes of     manufacture which do not put much labor upon the materials     especially where the articles are bulky are conducted in this     country without fear of foreign competition and the range of this     class of manufactures is surprisingly large it includes the     manufactures of iron such as stoves and the common utensils of     everyday life of hides such as leather harnesses etc and of     wood such as all the furniture of common use the list is too     long to be fully stated here these industries are not kept in     existence by the tariff and a diversity as wide as this would     arise under a system of free exchange as well as of restriction     indeed if duties were removed from socalled “raw materials” it     is altogether probable that a wider diversity would exist than     ever before      and yet it will be said there are some things we can not produce     in free competition with england of course there are and it is     to be hoped it will long continue so if there are not some kinds     of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage     than we then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade     whatever since if they can send us nothing they can take     nothing from us to deny this position is to say that the export     and import trade of the united states amounting in 1883 to more     than 1500000000 is of no profit and had best be entirely     destroyed in order that a few industries in which we have no     natural advantages and which employ less than one seventeenth of     the laborers in the united states should be continued at a loss     to the general productiveness of our labor and capital and so to     a general diminution of wages and profits    § 7 —on the ground that it lowers prices       the argument—heard less frequently now than formerly—has been     advanced drawn inductively from statistics that protection does     not raise prices because after duties are put on a larger     quantity is produced the advantages of large production are     reaped and then the price of the manufactured commodity falls     lower here than it was before the duty was imposed the position     is then held that protection does not raise prices it is of     course understood to mean the prices of protected commodities—a     necessary precaution because we find our own agricultural     unprotected commodities cited to show that prices are lower here     than in england      no one however will deny that there has been a fall in the     prices of textile fabrics and manufactured goods that is the     result of a general law of value and of the tendencies of a     progressive state of industry372 the causes of this     acknowledged fall would be at work no matter whether tariffs     existed or not it is the result of the general forward march of     improvements as evidenced in the application of new inventions     and the display of skill and ingenuity in new processes to say     that it comes because of a tariff is a complete non sequitur     how true this is may be seen by observing that a country like     england without tariffs shares in the general fall of prices of     manufactured goods equally with the country which has heavy     customsduties the causes must be wider than tariffs if they are     seen working alike in tariff and nontariff countries      but the fact itself can not be gainsaid that protection does raise     the prices of the protected goods in the home market the     comparison is not to be made between prices as they now are in     this country and as they were twenty or forty years ago also in     this country for this would show only the general march of     improvements in this country but a comparison is to be made     between prices in this country today and present prices in     foreign countries does for instance the tariff increase the     price of woolen goods and clothing to every consumer far beyond     what the price would be if the duty on imported woolens were     removed the very existence of a protecting duty is the answer to     this if the duty does not raise the price then why does the     woolen industry wish a continuance of the duties if goods can be     sold as cheaply here as the foreign goods why do protectionists     want any duties the duties are intended to keep foreign goods out     of our markets and they would be unnecessary if our goods could     be sold as cheaply as the foreign wares      the facts however are at hand to show that the statement of     principle as made above is corroborated by the statistics in     1883 although average weekly wages in massachusetts were over 77     per cent higher than in england the american laborer had to pay     more for the articles entering into his real wages and to that     extent lost the advantage of his higher reward in this country     this is to be seen in the following figures373 which show in     percentages whether prices are higher or lower here than in     england      classes of articles          higher percent   lower percent     groceries                                  16     provisions including meat                                 23     eggs butter and potatoes     dry goods all grades                     13     boots shoes and slippers                 62     clothing                                   45      and yet in spite of the high prices 31 per cent of the     massachusetts workman’s expenditure represents more comfort and     better home surroundings than is enjoyed by the english workman     if the american could purchase at english prices he would have no     less than 37 per cent of a surplus for additional enjoyments     after making due allowance for the higher rents paid here than in     england in other words higher prices cut off the american     laborer from reaping all the superiority in comfort which might be     expected from knowing that he had an advantage over the english     laborer of 77 per cent in the money wages received      in order that the reader may easily find the arguments of the     protectionists he is referred to the following books      carey’s “principles of social science” 3 vols the form of     argument is briefly that all industries should be kept going     within the bounds of a country so as to avoid foreign trade the     change of form into the finished commodity should he holds take     place near the spot where the raw materials are produced so that     not so great a share should go to the mere middlemen or     transporters      bowen’s “political economy” chap xx advocates protection on the     ground that it is needed to secure diversity of industries and     that it lowers the prices of imported goods      sir j b byles’s “sophisms of free trade” is an answer to     bastiat’s “sophisms of protection” the latter having been     translated into english by horace white      erastus b bigelow’s “the tariff question” this is one of the     ablest discussions from the protectionist point of view based on     statistical tables and comparisons of the policy of england and     the united states      stebbins’s “protectionists’ manual” is a brief and handy     statement      ellis h roberts’s “government revenue” is the form into which he     has thrown his lectures at cornell university 1884 on     protection and is the latest statement emanating from that side     of the discussion he goes at length into the history of taxes in     various countries holds that wages are higher here than in     england because of protection that our manufactures are more     flourishing than our agriculture etc      frederick list’s “national economy” is the german statement of     protection much on carey’s own grounds      “the congressional globe” contains numerous speeches of members of     congress on the tariff and the iron and steel association of     philadelphia send out pamphlets explaining the protectionist     position      the freetrade arguments may be found also in w m grosvenor’s     “does protection protect” he studies the results of the various     tariffs of the united states and gives many very valuable tables     and collections of statistics bearing upon this question      w g sumner’s “history of protection in the united states” is a     very vigorous account of the evils of the various tariffs and the     protective system      d a wells’s “reports” as special commissioner of the revenue     and his numerous pamphlets see putnams’ publisher’s catalogue     are full of facts and give the results of special study of the

examinations set by english374 and american universities they have been taken in each case from papers actually given it is hardly necessary to state perhaps that these questions do not exhaust the subject and are only some of a kind of which many more might be added  definitions  1 define briefly fixed capital unproductive consumption law of diminishing returns effective desire of accumulation law of increase of labor communism wages fund wages of superintendence real wages value price demand medium of exchange gresham’s law  2 explain carefully the following terms productive consumption effectual demand margin of cultivation cost of production value of money cost of labor wealth and abstinence  3 explain the following terms real wages fixed capital allowance system margin of cultivation price demand medium of exchange seignorage value of money and bill of exchange  4 define supply value of money productive consumption cost of production cost of labor exchange value law of production from land rate of profit capital and gresham’s law  5 define political economy state the parts into which it may be divided and show how they are mutually related  labor  6 distinguish between direct and indirect labor and give an illustration of the distinction  7 apply the distinction between productive and unproductive labor and productive and unproductive consumption respectively to each of the following persons a tailor an architect an annuitant a sailor and a bricklayer  8 is an actor to be classed as a productive laborer the inventor of a machine a confectioner  9 in which of the two classes of laborers productive and unproductive would you place the following        1 the officers of our government       2 the maker of an organ       3 an organist       4 a schoolmaster       5 an artist       6 he who makes an article for which there is no use  10 classify as productive or unproductive the following laborers a clergyman musicalinstrument maker actor soldier and lacemaker  capital  11 explain fully what you understand by capital and what function it discharges in production consider whether or not the following ought to be included in capital 1 the original and acquired powers of the laborer 2 the original properties of the soil 3 improvements on land 4 credit 5 unsold stock in the hands of a merchant 6 articles purchased but still in the consumer’s hands  12 does a national loan add to the capital of a country  13 inquire how far or in what cases or in what sense it may be said that a common dwellinghouse an hotel a schoolhouse a policestation a theatre and a fortification constitute part of the capital of the country  14 discuss carefully the question whether money lying in a bank or corn lying in a granary is always capital or whether its economic nature depends upon the intentions of the owner  15 are railwayshares stocks of wine wheat munitions of war and land to be considered capital or not  16 explain fully whether you consider that united states bonds are capital or not  17 is an investment in government funds capital or not give your reasons  18 in what manner does a large expenditure for military purposes affect the operations of capital and labor  19 distinguish between wealth and capital show that there is no assignable limit to the employment of capital in bettering the condition of the members of a community  20 “if there are human beings capable of work and food to feed them they may always be employed in producing something” explain the meaning of this fully  21 what is meant by saying wealth can only perform the functions of capital by being wholly or partially consumed  22 explain and illustrate the statement that demand for commodities is not demand for labor  23 show that expenditure of money does not necessarily increase the demand for labor  24 in what way would a general demand for luxuries affect productive laborers and the wealth of the community  25 in a community where capital is all employed what would be the effect if one employer gradually withdrew some of his capital and spent this for personal luxuries  26 it is contended that “the demand for commodities which can only be got by labor is as much a demand for labor as a demand for beef is a demand for bullocks” criticise this position  27 “it is often said that though employment is withdrawn from labor in one department an exactly equivalent employment is opened for it in others because what the consumers save in the increased cheapness of one particular article enables them to augment their consumption of others thereby increasing the demand for other kinds of labor” point out the fallacy  28 a college undergraduate with the applause of shopkeepers bought twenty waistcoats under the plea that he was doing good to trade examine the economical soundness of his act  29 a man invested a portion of his capital in a loan to a state which subsequently repudiated its debts the man thereupon gave up his carriage discharged superfluous gardeners and reduced the number of his domestic servants examine the effect of these changes on the employment of labor in the district where he resides  30 in the sixteenth century a great change in the mode of expenditure took place retainers were dismissed households were reduced and a demand for commodities was substituted for a demand for labor how would this change affect wages and why  31 it is supposed by some persons that expenditure by the rich in costly entertainments is good for trade what is your opinion on the subject  32 a is an absentee who spends his income abroad b spends his income chiefly on american pictures and other works of art c spends most of his income on american servants d saves and buys united states bonds e employs most of his income in the production of manufactures explain the various effects of these different modes of expenditure on the amount of wealth in the united states and on the workingclasses of the country  33 compare the economic effects of defraying war expenditure 1 by loans 2 by increased taxation  34 define the term capital and distinguish between fixed and circulating capital giving instances of each  35 distinguish between fixed and circulating capital and point out how far or in what manner each of the following articles belongs to one kind or the other a dwellinghouse a crop of corn a wagon a load of coal an ingot of gold a railwayengine a bale of cotton goods  36 of the following which would you class under fixed and which under circulating capital cash in the hands of a merchant a cottonmill a plow diamonds in a jeweler’s shop a locomotive a nurserygardener’s seeds greenhouses manures a carpenter’s tools woods nails  37 if in a country like this a large amount of capital becomes fixed in the building of railroads what effect will this change taken by itself have upon the laboringclass supposing the capital to be 1 domestic or 2 borrowed wholly or in part from abroad  38 what conclusion is reached by mr mill respecting the objections to the use of laborsaving machinery  39 is the extension of machinery beneficial to laborers  40 what is “the conclusive answer to the objections against machinery”  efficiency of production  41 explain briefly the chief causes on which the productiveness of labor depends  42 what are the principal ways in which advantage arises from the division of labor  43 what are the principal advantages of division of labor in what cases and why is it better to carry on a productive enterprise on a large scale  44 under what circumstances and in what callings can the division of employment be carried out to the fullest extent  45 show how the amount of available capital and the extent of the market for products limit division of labor  population  46 give a brief statement of malthus’s theory of population explaining the different checks on population in different stages of civilization  47 enunciate malthus’s law of population and give an outline of the reasoning by which he established it give an account of any objections that have been brought against malthus’s position and criticise those objections  48 when the growth of population outstrips the progress of improvements what are the means of relief for the laborer  49 does the increased facility of emigration nullify the malthusian law of population in your opinion or not and why  50 explain the law of diminishing return and the malthusian doctrine of population and trace the connection between them  increase of production  51 compare the motives to saving in the case of savages and of a country like the united states state the causes of diversity in the strength of the effective desire of accumulation  52 capital is said to be accumulated by saving what is saving is hoarded money a saving while hoarded  53 how far does the increasing productiveness of manufacturing industry tend to neutralize the effect on profits of the diminishing productiveness of agricultural industry  54 what conclusion as to the limit to the increase of production does mr mill deduce from his investigation of the laws of the various requisites of production  property  55 what are the essential elements of property are the grounds of property in land the same as those of property in movables  56 give what you conceive to be the chief arguments in favor of the institution of private property as opposed to common ownership  57 what arguments does mr mill suggest in favor of some redistribution of landed property  58 what are the economic arguments for and against communism  59 in what way and by what means do socialists want to alter the present distribution of wealth  60 sketch the principal forms of communistic and noncommunistic socialism  61 should the power of bequest be limited  wages  62 on what according to mill does the rate of wages depend hence show the fallacy of the popularly proposed remedies for low wages  63 state and examine the principal theories which have been put forward as to the circumstances which regulate the general rate of wages saying which you deem to be correct and why so  64 mr thornton argues that the wagesfund is neither “determined” nor “limited” not “determined” because there is no “law” to compel capitalists to devote any portion of their wealth to the payment of labor nor are they morally “bound” to do so and not “limited” because there is nothing to prevent them from adding to the portion of their wealth so applied criticise this argument and if you dissent from mr thornton’s view state the causes which “determine” and “limit” the fund in question  65 state precisely what you mean by the “wagesfund” and explain the conditions on which its growth depends  66 explain generally the circumstances which determine the rate of wages mention some of the reasons why wages should be higher in one occupation than in another  67 in what way does dearness or cheapness of food affect money wages  68 what determines—        1 the general rate of wages in a country       2 the relative rates of wages in different employments  69 what causes different rates of wages in different employments and by what methods might wages be raised  70 how do you explain the fact that some of the most disagreeable kinds of labor are the most badly paid  71 what according to mr mill are the most promising means for the improvement of the laboringclasses  72 in the island of laputa a law was passed compelling each workman to work with his left hand tied behind his back and the law was justified on the ground that the demand for labor was more than doubled by it examine this argument  73 some coalworkers are calling for a diminution of the output of coal so as to keep up their wages examine how far if at all this result would follow from their proposed action  74 discuss any remedies for low wages that have been or might be suggested  75 why are the wages of women habitually lower than those of men  profits  76 what is the cause of the existence of profits and what according to mr mill are the circumstances which determine the respective shares of the laborer and the capitalist  77 1 what is the lowest rate of profit which can permanently exist 2 why is this minimum variable  78 analyze the remuneration received by any of the following 1 the proprietor of a cottonmill managing his own mill 2 a merchant conducting his own business 3 a railway shareholder 4 a holder of government funds  79 into what portions may we divide the return which is usually called profit which of these portions would be received by a merchant carrying on business with borrowed capital  80 analyze the payment called profits into its various elements point out in what respects the earnings of the employer differ from or resemble the wages paid to other classes of laborers  81 it is asserted that “profits tend to an equality” what conditions must be satisfied before this position can be maintained  82 how is the alleged tendency of profits to equivalence in different employments to be reconciled with the notorious difference in the profit of different individuals  83 which one of the elements in profit has the greatest effect on its amount explain by comparing the causes which regulate each element  84 how does mill reconcile the high wages in america with ricardo’s law of profits  85 explain the proposition that the rate of profits depends on the cost of labor stating carefully what elements are included in cost of labor  86 explain what connection there may be between an increase of population and any of the elements entering into cost of labor  87 what effect would an increase or diminution of population have upon cost of labor  88 explain mill’s view as to the cost of labor being a function of three variables considering the passages in which he says 1 “if without labor becoming less efficient its remuneration fell no increase taking place in the cost of the articles composing that remuneration” 2 “if the laborer obtained a higher remuneration without any increased cheapness in the things composing it or if without his obtaining more that which he did obtain would become more costly” profits in the last two cases would suffer a diminution and discussing—firstly if the remuneration of labor falls what can the cost of the articles composing that remuneration signify to the capitalist secondly if the laborer gets a higher remuneration what can the increased cheapness of the things composing it signify to the capitalist  89 is the contest between capital and labor permanent and fundamental if not give your reasons for your answer  90 what is the effect on wages and profits of the introduction of machinery  rent  91 what connection exists between the law of malthus and ricardo’s doctrine of rent  92 what is the reason why landowners can demand rent  93 explain and illustrate the distinction between rent and profits in what cases are they nearly indistinguishable  94 it has often been observed that in america land is much less highly cultivated than in england explain the economic reasons for this  95 how does the theory of rent apply in a country like the united states where the farmer owns his land instead of hiring it  96 how is it that some agricultural capital pays rent even if resort is not had to different grades of land  97 give a brief description of the theory of rent and point out to what payments not usually called rent the theory may be applied  98 state briefly ricardo’s theory of rent and show that if it be true the following statements of adam smith must be false  “the most fertile coalmine regulates the price of coals at all the other mines in the neighborhood”  “in the price of corn one part pays the rent of the landlord another pays the wages and another the profit of the farmer”  99 why does the farming business pay rent and the cotton business groundrent excluded pay none define rent  100 “as population increases rents estimated in corn increase and the price of corn rises rents therefore doubly tend to increase” prove this  101 professor rogers adduces in refutation of the common theory of rent the fact that land near new york pays a high rent while land of the same natural fertility in the western states pays no rent how far do you admit the force of this objection  102 examine the following doctrine       “if invention and improvement still go on the efficiency of labor     will be further increased and the amount of labor and capital     necessary to produce a given result further diminished the same     causes will lead to the utilization of this new gain in productive     power for the production of more wealth the margin of cultivation     will be again extended and rent will increase both in proportion     and amount without any increase in wages and interest and so      will  rent constantly increase though population should     remain stationary”—henry george “progress and poverty” p 226   103 what answer is made to mr carey’s objection to ricardo’s theory of rent that in point of fact the poorer not the richer lands are first brought under cultivation  104 explain how land “even apart from differences of situation would all of it on a certain supposition pay rent”  105 explain clearly how it is possible for the land of a country which is all of uniform fertility to pay rent  106 “if the earth had a perfectly smooth surface the same everywhere and if it were all tilled and cultivated in exactly the same way there would be no such thing as rent” examine this proposition  107 show that rent does not increase the price of bread  108 how is it shown that “rent does not really form any part of the expenses of production or of the advances of the capitalist”  109 1 what connection exists between the price of agricultural products and the amount of rent paid 2 can rent affect the price  110 “rent is the effect and not the cause of price” prove this  111 does rent enter into the cost of production of the following commodities or not and why corn cloth the wine of the best vineyards  112 “rent arises from the difference between the least fertile and the most fertile soils and from the fact that the former have been taken into cultivation rent is the difference between the market price of produce and the cost of production” harmonize these statements  113 in order that the actual payments made by farmers to landlords should generally correspond with “economic rent” what conditions must be observed  114 what is assumed as to competition in all mr mill’s reasoning on wages profits and rent explain its action in each case  value  115 enumerate compare and criticise any opinions known to you which have been held concerning the nature origin or measure of value in exchange  116 define precisely what it is which gives value to objects and point out the causes which vary the value of the same object under differing circumstances  117 do men dive to the bottom of the sea to get pearls because they are valuable or are pearls valuable because men must dive to the bottom of the sea to get them  118 there are three forms of difficulty of attainment state the law of value applicable to each  119 explain the exact economic meaning of the words supply and demand  120 when it is said that the value of certain commodities depends upon supply and demand what is meant by demand  121 if the supply of all commodities were suddenly doubled would any changes in their relative values ensue or not and why  122 state the laws which regulate the permanent and temporary values of agricultural products  123 how far does the value of commodities depend on the quantity of labor required for their production  124 has the term exchange value any precise meaning when we are comparing times or places very remote from one another  125 what is meant by the natural or normal price and the market price of commodities to what extent can they differ  126 does a general rise of wages raise the prices of commodities in general or not and why does it tend to cause any change in the relative prices of commodities or not and why  127 suppose that wages were double would the values of commodities be affected what would be the effect on prices and profits of such an increase of wages  128 are wages and profits influenced by prices  129 can employers recoup themselves by a rise of prices for a rise of—        a wages in particular employments       b general wages  how does this question bear on the efficacy of tradesunionism  130 do values depend on wages  131 explain the following statement “it is true the absolute wages paid have no effect upon values but neither has the absolute quantity of labor”  132 explain the statement that “high general profits can not any more than high general wages be a cause of high values in so far as profits enter into the cost of production of all things they can not affect the value of any”  133 explain fully why it is that capitalists can not compensate themselves for a general high cost of labor through any action on values and prices  134 “the value of a commodity depends on its cost of production” under what conditions is this true and what causes interfere with it  135 describe the hindrances which impede the free movement of capital to those fields which apparently offer the highest return for its employment  136 give j s mill’s analysis of the “cost of production” and also professor cairnes’s with the arguments for and against each  137 analyze cost of production what is its connection with cost of labor  138 give an analysis of cost of production of any commodity  139 show carefully the distinction between wages cost of labor and cost of production  140 define clearly value price real wages and cost of production  141 define real wages money wages cost of labor  money  142 point out the difference between the scientific and popular conceptions implied in the terms wealth and money  143 show the fallacy of confounding capital with money can there be a glut of capital  144 what is money to what sort of necessity does it owe its existence what articles have been used for money enumerate the qualities which render a commodity fit to serve as money  145 what are the qualities requisite in any commodity in order that it may serve as money  146 distinguish accurately between the functions of money  147 how far is a fixed standard of value possible  148 what effect does the great durability of gold and silver have upon the value of money  149 how far does the law of demand and supply govern the value of money  150 explain fully how it is that the value of the precious metals is affected by “questions of quantity only with little reference to cost of production”  151 what is to be said to the following “some political economists have objected altogether to the statement that the value of money depends on its quantity combined with the rapidity of circulation which they think is assuming a law for money that does not exist for any other commodity”  152 under what conditions is it true that the “value of money is inversely as its quantity”  153 explain carefully the following “the average value of gold is made to conform to its natural value in the same manner as the values of other things are made to conform to their natural value”  154 in what various meanings is the phrase “the value of money” used how far does the value of money in each of these meanings depend on 1 the cost of production 2 supply and demand  155 are the values of gold and silver subject to exactly the same natural laws as other commodities  156 give the explanations and qualifications required to render the following proposition true “the quantity of coin in every country is regulated by the value of the commodities which are to be circulated by it”  157 would the world be richer if every individual in it suddenly found the quantity of money in his possession doubled  158 how far or in what way do you consider it correct to say that the general level of prices in a country depends upon the quantity of gold coin existing in that country  159 a single good harvest causes a considerable fall in the value of wheat but a great addition to the year’s supply of gold from the mines produces little effect on its general value how do you account for the difference  160 show the effect of establishing a double standard  161 show how gresham’s law is illustrated by the history of the currency in the united states between 1834 and 1873  162 what effect had the discovery of gold in this century upon the coinage of the united states  163 what is the system upon which the small silver currency of the united states is coined and issued  164 state briefly the aim of the united states coinage act of 1853  credit  165 how do you define credit form a classification of credit documents  166 it has been said that “credit is capital” is this so or not  167 define capital and examine the meaning of the term in the following statements  a demand for commodities can not create capital  b credit is not a creation but a transfer of capital  c wages depend upon the proportion between population and capital  168 state the law of the value of money which governs general prices what change is to be made in the statement if credit is to be taken into consideration  169 what is the part which instruments of credit other than banknotes play in the exchange of commodities  170 mention some of the principal features of a credit crisis  171 what are inconvertible notes what objections are there to currency of this description  172 can an inconvertible currency be made to maintain the same value as a convertible currency and if so how supposing that it can what objections are there nevertheless to it  173 “nothing is subject to more variation than paper money even when it is limited and has no guarantees for this simple reason that having no value of its own it depends on the idea that each person forms of those guarantees” comment on this passage  174 how is it that a bad dollar does the work of buying as well as a good one until it is found out is it that it makes no difference whether it is made of gold or not  175 to what extent is a government capable of giving fictitious value to a paper or a metallic currency  176 in a country with an inconvertible paper currency how can it be determined whether the issues are excessive or not and why  177 what will be the effect if the circulating medium of a country is increased beyond its natural amount—        1 when the medium is coin       2 when it is coin and convertible paper       3 when it is inconvertible paper  178 what is the error involved in the assumption frequently made by writers and public speakers that the currency of a country ought to increase in like ratio with its wealth and population  179 on what does the desire to use credit depend what connection exists between the amount of notes and coin in circulation and the use of credit  180 compare the advantages and disadvantages of a metallic and paper currency  181 a member of congress advocated expansion of the paper currency by the following argument “our currency as well as everything else must keep pace with our growth as a nation france has a circulation per capita of thirty dollars england of twentyfive and we with our extent of territory and improvements certainly require more than either” state your opinion of this argument  182 trace the effects immediate and ultimate on general prices of a an extended system of credit b an enlarged issue of paper money and c an addition to the stock of precious metals respectively  183 what is the error in the common notion that “a paper currency can not be issued in excess so long as every note represents property or has a foundation of actual property to rest on”  184 explain the action of the check and clearinghouse system and state what is meant by the restoration of barter  overproduction  185 state the relation between supply and demand as aggregates eg between the aggregate supply of commodities in a given community and the aggregate demand for them and show the bearing of the principle involved on the doctrine of “general overproduction”  186 prove that the increase of capital and the extension of industry can not lead to a general overproduction of commodities  187 what is the error of those who believe in the danger of overproduction  188 distinguish “excess of supply” from a “commercial crisis”  189 give the substance of mill’s examination of the theories of excess of supply  190 “when production is fully equal to consumption every discovery in the arts or in mechanics is a calamity because it only adds to the enjoyment of consumers the opportunity of obtaining commodities at a cheaper rate while it deprives the producers of even life itself” discuss this opinion of sismondi  191 explain the difference in the theories of dr chalmers and mr mill on overproduction and the excess of supply  peculiar cases of value  192 it costs as much to produce straw as to produce grain how then do you explain the comparatively low value of straw  193 suppose a considerable rise in the price of wool to be foreseen how should farmers expect the prices of mutton to be affected and why  194 explain the operation of the laws of value by which the relative prices of wool and mutton are regulated  international trade and values  195 what is the meaning of the statement that “it is not a difference in the absolute cost of production which determines the interchange of commodities between countries but a difference in the comparative cost”  196 what are the advantages which a country derives from foreign trade  197 explain clearly the following passage “we may often by trading with foreigners obtain their commodities at a smaller expense of labor and capital than they cost to the foreigners themselves”  198 is there any essential difference between trade between country and country and trade between county and county or even between man and man what is the real nature of trade in all cases  199 why is it necessary to make any different statement of the laws of value for foreign than for domestic products what is the cause for the existence of any international trade  200 how would a serious decline in the efficiency of england as compared with other countries in the production of manufactures affect the scale of money incomes and prices in england and why  201 mr mill refers the value of home products to the “cost of production” of foreign products to the “cost of acquisition” examine the truth of this distinction  202 it is said that in the home market the value of commodities depends on the cost of production in the foreign market on the cost of acquisition comment on this distinction  203 is the cost of production the regulator of international values  204 discuss the following statement “international value is regulated just as interprovincial or interparishional value is coals and hops are exchanged between northumberland and kent on absolutely the same principles as iron and wine between lancashire and spain”—ruskin “munera pulveris” p 84  205 what determines the value of imported commodities  206 why does cost of production fail to determine the value of commodities brought from a foreign country does it also fail in the case of commodities brought from distant parts of the same country  207 it is on the matter of fact that there is not much migration of capital and labor from country to country that mr mill has based his whole doctrine of “international trade and international values” explain and comment on the above statement  208 what are the causes which determine for a nation the cost of its imports  209 it follows from the theory of international values as laid down by mill that the permanent residence of americans in europe may enhance the cost of foreign imports to americans residing at home explain in what way  210 suppose two countries a and b isolated from the rest of the world and a trade established between them in consequence of the labor of a becoming less effective the cost of production of every article which can be produced in that country is greatly increased but so that the relation between the costs of any two articles remains the same what if any will be the effect of the change on the trade between a and b does your answer depend upon your using the phrase “cost of production” in a sense different from that given to it by some economists  211 show that every country gets its imports at less cost in proportion to the efficiency of its labor  foreign exchanges  212 what is the ordinary limit to the premium on foreign bills of exchange and why  213 what are the chief effects on the foreign exchanges which are produced by the breaking out of a war account for the fact that in 1861 the exchanges on england in america fell considerably below specie point  214 suppose that the next harvest in england should be very defective and extraordinary supplies of american grain needed how would this probably affect the price of bills of exchange between england and america and the profit on the exportation of english manufactures to the latter and why  215 trace the process by which the precious metals spread from the mines over the world  216 suppose the exchange between england and the united states to be heavily against england how will this fact affect the export and import trade between the two countries and why  217 what is meant by exchanges being against a country  218 enumerate the principal circumstances which affect the rate of exchange between two countries how is the par of exchange ascertained  219 in what way are gold and silver distributed among the different trading countries between different parts of the same country  220 trace the effects of large and continuous issues of inconvertible paper currency on the prices of commodities on importation and exportation and on the foreign exchanges  221 state the conditions under which international trade can permanently exist what will be the ultimate effect of a large movement of foreign gold upon prices imports and exports in the receiving country  222 state the theory of the value of money ie “metallic money” and clear up any apparent inconsistencies between the following statements 1 the value of money depends on the cost of production at the worst mines 2 the value of money varies inversely as its quantity multiplied by its rapidity of circulation 3 the countries whose products are most in demand abroad and contain the greatest value in the smallest bulk which are nearest the mines and have the least demand for foreign productions are those in which money will be of lowest value  228 the effects of the depreciation of the paper currency in the united states are thus described by mr wells “it renders it impossible to sell abroad the products which have cost too much at home and invites from other countries the products of a cheaper labor paid for in a sounder currency it exaggerates imports while destroying our ability to pay in kind” state how far you agree with the deductions here drawn assigning your reasons where you differ  224 when the foreign exchanges are manifestly against a country and a balance of indebtedness is the cause the equilibrium can be restored in two ways state and explain the operation of each  225 what are the conditions which determine for a country a high range of general prices how far is this advantageous  226 what is the effect of the imposition of a tribute by one country on another upon the course of trade between them and the terms on which they exchange commodities and why  227 for what reasons may a nation’s exports habitually exceed or fall short of its imports  228 explain the real and nominal exchange  229 expound mr mill’s theory of the influence which a convertible currency exercises on foreign trade  230 what is the effect of a depreciated currency on 1 foreign trade and 2 the exchanges  interest  231 how does the general rate of interest determine the selling price of stocks and land  232 is there any relation between the rate of interest and the value of money  233 what are the relations of interest and profit on what causes does the rate of interest depend  234 “high interest means bad security” comment on this saying  235 is the rate of interest affected by the supply of the precious metals  236 what determines the rate of interest on the loanable funds is the “current or ordinary rate of interest the measure of the relative abundance or scarcity of capital”  237 what are the chief causes that determine the rate of interest  238 if it be true that in america every man however rich is engaged in some business but that in england many rich men have no trade or profession how is the rate of interest in each country affected in consequence and why  239 how does a fall in the purchasing power of money tend to affect if at all and why 1 the rate of interest 2 the price of land 3 the price of government bonds 4 the price of gold and silver ornaments and plate  foreign competition  240 explain the grounds of mr mill’s proposition that general low wages never caused any country to undersell its rivals nor did general high wages ever hinder it from doing so if you think the proposition needs qualification give your reason  241 1 what is the true theory of one country underselling another in a foreign market 2 what weight should be attributed to the fact of generally higher or lower wages in one of the competing countries  242 discuss the question whether a high rate of wages necessarily lays the commerce of a country under a disadvantage with reference to a country where the rate of wages is lower  243 what are the conditions under which one country can permanently undersell another in a foreign market  244 point out distinctly the connection between the money wages of laborers in the united states and the productiveness of the soil  245 in the eastern states ironmolders earn from fourteen to seventeen dollars a week in california their wages run from twentyone to twentyseven dollars account for this variation  progress of society  246 what are the reasons for the change in the normal values of manufactured and of agricultural commodities respectively during the progress of society  247 wages and profits in different employments and neighborhoods are not uniformly proportional to the efforts of labor and abstinence of which they are the respective rewards classify the circumstances which prevent this correspondence and show how far their effect is likely to be reduced a by general economical progress and b by the extension of the division of labor  248 what is the law of diminishing returns can you point out any connection between this law and the following phenomena—        a density of population       b rate of wages       c rate of profits in different countries  249 sketch the influence on rents and profits of an increase of population and capital concurrently with a stationary state of the arts of production  250 is there reason to believe that mr mill has underrated the powers possessed by man of extending the area of production and facilitating the market of food if such a statement has been made to what extent is his theory of population modified and the risks he had indicated rendered distant  251 compare the effects on rent profits and wages of a sudden improvement in the production a of food b of some manufactured articles largely consumed by the workingclasses  252 trace the connection between ricardo’s theory of rent and the decline in the general rate of profits as a country increases in population explain clearly the connection which exists between wages and profits  253 what effect is produced upon rents profits and wages respectively in a country like france where population is stationary and capital advancing  254 if capital continued to increase and population did not explain the proposition that “the whole savings of each year would be exactly so much subtracted from the profits of the next and of every following year” if improvements were stationary  255 how does social and industrial progress tend to affect the prices of land raw produce and manufactures respectively and why  256 the capitalized value of land rises in the progress of society from two causes—from one which affects land in common with all investments from another which is peculiar to land  257 “the tendency of improved communications is to lower existing rents” how far is this true and in what directions is it true  258 what would be the effect on profits wages and rents of an improvement in a manufactured article consumed by the laboringclass  259 explain the doctrine of the tendency of profits to a minimum the cause of that tendency and the circumstances which counteract it  260 what was adam smith’s doctrine as to the decline of profit in progressive communities criticise his argument  261 mention some of the principal causes which in the ordinary progress of society respectively tend to increase or to reduce the current rate of profits  262 why do profits tend to fall as population increases and how may this result be retarded or prevented  263 what is the effect of a general rise of money wages apart from the consideration of a greater efficiency of labor in prices profits and rent give reasons for your answer  264 how does the general progress of society in wealth and industrial efficiency tend to affect the rate of wages the rate of profit and the rate of rent respectively  265 what is the general effect of the progress of society on the landowner the capitalist and the laborer  future of laboringclasses  266 examine the influences of machinery on the economic condition of the workingclasses  267 mention and discuss some of the popular remedies for low wages and especially the effect of the subdivision of landed property among peasant proprietors  268 explain briefly what is meant by cooperation and indicate the more prominent forms assumed by the cooperative movement  269 what is meant by the cooperative system of industry show ways in which this system may affect for good or for evil the productiveness of labor and mention any moral benefits or the opposite in which it may be expected to issue  270 what are the difficulties in the way of cooperation for the production of salable objects  271 explain the advantages of industrial partnership in which the employés share in proportion to the wages received half the profits of the business beyond a certain fixed minimum which is assigned to the employers  taxation  272 how is the state justified in undertaking any manufacture or service which might be performed by private enterprise  273 enumerate adam smith’s canons of taxation  274 examine the argument in favor of the resumption by the state of what is called the unearned increment in the value of land arising from the development of society  275 a picture by gainsborough and a house in broadway are sold in the same year at the same price at the end of fifty years each sells for five times its first cost is there any and if so what reason why the increase should be sequestrated for the public benefit in the one case and not in the other  276 explain the incidence of taxes laid on wages  277 why should a tax on profits if no improvements follow fall on the laborer and capitalist  278 explain what effect if any will be produced on the price of corn by—        1 a tax upon rent       2 a tithe       3 a tax of so much per acre irrespective of value       4 a tax of so much per bushel  279 on whom does a tax of a fixed proportion of agricultural produce fall  280 discuss the question whether the incometax ought to be a tax upon income and property or upon expenditure  281 discuss the expediency of a graduated incometax  282 state the arguments which you think strongest both for and against exempting savings from the incometax  283 explain the conditions which should be observed in imposing taxes on commodities  284 what taxes does a tradesman get back in the price of the articles he sells and what does he not  285 test by adam smith’s four maxims of taxation the policy of indirect taxes on the necessaries of life  286 all indirect taxation violates adam smith’s fourth canon  287 discuss the following  “a man with 100000 in united states bonds comes to boston hires a house thus he lives in luxury i am in favor of taxing idle investments such as this and allowing manufacturing investments to go untaxed”  288 compare the advantages and disadvantages of direct and indirect taxation  289 on what principles is this country now taxed  290 explain the arguments for and against the policy of maintaining a surplus for the purpose of redeeming a national debt  291 in estimating the ability of the united states to pay its public debts it is usual to include among the data of the question the increased productiveness of industry in that country how far is this a pertinent consideration  protection  292 mention some of the principal arguments brought forward in favor of protective tariffs  293 connect the principle of the division of employments or labor with the policy of free trade and the functions of government  294 sketch the effects of discriminating duties including the operation of the corn laws  295 examine the following argument emending if you think it necessary the freetrader’s doctrine on the point raised the freetrader’s belief is that a customs duty is added to the price of the article upon which it is imposed if the article is imported according to his theory the increase of the price goes into the public treasury if the article is made in the country the increase of the price goes into the pocket of the producer but in the former case there is no protection and competition will prevent the latter therefore protection does not increase the price of the protected article if a customs duty is imposed upon a commodity and its price is not raised in consequence what inference can you draw  296 under what circumstances did mr mill think nascent states might be justified in adopting a policy of protection criticise his opinion and if you agree with it give some examples of its application  297 american protectionists allege that the high rate of wages prevailing in the united states disables them from competing with “the pauper labor” of europe examine the grounds of this statement and consider how far it forms a justification for protection to american industry  298 a high rate of wages indicates not a high but a low cost of production for all commodities measured in which the rate of wages is high  explain and prove this proposition and illustrate it from the circumstances of the united states  299 state under what limitations the proposition is correct that profits vary inversely with wages explain the circumstances which cause both a higher rate of wages and profits to prevail in a young country such as the united states than in england  300 in america wages are much higher than in england yet the general rate of profits is higher also according to mr mill how do you reconcile the two facts  301 examine the following  “it seems to me that protection is absolutely essential to the encouragement of capital and equally necessary for the protection of the american laborer he must have good food enough of it good clothing schoolhouses for his children comforts for his home and a fair chance to improve his condition to this end i would protect him against competition with the halfpaid laborers of european countries”—congressional globe  302 an american newspaper has said of the burning of chicago “the money to replace what has been burned will not be sent abroad to enrich foreign manufacturers but thanks to the wise policy of protection which has built up american industries it will stimulate our own manufactures set our mills running faster and give employment to thousands of idle workingmen” comment on this passage  303 on whom does a tax on imports if not prohibitory fall  304 in what cases would duties on imported commodities fall on the producers  305 are taxes on imports in any way paid by foreigners  306 discuss the effects of duties on exports  307 trace the effects of duties on the importation of raw materials and distinguish with examples between duties that violate and duties which do not violate the principle of free trade  308 is it possible for any country by legislative enactments to engross a larger share of the advantages of foreign trade than it would naturally have discuss the question fully  309 “those are therefore in the right who maintain that taxes on imports are partly paid by foreigners but they are mistaken when they say it is by the foreign producer it is not on the person from whom we buy but on all those who buy from us that a portion of our customs duties spontaneously falls” explain and examine the reasons for this conclusion  310 state the principle which determines the relation between the amount of a country’s imports and that of its exports and show how this relation is affected by a system of protective duties  the end      advertisements   science  huxley and youmans’s physiology and hygiene by thomas h huxley ll d frs and william j youmans md new and revised

described as the cause       of the decline of dutch shipping the taxation necessitated by her       wars is rather the cause as history shows it to us sir josiah       child 1668 and 1690 speaks of a serious depression in english       commerce and says the low rate of interest among the dutch hurts       the english trade this does not show that the acts greatly aided       english shipping moreover gee a determined partisan of the       mercantile theory says in 1730 that the shiptrade was       languishing sir matthew decker 1744 confirms gee’s impressions       it looks very much as if the commercial supremacy of england was       acquired by internal causes and in spite of her navigation acts       the anonymous author of “britannia languens” confirms this view     13 this was in substance the whole teaching of one of the leading and       most intelligent writers sir james steuart 1767 “principles of       political economy” see also held’s “carey’s socialwissenschaft und

indicating a reverence for natural       laws     19 the words were not invented by quesnay but formed the phrase of a       merchant legendre in addressing colbert although it was later       ascribed as by perry “political economy” p 46 and cossa p       150 to one of the economists gournay see wolowski in his essay       prefixed to “roscher’s political economy” p 36 american       translation     20 the margrave karl friedrich was the author of “abrégé des principes       de l’économie politique” 1775 and applied the physiocratic system       of taxation to two of his villages with disastrous results     21 he published a first work on “population” 1756 the “théorie de       l’impôt” 1760 and “philosophie rurale” 1763 in this latter       work mirabeau adopted the “tableau économique” as the key to the       subject and classed it with the discovery of printing and of money     22 in 1742 turgot when scarcely twenty appeared as a sound writer on       paper money in letters to abbé cicé the physiocratic doctrines were       presented in a more intelligible form in his greater work       “réflexions sur la formation et la distribution des richesses”       1766 three works of turgot on mining property interest of       money and freedom in the corntrade bear a high reputation for       works treating of turgot see batbie “turgot philosophe       économiste et administrateur” 1861 mastier “turgot sa vie et sa       doctrine” 1861 tissot “turgot sa vie son administration et ses       ouvrages” 1862     23 he was the editor of the works of quesnay and turgot and wrote a       “mémoire de turgot” 1817 he opposed the issue of assignats during       the french revolution and falling into disfavor he barely escaped       the scaffold having been a correspondent of jefferson’s when       napoleon returned from elba he came to america and settled in       delaware where he died in 1817 the connection between the       economists and the framers of our constitution is interesting       because it explains some peculiarities introduced into our system of       taxation in that document the only direct taxes recognized by the       supreme court under our constitution are the poll and land taxes       and it is in this connection that the constitutionality of the       incometax a direct tax is doubted     24 one of the earliest is that of roger coke 1675 in which he argues       for free trade and attacks the navigation acts sir dudley north’s       “discourse on trade” 1691 urges that the whole world as regards       trade is but one people and explains that money is only       merchandise     25 joseph harris an official in the london mint published a very       clear exposition of this subject in his “essay upon money and coins”       1757 but eighty years before rice vaughan had given a       satisfactory statement in his “treatise of money”     26 “contemporary review” january 1881 “richard cantillon” adam       smith had quoted cantillon on his discussion of the wages of labor       b i ch viii and evidently knew his book     27 born in 1723 and died 1790 he was eleven years younger than hume       a professor of logic 1751 and moral philosophy 1752 at glasgow       he published a treatise on ethical philosophy entitled the “theory       of moral sentiments” 1739 dugald stewart is the authority as to       smith’s life having received information from a contemporary of       smith’s professor miller see playfair’s edition of smith’s works       for adam smith destroyed all his own papers in his last illness his       lectures on political economy at glasgow outlined the results as       they appeared in the “wealth of nations” it was not until 1764 that       he resigned his professorship and spent two years on the continent       twelve months of this in france on his return home he immured       himself for ten years of quiet study and published the “wealth of       nations” in 1776 see also mcculloch’s introduction to his edition       of the “wealth of nations” and bagehot’s “economic studies” iii     28 a glance at sir james steuart’s treatise 1767 with the “wealth of       nations” shows adam smith’s great qualities the former was a series       of detached essays although of wide range but admittedly without       any consistent plan     29 a he went into a vague discussion upon labor as a measure of       value b a legal rate of interest received his support and his       argument was answered effectually by bentham “defense of usury”       c while not agreeing with the french school that agriculture is       the only industry producing more than it consumes and so land pays       rent yet he thinks that it produces more in proportion to the labor       than other industries that manufactures came next and exportation       and commerce after them this error however did not modify his       more important conclusions thorold rogers and even chevalier       however claim that adam smith drew his inspiration from the french       school d in the discussion of rent he failed to follow out       his ideas to a legitimate end and did not get at the true doctrine       while hinting at the right connection between price and rent he yet       believed that rent formed a part of price of the fundamental       principle in the doctrine of rent the law of diminishing returns       he had no full knowledge but came very close to it he points out       that in colonies when the good soil has all been occupied profits       fall e in saying that every animal naturally multiplies in       proportion to and is limited by the means of subsistence adam       smith just missed malthus’s law of population in fact cantillon       came quite as near it        book iii in his “wealth of nations” is concerned with the policy of       europe in encouraging commerce at the expense of agriculture and       has less interest for us book v considers the revenue of the       sovereign and much of it is now obsolete but his discussion of       taxation is still highly important     30 among the english liberals carried away by the french revolution       and by such theories as those of condorcet was william godwin the       author of “political justice” 1793 and the “inquirer” 1797 who       advocated the abolition of government and even marriage since by       the universal practice of the golden rule there would come about a       lengthening of life malthus tells us that his study was brought       forward as an answer to the doctrines of the “inquirer” and he       applied his principles to condorcet’s and godwin’s ideas it was a       period when pauperism demanded attention from all malthus favored       the repeal of the old poorlaws as destroying independence of       character among the poor        malthus also wrote “principles of political economy” 1821 and       “definitions in political economy” 1827 but the former did not       increase his reputation he believed in taxing imported corn and he       gave in his adherence to the doctrine of overproduction but on       the other hand he was one of several writers who almost at the       same time discovered the true theory of rent his father was a       friend of godwin and a correspondent of rousseau see bagehot       “economic studies” p 135     31

honor of first discovery     33 born in 1772 of jewish parentage ricardo died in 1824 a rich       banker who made a fortune on the stock exchange he early in life       retired from business the discussions on the restriction act and       the corn laws led him to investigate the laws governing the subjects       of money and rent he gained notice first by his “letters on the       high price of bullion” 1810 the “reply to mr bosanquet” 1811       and “inquiry into rent” 1815 were followed by his greater work       “principles of political economy and taxation” 1817 he entered       the house of commons from portarlington a pocket borough in       ireland and was influential in the discussions on resumption       although he was not on the committee his views on depreciated paper       are practically embodied in the famous “bullion report” 1810       tooke “history of prices” says the results of the restriction were       not known until the time of ricardo’s contributions neither mill       nor say has had so great an influence as ricardo has gained through       the pages of his “political economy”     34 johann heinrich von thünen a rich landowner of mecklenburg in his       “der isolirte staat in beziehung auf landwirthschaft und       nationaloekonomie” 1826 worked entirely by himself but reached       practically the same law of rent as ricardo’s in spreading the       doctrines of adam smith he has influenced later german writers     35 the first distinct recognition of this important physical law       according to mcculloch introduction to “wealth of nations” lv       was in a fanciful work of two volumes entitled “principes de tout       gouvernement” published in 1766 “quand les cultivateurs devenus       nombreux auront défriché toutes les bonnes terres par leur       augmentation successive et par la continuité du défrichement il se       trouvera un point ou il sera plus avantageux à un nouveau colon de       prendre à ferme des terres fécondes que d’en défricher de nouvelles       beaucoup moins bonnes” i p 126 the author was however unaware       of the importance of his discovery     36 carey “social science” i ch iv v and bowen “american       political economy” ch ix have denied ricardo’s doctrine of rent       thesupposed connection between free trade and ricardo’s teachings on       rent has prejudiced protectionists against him free trade follows       from the theory of international trade and has nothing to do with       ricardo’s main doctrines it is true ricardo was a vigorous       freetrader of opposing views on rent carey’s argument is the most       important     37 say drew considerable attention by his theory of “gluts” he based       his idea of value wholly on utility which has

    beyond the occasional change of a pronoun    277 the subjoined extract from the separate essay “some unsettled       questions of political economy” previously referred to will give       some assistance in following the course of the phenomena it is       adapted to the imaginary case used for illustration throughout that       essay the case of a trade between england and germany in cloth and       linen        “we may at first make whatever supposition we will with respect to       the value of money let us suppose therefore that before the       opening of the trade the price of cloth is the same in both       countries namely six shillings per yard as ten yards of cloth       were supposed to exchange in england for fifteen yards of linen in       germany for twenty we must suppose that linen is sold in england at       four shillings per yard in germany at three cost of carriage and       importer’s profit are left as before out of consideration        “in this state of prices cloth it is evident can not yet be       exported from england into germany but linen can be imported from       germany into england it will be so and in the first instance the       linen will be paid for in money        “the efflux of money from england and its influx into germany will       raise money prices in the latter country and lower them in the       former linen will rise in germany above three shillings per yard       and cloth above six shillings linen in england being imported from       germany will since cost of carriage is not reckoned sink to the       same price as in that country while cloth will fall below six       shillings as soon as the price of cloth is lower in england than in       germany it will begin to be exported and the price of cloth in       germany will fall to what it is in england as long as the cloth       exported does not suffice to pay for the linen imported money will       continue to flow from england into germany and prices generally       will continue to fall in england and rise in germany        “by the fall however of cloth in england cloth will fall in       germany also and the demand for it will increase by the rise of       linen in germany linen must rise in england also and the demand       for it will diminish as cloth fell in price and linen rose there       would be some particular price of both articles at which the cloth       exported and the linen imported would exactly pay for each other at       this point prices would remain because money would then cease to       move out of england into germany what this point might be would       entirely depend upon the circumstances and inclinations of the       purchasers on both sides if the fall of cloth did not much increase       the demand for it in germany and the rise of linen did not diminish       very rapidly the demand for it in england much money must pass       before the equilibrium is restored cloth would fall very much and       linen would rise until england perhaps had to pay nearly as much       for it as when she produced it for herself but if on the       contrary the fall of cloth caused a very rapid increase of the       demand for it in germany and the rise of linen in germany reduced       very rapidly the demand in england from what it was under the       influence of the first cheapness produced by the opening of the       trade the cloth would very soon suffice to pay for the linen       little money would pass between the two countries and england would       derive a large portion of the benefit of the trade we have thus       arrived at precisely the same conclusion in supposing the       employment of money which we found to hold under the supposition of       barter        “in what shape the benefit accrues to the two nations from the trade       is clear enough germany before the commencement of the trade paid       six shillings per yard for broadcloth she now obtains it at a lower       price this however is not the whole of her advantage as the       moneyprices of all her other commodities have risen the       moneyincomes of all her producers have increased this is no       advantage to them in buying from each other because the price of       what they buy has risen in the same ratio with their means of paying       for it but it is an advantage to them in buying anything which has       not risen and still more anything which has fallen they       therefore benefit as consumers of cloth not merely to the extent       to which cloth has fallen but also to the extent to which other       prices have risen suppose that this is one tenth the same       proportion of their moneyincomes as before will suffice to supply       their other wants and the remainder being increased one tenth in       amount will enable them to purchase one tenth more cloth than       before even though cloth had not fallen but it has fallen so that       they are doubly gainers they purchase the same quantity with less       money and have more to expend upon their other wants        “in england on the contrary general moneyprices have fallen       linen however has fallen more than the rest having been lowered       in price by importation from a country where it was cheaper whereas       the others have fallen only from the consequent efflux of money       notwithstanding therefore the general fall of moneyprices the       english producers will be exactly as they were in all other       respects while they will gain as purchasers of linen        “the greater the efflux of money required to restore the       equilibrium the greater will be the gain of germany both by the       fall of cloth and by the rise of her general prices the less the       efflux of money requisite the greater will be the gain of england       because the price of linen will continue lower and her general       prices will not be reduced so much it must not however be       imagined that high moneyprices are a good and low moneyprices an       evil in themselves but the higher the general moneyprices in any       country the greater will be that country’s means of purchasing       those commodities which being imported from abroad are       independent of the causes which keep prices high at home”        “in practice the cloth and the linen would not as here supposed       be at the same price in england and in germany each would be dearer       in moneyprice in the country which imported than in that which       produced it by the amount of the cost of carriage together with       the ordinary profit on the importer’s capital for the average length       of time which elapsed before the commodity could be disposed of but       it does not follow that each country pays the cost of carriage of       the commodity it imports for the addition of this item to the price       may operate as a greater check to demand on one side than on the       other and the equation of international demand and consequent       equilibrium of payments may not be maintained money would then       flow out of one country into the other until in the manner already       illustrated the equilibrium was restored and when this was       effected one country would be paying more than its own cost of       carriage and the other less”—mill    278 see book

industrial       pursuit—mill it is however worth recalling that gold and silver       mining have not been—for large effects on the value of the       metals—anything like a permanent branch of industry but that in       the main great additions have been obtained suddenly and by chance       discoveries—j l l    284 see walker “money” chap xix    285 book ii chap v § 1    286 i do not

one that       has attracted the most attention was made nearly forty years since       by mr gurdon on his estate at assington near sudbury in suffolk       mr gurdon was so much impressed with the miserable condition of the       agricultural laborers who were employed on his estate that he was       prompted to do something on their behalf when therefore one of       his farms became vacant he offered to let it at the ordinary rent       £150 a year to the laborers who worked upon it as they of course       had not sufficient capital to cultivate it he in the first instance       loaned them the requisite stock and implements the laborers were       in fact formed into a company in which there were eleven shares       and no laborer was permitted to hold more than one share the plan       was so eminently successful that in a few years sufficient had been       saved out of the profits to repay all that had been advanced and       the stock and implements became the property of the laborers each       share greatly increased in value mr gurdon was so much encouraged       not only by the pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers but       also by the general improvement effected in their condition that       some years afterward he let another and a larger farm on similar       terms although no statement of accounts has ever been published       the remarkable pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers is       proved by the fact that after enjoying at least as high wages as       were paid in the district they were able in a few years to become       the owners of a valuable property consisting of the stock and       implements on the farms one of the most significant and hopeful       circumstances connected with the experiment is that it was not       carried out by a picked body of men and if so much could be done by       laborers who were probably among the worst educated in the country       it maybe fairly concluded that when the intelligence of our rural       population has been better developed cooperation may be applied in       a more complete form to agriculture and with even more striking       results than were obtained at assington in the description which       has been frequently given of the system of peasant proprietorship       it is shown how powerfully the industry of the laborer is stimulated       by the feeling of property when he cultivates his own plot of       ground he exerts himself to the utmost because he knows that he       will enjoy all that is yielded by his labor each year with the       extended use of machinery in agriculture it is becoming more       advantageous to carry on farming on a large scale when therefore       cooperative agriculture becomes practicable land may be cultivated       by associations of laborers and thus many of the advantages       associated with the system of peasant proprietorship may be secured       while at the same time the disadvantages of small farming may be       avoided the progress toward cooperative agriculture will no doubt       be slow and gradual”    334 godkin “north american review” 1868 also see hermann

changed the sums mentioned in this illustration into our own       money    342 another common objection is that large and expensive accommodation       is often required not as a residence but for business but it is       an admitted principle that buildings or portions of buildings       occupied exclusively for business such as shops warehouses or       manufactories ought to be exempted from housetax        it has been also objected that houserent in the rural districts is       much lower than in towns and lower in some towns and in some rural       districts than in others so that a tax proportioned to it would       have a corresponding inequality of pressure to this however it       may be answered that in places where houserent is low persons of       the same amount of income usually live in larger and better houses       and thus expend in houserent more nearly the same proportion of       their incomes than might at first sight appear or if not the       probability will be that many of them live in those places precisely       because they are too poor to live elsewhere and have therefore       the strongest claim to be taxed lightly in some cases it is       precisely because the people are poor that houserent remains       low—mill    343 i have here also changed the amounts into our own money    344 this illustration has also been changed but only so far as to fit       the trade between england and the united states    345 probably the strongest known instance of a large revenue raised from       foreigners by a tax on exports is the opiumtrade with china the       high price of the article under the government monopoly which is       equivalent to a high export duty has so little effect in       discouraging its consumption that it is said to have been       occasionally sold in china for as much as its weight in       silver—mill    346 a landtax is to its extent an evidence that the state claims a       certain right in the soil and that it stands to the contributor as       it were in the place of a landlord this tax however is generally       so small that it does not materially diminish the rent of land so       far as it goes it is a tax on rent    347 some argue that the materials and instruments of all production       should be exempt from taxation but these when they do not enter       into the production of necessaries seem as proper subjects of       taxation as the finished article it is chiefly with reference to       foreign trade that such taxes have been considered injurious       internationally speaking they may be looked upon as export duties       and unless in cases in which an export duty is advisable they       should be accompanied with an equivalent drawback on exportation       but there is no sufficient reason against taxing the materials and       instruments used in the production of anything which is itself a fit       object of taxation—mill    348 see lalor’s “cyclopædia”

when in       reality they mean that which to the economist is expressed by “cost       of labor” if cost of labor becomes higher it takes from       profits—the place where they feel the difficulties of       competition—but they say that the cost of production has risen the       cost to them only has risen that is the “cost of labor” not       “cost of production”    366 cf cairnes “leading
