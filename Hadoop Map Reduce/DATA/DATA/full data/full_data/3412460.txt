storeroom to fetch cherrystones and thistledown seed for dinner  all along the passage she sniffed and looked at the floor  i smell a smell of honey is it the cowslips outside in the hedge i am sure i can see the marks of little dirty feet  illustration marks of little feet  illustration babbitty bumble  suddenly round a corner she met babbitty bumblezizz bizz bizzz said the bumble bee  mrs

and say zizz bizz bizzz mrs tittlemouse began to get cross  zizz wizz wizzz replied babbitty bumble in a peevish squeak she sidled down a passage and disappeared into a storeroom which had been used for acorns  mrs tittlemouse had eaten the acorns before christmas the storeroom ought to have been empty  but it was full of untidy dry moss  illustration full of moss  illustration bees nest  mrs

fender  he lived in a drain below the hedge in a very dirty wet ditch  illustration mr jackson  illustration sitting and dripping  how do you do mr jackson deary me you have got very wet  thank you thank you thank you mrs tittlemouse ill sit awhile and dry myself said mr jackson  he sat and smiled and the water dripped off his coat tails mrs tittlemouse went round with a mop  he sat such a while that he had to be asked if he would take some dinner  first she offered him cherrystones thank you thank you mrs tittlemouse no teeth no teeth no teeth said mr jackson  he opened his mouth most

look into the cupboards  mrs tittlemouse followed him with a dishcloth to wipe his large wet footmarks off the parlour floor  illustration wiping up footmarks  illustration walking down the passage  when he had convinced himself that there was no honey in the cupboards he began to walk down the passage  indeed indeed you will stick fast mr jackson  tiddly widdly widdly mrs tittlemouse  first he

early and began a spring cleaning which lasted a fortnight  she swept and scrubbed and dusted and she rubbed up the furniture with beeswax and polished her little tin spoons  illustration polishing
