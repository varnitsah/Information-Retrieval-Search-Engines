                                        335     joseph de maistre   owing to causes which lie tolerably near the surface the remarkable catholic reaction which took place in france at the beginning of the present century has never received in england the attention that it deserves not only for its striking interest as an episode in the history of european thought but also for its peculiarly forcible and complete presentation of those ideas with which what is called the modern spirit is supposed to be engaged in deadly war for one thing the protestantism of england strips a genuinely catholic movement of speculation of that pressing and practical importance which belongs to it in countries where nearly all spiritual sentiment that has received any impression of religion at all unavoidably runs in catholic forms with us the theological reaction against the ideas of the eighteenth was not and could not be other than protestant the defence and reinstatement of christianity in each case was conducted as might have been expected with reference to the dominant creed and system of the country if coleridge had been a catholic his works thus newly coloured by an alien creed would have been read by a small sect only instead of exercising as they did a wide influence over the whole nation reaching people through those usual conduits of press and pulpit by which the products of philosophic thought are conveyed to unphilosophic minds as naturally in france hostility to all those influences which were believed to have brought about the revolution to sensationalism in metaphysics to atheism in what should have been theology to the notion of sovereignty of peoples in politics inevitably sought a rallyingpoint in a renewed allegiance to that prodigious spiritual system which had fostered the germs of order and social feeling in europe and whose name remains even now in the days of its ruin as the most permanent symbol and exemplar of stable organisation another reason for english indifference to this movement is the rapidity with which here as elsewhere dust gathers thickly round the memory of the champions of lost causes some of the most excellent of human characteristicsintensity of belief for example and a fervid anxiety to realise aspirationsunite with some of the least excellent of them to make us too habitually forget that as mill has said the best adherents of a fallen standard in philosophy in religion in politics are usually next in all good qualities of understanding and sentiment to the best of those who lead the van of the force that triumphs men are not so anxious as they should be considering the infinite diversity of effort that goes to the advancement of mankind to pick up the fragments of truth and positive contribution that so nothing be lost and as a consequence the writings of antagonists with whom we are believed to have nothing in common lie unexamined and disregarded  in the case of the group of writers who after a century of criticism ventured once more with an intrepid confidencediffering fundamentally from the tone of preceding apologists in the protestant camp who were nearly as critical as the men they refutedto vindicate not the bare outlines of christian faith but the entire scheme in its extreme manifestation of the most ancient and severely maligned of all christian organisations this apathy is very much to be regretted on several grounds in the first place it is impossible to see intelligently to the bottom of the momentous spirit of ultramontanism which is so deep a difficulty of continental europe and which touching us in ireland is perhaps already one of our own deepest difficulties without comprehending in its best shape the theory on which ultramontanism rests and this theory it is impossible to seize thoroughly without some knowledge of the ideas of its most efficient defenders in its earlier years secondly it is among these ideas that we have to look for the representation in their most direct logical uncompromising and unmistakable form of those theological ways of regarding life and prescribing right conduct whose more or less rapidly accelerated destruction is the first condition of the further elevation of humanity as well in power of understanding as in morals and spirituality in all contests of this kind there is the greatest and most obvious advantage in being able to see your enemy full against the light thirdly in one or two respects the catholic reactionaries at the beginning of the century insisted very strongly on principles of society which the general thought of the century before had almost entirely dropped out of sight and which we who in spite of many differences still sail down the same great current and are propelled by the same great tide are accustomed almost equally either to leave in the background of speculation or else deliberately to deny and suppress such we may account the importance which they attach to organisation and the value they set upon a common spiritual faith and doctrine as a social basis that the form which the recognition of these principles is destined to assume will at all correspond to their hopes and anticipations is one of the most unlikely things possible this however need not detract from the worth for our purpose of their exposition of the principles themselves again the visible traces of the impression made by the writings of this school on the influential founder of the earliest positivist system are sufficiently deep and important to make some knowledge of them of the highest historical interest both to those who accept and those who detest that system  at the beginning of the nineteenth century there were three chief schools of thought the sensational the catholic and the eclectic or as it may be put in other terms the materialist the theological and the spiritualist the first looked for the sources of knowledge the sanction of morals the inspiring fountain and standard of æsthetics to the outside of men to matter and the impressions made by matter on the corporeal senses the second looked to divine revelation authority and the traditions of the church the third steering a middle course looked partly within and partly without relied partly on the senses partly on revelation and history but still more on a certain internal consciousness of a direct and immediate kind which is the supreme and reconciling judge of the reports alike of the senses of history of divine revelation1 each of these schools had many exponents the three most conspicuous champions of revived catholicism were de maistre de bonald and chateaubriand the last of them the author of the génie du christianisme was effective in france because he is so deeply sentimental but he was too little trained in speculation and too little equipped with knowledge to be fairly taken as the best intellectual representative of their way of thinking de bonald was of much heavier calibre he really thought while chateaubriand only felt and the législation primitive and the pensées sur divers sujets contain much that an enemy of the school will find it worth while to read in spite of an artificial and if a foreigner may judge a detestable style  de maistre was the greatest of the three and deserves better than either of the others to stand as the type of the school for many reasons his style is so marvellously lucid that notwithstanding the mystical or as he said the illuminist side of his mind we can never be in much doubt about his meaning which is not by any means the case with bonald to say nothing of his immensely superior natural capacity de maistres extensive reading in the literature of his foes was a source of strength which might indeed have been thought indispensable if only other persons had not attacked the same people as he did without knowing much or anything at all at firsthand about them then he goes over the whole field of allied subjects which we have a right to expect to have handled by anybody with a systematic view of the origin of knowledge the meaning of ethics the elements of social order and progressiveness the government and scheme of the universe and above all his writings are penetrated with the air of reality and life which comes of actual participation in the affairs of that world with which social philosophers have to deal lamennais had in many respects a finer mind than de maistre but the conclusions in which he was finally landed no less than his liberal aims prevent him from being an example of the truly catholic reaction he obviously represented the revolution or the critical spirit within the catholic limits while de maistres ruling idea was in his own trenchant phrase absolument tuer lesprit du dixhuitième siècle on all these accounts he appears to be the fittest expositor of those conceptions which the anarchy that closed the eighteenth century provoked into systematic existence  footnote  1 see damirons la philosophie en france au xixième siècle introduction to vol i fifth edition     i   joseph de maistre was born at chambéry in the year 17542 his family was the younger branch of a stock in languedoc which about the beginning of the seventeenth century divided itself into two one remaining in france the other establishing itself in piedmont it is not wonderful that the descendants of the latter settled in a country of small extent and little political importance placed a high value on their kinship with an ancient line in the powerful kingdom of france joseph de maistre himself was always particularly anxious to cultivate close relations with his french kinsfolk partly from the old aristocratic feeling of blood and partly from his intellectual appreciation of the gifts of the french mind and its vast influence as an universal propagating power his father held a high office in the government of savoy and enjoyed so eminent a reputation that on his death both the senate and the king of sardinia deliberately recorded their appreciation of his loss as a public calamity his mother is said to have been a woman of lofty and devout character and her influence over her eldest son was exceptionally strong and tender he used to declare in after life that he was as docile in her hands as the youngest of his sisters among other marks of his affectionate submission to parental authority we are told that during the whole time of his residence at turin where he followed a course of law he never read a single book without previously writing to chambéry to one or other of his parents for their sanction such traditions linger in families and when he came to have children of his own they too read nothing of which their father had not been asked to express his approbation de maistres early education was directed by the jesuits and as might have been expected from the generous susceptibility of his temper he never ceased to think of them with warm esteem to the end of his life he remembered the gloom which fell upon the household though he was not nine years old at the time when the news arrived of the edict of 1764 abolishing the society in the kingdom of france one element of his education he commemorates in a letter to his favourite daughter let your brother he says work hard at the french poets let him learn them by heart especially the incomparable racine never mind whether he understands him yet or not i didnt understand him when my mother used to come repeating his verses by my bedside and lulled me to sleep with her fine voice to the sound of that inimitable music i knew hundreds of lines long before i knew how to read and it is thus that my ears accustomed betimes to this ambrosia have never since been able to endure any sourer draught  after his law studies at the university of turin then highly renowned for its jurisconsults the young de maistre went through the successive stages of an official career performing various duties in the public administration and possessing among other honours a seat in the senate over which his father presided he led a tranquil life at chambéry then as at all other times an ardent reader and student unaided he taught himself five languages english he mastered so perfectly that though he could not follow it when spoken he could read a book in that tongue with as much ease as if it had been in his own to greek and german he did not apply himself until afterwards and he never acquired the same proficiency in them as in english french italian latin and spanish to be ignorant of german then it will be remembered was not what it would be now to be without one of the literary senses  like nearly every other great soldier of reaction he showed in his early life a decided inclination for new ideas the truth that the wildest extravagances of youthful aspiration are a better omen of a vigorous and enlightened manhood than the decorous and ignoble faith in the perfection of existing arrangements was not belied in the case of de maistre his intelligence was of too hard and exact a kind to inspire him with the exalted schemes that present themselves to those more nobly imaginative minds who dream dreams and see visions he projected no savoyard emigration to the banks of the susquehanna or delaware to found millennial societies and pantisocratic unions these generous madnesses belong to men of more poetic temper but still in spite of the deadening influences of officialism and relations with a court de maistre had far too vigorous and active a character to subside without resistance into the unfruitful ways of obstruction and social complacency it is one of the most certain marks we may be sure of a superior spirit that the impulses earliest awakened by its first fresh contact with the facts of the outer world are those which quicken a desire for the improvement of the condition of society the increase of the happiness of men the amelioration of human destiny with this unwritten condition of human nature de maistre like other men of his mental calibre is found to have complied he incurred the suspicion and illwill of most of those by whom he was immediately surrounded by belonging to a reform lodge at chambéry the association was one of a perfectly harmless character but being an association it diffused a tarnishing vapour of social disaffection and insurgency over the names of all who ventured to belong to it and de maistre was pointed out to the sardinian court as a man with leanings towards new things and therefore one of whom it were well to beware there was little ground for apprehension in very small countries there is seldom room enough for the growth of a spirit of social revolution not at least until some great and dominant country has released the forces of destruction so when the menacing sounds of the approaching hurricane in france grew heavy in the air the little lodge at chambéry voluntarily dissolved itself and de maistre was deputed to convey to the king victor amadeo iii the honourable assurance of its members that they had assembled for the last time  in 1786 at the age of thirtytwo de maistre had married and when the storm burst which destroyed all the hopes of his life he was the father of two children in one of his gay letters to a venerable lady who was on intimate terms with them both he has left a picture of his wife which is not any less interesting for what it reveals of his own character the contrast between us two is the very strangest in the world for me as you may have found out i am the pococurante senator and above all things very free in saying what i think she on the contrary will take care that it is noon before allowing that the sun has risen for fear of committing herself she knows what must be done or what must not be done on the tenth of october 1808 at ten oclock in the morning to avoid some inconvenience which otherwise would come to pass at midnight between the fifteenth and sixteenth of march 1810 but my dear husband you pay attention to nothing you believe that nobody is thinking of any harm now i know i have been told i have guessed i foresee i warn you etc come now my dear leave me alone you are only wasting your time i foresee that i shall never foresee things thats your business she is the supplement to me and hence when i am separated from her as i am now i suffer absurdly from being obliged to think about my own affairs i would rather have to chop wood all day my children ought to kiss her very steps for my part i have no gift for education she has such a gift that i look upon it as nothing less than the eighth endowment of the holy ghost i mean a certain fond persecution by which it is given her to torment her children from morning to night to do something not to do something to learnand yet without for a moment losing their tender affection for her how can she manage it i cannot make it out she was laughingly called by himself and her friends madame prudence it is certain that few women have found more necessity for the qualities implied in this creditable nickname  they had not been married many years before they were overtaken by irreparable disaster the french revolution broke out and savoy was invaded by the troops of the new republic count de maistre with his wife and children fled from chambéry across the alps to aosta ma chère amie he said to his wife by the side of a great rock which he never afterwards forgot the step that we are taking today is irrevocable it decides our lot for life and the presentiment was true soon the loi des allobroges was promulgated which enjoined upon all who had left their homes in savoy to return instantly under pain of confiscation of all their property it was the very depth of winter madame de maistre was in the ninth month of her pregnancy she knew that her husband would endure anything rather than expose her to the risks of a journey in such a season so urged by a desire to save something from the wreck of their fortune by compliance with the french decree she seized the opportunity of her husbands absence at turin and started for savoy without acquainting him with her design she crossed the great st bernard in the beginning of january on the back of a mule accompanied by her two little children wrapped in blankets the count on his return to aosta two or three days afterwards forthwith set off in her steps in the trembling expectation of finding her dead or dying in some alpine hovel but the favour of fate and a stout heart brought her safe to chambéry where shortly afterwards she was joined by her husband the authorities vainly tendered him the oath vainly bade him inscribe his name on the register of citizens and when they asked him for a contribution to support the war he replied curtly that he did not give money to kill his brothers in the service of the king of sardinia as soon as his wife was delivered of their third child whom he was destined not to see again for nearly twenty years he quitted her side abandoned his property and his country and took refuge at lausanne where in time his wife and his two eldest children once more came to him  gibbon tells us how a swarm of emigrants escaping from the public ruin was attracted by the vicinity the manners and the language of lausanne they are entitled to our pity he reflected and they may claim our esteem but they cannot in their present state of mind and fortune contribute much to our amusement instead of looking down as calm and idle spectators on the theatre of europe our domestic harmony is somewhat embittered by the infusion of party spirit gibbon died in london almost at the very moment that de maistre arrived at lausanne but his account of things remained true and political feuds continued to run as high as ever among the people with whom de maistre was thrown was madame de staël as we had not been to the same school he says either in theology or in politics we had some scenes enough to make one die of laughter still without quarrelling her father who was then alive was the friend and relative of people that i love with all my heart and that i would not vex for all the world so i allowed the émigrés who surrounded us to cry out as they would without ever drawing the sword de maistre thought he never came across a head so completely turned wrong as madame de staëls the infallible consequence as he took it to be of modern philosophy operating upon a womans nature he once said of her ah if madame de staël had been catholic she would have been adorable instead of famous we can believe that his position among the french émigrés was not particularly congenial for though they hated the revolution they had all drunk of the waters of the eighteenth century philosophy and de maistre hated this philosophy worse than he hated the revolution itself then again they would naturally vapour about the necessities of strong government yes said the savoyard exile but be quite sure that to make the monarchy strong you must rest it on the laws avoiding everything arbitrary too frequent commissions and all ministerial jobberies we may well believe how unsavoury this rational and just talk was to people who meant by strong government a system that should restore to them their old prerogatives of antisocial oppression and selfish corruption the order that de maistre vindicated was a very different thing from the deadly and poisonous order which was the object of the prayers of the incorrigible royalists around him  after staying three years at lausanne de maistre went to turin but shortly afterwards the sardinian king at the end of a long struggle was forced to succumb to the power of the french then in the full tide of success bonapartes brilliant italian campaign needs no words here the french entered turin and de maistre being an émigré had to leave it furnished with a false passport and undergoing a thousand hardships and dangers he made his way once more in the depth of a severe winter 1797 to venice he went part of the way down the po in a small trading ship crowded with ladies priests monks soldiers and a bishop there was only one small fire on board at which all the cooking had to be done and where the unhappy passengers had to keep themselves warm as they could at night they were confined each to a space about three planks broad separated from neighbours by pieces of canvas hanging from a rope above each bank of the river was lined by military poststhe left by the austrians and the right by the french and the danger of being fired into was constantly present to aggravate the misery of overcrowding scanty food and bitter cold even this wretchedness was surpassed by the hardships which confronted the exiles at venice the physical distress endured here by de maistre and his unfortunate family exceeded that of any other period of their wanderings he was cut off from the court and from all his relations and friends and reduced for the means of existence to a few fragments of silver plate which had somehow been saved from the universal wreck this slender resource grew less day by day and when that was exhausted the prospect was a blank the student of de maistres philosophy may see in what crushing personal anguish some of its most sinister growths had their roots when the cares of beggary come suddenly upon a man in middle life they burn very deep alone and starving for a cause that is dear to him he might encounter the grimness of fate with a fortitude in which there should be many elevating and consoling elements but the destiny is intolerably hard which condemns a man of humane mould as de maistre certainly was to look helplessly on the physical pains of a tender woman and famishing little ones the anxieties that press upon his heart in such calamity as this are too sharp too tightened and too sordid for him to draw a single free breath or to raise his eyes for a single moment of relief from the monstrous perplexity that chokes him the hour of bereavement has its bitterness but the bitterness is gradually suffused with soft reminiscence the grip of beggary leaves a mark on such a character as de maistres which no prosperity of after days effaces the seeming inhumanity of his theory of life which is so revolting to comfortable people like m villemain was in truth the only explanation of his own cruel sufferings in which he could find any solace it was not that he hated mankind but that his destiny looked as if god hated him and this was a horrible moral complexity out of which he could only extricate himself by a theory in which pain and torment seem to stand out as the main facts in human existence  to him indeed prosperity never came hope smiled on him momentarily but in his own words it was only a flash in the night while he was in venice the armies of austria and russia reconquered the north of italy and charles emanuel iv in the natural anticipation that the allies would at once restore his dominions hastened forward austria however as de maistre had seen long before was indifferent or even absolutely hostile to sardinian interests and she successfully opposed charles emanuels restoration the king received the news of the perfidy of his nominal ally at florence but not until after he had made arrangements for rewarding the fidelity of some of his most loyal adherents  it was from florence that de maistre received the kings nomination to the chief place in the government of the island of sardinia through the short time of his administration here he was overwhelmed with vexations only a little more endurable than the physical distresses which had weighed him down at venice during the war justice had been administered in a grossly irregular manner hence people had taken the law into their own hands and retaliation had completed the round of wrongdoing the taxes were collected with great difficulty the higher class exhibited an invincible repugnance to paying their debts some of these difficulties in the way of firm and orderly government were insuperable and de maistre vexed his soul in an unequal and only partially successful contest in after years amid the miseries of his life in russia he wrote to his brother thus sometimes in moments of solitude that i multiply as much as i possibly can i throw my head back on the cushion of my sofa and there with my four walls around me far from all that is dear to me confronted by a sombre and impenetrable future i recall the days when in a little town that you know wellhe meant cagliariwith my head resting on another sofa and only seeing around our own exclusive circle good heavens what an impertinence little men and little things i used to ask myself am i then condemned to live and die in this place like a limpet on a rock i suffered bitterly my head was overloaded wearied flattened by the enormous weight of nothing  but presently a worse thing befell him in 1802 he received an order from the king to proceed to st petersburg as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary at the court of russia even from this bitter proof of devotion to his sovereign he did not shrink he had to tear himself from his wife and children without any certainty when so cruel a separation would be likely to end to take up new functions which the circumstances of the time rendered excessively difficult while the petty importance of the power he represented and its mendicant attitude in europe robbed his position of that public distinction and dignity which may richly console a man for the severest private sacrifice it is a kind destiny which veils their future from mortal men fifteen years passed before de maistres exile came to a close from 1802 to 1817 he did not quit the inhospitable latitudes of northern russia  de maistres letters during this desolate period furnish a striking picture of his manner of life and his mental state we see in them his most prominent characteristics strongly marked not even the painfulness of the writers situation ever clouds his intrepid and vigorous spirit lively and gallant sallies of humour to his female friends sagacious judgments on the position of europe to political people bits of learned criticism for erudite people tender and playful chat with his two daughters all these alternate with one another with the most delightful effect whether he is writing to his little girl whom he has never known or to the king of sardinia or to some author who sends him a book or to a minister who has found fault with his diplomacy there is in all alike the same constant and remarkable play of a bright and penetrating intellectual light coloured by a humour that is now and then a little sardonic but more often is genial and lambent there is a certain semilatent quality of hardness lying at the bottom of de maistres style both in his letters and in his more elaborate compositions his writings seem to recall the flavour and bouquet of some of the fortifying and stimulating wines of burgundy from which time and warmth have not yet drawn out a certain native roughness that lingers on the palate this hardness if one must give the quality a name that only imperfectly describes it sprang not from any original want of impressionableness or sensibility of nature but partly from the relentless buffetings which he had to endure at the hands of fortune and partly from the preponderance which had been given to the rational side of his mind by long habits of sedulous and accurate study few men knew so perfectly as he knew how to be touching without ceasing to be masculine nor how to go down into the dark pits of human life without forgetting the broad sunlight nor how to keep habitually close to visible and palpable fact while eagerly addicted to speculation his contemplations were perhaps somewhat too near the ground they led him into none of those sublimer regions of subtle feeling where the rarest human spirits have loved to travel we do not think of his mind among those who have gone      voyaging through strange seas of thought alone  if this kind of temper strong keen frank and a little hard and mordent brought him too near a mischievous disbelief in the dignity of men and their lives at least it kept him well away from morbid weakness in ethics and from beating the winds in metaphysics but of this we shall see more in considering his public pieces than can be gathered from his letters  the discomforts of de maistres life at st petersburg were extreme the dignity of his official style and title was an aggravation of the exceeding straitness of his means the ruined master could do little to mitigate the ruin of his servant he had to keep up the appearance of an ambassador on the salary of a clerk this is the second winter he writes to his brother in 1810 that i have gone through without a pelisse which is exactly like going without a shirt at cagliari when i come from court a very sorry lackey throws a common cloak over my shoulders the climate suited him better than he had expected and in one letter he vows that he was the only living being in russia who had passed two winters without fur boots and a fur hat it was considered indispensable that he should keep a couple of servants so for his second de maistre was obliged to put up with a thief whom he rescued under the shelter of ambassadorial privilege from the hands of justice on condition that he would turn honest the austrian ambassador with whom he was on good terms would often call to take him out to some entertainment his fine servants mount my staircase groping their way in the dark and we descend preceded by a servant carrying luminare minus quam ut præesset nocti i am certain he adds pleasantly that they make songs about me in their austrian patois poor souls it is well they can amuse themselves  sometimes he was reduced so far as to share the soup of his valet for lack of richer and more independent fare then he was constantly fretted by enemies at home who disliked his trenchant diplomacy and distrusted the strength and independence of a mind which was too vigorous to please the oldfashioned ministers of the sardinian court these chagrins he took as a wise man should they disturbed him less than his separation from his family six hundred leagues away from you all he writes to his brother the thoughts of my family the reminiscences of childhood transport me with sadness visions of his mothers saintly face haunted his chamber almost gloomier still was the recollection of old intimates with whom he had played lived argued and worked for years and yet who now no longer bore him in mind there are not many glimpses of this melancholy in the letters meant for the eye of his beloved trinité féminine as he playfully called his wife and two daughters a quoi bon vous attrister he asked bravely sans raison et sans profit occasionally he cannot help letting out to them how far his mind is removed from composure every day as i return home i found my house as desolate as if it was yesterday you left me in society the same fancy pursues me and scarcely ever quits me music as might be surmised in so sensitive a nature drove him almost beside himself with its mysterious power of intensifying the dominant emotion whenever by any chance i hear the harpsichord he says melancholy seizes me the sound of the violin gives me such a heavy heart that i am fain to leave the company and hasten home he tossed in his bed at night thinking he heard the sound of weeping at turin making a thousand efforts to picture to himself the looks of that orphan child of a living father whom he had never known wondering if ever he should know her and battling with a myriad of black phantoms that seemed to rustle in his curtains but you m de chevalier he said apologetically to the correspondent to whom he told these dismal things you are a father you know the cruel dreams of a waking man if you were not of the profession i would not allow my pen to write you this jeremiad as de maistre was accustomed to think himself happy if he got three hours sound sleep in the night these sombre and terrible vigils were ample enough to excuse him if he had allowed them to overshadow all other things but the vigour of his intellect was too strenuous and his curiosity and interest in every object of knowledge too inextinguishable after all he said the only thing to do is to put on a good face and to march to the place of torture with a few friends to console you on the way this is the charming image under which i picture my present situation mark you he added i always count books among ones consoling friends  in one of the most gay and charming of his letters apologising to a lady for the remissness of his correspondence he explains that diplomacy and books occupy every moment you will admit madam there is no possibility of ones shutting up books entirely nay more than ever i feel myself burning with the feverish thirst for knowledge i have had an access of it which i cannot describe to you the most curious books literally run after me and hurry voluntarily to place themselves in my hands as soon as diplomacy gives me a moment of breathingtime i rush headlong to that favourite pasture to that ambrosia of which the mind can never have enough      et voilà ce qui fait que votre ami est muet  he thinks himself happy if by refusing invitations to dinner he can pass a whole day without stirring from his house i read i write i study for after all one must know something in his hours of depression he fancied that he only read and worked not for the sake of the knowledge but to stupefy and tire himself out if that were possible  as a student de maistre was indefatigable he never belonged to that languid band who hoped to learn difficult things by easy methods the only way he warned his son is to shut your door to say that you are not within and to work since they have set themselves to teach us how we ought to learn the dead languages you can find nobody who knows them and it is amusing enough that people who dont know them should be so obstinately bent on demonstrating the vices of the methods employed by us who do know them he was one of those wise and laborious students who do not read without a pen in their hands he never shrank from the useful toil of transcribing abundantly from all the books he read everything that could by any possibility eventually be of service to him in his inquiries his notebooks were enormous as soon as one of them was filled he carefully made up an index of its contents numbered it and placed it on a shelf with its unforgotten predecessors in one place he accidentally mentions that he had some thirty of these folios over the head of his writingtable  if i am a pedant at home he said at least i am as little as possible a pedant out of doors in the evening he would occasionally seek the society of ladies by way of recovering some of that native gaiety of heart which had hitherto kept him alive i blow on this spark to use his own words just as an old woman blows among the ashes to get a light for her lamp a student and a thinker de maistre was also a man of the world and he may be added to the long list of writers who have shown that to take an active part in public affairs and mix in society give a peculiar life reality and force to both scholarship and speculation it was computed at that time that the author of a philosophic piece could not safely count upon more than a hundred and fifty readers in russia and hence we might be sure even if we had not de maistres word for it that away from his own house he left his philosophy behind the vehemence of his own convictions did not prevent him from being socially tolerant to others who hated them if i had the good fortune to be among his acquaintances he wrote of a heretical assailant he would see that among the people with convictions it would be hard to find one so free from prejudice as i am i have many friends among the protestants and now that their system is tottering they are all the dearer to me in spite of his scanty means his shabby valet his threadbare cloak and the humbleness of his diplomatic position the fire and honesty of his character combined with his known ability to place him high in the esteem of the society of st petersburg his fidelity devotion and fortitude mellowed by many years and by meditative habits and tinged perhaps by the patrician consciousness of birth formed in him a modest dignity of manner which men respected they perceived it to be no artificial assumption but the outward image of a lofty and selfrespecting spirit his brother diplomatists even the representatives of france appear to have treated him with marked consideration his letters prove him to have been a favourite among ladies the emperor alexander showed him considerable kindness of the cheap royal sort he conferred on his brother xavier de maistre a post in one of the public museums while to the sardinian envoys son he gave a commission in the russian service  the first departure of this son for the campaign of 1807 occasioned some of the most charming passages in de maistres letters both to the young soldier himself and to others for though without a touch of morbid expansiveness he never denied himself the solace of opening his heart to a trusted friend and a just reserve with strangers did not hinder a humane and manly confidence with intimates this morning he wrote to his stripling soon after he had joined the army i felt a tightening at my heart when a pet dog came running in and jumped upon your bed where he finds you no more he soon perceived his mistake and said clearly enough after his own fashion i am mistaken where can he be then as for me i have felt all that you will feel if ever you pursue this mighty trade of being a father and then he begs of his son if he should find himself with a tape line in his hand that he will take his exact measure and forward it soon came the news of the battle of friedland and the unhappy father thought he read the fate of his son in the face of every acquaintance he met and so it was in later campaigns as de maistre records in correspondence that glows with tender and healthy solicitude all this is worth dwelling upon for two reasons first because de maistre has been too much regarded and spoken of as a man of cold sensibility and little moved by the hardships which fill the destiny of our unfortunate race and secondly because his own keen acquaintance with mental anguish helps us to understand the zeal with which he attempts to reconcile the blind cruelty and pain and torture endured by mortals with the benignity and wisdom of the immortal after all he used to say there are only two real evilsremorse and disease this is true enough for an apophthegm but as a matter of fact it never for an instant dulled his sensibility to far less supreme forms of agony than the recollection of irreparable pain struck into the lives of others it is interesting and suggestive to recall how a later publicist viewed the ills that dwarf our little lives if i were asked to class human miseries said tocqueville i would do so in this order first disease second death third doubt at a later date he altered the order and deliberately declared doubt to be the most insupportable of all evils worse than death itself but tocqueville was an aristocrat as guizot once told him who accepted his defeat he stood on the brink of the great torrent of democracy and shivered de maistre was an aristocrat too but he was incapable of knowing what doubt or hesitation meant he never dreamt that his cause was lost and he mocked and defied the revolution to the end we easily see how natures of this sort ardent impetuous unflinching find themselves in the triumphant paths that lead to remorse at their close and how they thus come to feel remorse rather than doubt as the consummate agony of the human mind  having had this glimpse of de maistres character away from his books we need not linger long over the remaining events of his life in 1814 his wife and two daughters joined him in the russian capital two years later an outburst of religious fanaticism caused the sudden expulsion of the jesuits from russia to de maistres deep mortification several conversions had taken place from the orthodox to the western faith and these inflamed the orthodox party headed by the prince de galitzin the minister of public worship with violent theological fury de maistre whose intense attachment to his own creed was well known fell under suspicion of having connived at these conversions and the emperor himself went so far as to question him i told him de maistre says that i had never changed the faith of any of his subjects but that if any of them had by chance made me a sharer of their confidence neither honour nor conscience would have allowed me to tell them that they were wrong this kind of dialogue between a sovereign and an ambassador implied a situation plainly unfavourable to effective diplomacy the envoy obtained his recall and after twentyfive years absence returned to his native country 1817 on his way home it may be noticed de maistre passed a few days in paris and thus for the first and last time one of the most eminent of modern french writers found himself on french soil  the king accorded de maistre an honourable reception conferred upon him a high office and a small sum of money and lent his ear to other counsellors the philosopher though insisting on declaring his political opinions then as ever unwaveringly antirevolutionary threw himself mainly upon that literary composition which had been his solace in yet more evil days than these it was at this time that he gave to the world the supreme fruit of nearly half a century of study meditation and contact with the world in du pape les soirées de saint pétersbourg and leglise gallicane their author did not live long to enjoy the vast discussion which they occasioned nor the reputation that they have since conferred upon his name he died in february 1821 after such a life as we have seen  footnote  2 the facts of de maistres life i have drawn from a very meagre biography by his son count rodolphe de maistre supplemented by two volumes of lettres et opuscules fourth edition paris vaton 1865 and a volume of his diplomatic correspondence edited by m albert blanc     ii   it is not at all surprising that they upon whom the revolutionary deluge came should have looked with indiscriminating horror and affright on all the influences which in their view had united first to gather up and then to release the destructive flood the eighteenth century to men like de maistre seemed an infamous parenthesis mysteriously interposed between the glorious age of bossuet and fénelon and that yet brighter era for faith and the church which was still to come in the good time of divine providence the philosophy of the last century he says on more than one occasion will form one of the most shameful epochs of the human mind it never praised even good men except for what was bad in them he looked upon the gods whom that century had worshipped as the direct authors of the bloodshed and ruin in which their epoch had closed the memory of mild and humane philosophers was covered with the kind of black execration that prophets of old had hurled at baal or moloch locke and hume voltaire and rousseau were habitually spoken of as very scourges of god from this temper two consequences naturally flowed in the first place while it lasted there was no hope of an honest philosophic discussion of the great questions which divide speculative minds moderation and impartiality were virtues of almost superhuman difficulty for controversialists who had made up their minds that it was their opponents who had erected the guillotine confiscated the sacred property of the church slaughtered and banished her children and filled the land with terror and confusion it is hard amid the smoking ruins of the homestead to do full justice to the theoretical arguments of the supposed authors of the conflagration hence de maistre though as has been already said intimately acquainted with the works of his foes in the letter was prevented by the vehemence of his antipathy to the effects which he attributed to them from having any just critical estimate of their value and true spirit i do not know one of these men he says of the philosophers of the eighteenth century to whom the sacred title of honest man is quite suitable they are all wanting in probity their very names me déchirent la bouche to admire voltaire is the sign of a corrupt soul and if anybody is drawn to the works of voltaire then be sure that god does not love such an one the divine anathema is written on the very face of this archblasphemer on his shameless brow in the two extinct craters still sparkling with sensuality and hate in that frightful rictus running from ear to ear in those lips tightened by cruel malice like a spring ready to fly back and launch forth blasphemy and sarcasm he plunges into the mud rolls in it drinks of it he surrenders his imagination to the enthusiasm of hell which lends him all its forces paris crowned him sodom would have banished him3 locke again did not understand himself his distinguishing characteristics are feebleness and precipitancy of judgment vagueness and irresolution reign in his expressions as they do in his thoughts he constantly exhibits that most decisive sign of mediocrityhe passes close by the greatest questions without perceiving them in the study of philosophy contempt for locke is the beginning of knowledge4 condillac was even more vigilantly than anybody else on his guard against his own conscience but hume was perhaps the most dangerous and the most guilty of all those mournful writers who will for ever accuse the last century before posteritythe one who employed the most talent with the most coolness to do most harm5 to bacon de maistre paid the compliment of composing a long refutation of his main ideas in which bacons blindness presumption profanity and scientific charlatanry are denounced in vehement and almost coarse terms and treated as the natural outcome of a low morality  it has long been the inglorious speciality of the theological school to insist in this way upon moral depravity as an antecedent condition of intellectual error de maistre in this respect was not unworthy of his fellows he believed that his opponents were even worse citizens than they were bad philosophers and it was his horror of them in the former capacity that made him so bitter and resentful against them in the latter he could think of no more fitting image for opinions that he did not happen to believe than counterfeit money which is struck in the first instance by great criminals and is afterwards passed on by honest folk who perpetuate the crime without knowing what they do a philosopher of the highest class we may be sure does not permit himself to be drawn down from the true object of his meditations by these sinister emotions but de maistre belonged emphatically to minds of the second order whose eagerness to find truth is never intense and pure enough to raise them above perturbing antipathies to persons his whole attitude was fatal to his claim to be heard as a truthseeker in any right sense of the term he was not only persuaded of the general justice and inexpugnableness of the orthodox system but he refused to believe that it was capable of being improved or supplemented by anything which a temperate and fair examination of other doctrines might peradventure be found to yield with de maistre there was no peradventure again no speculative mind of the highest order ever mistakes or ever moves systematically apart from the main current of the social movement of its time it is implied in the very definition of a thinker of supreme quality that he should detect and be in a certain accord with the most forward and central of the ruling tendencies of his epoch threequarters of a century have elapsed since de maistre was driven to attempt to explain the world to himself and this interval has sufficed to show that the central conditions at that time for the permanent reorganisation of the society which had just been so violently rent in pieces were assuredly not theological military nor ultramontane but the very opposite of all these  there was a second consequence of the conditions of the time the catastrophe of europe affected the matter as well as the manner of contemporary speculation the french revolution has become to us no more than a term though the strangest term in a historic series to some of the best of those who were confronted on every side by its tumult and agitation it was the prevailing of the gates of hell the moral disruption of the universe the absolute and total surrender of the world to them that plough iniquity and sow wickedness even under ordinary circumstances few men have gone through life without encountering some triumphant iniquity some gross and prolonged cruelty which makes them wonder how god should allow such things to be if we remember the aspect which the revolution wore in the eyes of those who seeing it yet did not understand we can imagine what dimensions this eternal enigma must have assumed in their sight it was inevitable that the first problem to press on men with resistless urgency should be the ancient question of the method of the creators temporal government what is the law of the distribution of good and evil fortune how can we vindicate with regard to the conditions of this life the different destinies that fall to men how can we defend the moral ordering of a world in which the wicked and godless constantly triumph while the virtuous and upright who retain their integrity are as frequently buffeted and put to shame  this tremendous question has never been presented with such sublimity of expression such noble simplicity and force of thought as in the majestic and touching legend of job but its completeness as a presentation of the human tragedy is impaired by the excessive prosperity which is finally supposed to reward the patient hero for his fortitude job received twice as much as he had before and his latter end was blessed more than his beginning in the chronicles of actual history men fare not so there is a terribly logical finish about some of the dealings of fate and in life the working of a curse is seldom stayed by any dramatic necessity for a smooth consummation destiny is no artist the facts that confront us are relentless no statement of the case is adequate which maintains by ever so delicate an implication that in the long run and somehow it is well in temporal things with the just and ill with the unjust until we have firmly looked in the face the grim truth that temporal rewards and punishments do not follow the possession or the want of spiritual or moral virtue so long we are still ignorant what that enigma is which speculative men from the author of the book of job downwards have striven to resolve we can readily imagine the fulness with which the question would grow up in the mind of a royalist and catholic exile at the end of the eighteenth century  nothing can be more clearly put than de maistres answers to the question which the circumstances of the time placed before him to solve what is the law of the distribution of good and evil fortune in this life is it a moral law do prosperity and adversity fall respectively to the just and the unjust either individually or collectively has the ancient covenant been faithfully kept that whoso hearkens diligently to the divine voice and observes all the commandments to do them shall be blessed in his basket and his store and in all the work of his hand or is god a god that hideth himself  de maistre perceived that the optimistic conception of the deity as benign merciful infinitely forgiving was very far indeed from covering the facts so he insisted on seeing in human destiny the everpresent hand of a stern and terrible judge administering a draconian code with blind and pitiless severity god created men under conditions which left them free to choose between good and evil all the physical evil that exists in the world is a penalty for the moral evil that has resulted from the abuse by men of this freedom of choice for these physical calamities god is only responsible in the way in which a criminal judge is responsible for a hanging men cannot blame the judge for the gallows the fault is their own in committing those offences for which hanging is prescribed beforehand as the penalty these curses which dominate human life are not the result of the cruelty of the divine ruler but of the folly and wickedness of mankind who seeing the better course yet deliberately choose the worse the order of the world is overthrown by the iniquities of men it is we who have provoked the exercise of the divine justice and called down the tokens of his vengeance the misery and disaster that surround us like a cloak are the penalty of our crimes and the price of our expiation as the divine st thomas has said deus est auctor mali quod est poena non autem mali quod est culpa there is a certain quantity of wrong done over the face of the world therefore the great judge exacts a proportionate quantity of punishment the total amount of evil suffered makes nice equation with the total amount of evil done the extent of human suffering tallies precisely with the extent of human guilt of course you must take original sin into account which explains all and without which you can explain nothing in virtue of this primitive degradation we are subject to all sorts of physical sufferings in general just as in virtue of this same degradation we are subject to all sorts of vices in general this original malady therefore which is the correlative of original sin has no other name it is only the capacity of suffering all evils as original sin is only the capacity of committing all crimes6 hence all calamity is either the punishment of sins actually committed by the sufferers or else it is the general penalty exacted for general sinfulness sometimes an innocent being is stricken and a guilty being appears to escape but is it not the same in the transactions of earthly tribunals and yet we do not say that they are conducted without regard to justice and righteousness when god punishes any society for the crimes that it has committed he does justice as we do justice ourselves in these sorts of circumstance a city revolts it massacres the representatives of the sovereign it shuts its gates against him it defends itself against his arms it is taken the prince has it dismantled and deprived of all its privileges nobody will find fault with this decision on the ground that there are innocent persons shut up in the city7  de maistres deity is thus a colossal septembriseur enthroned high in the peaceful heavens demanding everrenewed holocausts in the name of the public safety  it is true as a general rule of the human mind that the objects which men have worshipped have improved in morality and wisdom as men themselves have improved the quiet gods without effort of their own have grown holier and purer by the agitations and toil which civilise their worshippers in other words the same influences which elevate and widen our sense of human duty give corresponding height and nobleness to our ideas of the divine character the history of the civilisation of the earth is the history of the civilisation of olympus also it will be seen that the deity whom de maistre sets up is below the moral level of the time in respect of punishment in intellectual matters he vehemently proclaimed the superiority of the tenth or the twelfth over the eighteenth century but it is surely carrying admiration for those loyal times indecently far to seek in the vindictive sackings of revolted towns and the miscellaneous butcheries of men women and babes which then marked the vengeance of outraged sovereignty the most apt parallel and analogy for the systematic administration of human society by its creator such punishment can no longer be regarded as moral in any deep or permanent sense it implies a gross harsh and revengeful character in the executioner that is eminently perplexing and incredible to those who expect to find an idea of justice in the government of the world at least not materially below what is attained in the clumsy efforts of uninspired publicists  in mere point of administration the criminal code which de maistre put into the hands of the supreme being works in a more arbitrary and capricious manner than any device of an italian bourbon as voltaire asks      lisbonne qui nest plus eutelle plus de vices     que londres que paris plongés dans les délices     lisbonne est abîmée et lon danse à paris   stay de maistre replies look at paris thirty years later not dancing but red with blood this kind of thing is often said even now but it is really time to abandon the prostitution of the name of justice to a process which brings lewis xvi to the block and consigns de maistre to poverty and exile because lewis xiv the regent and lewis xv had been profligate men or injudicious rulers the reader may remember how the unhappy emperor maurice as his five innocent sons were in turn murdered before his eyes at each stroke piously ejaculated thou art just o lord and thy judgments are righteous8 any name would befit this kind of transaction better than that which in the dealings of men with one another at least we reserve for the honourable anxiety that he should reap who has sown that the reward should be to him who has toiled for it and the pain to him who has deliberately incurred it what is gained by attributing to the divine government a method tainted with every quality that could vitiate the enactment of penalties by a temporal sovereign  we need not labour this part of the discussion further though conducted with much brilliance and vigour by de maistre it is not his most important nor remarkable contribution to thought before passing on to that it is worth while to make one remark it will be inferred from de maistres general position that he was no friend to physical science just as moderns see in the advance of the methods and boundaries of physical knowledge the most direct and sure means of displacing the unfruitful subjective methods of old and so of renovating the entire field of human thought and activity so did de maistre see as his school has seen since that here was the stronghold of his foes ah how dearly he exclaimed has man paid for the natural sciences not but that providence designed that man should know something about them only it must be in due order the ancients were not permitted to attain to much or even any sound knowledge of physics indisputably above us as they were in force of mind a fact shown by the superiority of their languages which ought to silence for ever the voice of our modern pride why did the ancients remain so ignorant of natural science because they were not christian when all europe was christian when the priests were the universal teachers when all the establishments of europe were christianised when theology had taken its place at the head of all instruction and the other faculties were ranged around her like maids of honour round their queen the human race being thus prepared then the natural sciences were given to it science must be kept in its place for it resembles fire which when confined in the grates prepared for it is the most useful and powerful of mans servants scattered about anyhow it is the most terrible of scourges whence the marked supremacy of the seventeenth century especially in france from the happy accord of religion science and chivalry and from the supremacy conceded to the first the more perfect theology is in a country the more fruitful it is in true science and that is why christian nations have surpassed all others in the sciences and that is why the indians and chinese will never reach us so long as we remain respectively as we are the more theology is cultivated honoured and supreme then other things being equal the more perfect will human science be that is to say it will have the greater force and expansion and will be the more free from every mischievous and perilous connection9  little would be gained here by serious criticism of a view of this kind from a positive point how little the reader will understand from de maistres own explanations of his principles of proof and evidence they have called to witness against moses he says history chronology astronomy geology etc the objections have disappeared before true science but those were profoundly wise who despised them before any inquiry or who only examined them in order to discover a refutation but without ever doubting that there was one even a mathematical objection ought to be despised for though it may be a demonstrated truth still you will never be able to demonstrate that it contradicts a truth that has been demonstrated before his final formula he boldly announced in these words que toutes les fois quune proposition sera prouvée par le genre de preuve qui lui appartient lobjection quelconque mÊme insoluble ne doit plus être écoutée suppose for example that by a consensus of testimony it were perfectly proved that archimedes set fire to the fleet of marcellus by a burningglass then all the objections of geometry disappear prove if you can and if you choose that by certain laws a glass in order to be capable of setting fire to the roman fleet must have been as big as the whole city of syracuse and ask me what answer i have to make to that jai à vous répondre quarchimède brûla la flotte romaine avec un miroir ardent  the interesting thing about such opinions as these is not the exact height and depth of their falseness but the considerations which could recommend them to a man of so much knowledge both of books and of the outer facts of life and of so much natural acuteness as de maistre persons who have accustomed themselves to ascertained methods of proof are apt to look on a man who vows that if a thing has been declared true by some authority whom he respects then that constitutes proof to him as either the victim of a preposterous and barely credible infatuation or else as a flat impostor yet de maistre was no ignorant monk he had no selfish or official interest in taking away the keys of knowledge entering not in himself and them that would enter in hindering the true reasons for his detestation of the eighteenthcentury philosophers science and literature are simple enough like every wise man he felt that the end of all philosophy and science is emphatically social the construction and maintenance and improvement of a fabric under which the communities of men may find shelter and may secure all the conditions for living their lives with dignity and service then he held that no truth can be harmful to society if he found any system of opinions any given attitude of the mind injurious to tranquillity and the public order he instantly concluded that however plausible they might seem when tested by logic and demonstration they were fundamentally untrue and deceptive what is logic compared with eternal salvation in the next world and the practice of virtue in this the recommendation of such a mind as de maistres is the intensity of its appreciation of order and social happiness the obvious weakness of such a mind and the curse inherent in its influence is that it overlooks the prime condition of all that social order can never be established on a durable basis so long as the discoveries of scientific truth in all its departments are suppressed or incorrectly appreciated or socially misapplied de maistre did not perceive that the cause which he supported was no longer the cause of peace and tranquillity and right living but was in a state of absolute and final decomposition and therefore was the cause of disorder and blind wrong living of this we shall now see more  footnotes  3 soirées de saint pétersbourg 8th ed 1862 vol i pp 238243  4 soirées de saint pétersbourg 6ième entretien i 397442  5 ib 8th

be things with which men are beaten and as we should not be beaten if we did not deserve it argal suffering is a merited punishment apart from that common infirmity which leads people after they have discovered an analogy between two things to argue from the properties of the one to those of the other as if instead of being analogous they were identical de maistre was particularly fond of inferring moral truths from etymologies he has an argument for the deterioration of man drawn from the fact that the romans expressed in the same word supplicium the two ideas of prayer and punishment

see the examen de la philosophie de bacon vol ii 58 et seq     iii   when the waters of the deluge of 89 began to assuage the best minds soon satisfied themselves that the event which bonapartes restoration of order enabled them to look back upon with a certain tranquillity and a certain completeness had been neither more nor less than a new irruption of barbarians into the european world the monarchy the nobles and the church with all the ideas that gave each of them life and power had fallen before atheists and jacobins as the ancient empire of rome had fallen before huns and goths vandals and lombards the leaders of the revolution had succeeded one another as attila had come after alaric and as genseric had been followed by odoacer the problem which presented itself was not new in the history of western civilisation the same dissolution of old bonds which perplexed the foremost men at the beginning of the nineteenth century had distracted their predecessors from the fifth to the eighth though their conditions and circumstances were widely different the practical question in both cases was just the samehow to establish a stable social order which resting on principles that should command the assent of all might secure the cooperation of all for its harmonious and efficient maintenance and might offer a firm basis for the highest and best life that the moral and intellectual state of the time allowed there were two courses open or which seemed to be open in this gigantic enterprise of reconstructing a society one of them was to treat the case of the eighteenth century as if it were not merely similar to but exactly identical with the case of the fifth and as if exactly the same forces which had knit western europe together into a compact civilisation a thousand years before would again suffice for a second consolidation christianity rising with the zeal and strength of youth out of the ruins of the empire and feudalism by the need of selfpreservation imposing a form upon the unshapen associations of the barbarians had between them compacted the foundations and reared the fabric of mediæval life why many men asked themselves should not christian and feudal ideas repeat their great achievement and be the means of reorganising the system which a blind rebellion against them had thrown into deplorable and fatal confusion let the century which had come to such an end be regarded as a mysteriously intercalated episode and no more in the long drama of faith and sovereign order let it pass as a sombre and pestilent stream whose fountains no man should discover whose waters had for a season mingled with the mightier current of the divinely allotted destiny of the race and had then gathered themselves apart and flowed off to end as they had begun in the stagnation and barrenness of the desert philosophers and men of letters astronomers and chemists atheists and republicans had shown that they were only powerful to destroy as the goths and the vandals had been they had shown that they were impotent as the goths and the vandals had been in building up again let men turn their faces then once more to that system by which in the ancient times europe had been delivered from a relapse into eternal night  the second course was very different from this the minds to whom it commended itself were cast in a different mould and drew their inspiration from other traditions in their view the system which the church had been the main agency in organising had fallen quite as much from its own irremediable weakness as from the direct onslaughts of assailants within and without the barbarians had rushed in it was true in 1793 but this time it was the church and feudalism which were in the position of the old empire on whose ruins they had built what had once restored order and belief to the west was now in its own turn overtaken by decay and dissolution to look to them to unite these new barbarians in a stable and vigorous civilisation because they had organised europe of old was as infatuated as it would have been to expect the later emperors to equal the exploits of the republic and their greatest predecessors in the purple to despise philosophers and men of science was only to play over again in a new dress the very part which julian had enacted in the face of nascent christianity the eighteenth century instead of being that home of malaria which the catholic and royalist party represented was in truth the seedground of a new and better future its ideas were to furnish the material and the implements by which should be repaired the terrible breaches and chasms in european order that had been made alike by despots and jacobins by priests and atheists by aristocrats and sansculottes amidst all the demolition upon which its leading minds had been so zealously bent they had been animated by the warmest love of social justice of human freedom of equal rights and by the most fervent and sincere longing to make a nobler happiness more universally attainable by all the children of men it was to these great principles that we ought eagerly to turn to liberty to equality to brotherhood if we wished to achieve before the new invaders a work of civilisation and social reconstruction such as catholicism and feudalism had achieved for the multitudinous invaders of old  such was the difference which divided opinion when men took heart to survey the appalling scene of moral desolation that the cataclysm of 93 had left behind we may admire the courage of either school for if the conscience of the liberals was oppressed by the sanguinary tragedy in which freedom and brotherhood and justice had been consummated the catholic and the royalist were just as sorely burdened with the weight of kingly basenesses and priestly hypocrisies if the one had some difficulty in interpreting jacobinism and the terror the other was still more severely pressed to interpret the fact and origin and meaning of the revolution if the liberal had marat and hébert the royalist had lewis xv and the catholic had dubois and de rohan each school could intrepidly hurl back the taunts of its enemy and neither of them did full justice to the strong side of the other yet we who are in england at all events removed a little aside from the centre of this great battle may perceive that at that time both of the contending hosts fought under honourable banners and could inscribe upon their shields a rational and intelligible device indeed unless the modern liberal admits the strength inherent in the cause of his enemies it is impossible for him to explain to himself the duration and obstinacy of the conflict the slow advance and occasional repulse of the host in which he has enlisted and the tardy progress that liberalism has made in that stupendous reconstruction which the revolution has forced the modern political thinker to meditate upon and the modern statesman to further and control  de maistre from those general ideas as to the method of the government of the world of which we have already seen something had formed what he conceived to be a perfectly satisfactory way of accounting for the eighteenth century and its terrific climax the will of man is left free he acts contrary to the will of god and then god exacts the shedding of blood as the penalty so much for the past the only hope of the future lay in an immediate return to the system which god himself had established and in the restoration of that spiritual power which had presided over the reconstruction of europe in darker and more chaotic times than even these though perhaps he nowhere expresses himself on this point in a distinct formula de maistre was firmly impressed with the idea of historic unity and continuity he looked upon the history of the west in its integrity and was entirely free from anything like that disastrous kind of misconception which makes the english protestant treat the long period between st paul and martin luther as a howling waste or which makes some americans omit from all account the still longer period of human effort from the crucifixion of christ to the declaration of independence the rise of the vast structure of western civilisation during and after the dissolution of the empire presented itself to his mind as a single and uniform process though marked in portions by temporary casual parenthetical interruptions due to depraved will and disordered pride all the dangers to which this civilisation had been exposed in its infancy and growth were before his eyes first there were the heresies with which the subtle and debased ingenuity of the greeks had stained and distorted the great but simple mysteries of the faith then came the hordes of invaders from the north sweeping with irresistible force over regions that the weakness or cowardice of the wearers of the purple left defenceless before them before the northern tribes had settled in their possessions and had full time to assimilate the faith and the institutions which they had found there the growing organisation was menaced by a more deadly peril in the incessant and steady advance of the bloody and fanatical tribes from the east and in this way de maistres mind continued the picture down to the latest days of all when there had arisen men who denying god and mocking at christ were bent on the destruction of the very foundations of society and had nothing better to offer the human race than a miserable return to a state of nature  as he thus reproduced this long drama one benign and central figure was ever present changeless in the midst of ceaseless change laboriously building up with preterhuman patience and preterhuman sagacity when other powers one after another in evil succession were madly raging to destroy and to pull down thinking only of the great interests of order and civilisation of which it had been constituted the eternal protector and showing its divine origin and inspiration alike by its unfailing wisdom and its unfailing benevolence it is the sovereign pontiff who thus stands forth throughout the history of europe as the great demiurgus of universal civilisation if the pope had filled only such a position as the patriarch held at constantinople or if there had been no pope and christianity had depended exclusively on the east for its propagation with no great spiritual organ in the west what would have become of western development it was the energy and resolution of the pontiffs which resisted the heresies of the east and preserved to the christian religion that plainness and intelligibility without which it would never have made a way to the rude understanding and simple hearts of the barbarians from the north it was their wise patriotism which protected italy against greek oppression and by acting the part of mayors of the palace to the decrepit eastern emperors it was they who contrived to preserve the independence and maintain the fabric of society until the appearance of the carlovingians in whom with the rapid instinct of true statesmen they at once recognised the founders of a new empire of the west if the popes again had possessed over the eastern empire the same authority that they had over the western they would have repulsed not only the saracens but the turks too and none of the evils which these nations have inflicted on us would ever have taken place10 even as it was when the saracens threatened the west the popes were the chief agents in organising resistance and giving spirit and animation to the defenders of europe their alert vision saw that to crush for ever that formidable enemy it was not enough to defend ourselves against his assaults we must attack him at home the crusades vulgarly treated as the wars of a blind and superstitious piety were in truth wars of high policy from the council of clermont down to the famous day of lepanto the hand and spirit of the pontiff were to be traced in every part of that tremendous struggle which prevented europe from being handed over to the tyranny ignorance and barbarism that have always been the inevitable fruits of mahometan conquest and had already stamped out civilisation in asia minor and palestine and greece once the very garden of the universe  this admirable and politic heroism of the popes in the face of foes pressing from without de maistre found more than equalled by their wisdom courage and activity in organising and developing the elements of a civilised system within the maxim of old societies had been that which lucan puts into the mouth of cæsarhumanum paucis vivit genus a vast population of slaves had been one of the inevitable social conditions of the period the popes never rested from their endeavours to banish servitude from among christian nations women in old societies had filled a mean and degraded place it was reserved for the new spiritual power to rescue the race from that vicious circle in which men had debased the nature of women and women had given back all the weakness and perversity they had received from men and to perceive that the most effectual way of perfecting the man is to ennoble and exalt the woman the organisation of the priesthood again was a masterpiece of practical wisdom such an order removed from the fierce or selfish interests of ordinary life by the holy regulation of celibacy and by the austere discipline of the church was indispensable in the midst of such a society as that which it was the function of the church to guide who but the members of an order thus set apart acting in strict subordination to the central power and so presenting a front of unbroken spiritual unity could have held their way among tumultuous tribes halfbarbarous nobles and proud and unruly kings protesting against wrong passionately inculcating new and higher ideas of right denouncing the darkness of the false gods calling on all men to worship the cross and adore the mysteries of the true god compare now the impotency of the protestant missionary squatting in gross comfort with wife and babes among the savages he has come to convert preaching a disputatious doctrine wrangling openly with the rival sent by some other sectcompare this impotency with the success that follows the devoted sons of the church impressing their proselytes with the mysterious virtue of their continence the selfdenial of their lives the unity of their dogma and their rites and then recognise the wisdom of these great churchmen who created a priesthood after this manner in the days when every priest was as the missionary is now finally it was the occupants of the holy chair who prepared softened one might almost say sweetened the occupants of thrones it was to them that providence had confided the education of the sovereigns of europe the popes brought up the youth of the european monarchy they made it precisely in the same way in which fénelon made the duke of burgundy in each case the task consisted in eradicating from a fine character an element of ferocity that would have ruined all everything that constrains a man strengthens him he cannot obey without perfecting himself and by the mere fact of overcoming himself he is better any man will vanquish the most violent passion at thirty because at five or six you have taught him of his own will to give up a plaything or a sweetmeat that came to pass to the monarchy which happens to an individual who has been well brought up the continued efforts of the church directed by the sovereign pontiff did what had never been seen before and what will never be seen again where that authority is not recognised insensibly without threats or laws or battles without violence and without resistance the great european charter was proclaimed not on paper nor by the voice of public criers but in all european hearts then all catholic kings surrender the power of judging by themselves and nations in return declare kings infallible and inviolable such is the fundamental law of the european monarchy and it is the work of the popes11  all this however is only the external development of de maistres central idea the historical corroboration of a truth to which he conducts us in the first instance by general considerations assuming what it is less and less characteristic of the present century at any rate to deny that christianity was the only actual force by which the regeneration of europe could be effected after the decline of the roman civilisation he insists that as he again and again expresses it without the pope there is no veritable christianity what he meant by this condensed form needs a little explanation as is always the case with such simple statements of the products of long and complex reasoning in saying that without the pope there is no true christianity what he considered himself as having established was that unless there be some supreme and independent possessor of authority to settle doctrine to regulate discipline to give authentic counsel to apply accepted principles to disputed cases then there can be no such thing as a religious system which shall have power to bind the members of a vast and not homogeneous body in the salutary bonds of a common civilisation nor to guide and inform an universal conscience in each individual state everybody admits the absolute necessity of having some sovereign power which shall make declare and administer the laws and from whose action in any one of these aspects there shall be no appeal a power that shall be strong enough to protect the rights and enforce the duties which it has authoritatively proclaimed and enjoined in free england as in despotic turkey the privileges and obligations which the law tolerates or imposes and all the benefits which their existence confers on the community are the creatures and conditions of a supreme authority from which there is no appeal whether the instrument by which this authority makes its will known be an act of parliament or a ukase this conception of temporal sovereignty especially familiarised to our generation by the teaching of austin was carried by de maistre into discussions upon the limits of the papal power with great ingenuity and force and if we accept the premisses with great success  it should be said here that throughout his book on the pope de maistre talks of christianity exclusively as a statesman or a publicist would talk about it not theologically nor spiritually but politically and socially the question with which he concerns himself is the utilisation of christianity as a force to shape and organise a system of civilised societies a study of the conditions under which this utilisation had taken place in the earlier centuries of the era and a deduction from them of the conditions under which we might ensure a repetition of the process in changed modern circumstance in the eighteenth century men were accustomed to ask of christianity as protestants always ask of so much of catholicism as they have dropped whether or no it is true but after the revolution the question changed and became an inquiry whether and how christianity could contribute to the reconstruction of society people asked less how true it was than how strong it was less how many unquestioned dogmas than how much social weight it had or could develop less as to the precise amount and form of belief that would save a soul than as to the way in which it might be expected to assist the european community  it was the strength of this temper in him which led to his extraordinary detestation and contempt for the greeks their turn for pure speculation excited all his anger in a curious chapter he exhausts invective in denouncing them12 the sarcasm of sallust delights him that the actions of greece were very fine verum aliquanto minores quam fama feruntur their military glory was only a flash of about a hundred and fourteen years from marathon compare this with the prolonged splendour of rome france and england in philosophy they displayed decent talent but even here their true merit is to have brought the wisdom of asia into europe for they invented nothing greece was the home of syllogism and of unreason read plato at every page you will draw a striking distinction as often as he is greek he wearies you he is only great sublime penetrating when he is a theologian in other words when he is announcing positive and everlasting dogmas free from all quibble and which are so clearly marked with the eastern cast that not to perceive it one must never have had a glimpse of asia there was in him a sophist and a theologian or if you choose a greek and a chaldean the athenians could never pardon one of their great leaders all of whom fell victims in one shape or another to a temper frivolous as that of a child ferocious as that of menespèce de moutons enragés toujours menés par la nature et toujours par nature dévorant leurs bergers as for their oratory the tribune of athens would have been the disgrace of mankind if phocion and men like him by occasionally ascending it before drinking the hemlock or setting out for their place of exile had not in some sort balanced such a mass of loquacity extravagance and cruelty13  it is very important to remember this constant solicitude for ideas that should work well in connection with that book of de maistres which has had most influence in europe by supplying a base for the theories of ultramontanism unless we perceive very clearly that throughout his ardent speculations on the papal power his mind was bent upon enforcing the practical solution of a pressing social problem we easily misunderstand him and underrate what he had to say a charge has been forcibly urged against him by an eminent english critic for example that he has confounded supremacy with infallibility than which as the writer truly says no two ideas can be more perfectly distinct one being superiority of force and the other incapacity of error14 de maistre made logical blunders in abundance quite as bad as this but he was too acute i think deliberately to erect so elaborate a structure upon a confusion so very obvious and that must have stared him in the face from the first page of his work to the last if we look upon his book as a mere general defence of the papacy designed to investigate and fortify all its pretensions one by one we should have great right to complain against having two claims so essentially divergent treated as though they were the same thing or could be held in their places by the same supports but let us regard the treatise on the pope not as meant to convince freethinkers or protestants that divine grace inspires every decree of the holy father though that would have been the right view of it if it had been written fifty years earlier it was composed within the first twenty years of the present century when the universe to men of de maistres stamp seemed once more without form and void his object as he tells us more than once was to find a way of restoring a religion and a morality in europe of giving to truth the forces demanded for the conquests that she was meditating of strengthening the thrones of sovereigns and of gently calming that general fermentation of spirit which threatened mightier evils than any that had yet overwhelmed society from this point of view we shall see that the distinction between supremacy and infallibility was not worth recognising  practically he says infallibility is only a consequence of supremacy or rather it is absolutely the same thing under two different names in effect it is the same thing in practice not to be subject to error and not to be liable to be accused of it thus even if we should agree that no divine promise was made to the pope he would not be less infallible or deemed so as the final tribunal for every judgment from which you cannot appeal is and must be est et doit être held for just in every human association under any imaginable form of government and every true statesman will understand me perfectly when i say that the point is to ascertain not only if the sovereign pontiff is but if he must be infallible15 in another place he says distinctly enough that the infallibility of the church has two aspects in one of them it is the object of divine promise in the other it is a human implication and that in the latter aspect infallibility is supposed in the church just as we are absolutely bound to suppose it even in temporal sovereignties where it does not really exist under pain of seeing society dissolved the church only demands what other sovereignties demand though she has the immense superiority over them of having her claim backed by direct promise from heaven16 take away the dogma if you will he says and only consider the thing politically which is exactly what he really does all through the book the pope from this point of view asks for no other infallibility than that which is attributed to all sovereigns17 without either vindicating or surrendering the supernatural side of the papal claims he only insists upon the political social or human side of it as an inseparable quality of an admitted supremacy18 in short from beginning to end of this speculation from which the best kind of ultramontanism has drawn its defence he evinces a deprecatory anxietya very rare temper with de maistrenot to fight on the issue of the dogma of infallibility over which protestants and unbelievers have won an infinite number of cheap victories that he leaves as a theme more fitted for the disputations of theologians my position he seems to keep saying is that if the pope is spiritually supreme then he is virtually and practically as if he were infallible just in the same sense in which the english parliament and monarch and the russian czar are as if they were infallible but let us not argue so much about this which is only secondary the main question is whether without the pope there can be a true christianity that is to say a christianity active powerful converting regenerating conquering perfecting  de maistre was probably conducted to his theory by an analogy which he tacitly leaned upon more strongly than it could well bear between temporal organisation and spiritual organisation in inchoate communities the momentary selfinterest and the promptly stirred passions of men would rend the growing society in pieces unless they were restrained by the strong hand of law in some shape or other written or unwritten and administered by an authority either physically too strong to be resisted or else set up by the common consent seeking to further the general convenience to divide this authority so that none should know where to look for a sovereign decree nor be able to ascertain the commands of sovereign law to embody it in the persons of many discordant expounders each assuming oracular weight and equal sanction to leave individuals to administer and interpret it for themselves and to decide among themselves its application to their own cases what would this be but a deliberate preparation for anarchy and dissolution for it is one of the clear conditions of the efficacy of the social union that every member of it should be able to know for certain the terms on which he belongs to it the compliances which it will insist upon in him and the compliances which it will in turn permit him to insist upon in others and therefore it is indispensable that there should be some definite and admitted centre where this very essential knowledge should be accessible  some such reflections as these must have been at the bottom of de maistres great apology for the papal supremacy or at any rate they may serve to bring before our minds with greater clearness the kind of foundations on which his scheme rested for law substitute christianity for social union spiritual union for legal obligations the obligations of the faith instead of individuals bound together by allegiance to common political institutions conceive communities united in the bonds of religious brotherhood into a sort of universal republic under the moderate supremacy of a supreme spiritual power as a matter of fact it was the intervention of this spiritual power which restrained the anarchy internal and external of the ferocious and imperfectly organised sovereignties that figure in the early history of modern europe and as a matter of theory what could be more rational and defensible than such an intervention made systematic with its rightfulness and disinterestedness universally recognised grant christianity as the spiritual basis of the life and action of modern communities supporting both the organised structure of each of them and the interdependent system composed of them all accepted by the individual members of each and by the integral bodies forming the whole but who shall declare what the christian doctrine is and how its maxims bear upon special cases and what oracles they announce in particular sets of circumstances amid the turbulence of popular passion in face of the crushing despotism of an insensate tyrant between the furious hatred of jealous nations or the violent ambition of rival sovereigns what likelihood would there be of either party to the contention yielding tranquilly and promptly to any presentation of christian teaching made by the other or by some suspected neutral as a decisive authority between them obviously there must be some supreme and indisputable interpreter before whose final decree the tyrant should quail the flood of popular lawlessness flow back within its accustomed banks and contending sovereigns or jealous nations fraternally embrace again in those questions of faith and discipline which the illexercised ingenuity of men is for ever raising and pressing upon the attention of christendom it is just as obvious that there must be some tribunal to pronounce an authoritative judgment otherwise each nation is torn into sects and amid the throng of sects where is unity to maintain that a crowd of independent churches form a church one and universal is to maintain in other terms that all the political governments of europe only form a single government one and universal there could no more be a kingdom of france without a king nor an empire of russia without an emperor than there could be one universal church without an acknowledged head that this head must be the successor of st peter is declared alike by the voice of tradition the explicit testimony of the early writers the repeated utterances of later theologians of all schools and that general sentiment which presses itself upon every conscientious reader of religious history  the argument that the voice of the church is to be sought in general councils is absurd to maintain that a council has any other function than to assure and certify the pope when he chooses to strengthen his judgment or to satisfy his doubts is to destroy visible unity suppose there to be an equal division of votes as happened in the famous case of fénelon and might as well happen in a general council the doubt would after all be solved by the final vote of the pope and what is doubtful for twenty selected men is doubtful for the whole human race those who suppose that by multiplying the deliberating voices doubt is lessened must have very little knowledge of men and can never have sat in a deliberative body again supposing there to present itself one of those questions of divine metaphysics that it is absolutely necessary to refer to the decision of the supreme tribunal then our interest is not that it should be decided in such or such a manner but that it should be decided without delay and without appeal besides the world is now grown too vast for general councils which seem to be made only for the youth of christianity in fine why pursue futile or mischievous discussions as to whether the pope is above the council or the council above the pope in ordinary questions in which a king is conscious of sufficient light he decides them himself while the others in which he is not conscious of this light he transfers to the statesgeneral presided over by himself but he is equally sovereign in either case so with the pope and the council let us be content to know in the words of thomassin19 that the pope in the midst of his council is above himself and that the council decapitated of its chief is below him  the point so constantly dwelt upon by bossuet the obligation of the canons upon the pope was of very little worth in de maistres judgment and he almost speaks with disrespect of the great catholic defender for being so prolix and pertinacious in elaborating it here again he finds in thomassin the most concise statement of what he held to be the true view just as he does in the controversy as to the relative superiority of the pope or the council there is only an apparent contradiction says thomassin between saying that the pope is above the canons and that he is bound by them that he is master of the canons or that he is not those who place him above the canons or make him their master only pretend that he has a dispensing power over them while those who deny that he is above the canons or is their master mean no more than that he can only exercise a dispensing power for the convenience and in the necessities of the church this is an excellent illustration of the thoroughly political temper in which de maistre treats the whole subject he looks at the power of the pope over the canons much as a modern english statesman looks at the question of the coronation oath and the extent to which it binds the monarch to the maintenance of the laws existing at the time of its imposition in the same spirit he banishes from all account the crowd of nonsensical objections to papal supremacy drawn from imaginary possibilities suppose a pope for example were to abolish all the canons at a single stroke suppose him to become an unbeliever suppose him to go mad and so forth why de maistre says there is not in the whole world a single power in a condition to bear all possible and arbitrary hypotheses of this sort and if you judge them by what they can do without speaking of what they have done they will have to be abolished every one20 this it may be worth noticing is one of the many passages in de maistres writings which both in the solidity of their argument and the direct force of their expression recall his great predecessor in the antirevolutionary cause the everillustrious burke  the vigour with which de maistre sums up all these pleas for supremacy is very remarkable and to the crowd of enemies and indifferents and especially to the statesmen who are among them he appeals with admirable energy what do you want then do you mean that the nations should live without any religion and do you not begin to perceive that a religion there must be and does not christianity not only by its intrinsic worth but because it is in possession strike you as preferable to every other have you been better contented with other attempts in this way peradventure the twelve apostles might please you better than the theophilanthropists and martinists does the sermon on the mount seem to you a passable code of morals and if the entire people were to regulate their conduct on this model should you be content i fancy that i hear you reply affirmatively well since the only object now is to maintain this religion for which you thus declare your preference how could you have i do not say the stupidity but the cruelty to turn it into a democracy and to place this precious deposit in the hands of the rabble  you attach too much importance to the dogmatic part of this religion by what strange contradiction would you desire to agitate the universe for some academic quibble for miserable wranglings about mere words these are your own terms is it so then that men are led will you call the bishop of quebec and the bishop of luçon to interpret a line of the catechism that believers should quarrel about infallibility is what i know for i see it but that statesmen should quarrel in the same way about this great privilege is what i shall never be able to conceive that all the bishops in the world should be convoked to determine a divine truth necessary to salvationnothing more natural if such a method is indispensable for no effort no trouble ought to be spared for so exalted an aim but if the only point is the establishment of one opinion in the place of another then the travelling expenses of even one single infallible are sheer waste if you want to spare the two most valuable things on earth time and money make all haste to write to rome in order to procure thence a lawful decision which shall declare the unlawful doubt nothing more is needed policy asks no more21  definitely then the influence of the popes restored to their ancient supremacy would be exercised in the renewal and consolidation of social order resting on the christian faith somewhat after this manner the anarchic dogma of the sovereignty of peoples having failed to do anything beyond showing that the greatest evils resulting from obedience do not equal the thousandth part of those which result from rebellion would be superseded by the practice of appeals to the authority of the holy see do not suppose that the revolution is at an end or that the column is replaced because it is raised up from the ground a man must be blind not to see that all the sovereignties in europe are growing weak on all sides confidence and affection are deserting them sects and the spirit of individualism are multiplying themselves in an appalling manner there are only two alternatives you must either purify the will of men or else you must enchain it the monarch who will not do the first must enslave his subjects or perish servitude or spiritual unity is the only choice open to nations on the one hand is the gross and unrestrained tyranny of what in modern phrase is styled imperialism and on the other a wise and benevolent modification of temporal sovereignty in the interests of all by an established and accepted spiritual power no middle path lies before the people of europe temporal absolutism we must have the only question is whether or no it shall be modified by the wise disinterested and moderating counsels of the church as given by her consecrated chief                                       there can be very little doubt that the effective way in which de maistre propounded and vindicated this theory made a deep impression on the mind of comte very early in his career this eminent man had declared de maistre has for me the peculiar property of helping me to estimate the philosophic capacity of people by the repute in which they hold him among his other reasons at that time for thinking well of m guizot was that notwithstanding his transcendent protestantism he complied with the test of appreciating de maistre22 comtes rapidly assimilative intelligence perceived that here at last there was a definite consistent and intelligible scheme for the reorganisation of european society with him the great end of philosophic endeavour its principle of the division of the spiritual and temporal powers and of the relation that ought to subsist between the two was the base of comtes own scheme  in general form the plans of social reconstruction are identical in substance it need scarcely be said the differences are fundamental the temporal power according to comtes design is to reside with industrial chiefs and the spiritual power to rest upon a doctrine scientifically established de maistre on the other hand believed that the old authority of kings and christian pontiffs was divine and any attempt to supersede it in either case would have seemed to him as desperate as it seemed impious in his strange speculation on le principe générateur des constitutions politiques he contends that all laws in the true sense of the word which by the way happens to be decidedly an arbitrary and exclusive sense are of supernatural origin and that the only persons whom we have any right to call legislators are those halfdivine men who appear mysteriously in the early history of nations and counterparts to whom we never meet in later days elsewhere he maintains to the same effect that royal families in the true sense of the word are growths of nature and differ from others as a tree differs from a shrub  people suppose a family to be royal because it reigns on the contrary it reigns because it is royal because it has more life plus desprit royalsurely as mysterious and occult a force as the virtus dormitiva of opium the common life of man is about thirty years the average duration of the reigns of european sovereigns being christian is at the very lowest calculation twenty how is it possible that lives should be only thirty years and reigns from twentytwo to twentyfive if princes had not more common life than other men mark again the influence of religion in the duration of sovereignties all the christian reigns are longer than all the nonchristian reigns ancient and modern and catholic reigns have been longer than protestant reigns the reigns in england which averaged more than twentythree years before the reformation have only been seventeen years since that and those of sweden which were twentytwo have fallen to the same figure of seventeen denmark however for some unknown cause does not appear to have undergone this law of abbreviation so says de maistre with rather unwonted restraint let us abstain from generalising as a matter of fact however the generalisation was complete in his own mind and there was nothing inconsistent with his view of the government of the universe in the fact that a catholic prince should live longer than a protestant indeed such a fact was the natural condition of his view being true many differences among the people who hold to the theological interpretation of the circumstances of life arise from the different degrees of activity which they variously attribute to the intervention of god from those who explain the fall of a sparrow to the ground by a special and direct energy of the divine will up to those at the opposite end of the scale who think that direct participation ended when the universe was once fairly launched de maistre was of those who see the divine hand on every side and at all times if then protestantism was a pernicious rebellion against the faith which god had provided for the comfort and salvation of men why should not god be likely to visit princes as offenders with the least excuse for their backslidings with the curse of shortness of days  in a trenchant passage de maistre has expounded the protestant confession of faith and shown what astounding gaps it leaves as an interpretation of the dealings of god with man by virtue of a terrible anathema he supposes the protestant to say inexplicable no doubt but much less inexplicable than incontestable the human race lost all its rights plunged in mortal darkness it was ignorant of all since it was ignorant of god and being ignorant of him it could not pray to him so that it was spiritually dead without being able to ask for life arrived by rapid degradation at the last stage of debasement it outraged nature by its manners its laws even by its religions it consecrated all vices it wallowed in filth and its depravation was such that the history of those times forms a dangerous picture which it is not good for all men so much as to look upon god however having dissembled for forty centuries bethought him of his creation at the appointed moment announced from all time he did not despise a virgins womb he clothed himself in our unhappy nature and appeared on the earth we saw him we touched him he spoke to us he lived he taught he suffered he died for us he arose from his tomb according to his promise he appeared again among us solemnly to assure to his church a succour that would last as long as the world  but alas this effort of almighty benevolence was a long way from securing all the success that had been foretold for lack of knowledge or of strength or by distraction maybe god missed his aim and could not keep his word less sage than a chemist who should undertake to shut up ether in canvas or paper he only confided to men the truth that he had brought upon the earth it escaped then as one might have foreseen by all human pores soon this holy religion revealed to man by the mangod became no more than an infamous idolatry which would remain to this very moment if christianity after sixteen centuries had not been suddenly brought back to its original purity by a couple of sorry creatures23  perhaps it would be easier than he supposed to present his own system in an equally irrational aspect if you measure the proceedings of omnipotence by the uses to which a wise and benevolent man would put such superhuman power if we can imagine a man of this kind endowed with it de maistres theory of the extent to which a supreme being interferes in human things is after all only a degree less ridiculous and illogical less inadequate and abundantly assailable than that protestantism which he so heartily despised would it be difficult after borrowing the account which we have just read of the tremendous efforts made by a benign creator to shed moral and spiritual light upon the world to perplex the catholic as bitterly as the protestant by confronting him both with the comparatively scanty results of those efforts and with the too visible tendencies of all the foremost agencies in modern civilisation to leave them out of account as forces practically spent                                       de maistre has been surpassed by no thinker that we know of as a defender of the old order if anybody could rationalise the idea of supernatural intervention in human affairs the idea of a papal supremacy the idea of a spiritual unity de maistres acuteness and intellectual vigour and above all his keen sense of the urgent social need of such a thing being done would assuredly have enabled him to do it in 1817 when he wrote the work in which this task is attempted the hopelessness of such an achievement was less obvious than it is now the bourbons had been restored the revolution lay in a deep slumber that many persons excusably took for the quiescence of extinction legitimacy and the spiritual system that was its ally in the face of the revolution though mostly its rival or foe when they were left alone together seemed to be restored to the fulness of their power fifty years have elapsed since then and each year has seen a progressive decay in the principles which then were triumphant it was not therefore without reason that de maistre warned people against believing que la colonne est replacée parcequelle est relevée the solution which he so elaborately recommended to europe has shown itself desperate and impossible catholicism may long remain a vital creed to millions of men a deep source of spiritual consolation and refreshment and a bright lamp in perplexities of conduct and morals but resting on dogmas which cannot by any amount of compromise be incorporated with the daily increasing mass of knowledge assuming as the condition of its existence forms of the theological hypothesis which all the preponderating influences of contemporary thought concur directly or indirectly in discrediting upheld by an organisation which its history for the last five centuries has exposed to the distrust and hatred of men as the sworn enemy of mental freedom and growth the pretensions of catholicism to renovate society are among the most pitiable and impotent that ever devout highminded and benevolent persons deluded themselves into maintaining or accepting over the modern invader it is as powerless as paganism was over the invaders of old the barbarians of industrialism grasping chiefs and mutinous men give no ear to priest or pontiff who speak only dead words who confront modern issues with blind eyes and who stretch out a palsied hand to help christianity according to a wellknown saying has been tried and failed the religion of christ remains to be tried one would prefer to qualify the first clause by admitting how much christianity has done for europe even with its old organisation and to restrict the charge of failure within the limits of the modern time today its failure is too patent whether in changed forms and with new supplements the teaching of its founder is destined to be the chief inspirer of that social and human sentiment which seems to be the only spiritual bond capable of uniting men together again in a common and effective faith is a question which it is unnecessary to discuss here they talk about the first centuries of christianity said de maistre i would not be sure that they are over yet perhaps not only if the first centuries are not yet over it is certain that the christianity of the future will have to be so different from the christianity of the past as to demand or deserve another name  even if christianity itself renewed could successfully encounter the achievement of renewing society de maistres ideal of a spiritual power controlling the temporal power and conciliating peoples with their rulers by persuasion and a coercion only moral appears to have little chance of being realised the separation of the two powers is sealed with a completeness that is increasingly visible the principles on which the process of the emancipation of politics is being so rapidly carried on demonstrate that the most marked tendencies of modern civilisation are strongly hostile to a renewal in any imaginable shape or at any future time of a connection whether of virtual subordination or nominal equality which has laid such enormous burdens on the consciences and understandings of men if the church has the uppermost hand except in primitive times it destroys freedom if the state is supreme it destroys spirituality the free church in the free state is an idea that every day more fully recommends itself to the public opinion of europe and the sovereignty of the pope like that of all other spiritual potentates can only be exercised over those who choose of their own accord to submit to it a sovereignty of a kind which de maistre thought not much above anarchy  to conclude de maistres mind was of the highest type of those who fill the air with the arbitrary assumptions of theology and the abstractions of the metaphysical stage of thought at every point you meet the peremptorily declared volition of a divine being or the ontological property of a natural object the french revolution is explained by the will of god and the kings reign because they have the esprit royal every truth is absolute not relative every explanation is universal not historic these differences in method and point of view amply explain his arrival at conclusions that seem so monstrous to men who look upon all knowledge as relative and insist that the only possible road to true opinion lies away from volitions and abstractions in the positive generalisations of experience there can be no more satisfactory proof of the rapidity with which we are leaving these ancient methods and the social results which they produced than the willingness with which every rightly instructed mind now admits how indispensable were the first and how beneficial the second those can best appreciate de maistre and his school what excellence lay in their aspirations what wisdom in their system who know most clearly why their aspirations were hopeless and what makes their system an anachronism  footnotes  10 de maistre forgot or underestimated the services of leo the isaurian whose repulse of the caliphs forces at constantinople ad 717 was perhaps as important for europe as the more renowned victory of charles martel but then leo was an iconoclast and heretic cf finlays byzantine empire pp 22 23  11 du pape bk iii c iv p 298 ed 1866  12 du pape bk iv c vii  13 a remark of mr finlays is worth quoting here the greeks he says had at times only a secondary share in the ecclesiastical controversies in the eastern church though the circumstance of these controversies having been carried on in the greek language has made the natives of western europe attribute them to a philosophic speculative and polemic spirit inherent in the hellenic mind a very slight examination of history is sufficient to prove that several of the heresies which disturbed the eastern church had their origin in the more profound religious ideas of the oriental nations and that many of the opinions called heretical were in a great measure expressions of the mental nationality of the syrians armenians egyptians and persians and had no conception whatever with the greek mindbyzantine empire from 716 to 1057 p 262  the same writer p 263 remarks very truly that the religious or theological portion of popery as a section of the christian church is really greek and it is only the ecclesiastical political and theoretic peculiarities of the fabric which can be considered as the work of the latin church  14 sir j fitzjames stephen in the saturday review sept 9 1865 p 334

reconcile conflicting opinions on discipline or doctrine by exhibiting a true sense in all in this spirit he wrote on the pope and the councils and on the neverending question of grace among other things he insisted that all languages could be traced to the hebrew he wrote a defence of the edict in which lewis xiv revoked the edict of nantes contending that it was less harsh than some of the decrees of theodosius and justinian which the holiest fathers of the church had not scrupled to approvean argument which would now be thought somewhat too dangerous for common use as cutting both ways
