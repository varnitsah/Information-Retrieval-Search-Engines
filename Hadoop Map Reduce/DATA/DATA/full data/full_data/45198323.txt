45198323	the red mans revenge by rm ballantyne    robert michael ballantyne was born in 1825 and died in 1894  he was educated at the edinburgh academy and in 1841 he became a clerk with the hudson bay company working at the red river settlement in northen canada until 1847 arriving back in edinburgh in 1848  the letters he had written home were very amusing in their description of backwoods life and his family publishing connections suggested that he should construct a book based on these letters  three of his most enduring books were written over the next decade the young fur traders ungava the hudson bay company and were based on his experiences with the hbc  in this period he also wrote the coral island and martin rattler both of these taking place in places never visited by ballantyne  having been chided for small mistakes he made in these books he resolved always to visit the places he wrote about  with these books he became known as a great master of literature intended for teenagers  he researched the cornish mines the london fire brigade the postal service the railways the laying down of submarine telegraph cables the construction of lighthouses the lightship service the life boat service south africa norway the north sea fishing fleet ballooning deepsea diving algiers and many more experiencing the lives of the men and women in these settings by living with them for weeks and months at a time and he lived as they lived  he was a very truetolife author depicting the often squalid scenes he encountered with great care and attention to detail  his young readers looked forward eagerly to his next books and through the 1860s and 1870s there was a flow of books from his pen sometimes four in a year all very good reading  the rate of production diminished in the last ten or fifteen years of his life but the quality never failed  he published over ninety books under his own name and a few books for very young children under the pseudonym comus  for todays taste his books are perhaps a little too religious and what we would nowadays call pi  in part that was the way people wrote in those days but more important was the fact that in his days at the red river settlement in the wilds of canada he had been a little dissolute and he did not want his young readers to be unmindful of how they ought to behave as he felt he had been  some of his books were quite short little over 100 pages  these books formed a series intended for the children of poorer parents having less pocketmoney  these books are particularly wellwritten and researched because he wanted that readership to get the very best possible for their money  they were published as six series three books in each series  for instance one of these series is on the coast which includes saved by the lifeboat  the red mans revenge is very authoritatively written because its setting is the red river where ballantyne had spent all those years in his youth  as so often with ballantynes books there are the threads of two stories running throughout  one of these occupying the last twothirds of the book concerns the red river flood of may 1826 when the river rose fourteen feet over a largely level plain causing much loss and annoyance to the settlers in that region though the loss of only one life  the other thread concerns the kidnapping of a young white child in revenge for a fancied insult offered to a red indian petanawaquat they are pursued by the boys older brother and some other settlers but not found  they return only when petanawaquat has a change of heart after meditating some time on the fact that jesus christ gave up his life to save the souls of those who considered themselves his enemies  there are various acutely observed actions such as a buffalo hunt various fights with bears the tracking methods used by the pursuers foiled only eventually when there is a prairie fire  we learn at this point what to do when a prairie fire is coming straight at you and there appears to be no escape  there are various canoeing incidents and indeed much of the action could not occur without the canoe  recreated as an etext by nick hodson august 2003    the red mans revenge by rm ballantyne    chapter one  a tale of the red river flood  opens the ball  if ever there was a man who possessed a gem in the form of a daughter of nineteen that man was samuel ravenshaw and if ever there was a girl who owned a bluff jovial fiery hottempered irascible old father that girl was elsie ravenshaw  although a gem elsie was exceedingly imperfect  had she been the reverse she would not have been worth writing about  old ravenshaw as his familiars styled him was a settler if we may use such a term in reference to one who was perhaps among the most unsettled of men  he had settled with his family on the banks of the red river  the colony on that river is now one of the frontier towns of canada  at the time we write of it was a mere oasis in the desert not even an offshoot of civilisation for it owed its existence chiefly to the fact that retiring servants of the hudsons bay fur company congregated there to spend the evening of life far beyond the canadian boundary in the heart of that great wilderness where they had spent their working days and on the borders of that grand prairie where the red man and the buffalo roamed at will and the conventionalities of civilised life troubled them not  to this haven of rest samuel ravenshaw had retired after spending an active life in the service of the furtraders somewhat stiffened in the joints by age and a rough career and a good deal soured in disposition because of promotion having as he thought been too long deferred  besides elsie old ravenshaw possessed some other gems of inferior lustre  his wife maggie a stout wellfavoured lady with an insufficient intellect and unbounded good humour was of considerable intrinsic value but highly unpolished  his second daughter cora was a thin slip of sixteen years like her mother in some respectspretty attractive and disposed to take life easily  his eldest son victor a wellgrown lad of fourteen was a rough diamond if a diamond at all with a soul centred on sport  his second son anthony between five and six was large and robust like his father  not having been polished at that time it is hard to say what sort of gem tony was  when engaged in mischiefhis besetting foiblehis eyes shone like carbuncles with unholy light  he was the plague of the family  of course therefore he was the beloved of his parents  such were the chief inmates of willow creek as old ravenshaw styled his house and property  it was midwinter  the owner of willow creek stood at his parlour window smoking and gazing  there was not much to look at for snow had overwhelmed and buried the landscape fringed every twig of the willows and obliterated the frozen river  elsie was seated by the stove embroidering a pair of moccasins  victor is bringing down some of the lads to shoot today father she said casting a furtive glance at her sire  humph that boy does nothing but shoot growled the old man who was a giant in body if not in spirit  who all is he bringing  theres john flett and david mowat and sam hayes and herr winklemann and ian macdonald and louis lambertall the best shots i suppose said elsie bending over her work  the best shots cried mr ravenshaw turning from the window with a sarcastic laugh  louis lambert indeed and winklemann are crack shots and john flett is not bad but the others are poor hands  mowat can only shoot straight with a crooked gun and as for that halfcracked schoolmaster jan macdonald he would miss a barn door at fifty paces unless he were to shut his eyes and fire at random in which case hed have some chance  here they is the shooters is comin  hooray shouted master anthony ravenshaw as he burst into the room with a scalpingknife in one hand and a wooden gun in the other  an is goin to shoot too daddy  so you are tony my boy cried the old trader catching up the pride of his heart in his strong arms and tossing him towards the ceiling you shall shoot before long with a real gun  tony knocked the pipe out of his fathers mouth and was proceeding to operate on his halfbald head with the scalpingknife when cora who entered the room at the moment sprang forward and wrenched the weapon from his grasp  well give them dinner after the shooting is over shant we father asked cora  of course my dear of course replied the hospitable old gentleman giving the pride of his heart a sounding kiss as he put him down  set your mother to work on a pie and get miss trim to help you with a lot of those cakes you make so famously  as he spoke there was a sudden clattering in the porch  the young men were taking off their snowshoes and stamping the snow from off their leggings and moccasined feet  here we are father cried a bright sturdy youth as he ushered in his followers  of course elsie has prepared you for our sudden invasion  the fact is that we got up the match on the spur of the moment because i found that ian had a holiday  no explanation required victor  glad to see you all boys  sit down said mr ravenshaw shaking hands all round  the youths who were thus heartily welcomed presented a fine manly appearance  they were clad in the capotes leggings fur caps moccasins and fingerless mittens usually worn by the men of the settlement in winter  that tall handsome fellow with the curly black hair and flashing eyes who bears himself so confidently as he greets the sisters is louis lambert  the thickset youth behind him with the shock of flaxen hair and imperceptible moustache is herr winklemann a german farmers son and a famed buffalohunter  the ungainly man of twentyfour apparentlyor thereaboutswith the plain but kindly face and the frame nearly as strong as that of the host himself is ian macdonald in appearance he is a rugged backwoodsman  in reality he is the schoolmaster of that part of the widelyscattered colony  the invitation to sit down was not accepted  daylight was shortlived in those regions at that season of the year  they sallied forth to the work in hand  youve had the target put up cora asked victor as he went out  yes in the old place  where is tony  i dont know said cora looking round  he was here just now trying to scalp father  youll find him at the target before you no doubt said elsie putting away her moccasins as she rose to aid in the household preparations  the target was placed against the bank of the river so that the bullets might find a safe retreat  the competitors stood at about a hundred yards distance in front of it  the weapons used were singlebarrelled smoothbores with flint locks  percussion locks had not at that time come into fashion and long ranges had not yet been dreamed of  come open the ball lambert said victor  the handsome youth at once stepped forward and old mr ravenshaw watched him with an approving smile as he took aim  puff went the powder in the pan but no sound followed save the peal of laughter with which the missfire was greeted  the touchhole was pricked and next time the ball sped to its mark  it hit the target two inches above the bullseye  the well done with which the shot was hailed was cut short by an appalling yell and little tony was seen to tumble from behind the target  rolling head over heels he curled himself round in agony sprang up with a spasmodic bound dropped upon his haunches turned over a complete somersault fell on his back with a fearful shriek and lay dead upon the snow  the whole party rushed in consternation towards the boy but before they had reached him he leaped up and burst into a fit of gleeful laughter which ended in a cheer and a savage warwhoop as he scampered up the track which led to the house and disappeared over the brow of the rivers bank  the imp was joking exclaimed mr ravenshaw as he stopped and wiped the cold perspiration from his brow  at that moment a red indian appeared on the scene in his blanket robe paint and feathers  attracted by the shot he had come to look on now the old furtraders nerves had received a tremendous shock and the practical jest which the pride of his heart had perpetrated had roused the irascibility of his nature so that an explosion became unavoidable  in these circumstances the arrival of the indian seemed opportune for the old gentleman knew that this particular savage was a chief and had visited the colony for the purpose of making inquiries into the new religion reported to be taught by certain white men in black garments and mr ravenshaw besides having very little regard for missionaries had a very strong contempt for those indians who became their disciples  he therefore relieved himself on the red man  what do you want here petawanaquat he demanded sternly in the language of the indian  the little wolf replied the indian referring to himself for such was the interpretation of his name wishes to see how his white brothers shoot  let the little wolf put his tail between his legs and be gone cried the angry old man  he is not wanted here  come be off  the chief looked straight in the eyes of the trader with a dark scowl then turning slowly on his heel stalked solemnly away  there was an irrepressible laugh at this episode as the group of marksmen returned to their former position  mr ravenshaw however soon left them and returned home  here he found miss trim in a state of considerable agitation she had just encountered the redskin  miss trim was a poor relation of mrs ravenshaw  she had been invited by her brotherinlaw to leave england and come to red river to act as governess to tony and assistantcompanion in the family  she had arrived that autumn in company with a piano on which she was expected to exercise elsie and cora  petawanaquat being the first really wild and painted savage she had seen made a deep impression on her  oh mr ravenshaw i have seen such an object in the garden she exclaimed in a gushing torrentshe always spoke in a torrentand it was all i could do to stagger into the house without fainting  such eyes with black cheeks and a red noseat least it looked red but i was in such a state that i couldnt make sure whether it was the nose or the chin and my shoe came off as i ran away having broken the tie in the morning  and such a yell as it gavethe creature not the shoetiebut i escaped and peeped out of the upper windowthe one in the gable you know with the green blind where you can see the garden from end to end and i found it had disappeared though i cant understand  tut tut miss trim how you do gallop  was it a beast asked the old trader  a beast  no a mana savage  oh  i understand it was that scoundrel petawanaquat said sam ravenshaw with a laugh hes little wolf by name and a big thief by practice no doubt  you neednt fear him however hes not so dangerous as he looks and i gave him a rebuff just now that will make him shy of willow creekha tony you rascal  come here sir  tony came at once with such a gleeful visage that his fathers intended chastisement for the recent practical joke ended in a parental caress  bitterly did ian macdonald repent of his agreeing to join the shooting party that day  owing to some defect in his vision or nervous system he was a remarkably bad shot though in everything else he was an expert and stalwart backwoodsman as well as a good scholar  but when his friend victor invited him he could not refuse because it offered him an opportunity of spending some time in the society of elsie ravenshaw and that to him was heaven upon earth  little of her society however did the unfortunate teacher enjoy that day for handsome louis lambert engrossed not only elsie but the mother and father as well  he had beaten all his competitors at the target but to do him justice did not boast of that neither did he make any reference to the fact that ian had twice missed the target though he did not spare the bad shooting of some of the other youths this no doubt because he and ian had been fast friends for many years  jealousyat least on the part of iannow seemed about to interfere with the old friendship  moreover lambert had brought to mrs ravenshaw a gift of a collar made of the claws of a grizzly bear shot by himself in the rocky mountains  elsie admired the collar with genuine interest and said she would give anything to possess one like it  cora with the coquettishness of sixteen said with a laugh and a blush that she would not accept such a ridiculous thing if it were offered to her  ian macdonald groaned in spirit for with his incapacity to shoot he knew that elsies wish could never be gratified by him  seeing that lambert was bent on keeping elsie as much as possible to himself ian devoted himself to cora but cora was cross  feeling it uphill work he soon rose to say goodbye and left willow creek before the others  dont look so crestfallen man said old mr ravenshaw heartily as he shook hands its nobler work to teach the young idea how to shoot than to be able to hit a bullseye  true but he who cannot hit a bullseye returned ian with a smile can scarcely be expected to touch a maidensi mean a grizzlys heart  a shout of laughter from lambert greeted him as he left the house  his way home lay over the frozen bed of the river  victor accompanied him part of the way  that was a strange slip for an unromantic fellow like you to make about a maidens heart ian said victor looking up at the rugged countenance of his friend  unromantic eh  well i suppose i am  of course you are said victor with the overweening assurance of youth  come lets sit down here for a few minutes and discuss the point  he sat down on a snowdrift ian kicked off his snowshoes and leaned against the bank  youre the most grave sensible goodnatured matteroffact unsentimental unselfish fellow i ever met with resumed victor  if you were a romantic goose i wouldnt like you half as much as i do  men are sometimes romantic without being geese returned ian but i have not time to discuss that point just now  tell me for i am anxious about it have you spoken to your father about selling the field with the knoll to my father  yes and he flatly refused to sell it  im really sorry ian but you know how determined my father is  once he says a thing he sticks to it even though it should be to his own disadvantage  thats bad victor very bad  it will raise illblood between them and estrange our families  you think theres no chance  none whatever  one more word before we part  do you know much about that redskin whom your father called petawanaquat  not much except that he has come from a considerable distance to make inquiries he says about the christian religion  he has been prowling about our place for a few days and father who has no great love to missionaries and has strong suspicions of converted indians has twice treated him rather roughly  im sorry to hear that victor  these fellows are sometimes very revengeful  if youll be advised by me youll keep a sharp eye upon petawanaquat  there ill say no more  you know im not an alarmist goodbye  goodbye old boy  i say  well  it was an awfully bad shot that last of mine  it was admitted victor with a laugh to miss a thing as big as a door at a hundred yards is only soso  no chance of improvement i fear said ian with a sigh  oh dont say that replied victor  practice perseverance and patience you know overcome every  yes yes  i know that well  goodbye  they shook hands again and were soon striding over the snow to their respective homes    chapter two  conflicting elements and a catastrophe  hoary winter passed away and genial spring returned to rejoice the land  in a particularly amiable frame of mind old ravenshaw went out one morning to smoke  everything had gone well that morning  breakfast had been punctual appetite good rheumatics in abeyance the girls lively and miss trim less of a torrent than was her wont  mrs ravenshaws intellect had more than once almost risen to the ordinary human average and master tony had been betterperhaps it were more correct to say less wicked than usual  old ravenshaw was what his friends styled a heavy smoker so was his kitchen chimney but then the chimney had the excuse of being compelled to smoke whereas its owners insane act was voluntary  be not afraid reader  we have no intention of entering into an argument with smokers  they are a pigheaded generation  we address those who have not yet become monomaniacs as regards tobacco  in order to the full enjoyment of his pipe the old gentleman had built on a knoll what elsie styled a summerhouse  regardless of seasons howeveras he was of most thingsher father used this temple at all seasons of the year and preferred to call it a smoking box  now as this smokingbox with its surroundings had much to do with the issues of our story we bring it under particular notice  it resembled a large sentrybox and the willowclad knoll on which it stood was close to the river  being elevated slightly above the rest of the country a somewhat extended view of river and plain was obtainable therefrom samuel ravenshaw loved to contemplate this view through the medium of smoke  thus seen it was hazy and in accord with his own idea of most things  the sun shone warmly into the smokingbox  it sparkled on the myriad dewdrops that hung on the willows and swept in golden glory over the rolling plains  the old gentleman sat down puffed and was happy  the narcotic influence operated and the irascible demon in his breast fell sound asleep  how often do bright sunshine and profound calm precede a storm  is not that a truismif not a newism  the old gentleman had barely reduced himself to quiescence and the demon had only just begun to snore when a cloud no bigger than a mans body arose on the horizon  gradually it drew near partially obscured the sky and overshadowed the smokingbox in the form of angus macdonald the father of ian  the demon ceased snoring  coot tay to you sir said angus  you will pe enchoyin your pipe this fine mornin  yes angus i am replied ravenshaw with as much urbanity as he could assumeand it wasnt much for he suspected the cause of his neighbours visityoud better sit down and light your own  angus accepted the invitation and proceeded to load with much deliberation  now it must be known that the highlander loved the view from that knoll as much as did his neighbour  it reminded him of the old country where he had been born and bred on a hilltop  he coveted that willow knoll intensely desiring to build a house on it and being prosperous was willing to give for it more than its value for his present dwelling lay somewhat awkwardly in the creek a little higher up the river so that the willows on the knoll interfered vexatiously with his view  its a peautiful spote this observed angus after a few preliminary puffs  it is answered the old trader curtly and the demon awoke  angus made no rejoinder for a few minutes but continued to puff great clouds with considerable emphasis from his compressed lips  mr ravenshaw returned the fire with interest  itll no pe for sellin the knowl ye are said angus  the demon was fairly roused now  no angus macdonald said the trader sternly ill not sell it ive told you already more than once and it is worse than illjudged it is impertinent of you to come bothering me to part with my land  ho inteed exclaimed angus rising in wrath and cramming his pipe into his vest pocket it is herself that will pe pothering you no more spout your dirty land samyool ruvnshaw  he strode from the spot with a look of ineffable scorn and the air of an offended chieftain  old ravenshaw tried to resume his tranquillity but the demon was selfwilled and tobacco had lost its power  there were more clouds however in store for him that morning  it so fell out that ian macdonald unable to bear the suspense of uncertainty any longer and all ignorant of his fathers visit to the old trader had made up his mind to bring things to a point that very morning by formally asking permission to pay his addresses to elsie ravenshaw  knowing the old mans habits he went straight to the smokingbox  if he had set out half an hour sooner he would have met his own father and saved himself trouble  as it was they missed each other  mr ravenshaw had only begun to feel slightly calmed when ian presented himself with a humble propitiatory air  the old man hated humility in every form even its name  he regarded it as a synonym for hypocrisy the demon actually leaped within him but the old man had a powerful will  he seized his spiritual enemy throttled and held him down  goodmorning mr ravenshaw  goodmorning  nothing more was said by either for a few minutes  ian was embarrassed he had got up a set speech and forgotten it  he was shy but he was also resolute  drawing himself up suddenly he said with an earnest honest look mr ravenshaw i love your daughter there was only one daughter in ians estimation and i come to ask leave to woo her  if by earnest devotion and  ian macdonald interrupted the old gentleman in a voice of suppressed anger you may save yourself and me the trouble of more talk on this subject  your father has just been here wanting me to sell him this knoll  now look here he rose and stepping out of the smokingbox pointed to angus macdonalds house which was full in view you see that house young man  mark what i say  i will sell this knoll to your father and give my daughter to you when you take that house and with your own unaided hands place it on the top of this knoll  this was meant by the old trader as a bitterly facetious way of indicating the absolute hopelessness of the case  ian accepted it in that light for he was well aware that samuel ravenshaws firmnessor obstinacywas insurmountable  he did not despair however true love never does that but he felt tremendously cast down  without a word or look of reproach he turned and walked slowly away  once again the old trader sought comfort in his pipe but found none besides feeling extremely indignant with the macdonalds father and son for what he styled their presumption he was now conscious of having treated both with undue severity  dashing his pipe on the ground he thrust both hands into his coat pockets and returned towards his dwelling  on the way he unfortunately met petawanaquat in one of his fields leaning composedly over a gate  that intelligent redskin had not yet finished his inquiries at the missionary village  he had appeared more than once at willow creek and seemed to hover round the old trader like a moth round a candle  the man was innocent of any evil intent on this occasion but ravenshaw would have quarrelled with an angel just then  what are you doing here  be off he said sternly  the indian either did not or would not understand and the old man seizing him by the arm thrust him violently through the gateway  all the hot blood of the petawanaquats from adam downwards seemed to leap through the red mans veins and concentrate in his right hand as he turned fiercely on the trader and drew his scalpingknife  quick as lightning ravenshaw hit out with his fist and knocked the indian down then turning on his heel walked away  for a moment petawanaquat lay stunned  recovering he arose and his dark glittering eyes told of a purpose of deadly revenge  the trader was still in sight  the indian picked up his gun glided swiftly behind a tree and took a long steady aim  just then little tony rushed from the house and leaped into his fathers arms where he received an unusually warm embrace for the trader wanted some sort of relief for his feelings  the indians finger was pressing the trigger at the moment  death was very near samuel ravenshaw just then but the finger relaxed and the gun was lowered  a more terrible form of revenge had flashed into the mind of the savage  gliding quietly from his position he entered the willows and disappeared  meanwhile angus macdonald returned in no very amiable mood to his own house  it was a small house had been built by its owner and was like most of the other houses of the colony at that time a good solid log structurea sort of noahs ark on a small scale  it stood on a flat piece of mother earth without any special foundation except a massive oblong wooden frame to which all the superstructure was attached  you might if strong enough have grasped it by the ridgepole and carried it bodily away without tearing up any foundation or deranging the fabric  it was kept in order and managed by an elderly sister of angus named martha for angus was a widower  his only son ian dwelt in the schoolhouse a mile farther up the river  marthas strong point was fowls  we are too ignorant of that subject to go into particulars  we can only say that she was an adept at fowls marthas chickens were always tender and fat and their eggs were the largest and freshest in red river  we introduce these fowls solely because one of them acted a very important part on a very critical occasion  as well might the geese who saved rome be omitted from history as martha macdonalds cochinchina hen whichwell we wont say what just yet  that hen was frightfully plain  why cochinchina hens should have such long legs and wear feather trousers are questions which naturalists must settle among themselves  being a humorous man angus had named her beauty  she was a very cross hen and her feather unmentionables fitted badly  moreover she was utterly useless and never laid an egg which was fortunate for if she had laid one it would have been an egregious monstrosity  she was obviously tough  if they had slain her for the table they would have had to cut her up with a handsaw or grind her into meal to fit her for use  besides all this beauty was a widow  when her husband diedprobably of disgustshe took to crowing on her own account  she received angus with a crow when he entered the house after his interview with ravenshaw and appeared to listen intently as he poured his sorrows into his sisters ear  its up at the knowl ive peen martha an i left samyool ruvnshaw there in a fery pad temperfery pad inteed  hell come oot of it whatever  an hell not be for sellin you the knowl asked martha  no he wont replied angus  from this point they went off into a very longwinded discussion of the pros and cons of the case which however we will spare the reader and return to willow creek  the bed of the creek near to the point where it joined the red river was a favourite resort of master tony  thither he went that same afternoon to play  having observed the childs habits petawanaquat paddled his canoe to the same point and hid it and himself among the overhanging bushes of the creek  in the course of his gambols tony approached the place  one stroke of the paddle sent the light birchbark canoe like an arrow across the stream  the indian sprang on shore  tony gave him one scared look and was about to utter an appalling yell when a red hand covered his mouth and another red hand half throttled him  petawanaquat bundled the poor child into the bottom of his canoe wrapped a leather coat round his head spread a buffalo robe over him gave him a smart rap on the head to keep him quiet and paddled easily out into the stream  steadily but not too swiftly he went down the river down the rapids and past the indian settlement without attracting particular notice  once the buffalo robe moved the paddle descended on it with a sounding whack and it did not move again before night closed the indian was paddling over the broad bosom of lake winnipeg  of course tony was soon missed his haunts were well known miss trim traced his footprints to the place where he had been seized saw evidences of the struggle the nature of which she correctly guessed and came shrieking back to the house where she went off into hysterics and was unable to tell anything about the matter  fortunately victor was there he also traced the footsteps  instead of returning home he ran straight to the schoolhouse which he reached out of breath  come ian come he gasped  tonys been carried offpetawanaquat bring your canoe and gun all the ammunition you can lay hands on  ian asked for no explanations he ran into the house shouldered a small bag of pemmican gave his gun and ammunition to victor told his assistant to keep the school going till his return and ran with his friend down to the river where his own birch canoe lay on the bank  a few minutes sufficed to launch it  both ian and victor were expert canoemen  straining their powers to the utmost they were soon far down the red river in hot pursuit of the fugitive    chapter three  the pursuit begins  there is something delightfully exhilarating in a chase whether it be after man or beast  how the blood careers  how the nerves tingle  but you know all about it reader  we have said sufficient  there was enough of righteous indignation in victors bosom to have consumed petawanaquat and ground enough to justify the fiercest resolves  was not the kidnapper a redskina low mean contemptible savage  was not the kidnapped one his brotherhis own brother  and such a brother  one of a thousand with mischief enough in him if rightly directed to make half a dozen ordinary men  the nature of the spirit which animated victor was obvious on his compressed lips his frowning brows his gleaming eyes  the strength of his muscles was indicated by the foam that fled from his paddle  ian macdonald was not less excited but more under selfcontrol than his friend  there was a fixed look in his plain but pleasant face and a tremendous sweep in his long arms as he plied the paddle that told of unfathomed energy  the canoe being a mere eggshell leaped forward at each quick stroke like a thing of life  there was no time to lose  they knew that for the indian had probably got a good start of them and being a powerful man animated by the certainty of pursuit sooner or later would not only put his strength but his endurance to the test  if they were to overtake him it must be by superhuman exertion  lake winnipeg was twenty miles off  they must catch up the indian before he reached it as otherwise it would be impossible to tell in which direction he had gone  they did not pause to make inquiries of the settlers on the banks by the way but they hailed several canoes whose occupants said they had seen the indian going quietly down stream some hours beforealone in his canoe  never mind vic push on said ian of course he would make tony lie flat down  the end of the settlement was passed and they swept on into the wilderness beyond  warming to their work they continued to paddle hour after hoursteadily persistently with clockwork regularity of stroke but never decreasing force  to save time they as it were cut off corners at the riverbends and just shaved the points as they went by  have a care ian exclaimed victor at one of these places as his paddle touched the bottom  we dont draw much water to be sure but a big stone mighthah  a roar of dismay burst from the youth and his companion as the canoe rasped over a stone  we have said that the birch canoe was an eggshell  the word is scarcely figurative  the slightest touch over a stone has a tendency to rip the bark of such a slender craft or break off the resinous gum with which the seams are pitched  water began to pour in  too bad exclaimed victor flinging his paddle ashore as he stepped over the side into water not much above his ankles and pulled the canoe slowly to land  an illustration of the proverb the more haste the less speed sighed ian as he stepped into the water and assisted in lifting the canoe tenderly to dry ground  oh its all very well for you to take it philosophically but you know our chance is gone  if it was your brother we were after you wouldnt be so cool  he is elsies brother replied ian and that makes me quite as keen as if he were my own besides keeping me cool  come vic dont be cross but light the fire and get out the gum  while he spoke ian was actively untying a bundle which contained awls and wattape a small pliable root with which to repair the injury  the gum had to be melted so that victor found some relief to his feelings in kindling a fire  the break was not a bad one  with nimble fingers ian sewed a patch of bark over it  while that was being done victor struck a light with flint and steel and soon had a blazing firebrand ready  hand it here vic said ian  he covered the stitches with melted gum blew the charcoal redhot passed it here and there over the old seams where they exhibited signs of leakage and in little more than half an hour had the canoe as tight as a bottle  once more they embarked and drove her like an arrow down stream  but precious time had been lost and it was dark when they passed from the river and rested on the bosom of the mighty freshwater sea  its of no use going on without knowing which shore the redskin has followed said ian as he suddenly ceased work and rested his paddle on the gunwale  its of no use to remain where we are replied the impatient victor looking back at his comrade  yes it is returned ian the moon will rise in an hour or so and enable us to make observations meanwhile we can rest  sooner or later we shall be compelled to rest  it will be a wise economy of time to do so now when nothing else can be done  victor was so tired and sleepy by that time that he could scarcely reply  ian laughed quietly and shoved the canoe among some reeds where it lay on a soft bed  at the same time he advised his companion to go to sleep without delay  more than half asleep already he obeyed in silence waded to the shore and sat down on a bank to take off his moccasins  in this position and act he fell asleep  hallo exclaimed ian coming up with the paddles and pemmican bag too soon vic too soon lad he tumbled him over on the bank come one mouthful of grub first then off with the moccasins and down we go  victor picked himself up with a yawn  on ordinary occasions a backwoodsman pays some little attention to the comforts of his encampment but our heroes were in no condition to mind such trifles they pulled off their wet moccasins indeed and put on dry ones but having done that they merely groped in the dark for the flattest piece of ground in the neighbourhood then each rolled himself in his blanket and lay or rather fell down  hah gasped victor  was wrong sighed ian faintly  put m shoulder n a puddle ats all lisped victor  tket out o the purl thenoh groaned ian  was e marrer now eh sighed victor  ony a big stone i m ribs  shovet out o yr ribs en an old yr tongue  profound slumber stopped the conversation at this point and the frogs that croaked and whistled in the swamps had it all to themselves  deep tranquillity reigned on the shores of lake winnipeg during the midnight hours for the voices of the frogs served rather to accent than to disturb the calm  stars twinkled at their reflections in the water which extended like a black mirror to the horizon  they gave out little light however and it was not until the upper edge of the full moon arose that surrounding objects became dimly visible  the pale light edged the canoe silvered the rocks tipped the rushes and at last touching the point of ians upturned nose awoke him  see frontispiece  he leaped up with a start instantly conscious of his situation and afraid lest he had slept too long  hi leve leve awake up he exclaimed in a vigorous undertone  victor growled turned on his other side with a deep sigh wanted to be let alone became suddenly conscious and sprang up in alarm  were too late  no were not vic  the moon is just rising but we must be stirring times precious  victor required no urging  he was fully alive to the situation  a few minutes sufficed to get the canoe ready and roll up their blankets during the performance of which operations they each ate several substantial mouthfuls of pemmican  looking carefully round before pushing off the canoe to see that nothing was forgotten ian observed some chips of wood on the beach close at hand  see vic he said eagerly some one has been hereperhaps the indian  they examined the chips which had been recently cut  its not easy to make out footprints here said ian going down on his knees the better to observe the ground and so many settlers and indians pass from time to time having little boys with them too that  i say look here vic this little footmark might or might not be tonys but moccasins are so much alike that  out o the light man if you were made o glass the moon might get through you  why yes it is tonys moccasin cried victor in eager excitement  i know it by the patch for i saw elsie putting it on this very morning  look speak man dont you see it  a square patch on the ball of the right foot  yes yes i see it said ian going down on his knees in a spirit of semiworship and putting his nose close to the ground  he would fain have kissed the spot that had been pressed by a patch put on by elsie but he was unromantic and refrained  now he said springing up with alacrity that settles the question at least it shows that there is strong probability of their having taken the left shore of the lake  come along then lets after them cried victor impatiently pushing off the canoe  the moment she floatedwhich she did in about four inches of water they stepped swiftly yet gently into her for bark canoes require tender treatment at all times even when urgent speed is needful  gliding into deep water they once more dipped their paddles deep and fast and danced merrily over the moonlit seafor a sea lake winnipeg certainly is being upwards of three hundred miles long and a gathering together of many waters from all parts of the vast wilderness of ruperts land  after two hours of steady work they paused to rest  now ian said victor leaning against the wooden bar at his back and resting his paddle across the canoe venus tells me that the sun is about to bestir himself and something within me tells me that empty space is a bad stomachic so out with the pemmican bag and hand over a junk  ian drew his huntingknife struck it into the mass of meat and chipped off a piece the size of his fist which he handed to his comrade  probably our readers are aware that pemmican is made of dried buffalo meat pounded to shreds and mixed with melted fat  being thus halfcooked in the making it can be used with or without further cookery  sewed up in its bag it will keep good for months or even years and is magnificent eating but requires a strong digestion  ian and victor were gifted with that requisite  they fed luxuriously  a draught from the crystal lake went down their unsophisticated throats like nectar and they resumed their paddles like giants refreshed  venus mounted like a miniature moon into the glorious blue  her perfect image went off in the opposite direction for there was not the ghost of a zephyr to ruffle the deep  presently the sun followed in her wake and scattered the battalions of cloudland with artillery of molten gold little white gulls with red legs and beaks came dipping over the water solemnly wondering at the intruders  the morning mists rolling along before the resistless monarch of day confused the visible world for a time so that between refraction and reflection and buoyant spirits victor ravenshaw felt that at last he had found the realms of fairyland and a feeling of certainty that he should soon rescue his brother filled him with exultation  but the exultation was premature  noon found them toiling on and still no trace of the fugitives was to be seen  what if we have overshot them said victor  impossible answered ian the shore is too open for that and i have been keeping a sharp lookout at every bend and bay  that may be true yet petawanaquat may have kept a sharper lookout and concealed himself when he saw us coming  see here is a creek  he may have gone up that  let us try  why there is a canoe in it hup drive along ian  the canoe seemed to leap out of the water under the double impulse and next moment almost ran down another canoe which was half hidden among the reeds  in it sat an old indian named peegwish and a lively young french halfbreed named michel rollin  they were both well known to our adventurers old peegwishwhose chief characteristic was owlishness being a frequent and welcome visitor at the house of ians father  you pears to be in one grand hurray exclaimed rollin in his broken english  ian at once told the cause of their appearance there and asked if they had seen anything of petawanaquat  yes oui nodat is to say  look ere  rollin pushed the reeds aside with his paddle and pointed to a canoe lying bottom up as if it had been concealed there  ves be come ere after duck an ve find dat said the halfbreed  an immediate investigation showed that petawanaquat had forsaken his canoe and taken to the woods  ian looked troubled  peegwish opened his owlish eyes and looked so solemn that victor could scarce forbear laughing despite the circumstances  it was immediately resolved to give chase  peegwish was left in charge of the canoes  the other three soon found the track of the red man and followed it up like bloodhounds  at first they had no difficulty in following the trail being almost as expert as indians in woodcraft but soon they came to swampy ground and then to stony places in which they utterly lost it again and again did they go back to pick up the lost trail and follow it only to lose it again  thus they spent the remainder of that day until night put a stop to their exertions and crushed their hopes  then dispirited and weary they returned to the canoes and encamped beside them  peegwish was engaged in roasting a duck when they arrived  what a difference between the evening and the morning said victor as he flung himself down beside the fire  dat is troo an vat i has obsarve oftin said rollin looking earnestly into a kettle which rested on the fire  never mind vic said ian heartily well be at it again tomorrow bright and early  were sure to succeed in the longrun  petawanaquat cant travel at night in the woods any more than we can  old peegwish glared at the fire as though he were pondering these sayings deeply  as he understood little or no english however it is more probable that his astute mind was concentrated on the roasting duck    chapter four  a discoverythe chase continued on foot  to bound from the depths of despair to the pinnacles of hope is by no means an uncommon experience to vigorous youth  when victor ravenshaw awoke next morning after a profound and refreshing sleep and looked up through the branches at the bright sky despondency fled and he felt ready for anything  he was early awake but peegwish had evidently been up long before him for that wrinkled old savage had kindled the fire and was seated on the other side of it wrapped in his blanket smoking and watching the preparation of breakfast  when victor contemplated his solemn eyes glaring at a roasting duck which suggested the idea that he had been sitting there and glaring all night he burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter  come i say vic said ian roused by this from a comfortable nap if you were a hyena there might be some excuse for you but being only a manforgive me a boyyou ought to have more sense than to disturb your friends so  oui yes dat is troo  vraiment it is too bad growled rollin sitting up and stretching himself  howsomewhatever it is time to rise  oui  i should think it was retorted victor the sun is already up and you may be sure that petawanaquat has tramped some miles this morning come peegwish close your eyes a bit for fear they jump out  what have you got to give us eh  robbiboo ducks andno is it tea  well we are in luck to have fallen in with you  he rested his head on his hand and lay looking at the savage with a pleased expression while rollin rose and went off to cut more firewood  the robbiboo referred to was a sort of thick soup made of pemmican boiled with flour  without loss of time the party applied themselves to it  when appetite was partially appeased ian propounded the question what was to be done  follow up the trail as fast as we can said victor promptly  dat is bon advise observed rollin  hand over de duck peegvish an do try for shut your eyes  if you vould only vink it vould seem more comfortabler  peegwish did not smile but with deepened gravity passed the duck  im not so sure of the goodness of the advice said ian  to go scampering into the woods on a chase that may lead us we know not where or how long with only a small quantity of provisions and ammunition and but one gun may seem energetic and daring but it may not perhaps be wise  victor admitted that there was truth in that and looked perplexed  nevertheless to give up at this point and return to the settlement for supplies he said would be to lose the advantage of our quick start  how are we to get over the difficulty  moi i can you git out of de difficulty said rollin lighting his pipe with a business air  dis be de vay  peegvish et me is out for long hunt vid much pemmican poodre an shote  you make von greement vid me et peegvish  you vill engage me i vill go vid you  you can take vat you vill of our tings and send peegvish back to de settlement for tell fat ye bees do  this plan after brief but earnest consideration was adopted  the old indian returned to willow creek with pencil notes written on birch bark to old samuel ravenshaw and angus macdonald and the other three of the party set off at once to renew the chase on foot with blankets and food strapped to their backs and guns on their shouldersfor rollin carried his own fowlingpiece and victor had borrowed that of peegwish  as happened the previous day they failed several times to find the trail of the fugitives but at last ian discovered it and they pushed forward with renewed hope  the faint footmarks at first led them deep into the woods where it was difficult to force a passage then the trail disappeared altogether on the banks of a little stream  but the pursuers were too experienced to be thrown off the scent by such a wellknown device as walking up stream in the water  they followed the brook until they came to the place where petawanaquat had once more betaken himself to dry land  it was a wellchosen spot hard and rocky ground on which only slight impressions could be left and the wily savage had taken care to step so as to leave as slight a trail as possible but the pursuers had sharp and trained eyes  ian macdonald in particular having spent much of his time as a hunter before setting up his school had the eyes of a lynx  he could distinguish marks when his companions could see nothing until they were pointed out and although frequently at fault he never failed to recover the trail sooner or later  of course they lost much time and they knew that petawanaquat must be rapidly increasing the distance between them but they trusted to his travelling more leisurely when he felt secure from pursuit and to his being delayed somewhat by tony whom it was obvious he had carried for long distances at a stretch  for several days the pursuers went on with unflagging perseverance and everincreasing hope until they at last emerged from the woods and began to traverse the great prairie  here the trail diverged for a considerable distance southward and then turned sharply to the west in which direction it went in a straight line for many miles as if petawanaquat had made up his mind to cross the rocky mountains and throw poor tony into the pacific  the travellers saw plenty of gameducks geese plover prairiehens antelopes etceteraon the march but they were too eager in the pursuit of the savage to be turned aside by smaller game  they merely shot a few ducks to save their pemmican  at last they came to a point in the prairie which occasioned them great perplexity of mind and depression of spirit  it was on the evening of a bright and beautiful dayone of those days in which the air seems fresher and the sky bluer and the sun more brilliant than usual  they had found that evening that the trail led them away to the right towards one of the numerous clumps of woodland which rendered that part of the prairie more like a noblemans park than a wild wilderness  on entering the bushes they perceived that there was a lakelet embosomed like a gem in the surrounding trees  passing through the belt of woodland they stood on the margin of the little lake  how beautiful exclaimed ian with a flush of pleasure on his sunburnt face  just like a bit of paradise  did you ever see paradise that you know so well what it is like asked victor of his unromantic friend  yes vic ive seen it many a timein imagination  indeed and what like was it and what sort of people were there  it was likelet me seethe most glorious scene ever beheld on earth but more exquisite and the sun that lighted it was more brilliant by far than ours  not bad for an unromantic imagination said victor with much gravity  were there any ducks and geese there  yes ducks plenty of them but no geese and nobler gameeven lions were there so tame that little children could lead them  better and better said victor and what of the people  ian was on the point of saying that they were allmen women and childrenthe exact counterparts of elsie ravenshaw but he checked himself and said that they were all honest sincere kind gentle upright and that there was not a single cynical person there nor a  hush what sort of a bird is that interrupted victor laying his hand on ians arm and pointing to a small patch of reeds in the lake  there were so many birds of various kinds gambolling on the surface that ian had difficulty in distinguishing the creature referred to  at last he perceived it a curious fatbodied little bird with a pair of preposterously long legs which stood eyeing its companions as if in contemplative pity  i know it not said ian never saw it before  well bag it now  stand back said victor raising his gun  the above conversation had been carried on in a low tone for the friends were still concealed by a bush from the various and numerous birds which disported themselves on the lake in fancied security and real felicity  the crash of victors gun sent them screaming over the treetopsall save the fat creature with the long legs which now lay dead on the water  go in for it rollin its not deep i think said victor  troo but it may be dangeroose for all dat replied the halfbreed leaning his gun against a tree  howsomewhatever i vill try  the place turned out as he had suspected to be somewhat treacherous with a floating bottom  before he had waded half way to the dead bird the ground began to sink under him  presently he threw up his arms went right down and disappeared  both ian and victor started forward with the intention of plunging into the water but they had not reached the edge when rollin reappeared blowing like a grampus  they soon saw that he could swim and allowed him to scramble ashore  this misadventure did not prevent them from making further attempts to secure the bird which victor having some sort of naturalistic propensities was eager to possess  it was on going round the margin of the lake for this purpose that they came upon the cause of the perplexities before mentioned  on the other side of a point covered with thick bush they came upon the remains of a large indian camp which had evidently been occupied very recently  indeed the ashes of some of the fires rollin declared were still warm but it was probably rollins imagination which warmed them  it was found too that the trail of petawanaquat entered this camp and was there utterly lost in the confusion of tracks made everywhere by many feet both large and small  here then was sufficient ground for anxiety  if the savage had joined this band and gone away with it the pursuers could of course follow him up but in the event of their finding him among friends there seemed little or no probability of their being able to rescue the stolen child on the other hand if petawanaquat had left the indians and continued his journey alone the great difficulty that lay before them was to find his point of departure from a band which would naturally send out hunters right and left as they marched along  its a blue lookout any way you take it remarked poor victor with an expression worthy of peegwish on his countenance  i vish it vas blue  it is black said rollin  ian replied to both remarks by saying that whether black or blue they must make the best of it and set about doing that at once  to do his desponding comrades justice they were quite ready for vigorous action in any form notwithstanding their despair  accordingly they followed the broad trail of the indians into the prairie a short way and separating in different directions round its margins carefully examined and followed up the tracks that diverged from it for considerable distances but without discovering the print of the little moccasin with elsies patch or the larger footprint of tonys captor  you see there are so many footprints some like and some unlike and they cross and recross each other to such an extent that it seems to me a hopeless case altogether said victor  you dont propose to give it up do you asked ian  give it up repeated victor almost fiercely  give up tony  no not as long as i can walk or even crawl  ve vill crawl before long perhaps said rollin ve may even stop crawling an die at last but ve must not yet give in  in the strength of this resolve they returned to the lakelet when the sun went down and encamped there  it is needless to say that they supped and slept well notwithstandingor notwithforstanding as rollin put it  rollin was fond of long words and possessed a few that were his own private property  victor had a dream that night  he dreamt that he caught sight of an indian on the plains with tony on his shoulder that he gave chase and almost overtook them when to save himself the indian dropped his burden that he victor seized his rescued brother in a tight embrace and burst into tears of joy that tony suddenly turned into petawanaquat and that in the sharp revulsion of feeling he victor seized the nose of the savage and pulled it out to a length of three yards twisted it round his neck and choked him thrust his head down into his chest and tied his arms in a knot over it and finally stuffing him into a mudpuddle jumped upon him and stamped him down  it was an absurd dream no doubt but are not dreams generally absurd  while engaged in the last mentioned humane operation victor was awakened by ian  its time to be moving said his comrade with a laugh  i would have roused you before but you seemed to be so busily engaged with some friend that i hadnt the heart to part you sooner  the whole of that day they spent in a fruitless effort to detect the footprints of petawanaquat either among the tracks made by the band of indians or among those diverging from the main line of march  in so doing they wandered far from the camp at the lakelet and even lost sight of each other  the only result was that ian and rollin returned in the evening dispirited and weary and victor lost himself  the ease with which this is done is scarcely comprehensible by those who have not wandered over an unfamiliar and boundless plain on which the clumps of trees and shrubs have no very distinctive features  victors comrades however were alive to the danger  not finding him in camp they at once went out in different directions fired shots until they heard his answering reply and at last brought him safely in  that night again they spent on the margin of the little lake and over the campfire discussed their future plans  it was finally assumed that petawanaquat had joined the indians and resolved that they should follow up the trail as fast as they could travel  this they did during many days without however overtaking the indians then the pemmican began to wax low for in their anxiety to push on they neglected to hunt  at last one evening just as it was growing dark and while they were looking out for a convenient restingplace they came on the spot where the indians had encamped evidently the night before for the embers of their fires were still smoking  here then they lay down with the pleasing hope not unmingled with anxiety that they should overtake the band on the following day    chapter five  tony becomes a redskin and the pursuers change their game  when petawanaquat joined the band of indians of whom we left victor ravenshaw and his comrades in eager pursuit he deemed it advisable for various reasons to alter the costume and general appearance of his captive and for that purpose took him to a sequestered spot in the bushes outside the camp  poor tony had at first shrunk from his captor with inexpressible horror but when he found that the indian did not eat him his mind was calmed as time advanced and he perceived that petawanaquat although stern and very silent took much pains to assist him on his long marches and above all fed him with a liberal hand his feelings changed considerably and at last he began to regard the taciturn red man with something like fondness  petawanaquat made no positive effort to gain the childs affections he never fondled him and seldom spoke save for the purpose of giving a brief command which tony always obeyed with miraculous promptitude  the utmost that can be said is that the savage was gentle and supplied his wants  could a civilised man have done much more  it may be well to remark in passing that tony having associated a good deal with indian boys in red river could speak their language pretty well  the indian of course spoke his own tongue correctly while tony spoke it much as he spoke his ownchildishly  as the reader probably does not understand the indian language we will give its equivalent as spoken by both in english  on reaching the sequestered spot above referred to petawanaquat sat down on a fallen tree and made the wondering child stand up before him  the white mans boy must become an indian he said solemnly  how zat possble demanded the child with equal solemnity  by wearing the red mans clothes and painting his face returned his captor  zatll be jolly said tony with a smile of hearty approval  how he expressed the word jolly in the indian tongue we cannot tell but he conveyed it somehow for the indians lips expanded in a grim smile the first he had indulged in since the day of the abduction  the process by which tony was transformed was peculiar  opening a little bundle the indian took therefrom a small coat or capote of deerskin soft and of a beautiful yellow like the skin of the chamois  it was richly ornamented with porcupinequillwork done in various colours and had fringes of leather and little locks of hair hanging from it in various places  causing tony to strip he put this coat on him and fastened it round his waist with a worsted belt of bright scarlet  next he drew on his little legs a pair of blue cloth leggings which were ornamented with beads and clothed his feet in new moccasins embroidered like the coat with quillwork  tony regarded all this with unconcealed pleasure but it did not seem to please him so much when the indian combed his rich curly hair straight down all round so that his face was quite concealed by it  taking a pair of large scissors from his bundle the indian passed one blade under the hair across the forehead gave a sharp snip and the whole mass fell like a curtain to the ground  it was a sublimely simple mode of clearing the way for the countenancemuch in vogue among north american savages from whom it has recently been introduced among civilised nations  the indian then lifted the clustering curls at the back and again opened the scissors  for a few moments his fingers played with the locks as he gazed thoughtfully at them then apparently changing his mind he let them drop and put the scissors away  but the toilet was not yet complete  the versatile operator drew from his bundle some brightred yellow ochre and blue paint with a piece of charcoal and set to work on tonys countenance with all the force of a van dyck and the rich colouring of a rubens  he began with a streak of scarlet from the eyebrows to the end of the nose  skipping the mouth he continued the streak from the lower lip down the chin under which it melted into a tender halftint made by a smudge of yellow ochre and charcoal  this vigorous touch seemed to rouse the painters spirit in petawanaquat for he pushed the boy out at arms length drew himself back frowned glared and breathed hard  three bars of blue from the bridge of the nose over each cheek with two red circles below and a black triangle on the forehead were touched in with consummate skill and breadth  one of the touches was so broad that it covered the whole jaw and had to be modified  on each closed upper eyelid an intensely black spot was painted by which simple device tony with his azure orbs was made as it were to wink black and gaze blue  the general effect having thus been blocked in the artist devoted himself to the finishing touches and at last turned out a piece of work which old samuel ravenshaw himself would have failed to recognise as his son  it should have been remarked that previous to this petawanaquat had modified his own costume  his leggings were fringed with scalplocks he had painted his face and stuck a bunch of feathers in his hair and a gay firebag and a tomahawk were thrust under his belt behind  ho he exclaimed with a look of satisfaction now tony is tonyquat and petawanaquat is his father  when will zoo take me back to my own fadder asked tony emboldened by the indians growing familiarity  no reply was given to this but the question seemed to throw the red man into a savage reverie and a dark frown settled on his painted face as he muttered the little wolf meant to take the white mans life but he was wise he spared his life and took his heart  his revenge is sweeter  wah  tony failed to catch the meaning of this but fearing to rouse the anger of his new father he held his tongue  meanwhile the indian put the child on a stump a few yards off in front of him filled his pipe lighted it placed an elbow on each knee rested his chin on his doubled fists and glared at his handiwork  tony was used to glaring by that time though he did not like it  he sat still for a long time like one fascinated and returned the stare with interest  at last the indian spoke  is tonyquat a christian  somewhat surprised but not perplexed by the question tony answered ho yis promptly  the indian again looked long and earnestly at the child as if he were considering how far such a juvenile mind might be capable of going into a theological discussion  what is a christian asked the indian abruptly  a kistns a dood boy replied tony then dropping his eyes for a moment in an effort to recall past lessons he suddenly looked up with an intelligent smile and said oh yis i memers now  elsie teach me a kistn boys one what tries to be like de lorddood kind gentle fogivin patient an heaps more zats what a kistn is  the indian nodded approvingly  this accorded as far as it went with what he had learned from the missionaries of red river but his mind was evidently perplexed  he smoked meditated a considerable time and glared at tony in silence then said suddenly  tonyquat your father is not a christian  my fadder would knock zoo down if zoo say dat to hims face replied the child confidently  this seemed so palpable a truth that the indian nodded several times and grinned fiendishly  do christians swear an drink and fight and get angry till the blood makes the face blue and strike with the fist asked petawanaquat  oh nonever replied tony adopting that shocked tone and look which elsie was in the habit of using when anything wicked was propounded to her deys always dood like josuf an abel an saml an cain an david an saul  tony stopped short with an indistinct idea that he was mixing pattern characters  ho muttered the savage with a gleam of triumph in his eyes petawanaquat has got his heart  eh zoo got im by heart aready  took me long long time to git em by heart said tony with a look of admiration which was sadly marred by the paint  mes not got em all off yet  but yous clever an anbig  the indians smile became a sad one and his look was again perplexed as he rose and returned to the camp followed by his adopted son  it was obvious that no light was to be thrown on his religious difficulties whatever they were by tonyquat  after leaving the lakelet on the plains the indian travelled for several days with his friends and then parting from them went towards the west to rejoin his family  this point of divergence the pursuers had missed and when they overtook the indian band they found to their intense regret that the kidnapper had escaped them  we will hold on with the redskins said ian macdonald while sitting in council with his companions after this discovery  the chief tells me that buffaloes have been reported in a spot which lies in the direction we must follow to recover the trail  this advantage we now possess however we know where petawanaquat is goingthanks to his socalled friends here who dont seem to care much about himand as he believes he has distanced all pursuers he will now journey slower than before  besides we must help to kill a buffalo or two our meat being nearly done  what say you vic  i say what you say of course though id rather set off ahead of the band and push on as fast as we can  vich means dat youth bees impetoous toujours said rollin  in pursuance of this plan they journeyed with the indians for three days when an event occurred which modified their plans considerably this was the discovery one afternoon of a broad trail made by the passage of numerous carts and horsemen over the prairie  buffalorunners exclaimed rollin when they came upon the track  from red river cried victor  even so boys said ian  the indian chief who led the party held the same opinion and added that they were evidently journeying in the same direction with themselves  this rendered it necessary that they should make a forced march during the night it being otherwise impossible for men on foot to overtake a party of horsemen  towards midnight of the same day they had the satisfaction of seeing their campfires in the distance  soon afterwards they were within the circle of the camp where men were still smoking and eating round the fires and women and children were moving busily about  why there are john flett and david mowat exclaimed victor as several of the men came forward to meet the party  an hayes an vinklemann cried rollin  another minute and they were shaking hands amid a chorus of surprised and hearty questions and replies  is louis lambert with you asked victor after mutual explanations had been given  no said david mowat with a laugh hes got other fish to fry at home  poor ian winced for he at once pictured to himself elsie as the mermaid hinted at  now boys im going to ask some of you to make a sacrifice said ian we had intended to follow up this chase on foot but of course will be able to accomplish our end sooner on horseback  i want three of you to lend us your horses  youre sure to be well paid for them by sam ravenshaw and my father  ill guarantee you that  we want no guarantee interrupted john flett and we have spare horses enough in the camp to mount you without giving up our own so make your mind easy  zat is troo said herr winklemann ve has goot horse to spare bufflorunners every von  bot you mus stay vid us von day for run ze bufflo an git supply of meat  victor and his friends at once agreed to this all the more readily that the possession of horses would now enable them easily to overtake the fugitives  accordingly they sat down to a splendid supper of robbiboo and continued to eat chat and quaff tea far into the following morning until nature asserted herself by shutting up their eyelids  the band with which our adventurers were now associated was composed of a motley crew of red river halfbreeds out for the great spring buffalo hunt  it consisted of nearly 700 hunters as many women more than 400 children and upwards of 1000 carts with horses and draught oxen besides about 700 buffalorunners or trained huntinghorses and more than 500 dogs  these latter although useless in the spring hunt were nevertheless taken with them fed and cared for because of their valuable qualities as draught animals for light sledges in winter  some of the hunters were steadygoing and respectable enough others were idle thriftless fellows who could not settle to farming in the colony and even in the chase were lazy bad hunters  the women were there for the purpose of attending to camp dutiescooking dressing the buffalo skins making bags from the animals green hides with the hair left on the outside and filling the same with pemmican  this substance as we have elsewhere remarked is by no means unpalatable it is very nutritious and forms the chief food of the hundreds of voyageurs who traverse ruperts land in boats and canoes during the open season of the year  it must be understood however that the compost is not attractive in appearance  it is made in the open air by women who are not very particular in their habits  hence during windy weather a modicum of dust is introduced into it  even stray leaves and twigs may get into it at times and it is always seasoned more or less profusely with buffalo hairs  but these are trifles to strong and hungry men  two trips to the plains were made annually by these hunters  the proceeds of the spring hunt were always sold to supply them with needed clothing ammunition etcetera for the year  the fall or autumn hunt furnished them with their winter stock of food and helped to pay off their debts most of them being supplied on credit  sometimes the fall hunt failed in which case starvation stared the improvident among them in the face and suffering more or less severe was the lot of all  little however did the reckless jovial halfbreeds care for such considerations on the occasion about which we write  it was the spring hunt  the year was before them  health rolled in the veins and hope revelled in the breasts of all as they mounted their steeds and sallied forth to the chase  ah it was a memorable day for victor when at early dawn he vaulted into the saddle of the horse lent to him and went off to hunt the buffalo  the said horse began by standing straight up on its hind legs like a man  victor held on by the mane  reversing the process it pointed its tail to the sky  victor stood in the stirrups  it swerved to the right it swerved to the left but victor swerved with it accommodatingly  he was a splendid horseman  finding that out at last the steed took the bit in its teeth and ran away  victor let it run nay he whacked its sides and made it run  dozens of wild fellows were curvetting and racing around him  it was his first hunt  mad with excitement he finally swept away from his comrades with a series of warwhoops that would have done credit to the fiercest redskin on the north american plains    chapter six  describes a great hunt  the huge bison or buffalo of the north american prairie is gregarious in other words it loves society and travels in herds  these herds are sometimes so vast as absolutely to blacken the plains for miles around  the halfbreed buffalohunters of red river were also gregarious  from the moment of their quitting the settlements they kept together for mutual help and protection  although a free wild and lawless set they found it absolutely necessary for hunting purposes to organise themselves and thus by voluntary submission to restraint unwittingly did homage to law  on a level plain at a place called pembina three days out from red river the whole camp squatted down the roll was called and rules and regulations for the journey were agreed upon and settled  then ten captains were named the senior being baptiste warder an english halfbreed a fine boldlooking and discreet man of resolute character who was thus elected the great war chief of the little army  as commanderinchief baptiste had various duties to perform among others to see that lost property picked up about the camp should be restored to its owner through the medium of a public crier who went his rounds every evening  each captain had ten stout fellows under him to act as soldiers or policemen  ten guides were also appointed each of whom led the camp day about and carried its flag or standard  the hoisting of the flag each morning was the signal for raising the camp  half an hour was the time allowed to get ready unless any one being sick or animals having strayed delay became necessary  all day the flag remained up its being lowered each evening was the signal for encamping  then the captains and their men arranged the order of the camp  the carts as they arrived moved to their appointed places side by side with the trains outwards and formed a circle inside of which at one end the tents were pitched in double and triple rows the horses etcetera being tethered at the other end thus they were at all times ready to resist attack from indians  among other rules laid down on this occasion at starting were the following  no hunting to be allowed on the sabbath day  no party to fork off lag behind or go before without permission  no hunter or party to run buffalo before the general order and every captain in turn to mount guard with his men and patrol the camp  the punishments for offenders were like themselves rather wild and wasteful  for a first offence against the laws a culprit was to have his saddle and bridle cut up for the second his coat to be taken and cut up and for the third he was to be flogged  a person convicted of theft was to be brought to the middle of the camp and have his or her name loudly proclaimed three times with the word thief added each time  it was the third week out from the settlement when the hunters met with victor ravenshaw and his friends yet up to that day they had failed to find the buffalo and were wellnigh starving  the intelligence therefore that scouts had at length discovered game had filled the camp with joy  after having taken a little of the mettle out of his steed as related in the last chapter victor caused him to make a wide circuit on the plain and came up behind the line of hunters just as they topped a prairie undulation or wave and sighted the buffalo  it was a grand array the sight of which thrilled the young sportsman to the heart full four hundred huntsmen mounted on fresh and restive steeds were slowly advancing waiting eagerly for the word to start  baptiste warder their chief was in front with his telescope surveying the game and the ground  victor pushed in between ian and rollin who rode near the centre of the impatient line  the wild cattle blackened the plain at the distance of about a mile and a half from them  surely they must have seen us by this time said victor in a voice of suppressed agitation  have you got your powderhorn and bullets handy asked ian  yes all right  put im in de mout de mout said rollin quickly  the halfbreed here referred to a habit of the hunters who carry several bullets in their mouths to facilitate loading while running at full speed  the method is simple  the hunter merely pours powder into his left palm transfers it to his gun drops a bullet from his mouth into the muzzle hits the butt smartly on his pommel which at once sends the charge home and forces priming into the pan and thus is ready for another shot  victor having forgotten all about this immediately put three bullets into his mouth his gun being already loaded  dont swallow them said ian  swallow your own advice growled victor  start shouted captain warder  the welcome signal sent an electric thrill along the line  it was promptly obeyed first at a slow trot then at a hard gallop  the low rumbling thunder of their tramp was in keeping with the wild eager looks of the halfsavage hunters  they had approached to within four or five hundred yards before the buffalobulls curved their tails into marks of interrogation and began to paw the ground  another moment and the mighty herd took to flight  then the huntsmen let loose their eager steeds  as squadrons of dragoons charge into the thick of battle these wild fellows bore down with grand momentum on the buffalo bands  the very earth seemed to tremble when they charged but when the herd sprang away in the frenzy of terror it was as though a shock of earthquake had riven the plains  right into the careering mass the horsemen rushed shots beganhere there and everywhere until a rattle of musketry filled the air while smoke dust shouts and bellowing added to the wild confusion  the fattest animals were selected and in an incredibly short space of time a thousand of their carcasses strewed the plain  the men who were best mounted of course darted forward in advance and secured the fattest cows  they seldom dropped a mark to identify their property  these hunters possess a power of distinguishing the animals they have slain during a hot and long ride which amounts almost to an instincteven though they may have killed from ten to twelve animals an experienced hunter on a good horse will perform such a feat during one race  he seldom fires till within three or four yards of his prey and never misses  a welltrained horse the moment it hears the shot springs on one side to avoid stumbling over the buffalo  an awkward or shy horse will not approach nearer than ten or fifteen yards  badly mounted men think themselves well off if they secure two or three animals during one run  as the battle continued the very air was darkened with dust and smoke of course such a fight could not rage without casualties  there were in truth many hairbreadth and some almost miraculous escapes for the ground was rocky and full of badgerholes  twentythree horses and riders were seen at one moment all sprawling on the ground  one horse was gored by a bull and killed on the spot two other horses fell over it and were disabled  one rider broke his shoulderblade another burst his gun by careless loading and lost three fingers while another was struck on the knee by a spent ball  the wonder was not that so many but that so few were hurt when it is considered that the riders were dashing about in clouds of dust and smoke crossing and recrossing each other in all directions with shots firing right and left before behindeverywherein quick succession  the explanation must be that every man being a trained marksman nearly every bullet found its billet in a buffalos body  with his heart in his mouth as well as his bullets victor ravenshaw entered into the wild melee scarce knowing what he was about although inexperienced he knew well what to do for many a time had he listened to the stories of buffalohunters in times past and had put all their operations in practice with a wooden gun in mimic chase  but it was not easy to keep cool  he saw a fat animal just ahead of him pushed close alongside pointed his gun without raising it to his shoulder and fired  he almost burnt the animals hair so near was he the buffalo fell and his horse leaped to one side  victor had forgotten this part of the programme  he was nearly unseated but held on by the mane and recovered his seat  immediately he poured powder into his palmspilling a good deal and nearly dropping his gun from under his left arm in the operationand commenced to reload while at full speed  he spat a ball into the muzzle just missed knocking out some of his front teeth forgot to strike the butt on the pommel of the saddle which omission would have infallibly resulted in the bursting of the gun had it exploded pointed at another animal and drew the trigger  it missed fire of course for want of priming  he remembered his error corrected it pointed again fired and dropped another cow  elated with success he was about to reload when a panting bull came up behind him  he seized his bridle and swerved a little  the bull thundered on mad with rage its tail aloft and pursued by michel rollin who seemed as angry as the bull  hah  i vill stop you growled the excited halfbreed as he dashed along  animals were so numerous and close around them that they seemed in danger at the moment of being crushed  suddenly the bull turned sharp round on its pursuer  to avoid it the horse leaped on one side the girths gave way and the rider saddle and all were thrown on the bulls horns  with a wild toss of its head the surprised creature sent the man high into the air  in his fall he alighted on the back of another buffaloit was scarcely possible to avoid this in the crowdand slipped to the ground  strange to say rollin was not hurt but he was effectually thrown out of the running for that time and victor saw him no more till evening  we relate no fanciful or exaggerated tale good reader  our description is in strict accordance with the account of a credible eyewitness  for upwards of an hour and a half the wild chase was kept up the plain was strewn with the dead and dying and horsemen as well as buffaloes were scattered far and wide  victor suddenly came upon ian while in pursuit of an animal  what luck he shouted  ive killed twoby accident i think said ian swerving towards his comrade but not slackening his pace  capital  ive killed three  whos that big fellow ahead after the old bull  its winklemann  he seems to prefer tough meat  as ian spoke the bull in question turned suddenly round just as rollins bull had done and received winklemanns horse on its hairy forehead  the poor man shot from the saddle as if he had been thrown from a catapult turned a complete somersault over the buffalo and fell on his back beyond  thrusting the horse to one side the buffalo turned and seemed to gore the prostrate german as it dashed onward  puffing up at once both victor and ian leaped from their horses and hastened to assist their friend  he rose slowly to a sitting posture as they approached and began to feel his legs with a troubled look  not much hurt i hope said ian kneeling beside him  no bones broken  no i think not mine leks are fery vell but i fear mine lunks are gone answered the german untying his belt  it was found however on examination that the lungs were all right the bulls horn having merely grazed the poor mans ribs  in a few minutes his horse was caught and he was able to remount but the trio were now far behind the tide of war which had swept away by that time to the horizon  they therefore determined to rest content with what they had accomplished and return to camp  what a glorious chase exclaimed victor as they rode slowly back i almost wish that white men might have the redskins heaven and hunt the buffalo for ever  youd soon grow tired of your heaven said ian laughing  i suspect that the soul requires occupation of a higher kind than the pursuing and slaying of wild animals  no doubt you are right you learned philosopher but you cant deny that this has been a most enjoyable burst  i dont deny anything  i merely controvert your idea that it would be pleasant to go on with this sort of thing for ever  hah de more so ven your back is almost broke and your lunks are gored  but your lunks are not gored said victor  come winklemann be thankful that you are aliveby the way ian where are the animals you killed  we are just coming to one  here it is  i threw my cap down to mark it and there is another one a quarter of a mile behind it  we have plenty of meat you see and shall be able to quit the camp tomorrow  while the friends were thus jogging onwards the hunt came to an end and the hunters throwing off their coats and turning up their sleeves drew their scalpingknives and began the work of skinning and cutting up the animals  while thus engaged their guns and bridles lay handy beside them for at such times their indian enemies are apt to pounce on and scalp some of them should they chance to be in the neighbourhood at the same time the carts advanced and began to load with meat and marrowbones  the utmost expedition was used for all the meat that they should be obliged to leave on the field when night closed in would be lost to them and become the property of the wolves  we know not what the loss amounted to on this occasion  but the gain was eminently satisfactory no fewer than 1375 tongues as titbits and trophies being brought into camp  is it to be wondered at that there were sounds of rejoicing that night round the blazing campfires  need we remark that the hissing of juicy steaks sounded like a sweet lullaby far on into the night that the contents of marrowbones oiled the fingers to say nothing of the mouths cheeks and noses of man woman and child  is it surprising that people who had been on short allowance for a considerable time past took advantage of the occasion and ate till they could hardly stand  truly they made a night of it  their indian visitors who constituted themselves campfollowers gorged themselves to perfect satisfaction and even the dogs who had a full allowance licked their lips that night with inexpressible felicity    chapter seven  some of the shadows of a buffalohunters life  in order to give the women time to prepare some pemmican for them victor ravenshaw and his companions agreed to spend another day with the hunters and again as a matter of course followed them to the chase  the same wild pursuit accompanied by accidents serious and seriocomic took place and success again attended the hunt but the day did not end so happily owing to an event which filled the camp with great anxiety  it happened at the close of the day  the men were dropping into camp by twos and threes wearied with hard work more or less covered with dust and blood and laden with buffalo tongues  carts also were constantly coming in filled with meat  the women were busy cutting up and drying the meat in the sun or over a slow fire melting down fat pounding the dried meat with stones and manufacturing bags out of the raw hides  chatting and merry laughter resounded on all sides for pemmican and bales of dried meat meant money and they were coining it fast  towards sunset a band of several hunters appeared on the ridge in front of the camp and came careering gaily towards it  baptiste warder the mighty captain led  victor ian rollin winklemann flett mowat and others followed  they dashed into camp like a whirlwind and sprang from their steeds evidently well pleased with the success of the day  had splendid sport said victor with glittering eyes to one of the subordinate captains who addressed him  i killed ten animals myself and ian macdonald missed fifteen winklemann dropped six besides dropping himself  vat is dat you zay demanded the big german who was divesting himself of some of the accoutrements of the chase  i say that you tumbled over six buffaloes and then tumbled over yourself said victor laughing  zat is not troo  it vas mine horse vat tombled  of course i could not go on riding upon noting after mine horse vas down  at supper herr winklemann was quieter than usual and rather cross  his propensity to tumble seemed to be a sore subject with him both as to body and mind  he made more than one cutting remark to victor during the meal  after supper pipes were of course lighted and conversation flowed freely  the only two who did not smoke were ian macdonald and strange to say winklemann  that worthy german was a brilliant exception to his countrymen in the matter of tobacco  victor under the influence of example was attempting in a quiet way to acquire the art but with little success  he took to the pipe awkwardly  vat vor you smok asked winklemann in a tone of contempt to victor it is clear zat you do not loike it  how dyou know that i dont like it asked victor with a blush and a laugh  becowse your face do show it  ve does not make faces at vat ve loikes  that may be retorted victor somewhat sharply  nevertheless i have earned a hunters right to enjoy my pipe as well as the rest of you  bon bon cest vraitrue cried rollin letting a huge cloud escape from his lips  bah doos killing buffalo give you right to do voolishness  do not try for deceive yourself  you loike it not bot you tink it makes you look loike a man  zat is vat you tink  nevair vas you more mistouken  i have seen von leetle poy put on a pair of big boots and tink he look very grand very loike him fadder bot de boots only makes him look smaller dan before an more foolish  so it is vid de pipe in de mout of de beardless poy  having thrown this apple of discord into the midst of the party winklemann shut his mouth firmly as if waiting for a belligerent reply as for victor he flushed again partly from indignation at this attack on his liberty to do as he pleased and partly from shame at having the real motive of his heart so ruthlessly exposed  victor was too honest and manly to deny the fact that he had not yet acquired a liking for tobacco and admitted to himself that in very truth his object in smoking was to appear as he imagined more like a man forgetful or ignorant of the fact that men even smokers regard beardless consumers of tobacco as poor imitative monkeys  he soon came to see the habit in its true light and gave it up luckily before he became its slave  he would have been more than mortal however had he given in at once  continuing therefore to puff with obstinate vigour he returned to the charge  smoking is no worse than drinking winklemann and you know that youre fond of beer  bon said rollin nodding approval  vat then cried the german who never declined a challenge of any kind and who was fond of wordy war doos my sin joostify yours  bot you is wrong  if smoking be not worse dan trinking it is less excusable for to trink is natural  i may apuse mine power an trink vat is pad for me but den i may likewise trink vat is coot for me  vit smoking no you cannot smok vat is coot it is all pad togeder  von chile is porn vell it do trink at vonce vidout learning  bot did any von ever hear of a chile vat cry for a pipe ven it was porn  the laugh with which this question was greeted was suddenly arrested by the sound of a galloping steed  every one sprang up and instinctively seized a weapon for the clatter of hoofs had that unmistakable character which indicates desperate urgency  it was low and dull at first but became suddenly and sharply distinct as a rider rose over the ridge to the left and bore madly down on the camp lashing his horse with furious persistency  its young valle exclaimed captain baptiste hastening to meet him  valle who was a mere youth had gone out with his father louison valle and the rest of the hunters in the morning  with glaring eyes and scarce able to speak he now reined in his trembling steed and told the terrible news that his father had been killed by sioux indians  a party of halfbreeds instantly mounted and dashed away over the plains led by the poor boy on a fresh horse  on the way he told the tale more fully  we have already said that when skinning the buffalo late in the evening or at a distance from camp the hunters ran considerable risk from savages and were more or less wary in consequence  it was drawing towards sunset when louison valle perceived that night would descend before he could secure the whole of the animals he had shot and made up his mind to the sacrifice  while busily engaged on a buffalo he sent his son on his own horse to a neighbouring eminence to watch and guard against surprise  even while the father was giving directions to the son a party of sioux armed with bows and arrows were creeping towards him snakelike through the long grass  these suddenly rushed upon him and he had barely time to shout to his son make for the camp when he fell pierced by a shower of arrows  of course the savages made off at once well knowing that pursuit was certain  the murderers were twelve in number  they made for the bush country meanwhile the avengers reached the murdered man  the body was on its back just as it had fallen  death must have relieved the unfortunate hunter before the scalp had been torn from his skull  it was the first time that victor ravenshaw had looked upon a slain man many a time and oft had he read with a thrill of interest glowing descriptions of fights in which isolated acts of courage or heroism or magnanimity on the battlefield coupled with but slight reference to the killed and wounded had blinded his perceptions as to the true nature of the game of war  now his eyes beheld the contorted form of one with whose manly aspect he had been familiar in the settlement scarcely recognisable in its ghastliness with blue lips protruding eyeballs and a horrid mass of coagulated blood where the once curling hair had been  victors ears were still ringing with the deadly shriek that had burst from valles wife when she heard the dreadful newsjust as he and his party galloped out of the camp  he knew also that the dead hunter left several young children to be pinched by dire poverty in future years for want of their natural breadwinner  these and many similar thoughts crowded on his throbbing brain as he gazed at the new and terrible sight and his eyes began for the first time to open to truths which ever after influenced his opinions while reading of the socalled triumphs of war  vengeance was now the cry as the hunters left the place in hot pursuit  they knew that the savages could not be far off and that they were unmounted but they also knew that if they succeeded in gaining the larger portions of thick bush with which some parts of that region were covered it would be impossible to follow them up  moreover it was growing dark and there was no time to lose  in a few minutes ian and victor were left alone with two men who had agreed to look after the body of the murdered man  sadly and silently they assisted in laying the corpse in a cavity of the rocks and covering it over with large stones to protect it from wolves and then prepared to leave the spot  will they succeed think you in overtaking the murderers asked victor of one of the men  succeed  ay no fear of that replied the hunter with a vindictive scowl  its not the first time some of them have been out after the sioux  we will ride back to camp vic said ian rousing himself from a reverie it is no part of our duty to assist in executing vengeance if the camp were assailed we should indeed be bound to help defend it but there are more than enough men out to hunt down these murderers  if a cart is not already on its way for the corpse we will send one come  that night the avengers returned they had overtaken and shot down eight of the siouxthe remaining four gained the bushes and escaped  none of themselves were hurt but one had a narrow escape an arrow having passed between his shirt and skin  next day victor and his friends prepared to leave the hunters and resume the chase of petawanaquat but they were arrested by one of those terrific thunderstorms which occasionally visit the prairies  they were already mounted and on the point of taking leave when the air darkened suddenly the sky became overcast lightning began to flash in vivid gleams and a crash of thunder seemed to rend the earth and heavens  presently herr winklemann who meant to ride with the parting guests a short way and was also mounted uttered a shout and immediately horse and man rolled upon the plain  the man rose slowly but the horse lay stillkilled by lightning  by the same flash apparently another horse was struck dead  vell you has tomble very often vid me said the german contemplating the fallen steed bot you vill tomble again no mor  oui he is mort sighed rollin looking down  after this first burst there was a considerable lull but appearances were so gloomy that departure was delayed  soon after the storm burst with a degree of violence that the oldest hunter said he had never before witnessed  lightning wind rain thunder seemed to have selected the spot for a battleground  although the camp was pitched on comparatively high and rocky ground the deluge was so great that in the course of ten minutes nearly everything was afloat  see note 1  the camp was literally swimming and some of the smaller children were with difficulty saved from drowning  so furious was the wind that the tents were either thrown down or blown to ribbons during the storm three of the indian tents or lodges were struck by lightning  in one of these a canadian was killed in another all the inmatesan indian his wife two children and two dogswere killed and a gun beside them was melted in several parts as though it had been lead  then there fell a shower of hail the stones of which were solid angular pieces of ice larger than a hens egg by which some of the people were severely wounded before they found shelter under the carts and overturned tents  it was a terrible display of the power of god and yet strange to say so far is such a scene incapable of influencing mans fallen nature for good that occasions such as these when the camp is in disorder are often taken advantage of by indians to approach and steal the horses  being well aware of this propensity of the red man baptiste warder and his captains kept a sharp lookout  it was well they did so for after the storm a formidable band of sioux was discovered within a short distance of the camp  their wily chief was however equal to the occasion  he assumed the role of an injured man  he had come to remonstrate with the halfbreeds and charge them with cruelty  my warriors said he killed only one of your people and for that one you murdered eight of my braves  the halfbreeds spoke the chief fairly however and entertained him and his followers hospitably so that the affair was amicably settled and they went away in peace  but dark eyes had met in deadly hatred during the conference  the party of indians who had joined the hunters with victor and his comrades were saulteaux pronounced sotoes and the bitter enemies of the sioux  some time after the sioux had taken their departure a band of about fifty of these saulteaux left the camp stealthily and pursued a detached party of their foes for about ten miles  they overtook them at a small stream  the unsuspecting sioux prepared to swim over to them mistaking them at first for friends but a volley which killed three undeceived them  the fire was instantly returned and a smoke raised to alarm the country  the saulteaux retreated while the sioux gathering force pursued and it is probable that the whole of the assailants would have been scalped if night had not favoured them  in this raid seven sioux were killed and three wounded  of the saulteaux three were killed and four wounded  again the camp was visited by enraged and armed sioux to the number of 300 who challenged the saulteaux to come forth man to man and fight it out  the latter declined and the halfbreeds many of whom were related by marriage to the saulteaux managed to patch up a hollow peace between them  at last victor ian and rollin got away glad to have done both with buffalo and savages  they now possessed three good horses a supply of fresh provisions and plenty of ammunition  thus provided they galloped off with light hearts over the boundless plains and soon left the camp of the hunters far behind them    note 1  this is no picture of the fancy but true in all its details    chapter eight  the chase continued and brought to a fiery termination  with the unerring certainty of bloodhounds the three friends now settled down to the pursuit of petawanaquat  from the saulteaux indians they had received an exact description of the spot where the fugitive had parted from them they had therefore little difficulty in finding it  still less difficulty had they in following up the trail for the grass was by that time very long and a horse leaves a track in such grass which if not very obvious to unaccustomed eyes is as plain as a highway to the vision of a backwoods hunter or a redskin  over the prairie waves they sped with growing excitement as their hopes of success increased now thundering down into the hollows anon mounting the gentle slopes at full swing or rounding the clumps of trees that here and there dotted the prairie like islets in an interminable sea of green and ever as they rounded an islet or topped a prairie wave they strained their eyes in earnest expectation of seeing the objects of their pursuit on the horizon but for several days they raced and gazed and hoped in vain  still they did not lose confidence but pressed persistently on  our horses are fresh and good said victor as they reined in to a gentle trot on the brow of a knoll to rest for a few minutes and petawanaquats horse whether good or bad is doubleweightedalthough to be sure tony is not heavy  besides said ian the redskin does not dream now of pursuit so that pressing on as we do we must overtake him ere long  voila de buffalo said rollin pointing to a group of these huge creatures in the midst of which two bulls were waging furious war while the cows stood by and looked on  shall ve go an chase dem  no rollin we have more important game to chase said victor whose conscience now that he was free from the exciting influences of the camp had twinged him more than once for his delayeven although it was partly justifiablewhile the image of poor tony with outstretched appealing hands on a flying horse behind a savage was ever before him come on come on  he switched his horse and went skimming down the slope followed by his comrades  soon they came to a place where the ground was more broken and rocky  voila a bar a bar shouted the excitable halfbreed com kill him  they looked and there sure enough was an object which rollin declared was a large grizzly bear  it was a long way off however and the ground between them seemed very broken and difficult to traverse on horseback  ian macdonald thought of the bears claws and a collar and elsie and tightened his reins  then he thought of the risk of breaking a horses leg if the bear should lead them a long chase over such ground and of the certain loss of time and of petawanaquat pushing on ahead  it was a tempting opportunity but his power of selfdenial triumphed  no rollin we have no time to hunt  behold exclaimed rollin again more buffalo  they had swept past the stony ground and rounded a clump of trees behind which a small herd of animals stood for a few seconds staring at them in mute amazement  these snorted set up their tails and tore wildly away to the right  this was too much  with a gleeful yell rollin turned to pursue but victor called to him angrily to let the buffalo be  the halfbreed turned back with a sigh  ah vell ve must forbear  i say vic remarked ian with a significant smile why wont you go after the buffalo  victor looked at his friend in surprise  surely he said it is more important as well as more interesting to rescue ones brother than to chase wild animals  true but how does that sentiment accord with your wish that you might spend eternity in hunting buffalo  oh you know returned victor with a laugh when i said that i wasnt thinking ofof  he switched his horse into a wilder gallop and said no more  he had said quite enough  he was not the only youth in north america and elsewhere who has uttered a good deal of nonsense without thinking but then that was long ago  youths are wiser now  on the evening of that day when the sun went down and when it became too dark to follow the trail and therefore unsafe to travel for fear of stumbling into badgerholes the three friends pulled up beside a clump of wood on the margin of a little stream and prepared their encampment  little did they imagine while busy with the fire and kettle how nearly they had gained their end yet how disastrously they had missed it well for man sometimes that he is ignorant of what takes place around him  had the three pursuers known who was encamped in a clump of trees not half a mile beyond them they would not have feasted that night so heartily nor would they have gone to sleep with such calm placidity  in the clump of trees referred to petawanaquat himself sat smoking over the dying embers of the fire that had cooked his recently devoured supper and tony full to repletion lay on his back gazing at him in quiet satisfaction mingled slightly with wonder for tony was a philosopher in a small way and familiarity with his fathers pipe had failed to set at rest a question which perplexed his mind namely why men should draw smoke into their mouths merely to puff it out again  when the pipe and the campfire had burnt low tony observed with much interest that the indians eyes became suddenly fixed that his nostrils dilated his lips ceased to move the cloud that had just escaped from them curled round the superincumbent nose and disappeared without being followed by another cloud and the entire man became rigid like a brown statue  at that point tony ceased to think because tired nature asserted her claims and he fell sound asleep  the practised ear of the indian had detected the sound of horses feet on the prairie  to any ordinary man no sound at all would have been perceptible save the sighing of the night wind  petawanaquat however not only heard the tramp but could distinguish it from that of buffalo he rose softly ascertained that tony was asleep turned aside the bushes and melted into darkness among the trees  presently he emerged on the plain at the other side of the clump and there stood still patience is one of the red mans characteristics  he did not move hand or foot for half an hour during which time despite the distance of the neighbouring clump he could easily make out the sound of an axe chopping wood and even heard human voices in conversation  then a gleam of light flickered among the trees and the kindling campfire of our three friends became visible  the indian now felt comparatively safe  he knew that whoever the new arrivals might be they were unsuspicious of his presence in the vicinity and had encamped for the night  he also knew that when men are busy with supper they are not very watchful especially when danger is not expected  he therefore gave them another quarter of an hour to prepare supper and then moved stealthily over the plain towards them  on gaining the shelter of the trees petawanaquat advanced with catlike caution until he could clearly see the travellers  he recognised them instantly and a dark frown settled on his features  his first thought was to steal their horses and thus leave them incapable of pursuing further but ian macdonald was too much of a backwoodsman to give a foe the opportunity to do this  the horses were tethered close beside the fire  then the indian thought of shooting them but his gun being a singlebarrel such as was sold to the indians by the furtraders could only dispose of one horse at a time thus leaving the other two to his incensed enemies who would probably capture him before he could reload or regain his own camp  with a feeling of baffled rage he suddenly thought of murder  he could easily kill ian macdonald could probably reload before rollin should overtake him and as for victor he was nothing  quick as thought the indian raised his gun and took a long steady aim at ians forehead  the contemplative schoolmaster was looking at the fire thinking of elsie at the time  he smiled as he thought of her  perhaps it was the smile that checked the savage perhaps it was the words thou shalt not kill which had been sounded in his ears more than once during the past winter by the missionary  at all events the fatal trigger was not drawn  ians contemplations were not disturbed the gun was lowered and the savage melted once more into the deep shade of the thicket  returning to his own camp in the same catlike manner as before petawanaquat quietly but quickly packed his provisions etcetera on his horse  when all was ready he tried to awaken tony but tony slept the sleep of infancy and comparative innocence  the indian pushed him kicked him even lifted him up and shook him before he awoke  then expressing astonishment at having to resume the journey at so early an hour the child submitted silently to orders  in a few minutes the indian led his horse down to the rivulet close at hand crossed it with tony half asleep clinging to his back ascended the opposite bank and gained the level plain  here he mounted with tony in front to guard against the risk of his falling off in a state of slumber and galloped away  fortunately for him the moon had risen for red men are not a whit better than white at seeing in the dark  indeed we question the proverbial capacity of cats in that way  true the orb of night was clouded and only in her first quarter but she gave light enough to enable the horseman to avoid dangers and proceed at full speed  thus while the pursuers snored the pursued went scouring over the prairies farther and farther towards the fair west  michel rollin being a lively restless character used generally to be up before his comrades in the mornings and gratified an inquisitive propensity by poking about  in his pokings he discovered the trail of the midnight visitor and thereupon set up a howl of surprise that effectually roused ian and victor  these guns in hand rushed as they fancied to the rescue  what a noisy goose you are said victor on learning the cause of the cry  there is reason for haste however said ian rising from a close inspection of the trail  some one has been here in the night watching us  why he didnt join us if a friend or kill us if an enemy puzzles me  if there were horsetracks about i should say it must have been petawanaquat himself  come we must mount and away without breakfast  they went off accordingly and soon traced the indians original track to the place where he had encamped  petawanaquat had taken the precaution to pour water on his fire so as to cool the ashes and thus lead to the supposition that he had been gone a considerable time but ian was not to be so easily deceived  the moment he had examined the extinct fire and made up his mind he leaped up and followed the trail to the spot where the indian had mounted  now then mount boys he cried vaulting into the saddle no time to lose  the redskin seems to have a good horse and knows we are at his heels  it will be a straight endon race now  hup get along  their course at first lay over a level part of the plain which rendered full speed possible then they came to a part where the thick grass grew rank and high rendering the work severe  as the sun rose high they came to a small pond or pool  the rascal has halted here i see cried ian pulling up leaping off and running to the water which he lifted to his mouth in both hands while his panting horse stooped and drank  it was very likely more for tonys sake than for his own  but if he could stop so can we for a few minutes  it vill make de horses go more better said rollin unstrapping the pemmican bag  thats right cried victor give us a junka big onesothanks we can eat it as we go  up and away they went again urging their horses now to do their utmost for they began to hope that the day of success had surely arrived  still far ahead of his pursuers the indian rode alone without check or halt to the alarm of tony who felt that something unusual had occurred to make his selfappointed father look so fierce  what de matter he ventured to ask  nobody chase us  let tonyquat shut his mouth was the brief reply  and tony obeyed he was learning fast  suddenly the air on the horizon ahead became clouded  the eyes of the savage dilated with an expression that almost amounted to alarm  could it be fire  it wasthe prairie on fire  as the wind blew towards him the consuming flames and smoke approached him at greater speed than he approached them  they must soon meet  behind were the pursuers in front the flames  there was but one course open  as the fire drew near the indian stopped dismounted and tore up and beat down a portion of the grass around him  then he struck a light with flint and steel and set fire to the grass to leeward of the cleared space  it burned slowly at first and he looked anxiously back as the roar of the fiery storm swelled upon his ear  tony looked on in mute alarm and surprise  the horse raised its head wildly and became restive but the indian having now lighted the long grass thoroughly restrained it  presently he sprang on its back and drew tony up beside him  flames and smoke were now on both sides of him  when the grass was consumed to leeward he rode on to the blackened spacenot a moment too soon however  it was barely large enough to serve as a spot of refuge when the storm rolled down and almost suffocated horse and riders with smoke  then the fire at that spot went out for want of fuel and thus the way was opened to the coalblack plain over which it had swept  away flew the indian then diverging sharply to the right so as to skirt the fire now on its windward side and riding frequently into the very fringe of flame so that his footprints might be burnt up  when some hours later the pursuers met the fire they went through the same performance in exactly the same manner excepting that victor and rollin acted with much greater excitement than the savage  but when they had escaped the flames and rode out upon the burnt prairie to continue the chase every trace of those of whom they were in pursuit had completely vanished away    chapter nine  meteorological changes and consequences and a grand opportunity misimproved  it must not be supposed that the life of a backwoodsman is all pleasure and excitement  not wishing to disappoint our readers with it we have hitherto presented chiefly its bright phases but truth requires that we should now portray some of the darker aspects of that life  for instance it was a very sombre aspect indeed of prairielife when victor ravenshaw and his party crossed a stony place where victors horse tripped and rolled over causing the rider to execute a somersault which laid him flat upon the plain compelling the party to encamp there for three days until he was sufficiently recovered to resume the journey perhaps we should say the chase for although the trail had been lost hope was strong and the pursuers continued to advance steadily in what they believed to be the right direction  the aspect of things became still more dreary when the fine weather which was almost uninterrupted as summer advanced gave way to a period of wind and rain  still they pushed on hopefully  michel rollin alone was despondent  it is a wild goose chase now he remarked sulkily one day while the wet fuel refused to kindle  that same night victor half awoke and growled  he seldom awoke of his own accord  nature had so arranged it that parents or comrades usually found it necessary to arouse him with much shouting and shakingnot unfrequently with kicks  but there was a more powerful influence than parents comrades or kicks at work that night  being tired and sleepy the party had carelessly made their beds in a hollow it was fair when they lay down  soon afterwards a small but exceedingly heavy rain descended like dew upon their unprotected heads it soaked their blankets and passed through  it soaked their garments and passed through  it reached their skins which it could not so easily pass through but was stopped and warmed before being absorbed a few uneasy turns and movements with an occasional growl was the resultnothing more  but when the density of the rain increased and the crevices in the soil turned into active watercourses and their hollow became a pool victor became as we have said halfawake presently he awoke completely sat up and scratched his head  it was the power of a soft and gentle but persistent influence triumphantly asserted  wassemarrer asked ian without moving  why yawning lake winnipeg is a trifle to this said victor  ogorosleep returned ian  niagara have com to de plains exclaimed rollin rising to a sitting posture in desperation  it have been rush longside of me spine for two hours by de cloke  oui  this aroused ian who also sat up disconsolate and yawned  its uncomfortable he remarked  no one replied to so ridiculously obvious a truth but each man slowly rose and stumbled towards higher ground  to add to their discomfort the night was intensely dark even if wide awake they could not have seen a yard in front of them  have you found a tree asked victor  ouiyesto be sure said rollin angrily  anyhow von branch of a tree have found me an amost split my head  where is itspeak ian i can see nothing  is itah  ive found it too  vid yoos head inquired rollin chuckling  victor condescended not to reply but lay down under the partial shelter of the tree rolled himself up in his wet blanket and went to sleep his companions followed suit  yes reader we can vouch for the truth of this having more than once slept damp and soundly in a wet blanket but they did not like it and their spirits were down about zero when they mounted at grey dawn and resumed the chase in a dull dreadful drizzle  after a time the aspect of the scenery changed  the rolling plain became more irregular and broken than heretofore and was more studded with patches of woodland which here and there almost assumed the dignity of forests  one evening the clouds broke glimpses of the heavenly blue appeared to gladden our travellers and ere long the sun beamed forth in all its wonted splendour  riding out into a wide stretch of open country they bounded away with that exuberance of feeling which is frequently the result of sunshine after rain  it is like heaven upon earth cried victor pulling up after a long run  i wonder what heaven is like returned ian musingly  it sometimes occurs to me that we think and speak far too little of heaven which is a strange thing considering that we all hope to go there in the longrun and expect to live there for ever  oh come now mr wiseman said victor i didnt mean to call forth a sermon  your remark vic only brings out one of the curious features of the case  if i had spoken of buffalohunting or riding or boating or even of the redskins happy huntinggroundsanything under the sun or above itall would have been well and in order but directly i refer to our own heaven i am sermonising  well because its so like the parsons pleaded victor  what then  were not the parsons as you style them sent to raise our thoughts to god and heaven by preaching christ  i admit that some of them dont raise our thoughts high and a few of them help rather to drag our thoughts downward  still as a class they are gods servants and for myself i feel that i dont consider sufficiently what they have to tell us  i dont wish to sermonise i merely wish to ventilate my own thoughts and get light if i can  you are willing to chat with me vic on all other subjects why not on this  oh  ive no objection ian none whatever only itsitsi say there seems to me to be some sort of brute moving down in the woods there  hist lets keep round by that rocky knoll and ill run up to see what it is  victor did not mean this as a violent change of subject although he was not sorry to make the change  his attention had really been attracted by some animal which he said and hoped was a bear  they soon galloped to the foot of the knoll which was very ruggedcovered with rocks and bushes  victor ascended on foot while his comrades remained at the bottom holding his horse  the sight that met his eyes thrilled him  in the distance on a wooded eminence sat a huge grizzly bear  the size of victors eyes when he looked back at his comrades was eloquently suggestive even if he had not drawn back and descended the slope toward them on tiptoe and with preternatural caution  a monstrous grizzly he exclaimed in a hoarse whisperthough the bear was at beast half a mile off on the other side of the knoll  the eyes of ian surpassed those of victor in the matter of dilation  did he see you  no he was nibbling his paws when i gave him my last look  now comrades said ian whose usually calm demeanour had given place to intense yet suppressed excitement it may seem selfishthough i hope it is notwhen i ask you to leave that bear entirely to me  you know vic that your sister elsie once expressed a wish for a grizzlybear collar and at the time i inwardly resolved to get her one of my own procuring if i could  it is a whim you know but in the circumstances i do hope thatthat  ah it is for une dameune affair of de heart  bon  you shall go in an vin said the gallant rollin  i dont know said victor dubiously it seems to me rather hard to give up my chance of the first grizzly ive ever seen  however im willing to do so on one conditionthat rollin and i go as near you as may be without interfering  you knowexcuse me ianwhat an awful bad shot you are  if you were to miss you knowwhich youre sure to do and we were not thereeh  all right you shall go with me but have a care no helping of me except in case of dire necessity  this being agreed to they made a wide circuit to reach a hollow  in its shelter they galloped swiftly towards the woodland near the margin of which the bear had been seen  arrived at a point which they judged to be near the animal they dismounted fastened up their horses and prepared for war  there were no encumbrances to lay aside for they travelled in the simplest possible costume but ian drew the charge of his gun wiped the piece carefully out with a bit of rag made sure that the touchhole was clear fixed in a new flint and loaded carefully with ball  the others acted similarly  empty de pan an prime again ven you gits near said rollin  ian made some uncalledfor reference to eggs and the education of rollins grandmother tightened his belt felt that the hatchet and scalpingknife were handy behind him and set off on his adventure followed by his companions at a considerable distance  on drawing near to the outer edge of the woods he stooped slightly and trod with the extreme caution of an indian  indeed no red man could have beaten ian at woodcraftexcept of course in the matter of shooting  he felt this defect keenly as he glided along but never faltered for an instant  elsie smiled at him as visibly as if she had been there  his mind was made up  at the edge of the wood he saw the rough spot where the bear had been seen but no bear was visible  he felt a sinking of the heart  it must have heard me and run away he thought and hurried forward  the actual spot where it had been seen was reached but bruin was not there disappointment rendered ian somewhat impatient  he entered the bushes beyond the knoll hastily  the bear had only changed its position and was wagging its head and nibbling its paws on the other side of these bushes  it heard a footstep ceased to nibble and wag and looked up inquiringly  suddenly macdonald burst through the bushes and stood before him  it is an open question whether the man or the beast was the more surprised for the former had given up all hope by that time  but the bear was first to recover selfpossession and advanced to meet the intruder  it is well known that the king of the western wilds is endowed with more than average ferocity and courage  he may perhaps let you alone if you let him alone but if you take him by surprise he is not prone to flee the bear in question was a magnificent specimen with claws like the fingers of a man  even in that moment of extreme peril ian saw these claws strung together and encircling elsies neck  we say that the peril was extreme for not only was the hunter a bad shot but the hunted was a creature whose tenacity of life is so great that one shot even if well placed is not sufficient to kill it outright  no one knew all this better than ian macdonald but elsie smiled approval and ian being a matteroffact unromantic fellow clenched his teeth with a snap and went down on one knee  the bear quickened his pace and came straight at him  ian raised his gun  then there came a gush of feeling of some sort at his heart  what if he should miss what if the gun should miss fire  certain death he well knew that  he took deadly aim when the monster was within a few yards of him and fired at the centre of its chest  the ball took effect on the extreme point of its nose coursed under the skin over its forehead and went out at the back of its head  never before was a shot taken with a more demonstrative expression of rage  to say that the bear roared would be feeble  a compounded steamwhistle and bassoon might give a suggestive illustration  the pain must have been acute for the creature fell on its knees drove its nose into the ground and produced a miniature earthquake with a snort then it sprang up and rushed at its foe  ian was reloading swiftly for his life  vain hope  men used to breechloaders can scarce understand the slow operations of muzzleloaders  he had only got the powder in and was plucking a bullet from his pouch  another moment and he would have been down when crack crack went shots on either side of him and the bear fell with a ball from victor in its heart and another from rollin in its spine  even thus fatally wounded it strove to reach its conquerors and continued to show signs of ungovernable fury until its huge life went out  poor ian stood resting on his gun and looking at it the picture of despair  you hit him after all said victor with a look of admiration at his friend not on account of the shooting but of his dauntless courage and of course he continued the grizzly is yours because you drew first blood  ian did not reply at once but shook his head gravely  if you and rollin had not been here he said i should have been dead by this time  no vic no  do you think i would present elsie with a collar thus procured  the bear belongs to you and rollin for it seems to me that both shots have been equally fatal  you shall divide the claws between you i will have none of them  there was bitterness in poor ians spirit for grizzly bears were not to be fallen in with every day and it might be that he would never have another opportunity  even if he had what could he do  i dont believe i could hit a house if it were running he remarked that night at supper  my only chance will be to wait till the bear is upon me shove my gun into his mouth and pull the trigger when the muzzle is well down his throat  that would be throttling a bear indeed said victor with a laugh as he threw a fresh log on the fire  what say you rollin  it vould bust de gun replied the halfbreed whose mind just then was steeped in tobacco smoke  bot he continued it vould be worth vile to try  possiblement de bustin of de gun in his troat might do ver vell  it vould give him conconvat you call him  de ting vat leetil chile have  contrariness said victor  contradictiousness suggested ian theyre both good long words after your own heart  non non  conconvulsions dat is it  anyhow it vould injure his digestiveness  ha ha yes so it would cried victor tossing off a can of cold water like a very toper  well boys im off to sleep my digestiveness being uninjured as yet  goodnight  what without a pipe vic  come now dont chaff  to tell you the truth ian ive been acting your part lately  ive been preaching a sermon to myself the text of which was given to me by herr winklemann the night before we left the buffalorunners and ive been considerably impressed by my own preaching  anyhow i mean to take my own advicegoodnight again  ian returned goodnight with a smile and lying down beside him gazed long and thoughtfully through the trees overhead at the twinkling tranquil stars  michel rollin continued to smoke and meditate for another hour  then he shook the ashes out of his pipe heaped fresh logs on the declining fire and followed his comrades to the land of nod    chapter ten  fate of the buffalohunters  in vain did the pursuers search after the lost tony  finding it impossible to rediscover the trail they made for the nearest post of the furtraders from whom they heard of an indian who had passed that way in the direction of the rocky mountains but the traders had taken no special notice of the boy and could tell nothing about him  they willingly however supplied the pursuers with provisions on credit for they knew victors father well by repute and allowed them to join a party who were about to ascend the saskatchewan river  on being further questioned one of the traders did remember that the hair of the boy seemed to him unusually brown and curly for that of a redskin but his reminiscences were somewhat vague  still on the strength of them victor and ian resolved to continue the chase and rollin agreed to follow  thus the summer and autumn passed away  meanwhile a terrible disaster had befallen the buffalohunters of the red river  we have said that after disposing of the proceeds of the spring hunt in the settlement and thus securing additional supplies it is the custom of the hunters to return to the plains for the fall or autumn hunt which is usually expected to furnish the means of subsistence during the long and severe winter  but this hunt is not always a success and when it is a partial failure the gay improvident harumscarum halfbreeds have a sad time of it  occasionally there is a total failure of the hunt and then starvation stares them in the face  such was the case at the time of which we write and the improvident habits of those people in times of superabundance began to tell  many a time in spring had the slaughter of animals been so great that thousands of their carcasses were left where they fell nothing but the tongues having been carried away by the hunters  it was calculated that nearly twothirds of the entire spring hunt had been thus left to the wolves  nevertheless the result of that hunt was so great that the quantity of fresh provisionsfat pemmican and dried meatbrought into red river amounted to considerably over one million pounds weight or about two hundred pounds weight for each individual old and young in the settlement  a large proportion of this was purchased by the hudsons bay company at the rate of twopence per pound for the supply of their numerous outposts and the halfbreed hunters pocketed among them a sum of nearly 1200 pounds  this however was their only market the sales to settlers being comparatively insignificant  in the same year the agriculturists did not make nearly so large a sumbut then the agriculturists were steady and their gains were saved while the jovial halfbreed hunters were volatile and their gains underwent the process of evaporation  indeed it took the most of their gains to pay their debts  thus with renewed supplies on credit they took the field for the fall campaign in little more than a month after their return from the previous hunt  it is not our purpose to follow the band step by step  it is sufficient to say that the season was a bad one that the hunters broke up into small bands when winter set in and some of these followed the fortunes of the indians who of course followed the buffalo as their only means of subsistence  in one of these scattered groups were herr winklemann and baptiste warderthe latter no longer a captain his commission having lapsed with the breaking up of the spring hunt  the plains were covered with the first snows  the party were encamped on a small eminence whence a wide range of country could be seen  there is a small herd on the horizon said baptiste descending from the highest part of the hillock towards the fire where the german was seated eating a scrap of dried meat  zat is vell  i vill go after dem  he raised his bulky frame with a sigh for he was somewhat weak and dispiritedthe band with which he hunted having been at the starvingpoint for some days  winklemann clothed himself in a wolfskin to which the ears and part of the head adhered  a small sledge which may be described as a long thin plank with one end curled up was brought to him by a hungrylooking squaw  four dogs were attached to it with miniature harness made to fit them  when all was ready the hunter flung himself flat on his face at full length on the sledge cracked his whip and away went the dogs at full speed  herr winklemann was armed only with bow and arrows such weapons being most suitable for the work in hand  directing his course to a small clump of trees near to which the buffalo were scraping away the yet shallow snow to reach their food he soon gained the shelter of the bushes fastened up the dogs and advanced through the clump to the other side  it was a fine sight to a hungry man  about a dozen animals were browsing there not far out of gunshot  winklemann at once went down on allfours and arranged the large wolfskin so that the legs hung down over his own legs and arms while the head was pulled over his eyes like a hood  thus disguised he crept into the midst of the unsuspicious band  the buffalo is not afraid of wolves  he treats them with contempt  it is only when he is wounded or enfeebled by sickness or old age that his sneaking enemy comes and sits down before him licking his chops in the hope of a meal  a fat young cow cast a questioning glance at winklemann as he approached her  he stopped  she turned aside and resumed her feeding  then she leaped suddenly into the air and fell quivering on the snow with an arrow up to the feathers in her side  the hunter did not rise  the animals near to the cow looked at her a moment as if in surprise at her eccentric behaviour and then went on feeding  again the hunter bent his bow and another animal lay dying on the plain  the guardian bull observed this lifted his shaggy head and moved that subtle index of temper his tail  an illdirected arrow immediately quivered in his flank  with a roar of rage he bounded into the air tossed up his heels and seeing no enemy on whom to wreak his vengeancefor the wolf was crouching humbly on the snowhe dashed wildly away followed by the rest of the astonished herd  the whole camp had turned out by that time to resume their journey and advanced joyfully to meet the returning hunter  as they passed one of the numerous clumps of wood with which the plains were studded another herd of buffalo started suddenly into view  among other objects of interest in the band of hunters there happened to be a small child which was strapped with some luggage on a little sled and drawn by two dogs  these dogs were lively  they went after the buffalo full swing to the consternation of the parents of the child  it was their only child  if it had only been a fragment of their only child the two dogs could not have whisked it off more swiftly  pursuit was useless yet the whole band ran yelling after it  soon the dogs reached the heels of the herd and all were mixed pellmell togetherthe dogs barking the sled swinging to and fro and the buffalo kicking  at length a bull gored one of the dogs his head got entangled in the harness and he went off at a gallop carrying the dog on his horns the other suspended by the traces and the sled and child whirling behind him  the enraged creature ran thus for full half a mile before ridding himself of the encumbrance and many shots were fired at him without effect  both dogs were killed but strange to say the child was unhurt  the supply of meat procured at this time although very acceptable did not last long and the group with which winklemann was connected was soon again reduced to sore straits  it was much the same with the scattered parties elsewhere though they succeeded by hard work in securing enough of meat to keep themselves alive  in these winter wanderings after the buffalo the halfbreeds and their families had travelled from 150 to 200 miles from the colony but in the midst of their privations they kept up heart always hoping that the sudden discovery of larger herds would ere long convert the present scarcity into the more usual superabundance  but it was otherwise ordained  on the 20th of december there was a fearful snowstorm such as had not been witnessed for years  it lasted several days drove the buffalo hopelessly beyond the reach of the hunters and killed most of their horses  what greatly aggravated the evil was the suddenness of the disaster  according to the account of one who was in red river at the time and an eyewitness the animals disappeared almost instantaneously and no one was prepared for the inevitable famine that followed  the hunters were at the same time so scattered that they could render each other no assistance  indeed the various groups did not know whereabouts the others were  some were never found  here and there whole families despairing of life weakened by want and perishing with cold huddled themselves together for warmth  at first the heat of their bodies melted the snow and soaked their garments these soon froze and completed the work of destruction  they died where they lay  some groups were afterwards discovered thus frozen together in a mass of solid ice  while the very young and the feeble succumbed at once the more robust made a brave struggle for life and as always happens in cases of extreme suffering the good or evil qualities of men and women came out prominently to view  the selfish caring only for themselves forsook their suffering comrades seized what they could or dared and thus prolonged awhile their wretched lives  the unselfish and noblehearted cared for others sacrificed themselves and in many cases were the means of saving life  among these last were baptiste warder and winklemann  i vill valk to de settlement said the latter one morning towards the middle of january as he rose from his lair and began to prepare breakfast  ill go with you said warder  its madness to stop here  death will be at our elbow anyhow but hell be sure to strike us all if we remain where we are  the meat we were lucky enough to get yesterday will keep our party on short allowance for some time and the men will surely find something or other to eke it out while we push on and bring relief  goot returned the german ve vill start after breakfast  my lecks are yet pretty strong  accordingly putting on their snowshoes the two friends set out on a journey such as few men would venture to undertake and fewer could accomplish in the circumstances  on the way they had terrible demonstration of the extent of suffering that prevailed among their friends  they had not walked twenty miles when they came on tracks which led them to a groupa father mother and two sonswho were sitting on the snow frozen to death  in solemn silence the hunters stood for a few minutes and looked at the sad sight then turned and passed on  the case was too urgent to permit of delay  many lives hung on their speedy conveyance of news to the settlement  they bent forward and with long swinging strides sped over the dreary plains until darknessnot exhaustioncompelled them to halt  they carried with them a small amount of pemmican about half rations trusting to meet with something to shoot on the way  before daylight the moon rose  they rose with it and pushed on  suddenly they were arrested by an appalling yell  next moment a man rushed from a clump of trees brandishing a gun  he stopped when within fifty yards uttered another demoniacal yell and took aim at warder  quick as thought the excaptain brought his own piece to his shoulder he would have been too late if the gun of his opponent had not missed fire  stop tis pierre vincent cried winklemann just in time to arrest warders hand  vincent was a wellknown comrade but his face was so disfigured by dirt and blood that they barely recognised him  he flung away his gun when it snapped and ran wildly towards them  come come  i have food food ha ha much food yonder in the bush my wife and child eat it they are eating eating now ha ha  with another fierce yell the poor maniacfor such he had becometurned off at a tangent and ran far away over the plains  they made no attempt to follow him it would have been useless  in the bush they found his wife and child stonedead  frequently during that terrible walk they came on single tracks which invariably showed that the traveller had fallen several times and at length taken to creeping then they looked ahead for they knew that the corpse of a man or woman was not far in advance of them  one such track led them to a woman with an infant on her back  she was still pretty strong and trudged bravely over the snow on her snowshoes while the little one on her back appeared to be quite content with its lot although pinchedlooking in the face  the men could not afford to help her on  it would have delayed themselves  the words life and death seemed to be ringing constantly in their ears  but they spoke kindly to the poor woman and gave her nearly all their remaining stock of provisions reserving just enough for two days  ive travelled before now on short allowance said warder with a pitiful smile  were sure to come across something before long  if not we can travel empty for a bit  goot it vill make us lighter said winklemann with a grave nod  they parted from the woman and soon left her out of sight behind  she never reached the settlement  she and the child were afterwards found dead within a quarter of a mile of pembina  from the report of the party she had left this poor creature must have travelled upwards of a hundred miles in three days and nights before sinking in that terrible struggle for life  warder and his companion did not require to diverge in order to follow these tracks  they all ran one way straight for red riverfor home but there were many very many who never saw that home again  one exception they overtook on their fourth day  she was a middleaged woman but her visage was so wrinkled by wigwam smoke and she had such a stoop that she seemed very old indeed  why i know that figure exclaimed warder on sighting her its old liz michel rollins scotch mother  so it turned out  she was an eccentric creature full of life fire and fun excessively short and plain but remarkably strong  she had been forsaken by her nephew she said  michel dear michel would not have left her in the lurch if he had been there  but she would be at home to receive michel on his return  that she would  and she was right  she reached the settlement alive though terribly exhausted  warder and winklemann did not come across anything except one raven but they shot that and devoured it bones and all  then they travelled a day without food and without halt  next day they might reach the settlement if strength did not fail but when they lay down that night warder said he felt like going to die and winklemann said that his lecks were now useless and his lunks were entirely gone    chapter eleven  to the rescue  elsie and cora ravenshaw were seated at a table in willow creek with their mother and miss trim repairing garments one night in that same inclement january of which we have been writing  mr ravenshaw was enjoying his pipe by the stove and louis lambert was making himself agreeable  the old man was a little careworn  no news had yet been received of tony or of victor  in regard to the latter he felt easy victor could take care of himself and was in good company but his heart sank when he thought of his beloved tony  what would he not have given to have had him smashing his pipe or operating on his scalp at that moment  it is an awful winter observed elsie as a gust of wind seemed to nearly blow in the windows  i pity the hunters in the plains said cora  they say a rumour has come that they are starving  i heard of that but hope it is not true observed lambert  oh they always talk of starving said old ravenshaw  no fear of em  at that moment there was a sound of shuffling in the porch the door was thrown open and a gaunt haggard man with torn snowsprinkled garments pale face and bloodshot eyes stood pictured on the background of the dark porch  baptiste warder exclaimed lambert starting up  ay whats left o me and heres the remains o winklemann said warder pointing to the cadaverous face of the starving german who followed him  need we say that the hunters received a kindly welcome by the ravenshaw family as they sank exhausted into chairs  the story of starvation suffering and death was soon toldat least in outline  you are hungry  when did you eat last asked mr ravenshaw interrupting them  two days ago replied warder with a weary smile  it seems like two veeks observed the german with a sigh  hallo  elsie cora victuals cried the sympathetic old man turning quickly round  but elsie whose perceptions were quick had already placed bread and beer on the table  here have a drink of beer first said the host pouring out a foaming glass  warder shook his head  winklemann remarked that beer vas goot ver goot but they had been used to vatter of late  ah he added after devouring half a slice of bread while waiting for cora to prepare another blessed brod an booter  nobody can know vat it is till he have starve for two veekai mean two days all de same ting in my feel  the entrance of a huge bite put a sudden and full stop to the sentence  why did you not stop at some of the houses higher up the river to feed asked lambert  warder explained that they meant to have done so but they had missed their way  they had grown stupid he thought from weakness  when they lost the way they made straight for the river guided by the polestar and the first house they came in sight of was that of willow creek  how can the polestar guide one asked cora in some surprise  dont you know said lambert going round to where cora sat and sitting down beside her  i will explain  if i did know i wouldnt ask replied cora coquettishly besides i did not put the question to you  nay but you dont object to my answering it do you  not if you are quite sure you can do so correctly  i think i can but the doubts which you and your sister so often throw on my understanding make me almost doubt myself retorted lambert with a laughing glance at elsie  you must know then that there is a constellation named the great bear  it bears about as much resemblance to a bear as it does to a rattlesnake but thats what astronomers have called it  part of it is much more in the shape of a plough and one of the stars in that plough is the polestar  you can easily distinguish it when once you know how because two of the other stars are nearly in line with it and so are called pointers  when you stand looking at the polestar you are facing the north and of course when you know where the north is you can tell all the other points of the compass  it must not be supposed that the rest of the party listened to this astronomical lecture  the gallant louis had sought to interest elsie as well as cora but elsie was too much engrossed with the wayworn hunters and their sad tale to think of anything else  when they had eaten enough to check the fierce cravings of hunger they related more particulars  and now said warder sitting erect and stretching his long arms in the air as if the more to enjoy the delightful sensation of returning strength we have pushed on at the risk of our lives to save time this news must be carried at once to the governor  the company can help us best in a fix like this  of course of course i shall send word to him at once said his host  all right baptiste said lambert coming forward i expected youd want a messenger  here i am  black dicks in the stable  hell be in the cariole in ten minutes  what shall i say to the governor  ill go with you answered warder  so vill i said winklemann  youll do nothing of the sort retorted ravenshaw  you both need rest  a sound sleep will fit you to do your work more actively in the morning  i myself will go to the fort  only one can go at least in my cariole remarked lambert for it only holds two and no one can drive black dick but myself  baptiste warder was immoveable it ended in his going off in the cariole with lambert to inform the governor of the colony who was also chief of the hudsons bay company in red river and to rouse the settlement they had to pass the cottage of angus macdonald on the way  oh wow cried that excitable old settler when he heard the news can it pe possible  so many tead an tying  oh wowhere martha martha where iss that wuman  it iss always out of the way she iss when shes wantit  ay peegwish you will do equally well  go to the staple man an tell the poy to put the mare in the cariole  make him pe quick its slow he iss at the best whatever  lambert did not wait to hear the remarks of angus but drove off at once  angus put on his leather coat fut cap and mittens and otherwise prepared himself for a drive over the snowclad plains to fort garry where the governor dwelt intending to hear what was going to be done and offer his services  with similarly benevolent end in view old ravenshaw harnessed his horse and made for the same goal regardless alike of rheumatism age and inclement weather  at a certain point not far from the creek the old traders private track and that which led to the house of angus macdonald united and thereafter joined the main road which road by the way was itself a mere track beaten in the snow with barely room for two carioles to pass  now it so happened that the neighbours came up to the point of junction at the same moment  both were driving hard being eager and sympathetic about the sufferings of the plainhunters to have continued at the same pace would have been to insure a meeting and a crash  one must give way to the other  since the affair of the knoll these two men had studiously cut each other  they met every sabbath day in the same church and felt this to be incongruous as well as wrong  the son of the one was stolen by savages  the son of the other was doing his utmost to rescue the child  each regretted having quarrelled with the other but pride was a powerful influence in both what was to be done  time for thought was short for two fiery steeds were approaching each other at the rate of ten miles an hour  who was to give in  ill see both carioles smashed to atoms first thought ravenshaw grinding his teeth  shell tie first thought angus pursing his lips  the instinct of selfpreservation caused both to come to a dead and violent halt when within six yards of the meetingpoint  a happy thought burst upon angus at that instant  efter you sir he said with a palpable sneer at the same time backing his horse slightly  it was an expression of mock humility and would become an evidence of superior courtesy if ravenshaw should go insolently on  if on the other hand he should take it well a friendly reference to the roads or the weather would convert the sneer into a mere nasal tone  ah thanks thanks cried mr ravenshaw heartily as he drove past bad news that about the plainhunters  i suppose youve heard it  ay it iss pad newsferry pad news inteed mister ruvnshaw  it will pe goin to the fort ye are  yes the poor people will need all the help we can give them  they wull that oo ay  discourse being difficult in the circumstances they drove the remainder of the way in silence but each knew that the breach between them was healed and felt relieved  angus did not however imagine that he was any nearer to his desires regarding the knoll  full well did he understand and appreciate the unalterable nature of sam ravenshaws resolutions but he was pleased again to be at peace for to say truth he was not fond of war though ready to fight on the smallest provocation  baptiste warder was right in expecting that the company would lend their powerful aid to the rescue  the moment the governor heard of the disaster he took immediate and active steps for sending relief to the plains  clothing and provisions were packed up as fast as possible and party after party was sent out with these  but in the nature of things the relief was slow  we have said that some of the hunters and their families had followed the indians and buffalo to a distance of between 150 and 200 miles  the snow was now so deep that the only means of transport was by dogsledges  dogs being light and shortlimbed can travel where horses cannot but even dogs require a track and the only way of making one on the trackless prairie or in the forest is by means of a man on snowshoes who walks ahead of the dogs and thus beats the track  the men employed however were splendid and persevering walkers and their hearts were in the work  both samuel ravenshaw and angus macdonald gave liberally to the cause and each obtaining a team of dogs accompanied one of the relief parties in a dogcariole  if the reader were to harness four dogs to a slipperbath he would have a fair idea of a dogcariole and team louis lambert beat the track for old ravenshaw  he was a recognised suitor at willow creek by that time  the old gentleman was well accustomed to the dogcariole but to angus it was newat least in experience  it iss like as if she was goin to pathe he remarked with a grim smile on stepping into the machine and sitting down or rather reclining luxuriously among the buffalo robes  the dogs attempted to run away with him and succeeded for a hundred yards or so  then they got off the track and discovered that angus was heavy  then they stopped put out their tongues and looked humbly back for the driver to beat the track for them  a stout young halfbreed was the driver  he came up and led the way until they reached the open plains where a recent gale had swept away the soft snow and left a long stretch that was hard enough for the dogs to walk on without sinking  the team was fresh and lively  shed petter hold on to the tail suggested angus  the driver assented  he had already left the front and allowed the cariole to pass him in order to lay hold of the tailline and check the pace but the dogs were too sharp for him  they bolted again ran more than a mile overturned the cariole and threw its occupant on the snow after which they were brought up suddenly by a bush  on the way the travellers passed several others of the wealthy settlers who were going personally to the rescue  sympathy for the plainhunters was universal  every one lent a willing hand  the result was that the lives of hundreds were saved though many were lost  their sufferings were so great that some died on their road to the colony after being relieved at pembina  those found alive had devoured their horses dogs raw hides leather and their very moccasins  mr ravenshaw and his neighbour passed many corpses on the way two of which were scarcely cold  they also passed at various places above forty sufferers in seven or eight parties who were crawling along with great difficulty  to these they distributed the provisions they had brought with them  at last the hunters were all rescued and conveyed to the settlementone man with his wife and three children having been dug out of the snow where they had been buried for five days and nights  the woman and children recovered but the man died  soon after this sad event the winter began to exhibit unwonted signs of severity  it had begun earlier and continued later than usual  the snow averaged three feet deep in the plains and four feet in the woods and the cold was intense being frequently down to fortyfive degrees below zero of fahrenheits scale while the ice measured between five and six feet in thickness on the rivers  but the great significant and prevailing feature of that winter was snow  never within the memory of man had there been such heavy continuous persistent snow  it blocked up the windows so that men had constantly to clear a passage for daylight  it drifted up the doors so that they were continually cutting passages for themselves to the world outside  it covered the ground to such an extent that fences began to be obliterated and landmarks to disappear and it weighted the roofs down until some of the weaker among them bid fair to sink under the load  a severe winter was old mr ravenshaws usual morning remark as he went to the windows pipe in hand before breakfast  to which his better half invariably replied never saw anything like it before and miss trim remarked it is awful  it snows hardwhatever was angus macdonalds usual observation about the same hour  to which his humble and fast friend peegwishwho assisted in his kitchenwas wont to answer ho and glare solemnly as though to intimate that his thoughts were too deep for utterance  thus the winter passed away and when spring arrived it had to wage an unusually fierce conflict before it gained the final victory over ice and snow    chapter twelve  victory  but before that winter closed ay before it began a great victory was gained which merits special mention here  let us retrace our steps a little  one morning while ian macdonald was superintending the preparation of breakfast in some faraway part of the western wilderness and michel rollin was cutting firewood victor ravenshaw came rushing into camp with the eager announcement that he had seen the footprints of an enormous grizzly bear  at any time such news would have stirred the blood of ian but at that time when the autumn was nearly over and hope had almost died in the breast of our scholastic backwoodsman the news burst upon him with the thrilling force of an electric shock  now ian take your gun and go in and win said victor with enthusiasm for the youth had been infected with rollins spirit of gallantry  you see rollin had said to victor during a confidential teteatete ven a lady is in de case ye must bow de head  ian do love your sister  ver goot  your sister do vish for a barclaw collar ver goot  vell de chance turn up at lastvon grizzly bar do appear who do shot im  vy ian certaintly  mais it is pity he am so bominibly bad shot  victor being an unselfish fellow at once agreed to this hence his earnest advice that ian should take his gun and go in and win  but ian shook his head  my dear boy he said with a sigh its of no use my attempting to shoot a bear or anything else  i dont know what can be wrong with my vision i can see as clear and as far as the best of you and im not bad youll allow at following up a trail over hard ground but when it comes to squinting along the barrel of a gun im worse than useless its my belief that if i took aim at a haystack at thirty yards id miss it  no vic i must give up the idea of shooting altogether  what have you forgotten the saying faint heart never won fair lady exclaimed victor in surprise  nay lad my memory is not so short as that neither is my heart as faint as you seem to think it  i do intend to go in and win but i shall do it after a fashion of my own vic  rollin who came up at the moment and flung a bundle of sticks on the fire demanded to know what vas the vashion referred to  that i wont tell you at present boys said ian but if you have any regard for me youll make me a solemn promise not in any way to interfere with me or my plans unless you see me in actual and imminent danger of losing my life  jus so said rollin with a nod ye vill not step in to de reskoo till you is at de very last gasp  having obtained the requisite promise ian set off with his comrades to examine the bears track  there could be but one opinion as to the size of the grizzly which had made it  as victor had said it was enormous and showed that the animal had wandered about hither and thither as if it had been of an undecided temperament  moreover the track was quite fresh  of course there was much eager conversation about it among the friends carried on in subdued tones and whispers as if they feared that the bear might be listening in a neighbouring bush  after discussing the subject in every point of view and examining the tracks in every light they returned to the camp at victors suggestion to talk it over more fully and make preparations for the hunt  ian however cut short their deliberations by reminding his comrades of their promise and claiming the strict fulfilment of it  if this thing is to be undertaken by me he said i must have it all my own way and do the thing entirely by myself  nobody objects to your having it all your own way retorted victor somewhat testily but why should you be so secret about it  why not give a fellow some sort of idea what your plan is so that if we cant have the pleasure of helping you we may at least enjoy the comfort of thinking about it  no vic no  i wont give you a hint because my plan is entirely new and you would laugh at it at least it is new to me for i never heard of its having been attempted with grizzlies before though i have heard of it in connection with other bears  besides i may fail in which case the less that is known about my failure the better  only this much will i say the idea has been suggested to me by the formation of the land hereabouts  you know there is a gap or pass in the rocks just ahead of us through which the bear seems to have passed more than once in the course of his rambles  well that gap is the spot where i will make my attempt  if you follow me to that gap i will at once return to camp and let you manage the matter yourselves  well well do as you please said victor with a laugh and the sooner you set about it the better  rollin and i will ride away some miles in the opposite direction and see if we cant get hold of a wild goose for supper  ha perhaps de grizzly vill get hold of anoder and a vilder goose for supper said rollin with a shake of his head  when his companions had departed ian macdonald cleaned his gun carefully and loaded with ball then placing his axe in his belt beside his scalpingknife he proceeded with long and rapid strides towards the gap or pass above referred to  the bears track led through this pass which was a narrow cut not more than thirty feet wide in a steep rocky ridge with which the country at that place was intersected for a considerable distance  the ridge itself and the pass by which it was divided were thickly covered with trees and dense undergrowth  the floor of the pass was level although rugged and the rocks on either side rose in a sheer precipice so that whoever should attempt to penetrate without wings to the region beyond must needs go by that narrow cut  arrived at the middle of the pass where it was narrowest ian leant his gun against the precipice on one side took off his coat tucked up his sleeves grasped his axe and attacked a mighty tree  like ulysses of old he swung the axe with trenchant power and skill  huge chips flew circling round  ere long a goodly tree creaked groaned and finally fell with a crash upon the ground  it was tough work  ian heaved a sigh of satisfaction and wiped his streaming brow as he surveyed the fallen monarch  there was another king of the same size near to the opposite precipice which he felled in the same way  both monarchs mingled and severely injured their royal heads in the middle of the pass which thus became entirely blocked up for our woodsman had so managed that the trees fell right across it  next ian attacked the united heads and with great labour hewed a passage through them near to a spot where a large boulder lay selecting another forest king ian cut it so that one end of it fell on the boulder  the result of all this hewing and guiding of the falling monarchs was that the only available track through the pass was a hole about four feet in diameter with a tree of great weight suspended above it by the boulder  to chop off the branches and convert this latter tree into a log did not take long  neither did it take much time or exertion to fashion a sort of support or trigger in the shape of a figure 4 immediately under the log so as to obstruct the hole before mentioned  but to lower the log gently from the boulder on to this trigger without setting it off was a matter of extreme difficulty requiring great care and much time for the weight of the log was great and if it should once slip to the ground ten ian macdonalds could not have raised it up again  it was accomplished at last however and several additional heavy logs were leaned upon the main one to increase its weight  if he returns this way at all he will come in the evening muttered ian to himself as he sat down on a stump and surveyed his handiwork with a smile of satisfaction  but perhaps he may not come back till morning in which case i shall have to watch here all night and those impatient geese in the camp will be sure to disturb us on the plea that they feared i had been killedbah and perhaps he wont come at all  this last idea was not muttered it was only thought but the thought banished the smile of satisfaction from ians face  in a meditative mood he took up his gun refreshed the priming and slightly chipped the flint so as to sharpen its edge and make sure of its striking fire  by that time it was long past noon and the hunter was meditating the propriety of going to a neighbouring height to view the surrounding country when a slight noise attracted his attention  he started cocked his gun glared round in all directions and held his breath  the noise was not repeated  gradually the frown of his brows melted the glare of his eyes abated the tension of his muscles was relaxed and his highlywrought feelings escaped in a longdrawn sigh  pshaw twas nothing  no bear in its senses would roam about at such an hour considering the row i have been kicking up with hacking and crashing  come ill go to the top of that crag and have a look round  he put on his coat and belt stuck his axe and knife into the latter shouldered his gun and went nimbly up the rocky ascent on his left  coming out on a clear spot at the crag which had attracted him he could see the whole pass beneath him except the spot where his trap had been laid  that portion was vexatiously hidden by an intervening clump of bushes  next moment he was petrified so to speak by the sight of a grizzly bear sauntering slowly down the pass as if in the enjoyment of an afternoon stroll  no power on earthexcept perhaps a glance from elsiecould have unpetrified ian macdonald at that moment  he stood in the halfcrouching attitude of one about to spring over the cliff absolutely motionlesswith eyes mouth and nostrils wide open as if to afford free egress to his spirit  not until the bear had passed slowly out of sight behind the intervening bushes was he disenchanted  then indeed he leaped up like a startled deer turned sharp round and bounded back the way he had come with as much caution and as little noise as was compatible with such vigorous action  before he had retraced his steps ten yards however he heard a crash well did he know what had caused it  his heart got into his threat somehow  swallowing it with much difficulty he ran on but a roar such as was never uttered by human lungs almost stopped his circulation  a few seconds brought ian within view of his trap and what a sight presented itself  a grizzly bear which seemed to him the hugest as it certainly was at that moment the fiercest that ever roamed the rocky mountains was struggling furiously under the weight of the ponderous tree with its superincumbent load of logs  the monster had been caught by the small of the backif such a back can be said to have possessed a small of any kindand its rage mingled as it must have been with surprise was awful to witness  the whole framework of the ponderous trap trembled and shook under the influence of the animals writhings  heavy though it was the bear shook it so powerfully at each spasm of rage that it was plainly too weak to hold him long  in the event of his breaking out death to the trapper was inevitable  ian did not hesitate an instant  his chief fear at the moment was that his comrades at the camp might have heard the roaringdistant though they were from the spotand might arrive in time to spoil by sharing his victory  victory  another struggle such as that and victory would have rested with the bear  ian resolved to make sure work  he would put missing out of the question  the tremendous claws that had already worked a small pit in the earth reminded him of the collar and of elsie  leaping forward he thrust the point of his gun into the ear of the infuriated animal and pulled the trigger  he was almost stunned by the report and roar together with an unwonted shock that sent him reeling backward  we know not how a good twistbarrelled gun would behave if its muzzle were thus stopped but the common indian gun used on this occasion was not meant to be thus treated  it was blown to pieces and ian stood gazing in speechless surprise at the fragment of wood remaining in his hand  how far it had injured the bear he could not tell but the shot had not apparently abated its power one jot for it still heaved upwards in a paroxysm of rage and with such force as nearly to overthrow the complex erection that held it down  evidently there was no time to lose  ian drew his axe grasped it with both hands raised himself on tiptoe and brought it down with all his might on the bears neck  the grizzly bear is noted for tenacity of life  ian had not hit the neckbone  instead of succumbing to the tremendous blow it gave the handle of the axe a vicious twist with its paw which jerked the hunter violently to the ground  before he could recover himself the claws which he coveted so much were deep in his right thigh  his presence of mind did not forsake him even then  drawing his scalpingknife he wrenched himself round and twice buried the keen weapon to the haft in the bears side  just then an unwonted swimming sensation came over ian his great strength seemed suddenly to dissipate and the bear the claw collar even elsie faded utterly from his mind  the stars were shining brightly in the calm sky and twinkling with pleasant tranquillity down upon his upturned countenance when consciousness returned to ian macdonald  ah vic he murmured with a long sad sigh ive had such a splendid dream  come thats right old boy  here have another mouthful said victor holding a tin can to his friends lips  its only tea hot and strongthe best thing in the world to refresh a wounded man and after such a fight  what exclaimed ian starting and sitting bolt upright while he gazed in the faces of his two comrades  is it true  have i killed the thegrizzly  killed him exclaimed victor rising i should think you have  killed im echoed rollin  yous killed im two or tree time over vy yous axed im stabbed im shotted im busted im squashed im ho  am i much damaged inquired ian interrupting for he felt weak  oh nonoting whatsocomever  only few leetil holes in yous legs  be bedder in a veek  look here said victor kneeling beside the wounded man and presenting to him a piece of wood on which were neatly arranged a row of formidable claws  i knew you would like to see them  how good of you vic  it was thoughtful of you and kind  put them down before mea little nearerthereso  ian gazed in speechless admiration  it was not that he was vain of the achievement he was too sensible and unselfish for that but it was such a pleasure to think of being able after all and in spite of his bad shooting to present elsie with a set of claws that were greatly superior to those given to her mother by louis lambertthe finest in short that he had ever seen    chapter thirteen  a cunning device ends in failure followed by destruction  in a previous chapter it has been told how the long hard winter of that year 1826 had passed away after an unwontedly severe tussle with the spring  the prophets of the land now began to hold up their heads and look owlishly wise for their predictions were evidently about to be fulfilled  had not old sam ravenshaw said all through the winter that something would come of it  was it not the daily remark of angus macdonald that such a state of things could not go on for everwhatever  had not peegwish glared prophecy with a degree of solemnity that rendered words not only impossible but unnecessary and had not miss trim asserted that dreadful consequences of some sort were sure to follow  dreadful consequences did follow and they began with a fine warm day for a considerable time the fields of snow had been subjected to the influence of the blazing sun and had been greatly diminished in depth the day in question however was so very warm that louis lambert was induced to take his horse and gun with a view to wolfhunting on the plains  the hard crust formed on the snows surface by the partial meltings of early spring is sufficiently strong to bear the weight of a wolf but will not support a horse  wolves therefore roam about with ease and at will at that period while horses are obliged to keep to beaten tracks  when however the thaws set in the case is reversed the wolf with his short limbs flounders laboriously in the drifts of soft snow while the horse with his long and powerful legs can gallop in spite of these  thus wolfhunting becomes for a time possible  louis lambert was fond of the chase  he was also fond of courting and resolving to combine the two galloped away to the abode of old ravenshaw  he had been there so often of late that he felt half ashamed of this early morning visit  lovers easily find excuses for visits  he resolved to ask if herr winklemann had been seen passing that morning as he wished his companionship on the plainsthe shallow deceiver  goodmorning cora he said on entering the hall  elsie who stood at the window with her back to the door turned quickly round  oh i beg pardon he said with a slightly confused air i thought you were cora and  well interrupted elsie with a hurt look that accorded ill with a twinkle in her eyes i think you might know the difference between me and cora by this time though you only saw my back  ah elsie returned the youth as he shook hands you ought in fairness to make allowance for the effects of spring  you know full well that the glare of the sun on the snow half blinds a fellow so that even when when  come now dont search about in your empty brain for one of your unmeaning compliments but say at once what brings you here at so early an hour  has a war party of sioux come down on us or is the river about to break up  warparties of sioux are no doubt prowling about the plains somewhere returned lambert with a smile and the ice will go soon if this heat continues but neither of these things brought me here  the truth is i came to ask if winklemann has been seen to pass your windows this morning  the truth repeated elsie with a searching look  well replied the youth with a laugh i came also to see you and andcora  and father also i suppose  why elsie you are unusually sharp this morning but i really do wish to know if winklemann has been seen because he had left home when i passed his house and i want him to hunt with me  then i may tell you that he passed our window not ten minutes before your arrival going in the direction of the lower fort  he rides fast as you know so if you would catch him up you must follow quickly  the young man stood for a moment undecided then perceiving that elsie gave him no encouragement to remain he bade her adieu and rode away  louis is remarkably fond of coming here said elsie to cora who entered the room a few minutes later but he did not come to see us this morning  he only came to ask after herr winklemann  cora laughed but gave no further evidence of the state of her mind  just then peegwish the indian entered  he walked towards the sisters with that solemn dignity of manner peculiar to the north american savage but the intensified solemnity of his looks and a certain unsteadiness in his gait rather marred the dignity  peegwish said elsie going towards him with a grieved look you have been drinking beer again  the indian protested in very bad english that he had not tasted beer since the previous christmas whereupon elsie proceeded to administer an earnest reproof to the muddled hypocrite for she was really anxious to save him from the destruction which had already overtaken many of his red brethren through the baleful influence of firewater but peegwish was just then in no condition to appreciate her remarks  to all she said his only reply was that he wanted bally  you want bally returned elsie with a puzzled look  yisbally he repeated and a gleam of indescribable slyness broke like a sunbeam on his solemn visage as he said it  what can he mean by bally cora  perhaps he means barley  ho exclaimed the indian with emphasis by which he meant youre right  but elsie had no barley to give him  she tried to find out what he wanted to do with the barley but peegwish was not communicative  the gleam of cunning faded from his mahogany countenance and he relapsed into a state of impenetrable wisdom in which condition he retired and betook himself to the upper part of the settlement near fort garry in quest of bally  here he found the people in a state of considerable excitement owing to the sudden and unusual rise of the river  at fort garry the assinaboine river joins the red river and flows with it into lake winnipeg  at the period of which we write the month of may both rivers were yet covered with the icy garmentbetween four and five feet thickunder which they had gone to rest five or six months before  the vast accumulation of snow which had fallen that winter was melted so fast that the red river had risen with terrible rapidity and it was obvious from the ominous complainings of the thickribbed ice that a burstup of unwonted violence was impending the strength of the ice however was so great that it rose with the swelling waters without breaking until nearly on a level with the top of the river banks  in some places where the banks were low the pentup floods broke forth and swamped the land but as yet little damage had been done  of course the alarm of the settlers was considerable  rumours of former floods which had devastated the surrounding plains were rife and those of the people whose houses stood on the lower grounds began to remove their goods and chattels to higher places  others delayed doing so in the belief that the river would not rise much higher at all events that it would subside as soon as the ice broke up and cleared away to lake winnipeg  some there were whose dwellings stood on high ground and who professed to have no belief in floods at all  in other circumstances peegwish would have noted the state of things that prevailed but at that time his faculties were steeped in beer for some days past they had been in this condition but his supply was exhausted and people who knew his propensity refused to give him more peegwish therefore being a somewhat resolute savage resolved to adopt a course which would render him independent  chuckling to himself at the depth and cunning of his intended course of action he went among the farmers begging for bally  some to whom he appealed treated him facetiously others turned him away from their doors being too anxious about the impending flood to listen to him  at last he found a softhearted soul in the person of michel rollins mother old liz who dwelt in a very small loghut on a knoll at a considerable height above the river  what dee want wi the barley demanded old liz who besides being amiable had a feeling of kindness for the man with whom her absent son had for years been in the habit of hunting  to heat im replied the indian  to eat it echoed the sturdy little woman weel come in  i can spare some but dinna mak a noise daddys sleepin  the savage entered with solemn though wavering caution  old though she was liz had a living father  he was so very ancient that if he had dwelt in egypt he would probably have been taken for a live mummy  he sat in the chimney corner in an armchair to which liz had tied him to prevent his falling into the fire  he smiled and nodded at the fire when awake and snored and nodded at it when asleep  beyond this and a grateful recognition of his daughters attentions he did and said nothing  gazing at daddy peegwish fell into an owlish reverie from which he was aroused by old liz putting a small sack of barley on the ground before him  the indian received it with thanks threw it on his shoulder and with an expression of unalterable determination on his visage returned to his own home  the home of peegwish was dilapidated like himself  it stood on a portion of ground belonging to angus macdonald and was very near to the rivers brink  it was a mere logcabin of the smallest dimensions having one low door and one glassless window  the window also served the purpose of a chimney  its furniture was in keeping with its appearancea stool a couple of blankets two little heaps of brushwood for beds a kettle or two a bag of pemmican an old flint gun two pairs of snowshoes a pair of canoepaddles a couple of very dirty bundles and an old female  the latter was the dirtiest piece of furniture in the establishment  she was sister to peegwish and was named by him wildcat  despite appearances the hut was comfortably warm for wildcatwho to do her justice had been grossly misnamedwas fond of heat  she devoted the chief part of her existence to the collection of fuel most of the remainder being spent in making moccasins etcetera and cooking  put on the pot wildcat said peegwish on entering as he threw down the sack of barley  the woman obeyed with alacrity  the fire burned on the earthen floor in primitive style  erecting three sticks over it in the tripod form she hung a pot therefrom filled it with water and awaited further orders knowing her brothers cast of mind well she refrained from questioning though she perceived from the peculiar cunning of his looks that something unusual occupied his mind  peegwish saw that wildcats curiosity was aroused and resolved to keep it in that condition  he had learned the fact that beer was made from barley and had resolved thenceforth to brew his own beer but no hint of this did he permit to escape him  he even went to the other extreme and became unusually communicative on subjects remote from beer  he told how that the people up the river were being frightened by the rise in the water how he had met lambert and winklemann going to hunt wolves how these nimrods had been obliged to change their minds and turn back for the purpose of looking after their property and in short he wandered as far from the subject of beer and brewing as possible  his reference to the rise of the river however turned wildcats thoughts to the fact that the ice in their immediate neighbourhood had been forced up in a manner that caused her some anxiety  she mentioned her fears to peegwish but that worthy was too deeply immersed in his experiments just then to care much for anything else  to her remarks he merely replied by a solemn shake of the head and an owlish gaze into the big pot  soon the water in the pot began to boil  peegwish put in a large proportion of barley lighted his pipe and sat down to await the result with the patience of a stoic  wildcat sat beside him with equal patience  an hour passed peegwish dipped a wooden spoon into the pot and tasted  the result was not satisfactoryit burnt his lips  he let the spoonful cool and tried again  the liquid was marvellously like barleybroth with which delicacy he was well acquainted  another hour passed again he dipped the spoon and again met with disappointment for his brew was not yet beer  the sun went down the moon arose the stars came out and still peegwish and wildcat sat watching and dozing over the big pot  at last the former bade the latter watch alone while he slept  he lay back where he sat and slumbered instantly  wildcat obeyed orders by heaping fresh logs on the fire and following suit  they snored in concert  the night advanced the uneasy grindings of the ice increased the tinkling of a thousand snowborn rills filled the air with liquid melody  the subglacial murmuring of many waters filled many hearts with anxious care and numerous households near the rivers brink sat up the livelong night to watchperhaps to pray  intermittent cracking of the ice kept up the sound as it were of spattering musketry and occasional loud reports were interspersed like the thunder of heavy guns  at grey dawn peegwish awoke looked slowly round observed his sister asleep and seized her by the nose  she awoke rose hastily and stirred the fire  an inspection of the big pot showed that its contents had become barley porridge  even peegwishs imagination failed to regard it as beer  but peegwish had been somewhat sobered by his sleep hearing the ominous sounds on the river he jumped up and ran outside the sight that presented itself was sufficiently alarming  during the night the water had risen six feet and the ice had been raised to a level with the floor of the indians hut  but this was not the worst a short tongue of land just above the hut had up to that time formed a sort of breakwater to the dwelling  now however the ice had been forced quite over the barrier by the irresistible pressure behind and even while he gazed a great wedge of ice nearly five feet thick and several yards in length was being reared up like a glittering obelisk and forced slowly but surely down upon the hut  peegwish had not recovered from his first surprise when the obelisk broke off by its own weight and fell in a mass of ruins whilst the ice behind kept thrusting with terrible force towards him  if peegwish was sluggish by nature his malady was evidently not incurable  he uttered a shout and leaped back into his hut like a panther  his sister came out gave one glance at the river became wildcattish for the first time in her life and sprang after her brother  a few seconds later and the pair reappeared bearing some of their poor possessions to a place of safety higher up the bank  they returned for more and in a very few minutes had the whole of their worldly wealth removed from their doomed edifice  then they sat down on the bank and sadly watched the destruction of their home  from their point of view they could see that the main body of ice on the river was still unbroken and that it was merely a huge tongue or needle which had been thrust up at that point by the form of the land above referred to  the shattered masses were soon forced against the side of the hut  there was a slight pause and a creaking of timbers then the ice slipped upwards and rose above the roof  more ice came down from aboveslowly grinding  again there was a pause  the creaking timbers began to groan the hut leaned gently over  one of the doorposts snapped the other sloped inwards the roof collapsed the sides went in the ice passed over all and the hut of peegwish was finally obliterated from off the face of the earth  so a giant with his foot might slowly and effectually crush the mansion of a snail    chapter fourteen  the flood begins to do its work  it is very sad that the hut of poor peegwish has been carried away observed miss martha macdonald while presiding at the breakfasttable  yes it iss fery sad responded angus macdonald in a somewhat unamiable tone but it iss more sad that he will pe living in our kitchen now for that wuman wildcat must pe there too and it iss not coot for wildcat to live in the kitchen  she will pe too fond of the kitchen altogether an she will pe a greater thief than our own cawtie for she is more omniferous an not so easy to scare  but cook is as good as a weasel at watching cats returned martha with a smile and it is reason we have to be thankful we have no heavier trouble angus for many of the people up the river are driven out of their houses  what you say iss true martha  just pefore breakfast i met that cherman crater winklemann ridin to the missionhouse for help  the ice would pe scrapin the end of his gardin he was tellin me an if the ruver would pe risin another fut it would come into the house  he says the people are goin off to the mountain like flocks of sheep carryin their coots and trivin their cattle pefore them  it is fery pad times whatever  in the parlour of willow creek house the breakfast party enlarged on the same theme  things look serious observed samuel ravenshaw as he commenced his third egg  if the water rises at this rate much longer not only the houses that stand low on the river banks but the whole settlement will be in danger  it is said that four houses and a barn were swept away last night by the force of the ice somewhere above the mission premises and that about sixty people slept in the church  it is well that our house stands high said mrs ravenshaw  dont you think sam that we might have the barn prepared in case some of our neighbours have to leave their houses  the barn is ready mother said elsie  father and i have been arranging it all the morning with the aid of peegwish poor fellow who has been sent to us by macdonald  ay and its as trim as an hospital added mr ravenshaw but i hope it wont be wanted  the ice is now clearing away  when it is gone the river will be sure to falltell the boy to saddle the horse cora continued the old gentleman attacking his fourth egg  i shall ride up to see how winklemann gets on  lambert is helping him  is lamberts own house safe asked elsie with a glance at her sister  safe enough just now replied her father for it stands much higher and further back  dont forget old liz rollin said elsie  her hut stands high but if things get worse she will be in danger and there is no one to look after her you know  no fear of my forgetting the mother of the man who is helping to search for my dear boy returned ravenshaw besides old liz is not without friends  both louis and winklemann have promised to keep their eyes on her  this reference to the mother of michel rollin turned the thoughts of the party into a channel that was very familiar for the lost tony and his brother were seldom absent from their thoughts  of late however they had ceased to talk much of the absent ones because as months flew by without any tidings their anxieties increased and as their fears increased they felt less inclined to talk hopefully  long before the breaking up of the ice mr ravenshaw had sent off an expedition at his own cost in search of the searchers  it consisted of a trusty indian and two halfbreeds  they were to cross the plains towards the saskatchewan district and make inquiries among the furtraders there but nothing had yet been heard of them and although the face and figure of tony were never absent from the old mans memory his name was not now so frequently on his lips  a sigh from miss trim revealed clearly the nature of her thoughts poor miss trim  her occupation was almost gone since tonys disappearance  besides losing the terrible and specific task of teaching tony his lessons the amiable lady had lost the general duty of keeping tony in order putting right what tony had put wrong and generally undoing what tony did  she also missed painfully those little daily attentions to her hands and shins which were rendered necessary in consequence of tonys activity with his nails and the toes of his boots to say nothing of his teeth  for many weeks pastit seemed to her yearsmiss trim had not bandaged a cut or fomented a bruise or mollified a scratch with ointment  she absolutely felt as though she had suffered bereavement  the silence which had descended on the breakfasttable was not broken until mr ravenshaws horse was reported ready at the door  on his way to the main road the old gentleman had to pass close to the summerhouse on the knoll so much coveted by angus macdonald  there he reined up a few minutes  the position commanded an extensive view and the aspect of the river was sufficiently alarming  the ice which by that time had broken up was rolling and crashing along with inconceivable force before the impetuous torrent  the water had risen to such a height that the lower lands were completely inundated  that it was still rising was made obvious by the fact that the rolling masses at the riversides were being thrust higher and higher on obstructing points carrying bushes and trees before them  even while he gazed a lofty elm that grew on a low part of angus macdonalds property was overthrown as if it had been a mere twig and swept away  several young maple and oak trees further down shared the same fate a few minutes later  the house of angus was full in view  it occupied a mound nearly though not quite as high as the knoll on which he stood and was still like his own dwelling far above the reach of the raging flood  the spot where the hut of peegwish had stood was by that time deep below the surface of the icetorrent  mr ravenshaw did not remain long in contemplation  the weather which had been stormy became suddenly cold and a blinding fall of sleet induced him to button his greatcoat up to the chin as he hastened away  arriving at the mission station after a gallop of several miles he found a state of things which almost beggars description  men women and children were hurrying to and fro laden with their chief valuables or driving carts loaded with household goods which they deposited on the mission premises for safety preparatory to the desertion of houses which was expected to take place on the morrow  goods of every description were scattered about in wild confusion for many of the people were half mad with alarm  the missionary with his assistants was doing his best to reduce the chaos to order  farther up the river mr ravenshaw encountered herr winklemann bearing a huge armchair on his shoulders  mine hause is toomed he said  doomed  i hope not  where are you going with the chair  to zee hause of old liz  without waiting for a rejoinder the stout german hurried on and was soon lost to view among the bushes  ravenshaw followed him shortly afterwards and found old liz arranging and piling away the belongings of winklemann who after depositing the armchair by the side of the fire opposite the corner occupied by daddy had returned to his doomed house for more  anxious to know in what condition his friends house was the old gentleman took the road to it  the house of old liz as we have said stood high and well back from the river  it had been made a place of refuge by the nearest neighbours and was not only filled but surrounded by goods and furniture as well as live stock  a dense mass of willow bushes by which the little hut was surrounded completely shut out the view all round except backward in the direction of the prairie so that ravenshaw did not come in sight of the spot where the flood had already commenced its work of destruction until he had traversed a footpath for nearly a quarter of a mile  many wet and weary settlers passed him however with their possessions on their backs and here and there groups of women and children to all of whom he gave a cheering word of hope and encouragement  on clearing the bushes the full extent of desolation was presented to view  the river here had overflowed its banks so that a large part of the country wore the aspect of a lake  knolls and slight eminences which in happier times had been scarcely observable now stood boldly out as conspicuous islets while many farmhouses were either partly submerged or stood on the margin of the rising waters which beat against them  there was a strong current in some places elsewhere it was calm but the river itself was clearly traceable by the turmoil of crashing ice and surging water which marked its course  men and women were seen everywherein the water and out of itloading carts or barrows with their property and old people with children looked on and shivered for the thermometer had fallen to five degrees below the freezingpoint of fahrenheits scale as indicated by the thermometer at the parsonage the sleet had ceased and the wind had fallen but dark masses of clouds hurried athwart the lowering sky and the dreary character of the scene was heightened by the poor cattle which being turned out of their warm places of shelter stood on knolls or in the water and lowed piteously  one of the most conspicuous objects of the scene from ravenshaws point of view was poor winklemanns housea small one which stood on a low spot already surrounded by water  in front of it was winklemann himself wading through the flood without coat or hat and carrying a large bundle in his arms  what have you got there asked ravenshaw as german went staggering past  mine moder he replied and hurried on  herr winklemann had a motheras old as the hills according to his own report and any one who beheld her feeble frame and wrinkled visage might well have believed him  with tender regard for her welfare her stout son had refrained from removing or even alarming her until the last moment partly from fear that fright and the removal might do her serious injury and partly from the hope that the flood had reached its highest point but when the danger to his dwelling became great he resolved to carry her to the hut of old liz and as a preliminary step had removed her old armchair as we have seen to be ready for her reception  on returning to the house however he found that a portion of the river bank above had unexpectedly given way diverging the flood a little in that part so that his dwelling was already a foot deep in water  the old woman however lay safely on the bed where winklemann had placed her and was either unconscious of or indifferent to what was going on  she did indeed look a little surprised when her son wrapped the blanket on which she lay completely round her and took her up in his arms as if she had been a little child but the look of surprise melted into a humorous smile as he drew the last fold over her face  she clearly believed it to be one of her dear boys little practical jokes and submitted without a murmur  staggering through the flood with her as we have said winklemann carried her to the cottage of old liz who received her with tender care helped to place her in the big chair and remembering daddys tendency to fall into the fire tied her securely therein  meanwhile winklemann ran back to his house where he found mr ravenshaw and louis lambert assisting several men to secure it on its foundations by tying it with ropes to the nearest trees  joining these he lent his powerful aid but a power greater than his was at work which could not be resisted  not only did the water rise at an alarming rate and rush against the house with tremendous violence but great cakes of ice bore down on it and struck it with such force as to make every timber tremble  like all the other houses of the settlement it was built entirely of wood and had no other foundation than the levelled ground on which its framework stood  when the water rose considerably above his knees and icefloes threatened to sweep him away mr ravenshaw thought it was time for an elderly gentleman to retire  the others continued for some time longer securing the ropes and with poles turning aside the ice but ere long they also were driven to the higher ground and compelled to stand idly by and watch the work of destruction  youve got everything out i fancy asked lambert  everyting replied winklemann with a deep sigh noting is left but zee hause  an that wont be left long observed mr ravenshaw as a huge mass of ice went against its gableend like a batteringram  it seemed to be the leader of a fresh battalion of the destroyer  a succession of icefloes ran against the house and trees to which it was fastened  an additional rush of water came down at the same time like a wave of the sea  every one saw that the approaching power was irresistible  the wave with its iceladen crest absolutely roared as it engulfed the bushes  two goodly elms bowed their heads into the flood and snapped off  the ropes parted like packthread the building slewed round reeled for a moment with a drunken air caught on a shallow spot and hung there  ach mine goot old hausefarvell exclaimed winklemann in tones of deepest pathos  the house bowed as if in recognition of the old familiar voice sloped into deeper water gurgled out its latest breath like a living thing through its doors and windows and sank beneath the wreck and ruin of its old surroundings  it was what men aptly term a clean sweep but winklemanns was not the only house that succumbed to the flood on that occasion  many besides himself were rendered homeless  that night the 4th of may the waters rose four feet and the settlers even on the higher grounds began to think of flight    chapter fifteen  the flood continues to do its work  rapidly and steadily did the waters of the red river rise until overflowing all their banks they spread out into the plains and gradually settler after settler retired before the deluge each forsaking his home at the last moment and going off in quest of higher ground with his cattle and property  these high places were not numerous for the whole region was very level  many settlers discovered at that time a number of features in the colony which had been unrecognised before and found refuge on spots which had never been observed as lying above the dead level of the plains  even these spots were not all safe  many of them were speedily submerged and those who had fled to them sought refuge on the still higher knolls which soon became inconveniently crowded  some miles from the river there was an elevation of ground named the little mountain and to this many of the people repaired  it was about as deserving of its title as is a molehill nevertheless it proved a safe asylum in the end  louis lambert was driven from his home the day after that on which the house of his friend winklemann was destroyed  his house was a stout one of two storeys and owing to its position was less exposed to the current of the flood than many other dwellings  confident of its strength and the security of its position its owner had carried all his goods and furniture to the upper storey but on returning after assisting his friend he found the water in it so high that he feared it might be set afloatas some of the houses had already beenand finally made up his mind to remove  but where should he remove to  that was the question  to zee hause of old liz observed his friend  it is close to hand an zere is yet room  this was true but lamberts inclinations turned in the direction of willow creek he therefore protested there was not room  no no he said its not fair to crowd round old liz as we are doing  ill ride down to ravenshaws and see if there is room on his ground to place my property  there will be plenty of time  even if the water should go on rising which i hope it wont my house cant float for many hours  meanwhile if youll fetch round the boat and place some of the heavy goods in it youll be doing me a good turn  vell vell muttered the german as he looked after his friend with a quiet smile and a shake of the head dere is no madness like lof  ven a man falls in lof he becomes blind qvite blind  the blind one meanwhile mounted his steed and galloped away on the wings of lof  lambert was a reckless rider and an impatient though goodnatured fellow  he dashed at full speed through shallow places where the floods were creeping with insidious tidelike persistency over the farmlands and forded some of the creeks which almost rendered swimming unavoidable but in spite of his daring he was compelled to make many a vexatious detour in his headlong course down to willow creek  on the way his mind preoccupied though it was could not escape being much affected by the scenes of devastation through which he passed  everywhere near the river houses were to be seen standing several feet deep in water while their owners were either engaged in conveying their contents in boats and canoes to the nearest eminences or removing them from such eminences in carts to spots of greater security  some of the owners of these deserted houses had become so reckless or so despairing under their misfortunes that they offered to sell them for merely nominal sums  it is said that some of them changed hands for so small a sum as thirty shillings or two pounds  cantering round the corner of a fence lambert came within a hundred yards of a house round which the water was deep enough to float a large boat  here he observed his friends john flett and david mowat embarking household goods into a large canoe out of the parlour window riding into the water lambert hailed them  hallo flett dee want help  thank ee no this is the last load  got all the rest down to the church the minister is lettin us stow things in the loft  youre in too great haste flett returned lambert  the water cant rise much higher your place is sure to stand  not so sure o that louis theres a report brought in by a redskin that all the country between the sources of the assinaboine and missouri is turned into a sea and the waters o the missouri itself are passing down to lake winnipeg  he says too that a whole village of redskins has been swept away  bah its not true said lambert  true or false rejoined flett resuming his work its time for me to clear out o this  forsaking the road which he had hitherto attempted to follow lambert now stretched out at full gallop into the plains  he came to a small creek and found that the simple wooden bridge had been washed away and that the waters of the river were driving its tiny current in the wrong direction  in a fit of impatience he applied the whip to his steed which being a fiery one rushed furiously at the creek  fire does not necessarily give an untrained horse power to leap  the animal made an awkward attempt to stop failed made a still more awkward attempt to jump failed again and stumbled headlong into the creek out of which he and his master scrambled on the opposite side  lambert shook himself laughed leaped into the saddle and went off again at full speed  he came to the mission station but did not stop there  it still stood high above the waters and was crowded with settlers  not far from it was a spot of rising ground which was covered with more than a hundred tents and wigwams belonging to canadian and halfbreed families  passing on he came upon other scenes of destruction and finally arrived at the abode of old mr ravenshaw  it like the mission premises still stood high above the rising flood  the family were assembled in the chief sittingroom old ravenshaw enjoying a pipe while the ladies were variously occupied around him  youve heard the report brought by the indian about the flood i fancy  oh yes but i give no ear to reports said the old gentleman emitting an indignant puff of smoke they often end like that  true nevertheless its as well to be prepared said lambert with a glance at elsie and cora who sat together near the window and ive come to beg for houseroom for my goods and chattels for the old house is not so safe as i had thought  theres plenty of room in the barn for people in distress said elsie with a glance at her sister  or in the cowhouse added cora with a laugh and a slight toss of her head weve had the cattle removed on purpose to make room for you  how considerate  and the cowhouse of willow creek with its pleasant associations is a palace compared to the hall of any other mansion said the gallant louis  a crash was heard outside just then  on looking from the windows a great cake of ice about five feet thick with a point like a church spire was seen attempting as it were to leap the lower end of the gardenfence  it failed but on making a second attempt was more successful  the fence went slowly down and the spire laid its head among the vegetables or rather on the spot where the vegetables would have been had the season been propitious  it was accompanied by a rush of water  the sight was viewed with comparative composure by old mr ravenshaw but his better half took it less quietly and declared that they would all be drowned  i hope not exclaimed miss trim fervently clasping her hands  were high and dry just now louis said mr ravenshaw gravely but willow creek wont be a place of refuge long if the rise goes on at this rate  see my neighbour is beginning to show signs of uneasiness though the ground on which he stands is not much lower than my own  as he spoke the old furtrader pointed to the house of angus macdonald where a large cart was being loaded with his property  angus himself entered at the moment to beg leave to remove some of his valuables to his friends barn  it iss not the danger you see muster ruvnshaw that troubles me it iss the watter  there are some things as the leddies fery well know will pe quite destroyed py watter an it is puttin them out of harms way that i will pe after  put whatever you like in the barn macdonald said mr ravenshaw promptly elsie and i have had it and the other outhouses prepared you are heartily welcome  i hope however that the water wont rise much higher  the watter will rise higher muster ruvnshaw returned angus with the decision of an oracle an it will pe goot for us if it will leave our houses standin where they are  peegwish will be tellin me that an peegwish knows what he iss apout when he is not trunk whatever  peegwish did indeed know what he was about  at the very time that angus was speaking about him peegwish feeling convinced that macdonalds house was in danger was on his way to the mission station which he knew to be a place of greater safety and where he felt sure of a welcome for the reverend mr cockranin charge at the timehad a weakness for the old hypocrite and entertained strong hopes of bringing about his reformation  for two days he stayed in the parsonage kitchen smoking his pipe revelling in the odds and ends such as knucklebones stray bits of fat and tripe which fell to his lot and proudly exhibiting himself in one of the ministers castoff black coats which contrasted rather oddly with a pair of ornamented blue leggings and a scarlet sash  when not busy in the kitchen he went about among the homeless settlers assembled round the mission sometimes rendering a little help oftener causing a good deal of obstruction and vainly endeavouring to obtain beer while he meditated sadly now and then on his failure in the brewing line  at the end of these two days however a great change took place at the mission station for the flood continued steadily to increase until it reached the church and parsonage and drove the hundreds of people who had assembled there away to the more distant knolls on the plains  mr cockran with his household and sabbath scholars besides a few of the people resolved to stick to the church as long as it should stick to the ground and peegwish remained with them  he had unbounded confidence in the good missionary and still more unbounded confidence in the resources of the parsonage kitchen  wildcat was similarly impressed  at last the water rose to the church itself and beat against the foundations of the parsonage for the current was very strong and had carried away some of the fences  all the people were thus obliged to take refuge in the church itself or in the parsonage  on the 13th of may there were very few dry spots visible on or near the banks of the red river  dozens of houses had been carried away and were either destroyed or stranded on localities far from their original sites  as far as the eye could reach the whole region had been converted into a mighty lake or rather sea for in the direction of the plains the waters seemed to join the horizon  everywhere this sea was studded with islets and knolls which grew fewer and smaller as the floods increased  here and there piles of floating firewood looked like boats with squaresails in the distance while deserted huts passed over the plains with the stream like fleets of noahs arks  when the water began to touch the parsonage its owner gave orders to collect timber and make preparation for the erection of a strong stage as a final place of refuge  come said he to peegwish when his orders were being carried out come get your canoe peegwish and we will pay a visit to the poor fellows on the knoll up the river  the indian waded to a spot close by where his canoe was fastened to a post and brought it to the door after the fashion of a gondolier of venice  the faithful wildcat took the bow paddle the clergyman stepped into the middle of the craft and sat down  they shot swiftly away and were soon out of sight  the day was calm and warm but the sky had a lurid heavy appearance which seemed to indicate the approach of bad weather  paddling carefully along to avoid running against sunk fences they soon came into the open plains and felt as though they had passed out upon the broad bosom of lake winnipeg itself  far up the riverwhose course was by that time chiefly discernible by empty houses and trees as well as bushes halfsubmergedthey came in sight of a stage which had been erected beside a cottage  it stood only eighteen inches out of the water and here several women and children were found engaged in singing watts hymns  they seemed quite comfortable under a sort of tarpaulin tent with plenty to eat and declined to be taken off though their visitors offered to remove them one at a time the canoe being unable to take more  further up the voyagers came to the hut of old liz  this hut was by that time so nearly touched by the water that all the people who had formerly crowded round it had forsaken it and made for the socalled mountain  only liz herself remained and herr winklemann to take care of their respective parents  do you think it safe to stay asked the clergyman as he was about to leave  safe ya qvite safe  besides i have big canoe vich can holt us all  goodbye then and remember if you want anything that i can give you just paddle down to the station and ask for it  say i sent you  ya i vill go down said herr winklemann gratefully  and herr winklemann did go down much to his own subsequent discomfiture and sorrow as we shall see  meanwhile mr cockran reached the knoll which he had set out to visit it was of considerable extent and crowded with a very miscellaneous noisy and quarrelsome crew of all sorts ages and colours in tents and wigwams and extemporised shelters  they received the clergyman heartily however and were much benefited by his visit as was made apparent by the complete though temporary cessation of quarrelling  the elements however began to quarrel that evening  mr cockran had intended to return home but a gale of contrary wind stopped him and he was fain to accept the hospitality of a farmers tent  that night the storm raged with fury  thunder and lightning added to the grandeur as well as to the discomfort of the scene  some time after midnight a gust of wind of extreme fury threw down the farmers tent and the pole hit the farmer on the nose  thus rudely roused he sprang up and accidentally knocked down peegwish who happened to be in his way  they both fell on the minister who being a powerful man caught them in a bearlike grasp and held them under the impression that they had overturned the tent in a quarrel while he was asleep  at that moment a cry of fire was raised  it was found that a spark from a tent which stood on the windward side of the camp had caught the long grass and a terrestrial conflagration was added to the celestial commotions of the night  it was a moment of extreme peril for the old grass was plentiful and sufficiently dry to burn  it is probable that the whole camp would have been destroyed but for a providential deluge of rain which fell at the time and effectually put the fire out  of course mr cockran became very anxious about those he had left at home for the storm had increased the danger of their position considerably  happily with the dawn the gale moderated  the improvement did not indeed render canoeing safe for the whitecrested waves of that temporary sea still lashed the shores of the newmade islet but the case was urgent therefore the clergyman launched his canoe and with peegwish and the faithful wildcat steered for the station    chapter sixteen  winklemann and old liz get into trouble  at the parsonage before the storm had fairly begun the canoe party was thought of with considerable anxiety for mrs cockran knew how frail the craft was in which her husband had embarked and among the sixtythree persons who had taken refuge with her not one was capable of taking command of the rest in a case of emergency  great therefore was her satisfaction when herr winklemann appeared in his canoe with a request for a barrel of flour  you shall have one said mrs cockran and anything else you may require but pray do not leave me tonight  i can give you a comfortable bed and will let you go the moment my husband returns  i fully expect him this evening  madam answered the gallant winklemann with a perplexed look you is vere goot bot de gale vill be rise qvickly an i dares not leaf mine moder vidout protection  oh but just stay for an hour or two entreated mrs cockran and show the people how to go on with the stage  perhaps my husband may return sooner than we expect  perhaps the storm may not come on many such threatenings you know come to nothing  winklemann looked anxiously up at the sky and shook his head but the entreaties of the lady prevailed  the goodnatured german consented to remain for a ver leetle time and at once set about urging on and directing the erection of the stage  this stage was planned to be a substantial platform about thirty feet square supported on posts firmly driven into the ground so that the water might pass freely under it in the event of the parsonage becoming untenable it would form a refuge of comparative safety  it was while winklemann was busily engaged on the stage that the storm broke forth which compelled the clergyman to spend the night on the islet as already described  of course the storm also forced winklemann to remain at the station  but that impulsive youths regard for his moder would not permit of his giving in without a struggle  when he saw that the gale increased rapidly he resolved to start off without delay  he launched his canoe a halfbreed in his employment managed the bow paddle but they found that their united strength was insufficient to drive the craft more than a hundred yards against wind and waves  returning to the station winklemann engaged two additional men to aid him but the increasing gale neutralised the extra force after a vain struggle the canoe was hurled back on the knoll a wave caught the bow overturned it and threw the men into the water at the very door of the parsonage  the canoe was partially broken  time was required to repair it  time also gave the gale opportunity to gather power and thus the chafing german was compelled to spend the night at the station  meanwhile those men whom he had left behind him spent a terrible night but the brunt of the trouble fell upon old liz  poor old liz  she was a squat piece of indomitable energy utterly regardless of herself and earnestly solicitous about every one else  when the storm commenced her dwelling had begun to show symptoms of instability  this fact she carefully concealed from daddy and old mrs winklemann who remained in their respective chairs smiling at each other for both were accustomed to good treatment from their children and regarded life in general from a sunny point of view  they knew that something very unusual was going on but the old frau saidor thought to herself my boy will look after me while daddy said or thought liz knows all about it  happy trustful spirits  enviable pair  having informed the pair that she was going away for a minute or two to look after something outside old liz left them  she found herself up to the knees in water of course the moment she passed the doorway from an outhouse she procured a strong rope  this she fastened to a large iron ring in the side of the hut and attached the other end to a thick tree whose branches overshadowed it  even during the brief time she was thus engaged the flood increased so rapidly and the rising wind blew so wildly that the poor creature was almost carried off her short legs  but old liz had a powerful will and was stronghearted  having accomplished her object and lost for ever her frilled cap in so doing she struggled back towards the door of the hut  a passing billet of firewood tripped her up and sent her headlong into the flood  she disappeared but emerged instantly with glaring eyes gasping mouth and streaming hair  a resolute rush brought her to the doorstep she seized the doorpost and was saved  hech but its an awfu time gasped old liz as she wrung the water from her garmentscomin daddy  ill be their this meenit  ive gotten mysel a wee wat  whats wrang asked daddy in a feeble voice as his ancient daughter entered  its only a bit spate daddy  the hoose is amaist soomin but yeve nae need to fear  im no feared liz  what wad i be feared o whan yere there  ver is mine boy demanded old mrs winklemann looking round  hes gane to the kirk for floor  neer fash yer heed aboot him hell be back afore lang  the old woman seemed content though she did not understand a word of lizs scotch  bless mine boy she said with a mild smile at daddy who replied with an amiable nod  but this state of comparative comfort did not last long  in half an hour the water came over the threshold of the door and flooded the floor  fortunately the old couple had their feet on wooden stools and thus escaped the first rush but old liz now felt that something must be done to keep them dry  there was a low table in the room  she dragged it out and placed it between the couple who smiled under the impression no doubt that they were about to have their evening meal  daddy im gaun to pit yer legs on the table  itll be mair comfortabler anll keep ye oot o the wat  daddy submitted with a good grace and felt more easy than usual the table being very little higher than his chair  mrs winklemann was equally submissive and pleased  covering the two pairs of legs with a blanket old liz produced some bread and cheese and served out rations thereof to keep their minds engaged  she plumed herself not a little on the success of the tableandlegs device but as the water rose rapidly she became anxious again though not for herself  she waded about the hut with supreme indifference to the condition of her own lower limbs at last she mounted upon the bed and watched as the water rose inch by inch on the legs of the two chairs  what wull i do whan it grups them she muttered experiencing that deep feeling of anticipation with which one might watch the gradual approach of fire to gunpowder  the objects of her solicitude snored pleasantly in concert  itll kill them wi the cauld to say naething o the start continued the old woman with deepening almost desperate anxiety  oh man man what for did ye leave us  this apostrophe was addressed to the absent winklemann  one inch more five minutes longer and the flood would reach the bodies of the old couple  liz looked round wildly for some mode of delivering them but looked in vain  even if her strength had been adequate there was no higher object in the room to which she could have lifted them the bed being a truckle one and lower than the chairs was already submerged and old liz herself was coolly if not calmly seated in two inches of water  at the very last moment deliverance came in an unexpected manner  there was a slight vibration in the timbers of the hut then a sliding of the whole edifice  this was followed by a snap and a jolt the ringbolt or the rope had gone and old liz might with perfect propriety have exclaimed in the words of the sea song im afloat  im afloat and the rover is free  for one moment her heart failed she had read of noahs ark but had never quite believed in the stability of that mansion  her want of faith was now rebuked for the old hut floated admirably as seamen might say on an even keel  true it committed a violent assault on a tree at starting which sent it spinning round and went crashing through a mass of drowned bushes which rendered it again steady but these mishaps only served to prove the seaworthiness of her ark and in a few minutes the brave little woman revived  splashing off the bed and spluttering across the room she tried to open the door with a view to see what had happened and whither they were bound for the two windows of the mansion were useless in this respect being fitted with parchment instead of glass  but the door was fast and refused to open  well a be lost exclaimed daddy in alarm for he had been awakened by the shock against the tree and was now slightly alive to their danger  ver is mine boy asked the old frau in a whimpering voice  nae fear o ee said liz in a soothing tone  him that saved noah can save us  open the door an see where we are lassie said the old man  itll no open daddy  try the wundy then  im sweerd to break the wundy said liz  losh man ill try the lum  the chimney to which old liz referred was capacious enough to admit a larger frame than hers  moreover it was a short one and the fire had long ago been drowned out  with the enthusiasm of an explorer the little woman stooped and entered the fireplace  she felt about inside for a few moments and in doing so brought down an enormous quantity of soot  immediately there was a tremendous coughing in the chimney  lassie lassie come oot  vell be chokit cried daddy in alarm  hoots man hand yer gab was the polite reply  liz was not to be easily turned from her purpose  raising one leg up she found a crevice for her right foot and the aged couple beheld the old creature for the first time in the attitude of a danseuse standing on one toe  next moment the remaining leg went up and she disappeared from view  if there had been any one outside the old woman would have been seen two minutes later to emerge from the chimneytop with the conventional aspect of a demonas black as a zulu chief choking like a chimpanzee with influenza and her hair blowing freely in the wind  only those who have intelligently studied the appearance of chimneysweeps can form a proper idea of her appearance especially when she recovered breath and smiled as she thought of her peculiar position  but that position was one which would have damped the courage of any one except old liz  the storm was beginning to grow furious the sun which had already set was tingeing the black and threatening clouds with dingy red  far as the eye could reach the once green prairie presented an angry sea whose inky waves were crested and flecked with foam and the current was drifting the hut away into the abyss of blackness that seemed to gape on the horizon  what see ye liz cried daddy bending a little so as to send his voice up the chimney  i see naethin but watter watter everywhere said liz unconsciously quoting the ancient mariner and bending so as to send her reply down she did more she lost her balance and sent herself down to the bottom of the chimney where she arrived in a sitting posture with a flop perhaps we should say a squash seeing that she alighted in water which squirted violently all over her sooty person  this sudden reappearance astonished the aged couple almost more than it surprised liz herself for she could not see herself as they saw her  hech but that was a klyte but neer heed daddy  im nane the waur  eh but ill hae to clean mysel said old liz rising slowly and going straight to a corner cupboard whence she took a slab of soap and began to apply it vigorously using the entire room so to speak as a washtub  the result was unsatisfactory beginning the process as a pure black she only ended it as an impure mulatto but she was content and immediately after set herself to fasten the aged pair more securely in their chairs and to arrange their limbs more comfortably on the table after that she lighted a candle and sat down on the sloppy bed to watch  thus that household spent the night rocked as it were on the cradle of the deep  at daylight herr winklemann rose from his sleepless couch at the parsonage and finding that the wind had moderated launched his canoe he left the mission station just an hour before mr cockran returned to it  anxious was the heart of the poor youth as he wielded the paddle that morning and many were the muttered remarks which he made to himself in german as he urged the canoe against wind and current  as he neared home his fears increased  on reaching a certain part from which he had been wont to descry the chimney of old lizs hut he perceived that the familiar object was gone and uttered a mighty roar of horror  the halfbreed in the bow ceased paddling and looked back in alarm  git on you brute shouted winklemann at the same time exerting his great strength as though he meant to urge the light craft out of the water into the air  a few minutes more and they swept round into the space where the hut had once stood  there was nothing left but the bit of rope that had been made fast to the ringbolt  poor winklemann let his paddle drop and sank almost double with his face in his hands  mine moder was all he could say as he groaned heavily  in a few seconds he recovered with a start and bade the man in the bow paddle for his life  winklemann of course knew that the house must have floated downwards with the current if it had not been utterly overwhelmed  he directed his search accordingly but the breadth of land now covered by the flood caused the currents to vary in an uncertain manner as every ridge or knoll or hollow in the plains modified them  still there could be only one general direction  after a few minutes of anxious reflection the bereaved man resolved to keep by the main current of the river  he was unfortunate in this for the hut in commencing its adventurous career had gone off in the direction of the plains  all day he and his companion paddled about in search of the lost family but in vain  at night they were forced to return to the parsonage for a little food and rest so as to fit them for a renewal of the search on the following morning  at the mission station they found mr cockran with his wife and forty of his people established on the stage  early in the day the water had burst into the parsonage and soon stood a foot deep on the floor so that the pastor deemed it high time to forsake it and take to the last refuge  it was a crowded stage and great was the anxiety of many of the mothers upon it lest their little ones should be thrust over the edge into the water  no such anxiety troubled the little ones themselves  with that freedom from care which is their high privilege they even gambolled on the brink of destruction  next day was the sabbath  to go to church was impossible  there were three and a half feet of water in that building  the day was fine however and sunny  the pastor therefore had service on the stage and being an earnest intelligent man he made good use of the floods and the peculiarity of their circumstances to illustrate and enforce his discourse  long before the hour of worship had arrived however poor winklemann went off in his canoe and spent the whole of that day as he spent several succeeding days in anxious diligent hopeful but finally despairing search for his lost old moder    chapter seventeen  the waves still rise and miss trim comes to grief  on the night of the 15th the gale broke out again with redoubled fury and the stage at the mission station was shaken so much by the violence of the waves and wind that fears were entertained of its stability despite its great strength  the water rose six inches during that night and when the vast extent of the floods is taken into account this rise was prodigious  the current was also so strong that it was feared the church itself with the property and people in its loft would be swept away  towards daylight a boat was seen approaching  it turned out to be that of mr ravenshaw containing himself and lambert with a crew from willow creek  the house of the old gentleman had he said much water in the lower rooms so that he had been driven to its upper floor but he felt sure of its strength having himself helped to lay its foundations  knowing the danger of those who dwelt in the parsonage he had come to offer an asylum to as many as his house would hold  but mr cockran declined to quit his post  the gale was by that time abating the cheering daylight increasing and as he had a large boat of his own moored to a neighbouring post he preferred to remain where he was  mr ravenshaw therefore ordered louis to hoist the sail and bidding adieu to the clerical party returned to willow creek  of all the household there miss trim had viewed the approach of the water with the greatest anxiety and mrs ravenshaw with the greatest philosophy  miss trim being an early riser was the first to observe the enemy on the morning of its entrance  she came downstairs and found the water entering the house quietly by the sides oozing from under the boards and secretly creeping along till it covered the floors she rushed upstairs to alarm mr ravenshaw and met that active old gentleman coming down  he set to work at once to rescue his goods on the lower floor while miss trim in great excitement went and roused the girls who leaped up at once  then she went to mrs ravenshaws room  oh mrs ravenshaw get up quick the flood is coming in at lastover the floorsthrough the chinksup the seamseverywheredodo get up we shall all be  she stopped  a longdrawn sigh and a gentle hush was all the reply vouchsafed by mrs ravenshaw  a quarter of an hour later miss trim came nervously back  its rushing in now like anything  oh do get up  we may have to fly the boards of the floor have been forced up and theyve had to take the door off its hinges  she stopped again  mrs ravenshaw with placid face and closed eyes had replied with another gentle hushsh  descending once more miss trim was met by a sudden stream which had burst in the back door  rushing again into the old ladys bedroom she cried vehemently woman wont you get up  why should i asked the other in a sleepy tone  isnt samuel looking after it  of course he is but  well well interrupted the old lady a little testily if hes there its all right  he knows what to do i dont  neither do you miss trim so pray go away and let me sleep  poor miss trim retired discomfited  afterwards when the family were driven to the upper storey of the dwelling she learned to regard things with something of mrs ravenshaws philosophy  one morning at daylight there was a calm so profound that the sleepers at willow creek were not awakened until the sun rose in a cloudless sky and glittered over the newborn sea with ineffable splendour  it was a strange and sad though beautiful sight  where these waters lay like a sheet of glass spreading out to the scarce visible horizon the grasswaves of the prairie had rolled in days gone by  there were still some knolls visible some tops of trees and bushes like islets on the sea and one or two square masses of driftwood floating slowly along with the now imperceptible current like boats under full sail  here and there could be seen several wooden houses and barns some of which had come down from the upper parts of the settlement like the hut of old liz and were stranded awkwardly on shoals while others were still drifting over the watery waste  all this was clearly visible from the windows of the upper room in which slept the sisters elsie and cora and presented itself to the former when she awoke like a vision of fairyland  unable to believe her eyes she rubbed them with her pretty little knuckles and gazed again  how beautiful she exclaimed  the exclamation awoke cora who sat up and yawned  then she looked at her sister and being only halfawake smiled in an imbecile manner  isnt it asked elsie  splendid replied cora turning to the windows  oh im so sleepy  she sank on the pillow again and shut her eyes  come cora let us finish the discussion we began last night about louis lambert said elsie with an arch smile  no i wont  let me sleep  i hate louis lambert said cora with a shake of her uppermost shoulder  elsie laughed and rose she was already dressed  mr ravenshaw had on the previous night ordered both his daughters to lie down in their clothes as no one could tell what might happen to the house at any moment  the flood had not yet begun to abate elsie could tell that as she sat arranging her hair from the sound of water gurgling through the lower rooms  we have said that the ravenshaws had been driven by the floods to the upper floor of their residence  this floor consisted of three bedrooms and a lumberroom  one of the bedrooms was very small and belonged to the sisters to whose sole use it was apportioned  for convenience the other two rooms were set apart on this occasion as the male and the female rooms of the establishment one being used by as many of the women as could get comfortably into it the other by the men  the overflow of the household including those neighbours who had sought refuge with the family were accommodated in the adjoining barn between which and the main building communication was kept up by means of a canoe with peegwish and wildcat as the ferrymen  the lumberroom having had most of its lumber removed was converted into a general hall or salon where the imprisoned family had their meals received their friends and discussed their trials  it was a rather dusty place with sloping roof no ceiling and crossbeams that caused cross tempers in those who ran against them  in one corner a door removed from its hinges did duty as a dresser  in another mr ravenshaw had erected a small stove on which being rather proud of his knowledge of cookery he busied himself in spoiling a good deal of excellent food  a couple of planks laid on two trunks served for a table  such cooking utensils and such portions of light furniture as were required had been brought up from the rooms below that which was left having been weighted with large stones to prevent its being carried away for the lower doors and windows had been removed to prevent their being driven in or out as the case might be  so complete was the destruction everywhere that samuel ravenshaw had passed into a gleeful state of recklessness and appeared to enjoy the fun of thus roughing it rather than otherwise to the amusement of his amiable wife who beheld his wasteful and daring culinary efforts without a murmur and to the horror of miss trim who was called upon to assist in and share the triumphs as well as the dangers of these efforts  fetch the pepper now miss trim  thats it thank eehallo  i say the top has come off that rascally thing and half the contents have gone into the pan  he was engaged in frying a mess of pemmican and flour of which provender he had secured enough to stand a siege of at least six months duration  never mind he continued in with more flour and more pemmican thats your sort  itll make it taste more like curry which is hot enough in all conscience  but pepper is not like curry said miss trim who had a brother in india and was consequently a secondhand authority on indian affairs curry is hot no doubt and what one may call a seasoning but it has not the flavour of pepper at all and is not the colour of it and  yes yes i know all about that miss trim  why theres a box of it isnt there in the little cupboard on the stair  i quite forgot it  fetch it please and well have real pemmican curry and rouse up my lazy girls as you pass  dont disturb mrs r though  the proverb says let sleepingno i dont mean that exactly  by the way dont slip on the stair  the waters about up to that cupboard  mind there are six feet water or more in the passage now and if  he stopped for miss trim had already left the room just as lambert entered it  the cupboard to which miss trim had been sent was an angular one let into the wall to utilise a crooked corner  the step of the stair immediately below it was the last dry one of the flight  from that step to the bottom was held by the flood which gurgled oilily through the deserted basement  descending to that step with caution and gazing anxiously at her own image reflected below she opened the cupboard door  now it chanced that angus macdonalds cochinchina hen having been driven from its own home by the flood had strayed into mr ravenshaws house and established itself uninvited in the cupboard  it received miss trim with a croak of indignation and a flutter  starting back with a slight oh the poor lady fell and who shall adequately describe or even imagine the effects of that fall  many a time had miss trim descended that stair and passage on her feet but never until then had she done so on her back like a mermaid or a seal  coming to the surface immediately she filled the house with a yell that almost choked the hearers caused old ravenshaw to heave the pemmican curry into the lap of lambert and induced lambert himself to leap downstairs to the rescue like a harlequin  the bold youth had to swim for it  a gurgle at the far end of the passage told where miss trim was going down like wedding announcements for the third and last time  lambert went in like an otter caught the lady in his arms and bore her to the staircase and thence to the upper floor in a few minutes  she was at once taken to the sisters bedroom and there restored to life and lamentation  my dear said mr ravenshaw to his wife when she appeared youd better look after our breakfastive made a mess of it and ill go over to angus macdonald and invite him and his household to come and stay with us  their house must be almost afloat by this time  the old gentleman hailed peegwish who was outside in the canoe at the moment  that wouldbe brewer at once made for the house paddled his canoe through the doorway and up the passage to the staircase where wildcat who managed the bow paddle held on by the bannister while mr ravenshaw embarked  reissuing from the doorway they made for their neighbours residence  macdonalds house had indeed become almost uninhabitable  it stood so deep in the water that only the upper windows were visible  the chimneys and roofs of some of the outhouses formed with the main building and a few treetops a small archipelago  you are fery kind mr ruvnshaw said angus from an upper window beneath which the canoe floated  it iss not improbaple that my house will pe goin down the river like a post but that iss nothingnot anything at allwhen there will pe such a destruction goin on all over the settlement whatever  it iss fery coot of you oo ay  i will put my fuddle into the canoe an my sister she will pe ready at wancewass you ready martha  a voice from the interior intimated that miss martha would be ready in two minutes  pe quick then said macdonald looking inwards while he lowered his violin to which he was passionately attached into the canoe you hef not much time to waste martha for it wass time we will pe goin  in a few minutes angus macdonalds house was abandoned to its fate and himself and sister with a couple of domestics were added to the number of refugees who crowded to the abode of hospitable sam ravenshaw  hef you forgotten the cawtie asked angus of his sister while assisting her to land on the steps from which miss trim had taken her dive  no angus ive got it in my basket but i fear the poor old hen has been lost  its all over the house i sought for it before comin away but  a triumphant cackle from the cupboard overhead interrupted miss martha  ha ha shouted mr ravenshaw thats where the sound came from this morning  and i do believe it must have been that brute which caused miss trim to fall into the water  with a twinkle in his eye the old gentleman related the incident of the morning while angus with a grim expression kept his eye on beauty who gazed inquiringly out at the halfopen door of her retreat  it iss a pad craitur youve peenfery padever since i got you but it iss no more mischief you will pe dooin after thiswhatever  angus seized the unfortunate hen by the neck as he spoke and flung it along the passage where it fell into the water and went cackling and choking through the doorway  beautys powers were varied as well as surprising  although thus for the first time in her life compelled to take to the water she swam as well as any duck and went straight off as if by instinct to the forsaken house  from the window of the lumberroom angus saw her reach it scramble somehow on to its roof and there utter a crow of defiance that would have done credit to her defunct husband  there was one other object besides his own house and surroundings which angus saw from that window  it was the smokingbox on the willowclad knoll which formed a separate island in the flood  the sight stirred up unpleasant recollections  he turned from the window and gave his attention to the substantial breakfast to which his host invited him  the greater part of that day was spent in rearranging the habitable parts of willow creek and placing the more delicate valuables further out of danger  at night candles were lighted fresh wood was heaped up in the stove and the lumberroom became comparatively comfortable  will you play us a tune angus said louis lambert drawing a stool between elsie and cora and sitting down  the ladies you know never tire of your music  i hef not anything new replied angus with becoming modesty but if the leddies wass willin to listen to some o the old tunes my fuddle an i will try what we can do  we love the old tunes best said cora  as every one else echoed the sentiment angus nothing loath began to discourse sweet sounds which to say truth were indeed very sweet and mingled not inharmoniously with the sound of waters which gurgled gently underneath  angus could play scotch reels in a manner that made dancing almost unavoidable but he preferred slow plaintive music and on this occasion indulged his taste to the full so as to fling a mantle of quiescence and pathos over the family circle  samuel ravenshaw had retired to a darkish corner to enjoy his pipe but the music awoke sad memories  the lost tony came vividly before him and beside his darling boy arose the dark form of the red man whose mode of taking his revenge had been to him so terrible all the more terrible that the nature of the old man was secretive in regard to sorrow  his joys he was ever ready to share with every one but his griefs he smothered in his own breast and scorned to let his countenance betray his heart  no one knew how much he suffered  perhaps elsie understood him best at all events she had become more earnest and thoughtful in her attentions after that dark day when her little brother was spirited away  leaving lambert to cora she went over to her father sat down beside him and laying her head upon his shoulder listened with a sort of melancholy pleasure to the sweet strains of the violin  they were suddenly and rudely awakened from this state of quiescence by a blinding flash of lightning followed almost instantaneously by a tremendous clap of thunder which sounded like colliding worlds overhead and then rolled away in deep mutterings of discontent  this was repeated at short intervals then the rain and hail came down in torrents and the wind rose so that soon the waves began to beat violently on the house  the day which had begun so calmly ended in furious stormemblematic of many a day in every human life  seated there with feelings of awe and anxiety the ravenshaw household passed the night in silence  and still the waters of the red river continued to riseslowly it is true and inch by inch instead of foot by footuntil these settlers in the great wilderness began to think with something akin to superstitious fear of that mighty deluge which had been sent to submerge the world in the days of old    chapter eighteen  old ravenshaw goes exploring and rescuing  another fine calm day came to comfort the victims of the flood in the midst of that tempestuous time with its april character of mingled storm and sunshine  the rise in the water on the previous night had been almost imperceptible  feeling therefore somewhat easier in his mind old mr ravenshaw determined to embark in his boat for the purpose of paying a visit to those unfortunates who after being driven from their homes had taken refuge on the imperceptible eminence which had been styled the mountain  taking with him lambert and a stout crew he embarked from his upper bedroom window bade his wife and daughters an affectionate adieu hoisted his sail and pushed off  the hoisting of the sail was a mere matter of form  its of no use at present but will be ready to catch the first puff that may favour us observed the old gentleman as he sat down and took the tiller  give way lads  the oars were dipped and the willow creek mansion was soon but a speck on the horizon of the watery waste  and now the old furtrader learned the full extent of the desolation with which it had pleased god to visit the settlement at that time while taken up with the cares and anxieties connected with willow creek he was of course aware that terrible destruction if not death must have been going on around him but now when he rowed over the plains saw the state of things with his own eyes and heard the accounts of many settlers some of whom he rescued from positions of danger the full extent of the damage done by the great flood of 1826 was borne powerfully in upon his mind  the varied stories which some had to tell of their escapes others of their losses and all of their sufferings were sad as well as interesting  some of the people had taken shelter in garrets or on stages where they had to wait anxiously till some boat or canoe should turn up to rescue them  some had been surprised by the sudden rise of the flood at night while asleep and had wakened to find themselves and their beds afloat  two men who had gone to sleep on a rick of hay found themselves next morning drifting with the current some three miles below the spot where they had lain down  others like old liz had been carried off bodily in their huts  not a few had been obliged to betake themselves to the housetops until help came  some there were who took to swimming and saved themselves by clinging to the branches of trees yet strange to say during the whole course of that flood only one man lost his life  see note 1  it was very different however with regard to the lower animals  when at its height the water spread out on each side of the river to a distance of six miles and about fourteen miles of its length so that not only were many horses cattle pigs and poultry drowned in the general stampede but the pretty little ground squirrels were driven out of their holes and along with rats mice snakes and insects perished in thousands  even the frogs discovered that too much of a good thing is bad for they found no rest for the soles of their feet except floating logs planks and stray pieces of furniture on which many of them were seen by our voyagers gazing contemplatively at the situation  everywhere houses and barns were seen floating about their owners gone but with dogs and cats in the doorways and windows and poultry on the roofs and the barking mewing and cackling of these with the squealing of sundry pigs tended to increase the general desolation such of the contents of these houses as had been left behind in the flight were washed out of them and the waters were sprinkled here and there with bedsteads chairs tables featherbeds and other property besides the carcasses of dead animals  at certain points of the river where there were shallows towards which the currents set carts carioles boxes carriages gigs fencing and property of every description were stranded in large quantities and in dire confusion but much of the wreck was swept onward and engulfed in lake winnipeg  the unfortunate settlers found refuge ultimately after being driven from knoll to knoll on the higher ground of the assinaboine on the little mountain and on a low hill twelve miles from the settlement  on his way to the little mountain mr ravenshaw touched at the mission station  here the various groups in the garret of the parsonage the gallery of the church and on the stage were greatly reduced in numbers many of the refugees having availed themselves of the visits of several settlers and gone off to the mountain in their boats or canoes with what of their property they had managed to save  among those who remained there was a marked spirit of cheerful submission  you see said the pastor in reply to an observation of mr ravenshaw on this point i have endeavoured to impress upon my poor people that mere quiet submission to the inevitable is not a christian characteristic that men of all creeds and nations may and do thus submit and that it is the special privilege of the follower of jesus to submit cheerfully to whatever befallspleasant or otherwisebecause he has the promise that all things shall work together for his good  humph said the trader with a shrug of his shoulders it seems to me that some of us dont avail ourselves much of our privilege  the pastor could scarcely repress a laugh at the grumpy tone in which his visitor spoke  you are right mr ravenshaw none of us come nearly up to the mark in our christian course  the effort to do so constitutes much of the battle that we have to fight but our comfort is that we shall be more than conquerors in the longrun  there sits a widow now he continued pointing to an indian woman seated on the stage who was busy making a pair of moccasins for a little child that played by her side who is fighting her battle bravely at present  not a murmur has yet escaped her lips although she has lost all her possessionsexcept her boy  ah except her boy  the old trader did not speak  he only thought of tony and quickly changed the drift of the conversation  soon after leaving the mission station a breeze sprang up the sail filled the oars were pulled in and they went more swiftly on  ere long they sighted the stage on which the women had been previously discovered singing hymns  they did not sing now  their provisions were failing their hopes of an abatement in the flood were dying out and they no longer refused to accept deliverance from their somewhat perilous position  have you seen anything of herr winklemann lately asked lambert of one of the women  nothing but john flett and david mowat passed our stage yesterday in a canoe and they told us that the hut of old liz rollin has been carried away with her and her father and winklemanns mother and they say that her son has been seen in a small canoe rangin about by himself like a madman searchin for her  the moment we reach the mountain ill get hold of a canoe and go in search of him said lambert  right boy right said ravenshaw i fear that something may have happened to the poor lad  these small canoes are all very well when you can run ashore and mend em if they should get damaged but out here among sunk posts and fences and no land to run to it is dangerous navigationhist  did ye hear a cry lads  the men ceased to talk and listened intently while they gazed round the watery waste in all directions  besides a stranded house here and there and a few submerged trees nothing was to be seen on the water save the carcasses of a few cattle above which a couple of ravens were wheeling slowly  the cry was not repeated  imagination muttered old ravenshaw to himself after lambert had given a lusty shout which however elicited no reply  it must have been i hear nothing said lambert looking round uneasily  come out oars again lads said the old gentleman as the sail flapped in the failing breeze  night will catch us before we reach hallo back your oarshard  catch hold of im  a living creature of some sort came out from behind a floating log at that moment and was almost run down  the man at the bow oar leaned over and caught it  the yell which followed left no shadow of doubt as to the nature of the creature  it was a pig  during the next two minutes while it was being hauled into the boat it made the air ring with shrieks of concentrated fury  before dismissing this pig we may state that it was afterwards identified by its owner who said it had been swept way from his house two days before and must therefore have been swimming without relief for eightandforty hours  that accounts for the cry you heard said louis lambert when the screams subsided  no louis a pigs voice is too familiar to deceive me  if it was not imagination it was the voice of a man  the old trader was right  one of the objects which in the distance resembled so closely the floating carcass of an ox was in reality an overturned canoe and to the stern of that canoe herr winklemann was clinging  he had been long in the water and was almost too much exhausted to see or cry  when the boat passed he thought he heard voices  hope revived for a moment and he uttered a feeble shout but he failed to hear the reply  the canoe happened to float between him and the boat so that he could not see it as it passed slowly on its course  poor winklemann  in searching wildly about the wide expanse of water for his lost mother he had run his canoe violently against the top rail of a fence  the delicate birch bark was ripped off  in another minute it sank and turned bottom up  it was a canoe of the smallest size winklemann having preferred to continue his search alone rather than with an unwilling companion  the german was a good swimmer a mere upset might not have been serious  he could have righted the canoe and perhaps clambered into it over the stern and baled it out  but with a large hole in its bottom there was no hope of deliverance except in a passing boat or canoe  clinging to the frail craft the poor youth gazed long and anxiously round the horizon endeavouring the while to push the wreck towards the nearest treetop which however was a long way off  by degrees the cold told on his huge frame and his great strength began to fail  once a canoe appeared in the distance  he shouted with all his might but it was too far off  as it passed on out of sight he raised his eyes as if in prayer but no sound escaped his compressed lips  it was noon when the accident occurred  towards evening he felt as though his consciousness were going to forsake him but the love of life was strong he tightened his grasp on the canoe  it was just then that he heard the voices of ravenshaws party and shouted but the cry as we have said was very feeble and the poor fellows sense of hearing was dulled with cold and exhaustion else he would have heard lamberts reply  oh mine moder mine moder he sighed as his head drooped helplessly forward though his fingers tightened on the canoe with the convulsive grasp of a drowning man  night descended on the water  the moon threw a fitful gleam now and then through a rift in the sailing clouds  all was still and dark and desolate above and around the perishing man  nothing with life was visible save a huge raven which wheeled to and fro with a solemn croak and almost noiseless wing  but the case of winklemann was not yet hopeless  his chum louis lambert could not shake himself free from a suspicion that the cry which had been put down to imagination might after all have been that of some perishing human beingperhaps that of his friend  arrived at the little mountain louis lost no time in obtaining a canoe also an indian to take the bow paddle  the mountain which was a mere undulation of the prairie presented a strange scene at that time  many settlershalfbreeds canadians and indianswere encamped there some under tents of various sizes others under upturned boats and canoes not a few under the wider canopy of the heavens  intermingled with the men women and children were horses cattle sheep pigs poultry dogs cats and pets of the feathered tribe besides goods household furniture carts etcetera so that no words can adequately describe the scene  it was confusion worse confounded  many were the hospitable proposals made here to louis lambert that he should remain all night for he was a general favourite but to all these he turned a deaf ear and set out on a searching expedition in the canoe just after the sun had gone down  at first he made as straight as he could for the place where mr ravenshaw had fancied he heard the cry but on consideration came to the conclusion that as the current must have carried all floating objects considerably farther down the settlement by that time he ought to change his course  soon it grew too dark to see objects distinctly but an occasional gleam of moonshine came to his aid  he passed several floating barns and cowhouses but found them empty  he also nearly ran against several dead animals but the silent indian in the bow was wary and vigilant  hope was at last beginning to die within louiss breast when he observed a raven circling round some floating object  ho theres something yonder  strike out old coppernose he exclaimed as he directed the canoe towards it  the light craft cut the water like a knife and was quickly alongside  why it is a canoe bottom up  have a care  ha hold on  lambert nearly overturned his own canoe as he made a sudden grasp at something and caught a man by the hair  hallo  i say let go your canoe and hold on to me cried lambert in excitement but the man spoken to made no reply and would not let go the wrecked canoe  lambert therefore hauled him powerfully and slowly alongside until his visage was level with the gunwale  just then a gleam of moonlight broke forth and revealed the face of herr winklemann  the difficulties that now beset the rescuers were great for the poor german besides being stupefied had grasped his canoe with tremendous power and could not be detached  to get an active and living man out of the water into a birch canoe is no easy matter to embark a halfdead one is almost impossible nevertheless lambert and his redskinned comrade managed to do it between them  raising his unconscious friend as far out of the water as possible louis caught one of his hands and wrenched it from its hold meanwhile the indian leaned out of the opposite side of the canoe so as to balance it  another violent wrench freed the other hand  it also freed winklemanns spirit to some extent and called it back to life for he exclaimed vat is dat in a tone of faint but decided surprise  here lay hold of my neck said lambert in a peremptory voice  winklemann obeyed  lambert exerted all his strength and heaved  the indian did not dare to lend a hand as that would have upset the canoe but he leaned still farther over its other side as a counterpoise  at last lambert got his friend on the edge and tumbled him inboard  at the same moment the indian adroitly resumed his position and winklemann was saved  youll soon be all right said lambert resuming his paddle  havent swallowed much water i hope  no no said winklemann faintly mine lunks i do tink are free of vatter but mine lecks are stranchly qveer  i hav no lecks at all pears as if i vas stop short at zee vaist  herr winklemann said no more but was swiftly borne in a state of semiconsciousness to his friends on the little mountain    twentysix years later in 1852 red river settlement was visited by a flood very similar in its main features to that of 1826 above described and it is a curious coincidence that only one man lost his life during the latter flood also that the waters of the floods of both years began to subside on exactly the same date    chapter nineteen  the red man receives a visitor cogitates deeply and acts with decision  we return now to the red man who with his captive spent the greater part of that winter on the slopes of the rocky mountains in a valley between two spurs of the range which merged gradually into the prairie  in this sequestered spot petawanaquat could by turning to the right hand seek the rugged haunts of the grizzly near and the rocky mountain goat or by turning to the left ride after the buffalo on his own undulating plains  here the indian instructed tony in all the mysteries of the hunters craft showed him how to set traps for wolves and foxes and snares for rabbits and taught him how to use the gun and how to follow the tracks of game in the snow  he also made him a little bow with a sheaf of bluntheaded arrows and a pair of snowshoe frames the interstices of which were filled up by the red mans wife  petawanaquat had only one wife named meekeye  he might have had half a dozen wives if he had chosen because he was a strong able and successful hunter which is equivalent to saying he was for an indian a rich man and among the indians there is no legal limit we believe to the number of a mans wives  but our red man seemed to think one quite enough  he was very good to herwhich is more than can be said alas of many white men  he never failed to bring her the titbits of all animals slain in the chase  he never beat her if she grew weary on the march as too many of his savage countrymen are wont to do but on the contrary relieved her of part of her burden and as a rule carried the heaviest part of the family baggage on his own shoulders or sledge  moreover when on a visit with his furs to the stores of the furtraders he never failed to consult meekeye as to every purchase that he made and invariably gladdened her heart with gifts of scarlet cloth and white enamelled beads and brilliant ribbons and little circular mirrors which were deemed ample in size though hardly big enough to display to advantage the point of an average nose  in short petawanaquat was quite unindian and chivalrous in his attentions to his squaw who repaid him with faithful service and above all with loving looks from the orbs which had originated her name  some people may think the loving looks produced the chivalry others that the chivalry caused the looks  whichever way it was the result was mutual felicity  the red man had no family hence meekeye took to tony with something of the fervour of a mother  tony soon reciprocated at first he indulged some of his mischievous tendencies but being only smiled at when he was naughty found that the interest of being bad was gone and ere long gave it up  in the presence of his new father he never dared to be other than absolute perfection  petawanaquats solemnity was too much for him thus it came to pass that tony was soon thoroughly broken in  meekeye taught him to make leggings and to ornament moccasins for the boy was omnivorous in his thirst for knowledge  he swallowed everything with avidity including immense quantities of food so that his frame and mind developed together in a marvellous manner  of course the red man did not take tony with him on his longest hunting expeditions but he took him considerable distances from home notwithstanding and showed him the far west sport in all its phases insomuch that tony who could scarcely sit a trotting horse in the settlements became tonyquat the fearless in the course of timecould ride barebacked steeds with ease and could send his little arrows into the flank of a buffalo with as much coolness if not as much force as his instructor  tony even got the length of drawing first blood from a grizzly bear  it happened thus  he was out with petawanaquat one day in a narrow defile of the mountains  the indian carried his gun the boy his bow  tonys quiver contained two sorts of arrows one set shod with iron and sharp the other set not only blunt but with a lumpy wooden head meant not to pierce but to stun birds  ho look here exclaimed tony fitting a blunt arrow to the string and pointing up at a tree among the branches of which sat a bird resembling a grey hen in size and colour  petawanaquat stopped let the butt of his gun fall to the ground rested his hands on the muzzle and smiled approval  the arrow flew hit the bird on its astonished eye and brought it down  good  tonyquat will be a great chief said the red man with another grave nod  ho look there whispered tony glaring in the direction of a thicket while he fitted a sharp arrow to his bow  turning quickly the indian saw a grizzly bear rise from behind a rock and look at the hunters inquiringly  before he could raise his gun he heard a twang and next moment saw an arrow quivering in the bears neck  the roar of the enraged animal and the report of his own gun commingled  another instant and tony found himself in the midst of the tree out of which he had just brought the grey bird hurled there by petawanaquat who was himself not a moment too soon in climbing to the same place of refuge  from this point of vantage the indian having carried his gun up with him fired several deadly shots and killed the bear whose claws tony afterwards wore in commemoration of the event  this was but one of the varied and stirring adventures which befell our little hero while under the care of his redskinned captor  what passed in the mind of the indian during that winter tony had little opportunity of knowing for he was remarkably taciturn though at night when smoking the calumet over his wigwam fire the thoughtful expression of his face and occasional troubled look on his brows suggested the idea that he was ill at ease  he frequently gazed at his captive as if about to speak to him seriously but as often seemed to abandon the idea with something like a sigh  one evening however petawanaquat seemed more troubled than usual and held frequent earnest consultations with meekeye in an undertone in the midst of which tony could distinguish a few words such as tracks white strangers encampment etcetera  before going to rest the indian smoked an extra pipe and then said  tonyquat is a brave boy  yes answered tony with an air of gravity quite equal to that of his red father  the few months he had been in captivity had indeed wrought an almost miraculous change in the child  his ideas were much more manly  even his speech had lost its childish lisp and he had begun to express himself somewhat in the allegorical language of the american indian  under the influence of a will stronger than his own he had proved himself an apt scholar  tonyquat is a boy who keeps his word continued the other with a keen glance  tony turned his large eyes full on the indian  has my indian father ever found tonyquat telling lies  to this petawanaquat said good and smoked his pipe with increasing vigour while tony sat with his hands clasped over one knee gazing sternly at the fire as though he were engaged in consulting on matters of life and death  he glanced however for one instant at meekeye to see that she observed his staid demeanour  the same glance revealed to tony the fact that meekeyes right foot was rather near the fire with the redhot end of a log close to it  tonys own left foot chanced to rest on the other and unburnt end of the same log  a very gentle motion on his part sufficed to bring meekeyes toes and the fire into contact she drew back with a sudden start but was too much of an indian to scream  tony was enough of one to remain motionless and abstracted like a brown statue  the slightest possible twitch at one corner of petawanaquats mouth showed that he had observed the movement but his brow did not relax as he said  tonyquat must make his red father a promise  white men are coming here  they travel towards the setting sun  if they hear the voice of tonyquat they will take him away  will they take me to my own father cried tony forgetting his role in the excitement of the moment  petawanaquat has said that the white strangers travel towards the setting sun  red river lies in the direction of the rising sun  would tonyquat like to go with white strangers into the mountains  tony was most emphatic in his denial of entertaining any such desire and declared with his wonted candour that he loved petawanaquat and meekeye next to his own father and mother  if this be so returned the indian tonyquat must be dumb when the white men speak to him  he must know nothing  his voice must be more silent than the waters of a lake when the wind is dead  tony promised to be as dumb as a stone as ignorant as a newborn infant and as quiet as a dead man  he then questioned the indian about the white men but obtained no further information than that petawanaquat had come on their camp unexpectedly the day before had observed them secretly from among the bushes knew that the route they were pursuing would infallibly lead them to his wigwam and that therefore he had hurried home to be ready for them  he could not tell who the white men were  they looked like tradersthat was all he knew or at least chose to communicate  that night meekeye repainted tonys neck and face with considerable care dyed his luxuriant hair with grease and charcoal touched up his eyebrows with the same and caused him to dirty his hands effectively with mud and ashes  next morning a little after sunrise the twinkle of bells the yelping of dogs and the cracking of whips were heard  petawanaquat and tony had just time to step out of the tent when a cariole somewhat in the form of a slipperbath drawn by four dogs dashed up to the door  the dogs being fresh and young took to fighting  their driver who wore a headdress with horns belaboured the combatants and abused them in french while a tall quietlooking man arose from the furs of the cariole and mounting the slope on which the indian stood to receive him advanced towards the wigwam  some minutes later another team of dogs with a provisionsled and driver came rattling up  what cheer said the tall man heartily as he held out his hand  watchee replied petawanaquat grasping the hand and repeating the phrase as he had learnt it in the settlements  the tall man was very affable and at once revealed the object of his journey  he was a missionary he said and was making a tour among the native tribes of that region to preach the good news of salvation from sin and its consequences through jesus christ the son of god  petawanaquat listened with grave intelligence but with the reticence of an indian  some tribes of indians i have been told are encamped not far from this spot said the missionary through his interpreter  petawanaquat admitted that such was the case and that some lodges of indians were pitched in the mountains not two days march from his tent  the missionary entered the wigwam and sat down  he gradually introduced the subject of his mission and endeavoured to bring it home to the indian and his wife who however replied in very brief sentences  he also addressed tony but that sharp child seemed to be less impressionable than a pine stump and refused to utter a word on any subject  the missionary however was a true man with the love of god burning brightly in his breast  although slightly disappointed he was not discouraged  he spoke of christ crucified with great earnestness and commended the christian virtuesamong others the duty of forgiving nay even loving ones enemies and especially of returning good for evil  he also dwelt much on the wickedness of harbouring revengeful feelings and on the sweetness and blessedness of doing good to others enforcing his arguments on the latter point by quoting the saviours own words whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them  still the red man listened with stolid composure meekeye with apparent indifference and tony with absolute vacancy so that the missionary after offering up a silent prayer went on his way with a sad feeling at his heart that his labour with that family of savages had been in vain he comforted himself however with the reflection that it is written your labour is not in vain in the lord  and he was right  his labour had not been in vain though it was not given to him at that time to see the fruit thereof  we have said that petawanaquat had smoked and pondered deeply in the evenings that winter over his wigwam fire  his slightly enlightened mind had been busy with those difficult problems about good and evil god and man which seem to exercise all earnest souls more or less in every land savage as well as civilised  the revenge which he had taken on mr ravenshaw was sweetvery sweet for his indignation against that irascible old gentleman was very bitter justifiably so he thought but the clergyman at red river had enlightened the red mans conscience and conscience being once aroused cannot easily be put to sleep again his reasoning powers told him that the revenge which he had taken was far in excess of the injury which he had received  this was unjust and conscience told him that injustice was wrong  the great manitou himself could not be unjust  had he not taken the guilt of man on himself in the person of jesus in order that without injustice he might be the justifier of sinners  injustice is wrong reiterated conscience again and again but revenge is sweet thought the indian  now this visit of the missionary had cleared the mind of petawanaquat to some extent  it was a new idea to him that returning good for evil was sweeter than revenge  he coupled this thought with the fact that the saviour had laid down his life for his enemies and the result was that a change gradual but decided was wrought in the red mans sentiments  the seed thus sown by the wayside fell into good ground unlike ordinary seed it bore fruit during the winter and that fruit ripened into action in the spring  tonyquat said the red man one morning after much of the snow had left the ground your indian father intends to start on a long journey tomorrow  petawanaquat replied tony your whitefaced son is ready to follow  it must be understood that tonys language was figurative for at the time he was speaking his white face was changed so much by paint and smoke that it quite equalled that of his adopted father in dirty brownness  meekeye will get ready continued the indian  our journey shall be towards the rising sun  the result of this order was that on the following day the indians leather tent was taken down wrapped up into a bundle and fastened to a couple of poles along with the rest of the family property  one end of each of these poles was fastened to a horse like shafts the other ends were left to trail on the ground the load resting between these ends and the steeds tail  it was as it were a cart without wheels or body  meekeye mounted the horse after the fashion of a man petawanaquat and tony together mounted another steed  three dogs formed part of the establishment  these were harnessed to little poles like those of the horse and each dragged a little load proportioned to his size  thus they left the spur of the rocky mountains and travelled over the plains towards red river settlement  about the same time and with the same destination in view and not far distant from the same region another party on horseback commenced their journey towards the rising sun  the two parties ultimately metbut these and other matters we shall reserve for our next chapter    chapter twenty  a terrible disaster and a joyful meeting  we left ian macdonald it will be remembered far away in the western wilderness suffering from the wounds received during his memorable and successful combat with a grizzly bear  these wounds were much more serious than had at first been supposed and despite the careful nursing of vic ravenshaw and michel rollin he grew so weak from loss of blood that it became evident to all of them that they should have to take up their abode in that wild unpeopled spot for a considerable period of time  they therefore planned and built a small loghut in a wood well stocked with game and on the margin of a little stream where fish abounded  at first victor resolved to ride to the nearest fort of the furtraders and fetch a doctor or the means of conveying their wounded friend to a place where better attendance and shelter were to be had but insurmountable difficulties lay in the way  there were no doctors in the land  the nearest abode of civilised man was several hundred miles distant and neither he nor rollin knew the way to any place whatever they had depended entirely on ian as a guide and now that he was helpless so were they  it would have been difficult for them even to have found their way back to the red river settlement without the aid of the scholastic backwoodsman  they were constrained therefore to rest where they were hoping from day to day that ian would regain strength sufficient to bear the fatigue of a journey  thus the winter slowly slipped away and wildfowlthe harbingers of springwere beginning to awake the echoes of the northern woods before ian felt himself strong enough to commence the journey homewards  that winter with all its vicissitudes hopes fears adventures and pleasures we must pass over in absolute silence and reintroduce our three friends on the evening of a fine spring day while riding over a sweep of prairie land in the direction of a thick belt of forest  the river must be somewhere hereabouts said ian reining up on an eminence and gazing earnestly round him  vas you ever here before asked rollin  ay once but not at this precise spot  i dont quite recognise it  i hope my long illness has not damaged my memory  if we dont reach the river soon said victor with something of weariness in his tone this poor brute will give in  victor referred to his horse which had been reduced by some unknown disease to skin and bone  however im well able to walk he continued more cheerfully and it cant be long before we shall fall in with the river and some indians who will sell or lend us a canoe  ah my cheval is not much more better dan your von said rollin and he spoke the truth for his horse was afflicted with the same disease that had attacked that of victor  ians steed however was in excellent condition  that night the invalid horses were freed from all their troubles by a pack of wolves while their owners were asleep  they had been hobbled so carelessly that they had broken loose and strayed far from the encampment  being weak they fell an easy prey to their sneaking enemies  next day however the three friends reached the river of which they were in search found a family of indians there who bartered with them a canoe and some provisions for the remaining horse and continued their homeward journey by water  for a time all went well  the river was in high flood for the snowfall there as elsewhere had been unusually heavy but all three were expert voyageurs and succeeded in steering past difficulties of all kinds until one afternoon when good fortune seemed to forsake them utterly  they began by running the canoe against a sunk tree or snag and were obliged to put ashore to avoid sinking  the damage was however easily remedied and while ian was busy with the repairs his comrades prepared a hot dinner which meal they usually ate cold in the canoe  next they broke a paddle  this was also easily replaced  after that they ventured to run a rapid which almost proved too much for them it nearly overturned the canoe and filled it so full of water that they were compelled to land again unload and empty it  dat is too bad observed rollin with a growl of discontent  it might have been worse said ian  bah returned rollin  pooh ejaculated victor  very good said ian i only hope the truth of my remark maynt be proved to both of you  it has been asserted by the enemies of ian macdonald that the catastrophe which followed was the result of a desire on his part to prove the truth of his own remark but we acquit him of such baseness certain it is however that the very next rapid they came to they ran straight down upon a big stone over which the water was curling in grand fury  hallo shouted ian in sudden alarm dipping his paddle powerfully on the right  hi yelled rollin losing his head and dipping wildly on the same sidewhich was wrong  look out roared victor  he might as well have roared look in for any good that could have come of it  there was a crash the canoe burst up and doubled down the bow was hurled high in the air the rest of it lay out limp and disappeared  rollin went clean over the rock victor went round it and ian after grasping it for a second went under it apparently for like the canoe he disappeared  that rapid treated these voyagers roughly of the three michel rollin appeared to suffer most  after sending him round the stone in a rush of foam that caused his arms and legs to go round like a mad windmill it sucked him down rubbed his head on the boulders at the bottom shot him up feet foremost into the air received him on its raging breast again spun him round like a teetotum and at last hurled him almost contemptuously upon a sandbank at its foot  ian and victor also received a severe buffeting before gaining the same sandbank where they faced each other in a blaze of surprise and horror  unable to find words to express their feelings they turned simultaneously and waded in silence from the sandbank to the shore  here a consultation of the most doleful character that can be imagined was entered into  everything lost said ian sitting down on a bank and wringing the water out of his garments  not even a gun saved said victor gravely  no nor von moutful of pemmican cried rollin wildly grasping his hair and glaring  the poor fellow seemed to his friends to have gone suddenly mad for the glare of despair turned to a grin of wild amusement accompanied by a strange laugh as he pointed straight before him and became as it were transfixed  turning to look in the direction indicated they beheld a small indian boy absolutely naked remarkably brown and gazing at them with a look of wonder that was never equalled by the most astonished owl known to natural history  seeing that he was observed the boy turned and fled like an antelope rollin uttered a yell and bounded away in pursuit  the halfbreed could easily have caught him but he did not wish to do so  he merely uttered an appalling shriek now and then to cause the urchin to increase his speed  the result was that the boy led his pursuer straight to the wigwam of his father which was just what rollin wanted  it stood but a short distance from the scene of the wreck  and now when to all appearance they had reached the lowest turn in the wheel of fortune they were raised to the highest heights of joy for the indian proved to be friendly supplied them with provisions to continue their journey and gave them a good bow and quiver of arrows on their simple promise to reward him if he should visit them at red river in the course of the summer  he had not a canoe to lend them however they were therefore constrained to complete their journey over the prairies on foot  you see i said that things might be worse said ian as they lay on their backs beside each other that night after supper each rolled in his blanket and gazing complacently at the stars  yes but you did not say that they might also be better  why did not your prophetic soul enable you to see further and tell of our present state of comparative good fortune mr wiseman asked victor with a sigh of contentment  i did not prophesy vic i only talked of what might be  vat is dat you say vat might be exclaimed rollin  ah vat is is vorse  here am me go to bed vidout my smok  dat is most shockable state i has yet arrive to  poor fellows said ian in a tone of commiseration  you indeed lose everything when you lose that on which your happiness depends  bah ejaculated rollin as he turned his back on his comrades and went to sleep  a feeling of sadness as well as drowsiness came over victor as he lay there blinking at the stars  the loss of their canoe and all its contents was but a small matter compared with the failure of their enterprise for was he not now returning home while tony still remained a captive with the red man  ians thoughts were also tinged with sadness and disappointment on the same account  nevertheless he experienced a slight gleam of comfort as the spirit of slumber stole over him for had he not after all succeeded in killing a grizzly bear and was not the magnificent claw collar round his neck at that very moment with one of the clawpoints rendering him so to speak pleasantly uncomfortable and would he not soon see elsie and thought stopped short at this point and remained thereor left himwe know not which  again we venture to skip  passing over much of that long and toilsome journey on foot we resume the thread of our tale at the point when our three travellers emerging suddenly from a clump of wood one day came unexpectedly to the margin of an unknown sea  lak vinnipeg have busted hisself an cover all de vorld exclaimed rollin with a look of real alarm at his companions  the red river has overflowed and the land is flooded said ian in a low solemn voice  surely surely said victor in sudden anxiety there must have been many houses destroyed since the water has come so far butbut fathers house stands high  ians face wore a troubled look as he replied  ay boy but the water has come more than twelve miles over the plains for i know this spot well  it must be deepvery deepat the willow creek  vat shall ye do vidout bot or canoe  rollins question was not heeded for at that moment two canoes were seen in the distance coming from the direction of lake winnipeg  one was paddled by an indian the other by a squaw and a boy  they made straight for the spot where our travellers were standing  as they drew near victor hailed them  the boy in the bow of the foremost canoe was observed to cease paddling  as he drew nearer his eyes were seen to blaze and eager astonishment was depicted on his painted face  when the canoe touched land he leaped of it and with a yell that would have done credit to the wildest redskin in the prairie rushed at victor leaped into his arms and shouting vic  vic besmeared his face with charcoal ochre vermilion and kisses  to say that victor was taken by surprise would be feeble language  of course he prepared for selfdefence at the first furious rush but the shout of vic opened his eyes he not only submitted to be kissed but returned the embrace with tenfold interest and mixed up the charcoal ochre and vermilion with his mouth and pose and tonys tears of joy  oh it was an amazing sight the meeting of these brothers  it is hard to say whether the eyes or the mouth of the onlookers opened widest petawanaquat was the only one who retained his composure  the eyes of meekeye were moistened despite her native stoicism but her husband stood erect with a grave sad countenance and his blanket folded with his arms in classic fashion on his breast  as for rollin he became and remained for some time a petrifaction of amazement  when the first burst was over victor turned to petawanaquat and as he looked at his stern visage a dark frown settled on his own and he felt a clenching of his fists as he addressed the indian in his native tongue  what made you take him away he demanded indignantly  revenge answered the red man with dignified calmness  and what induces you now to bring him back asked victor in some surprise  forgiveness answered petawanaquat  for a few moments victor gazed at the calm countenance of the indian in silent surprise  what do you mean he asked with a puzzled look  listen replied the indian slowly  petawanaquat loves revenge  he has tasted revenge  it is sweet but the indian has discovered a new fountain  the old white father thirsts for his child  does not the white mans book say if your enemy thirst give him drink  the red man brings tonyquat back in order that he may heap coals of fire on the old white fathers head  the great spirit has taught petawanaquat that forgiveness is sweeter than revenge  he stopped abruptly  victor still looked at him with a puzzled expression  well he said smiling slightly i have no doubt that my father will forgive you now that you have brought back the child  a gleam which seemed to have a touch of scorn in it shot from the indians eye as he rejoined  when petawanaquat brings back tonyquat it is a proof that he forgives the old white father  this was all that the indian would condescend to say  the motives which had decided him to return good for evil were too hazy and complex for him clearly to understand much less explain  he took refuge therefore in dignified silence  victor was too happy in the recovery of his brother to push the investigation further or to cherish feelings of illwill  he therefore went up to the indian and with a smile of candour on his face held out his hand which the latter grasped and shook exclaiming watchee under the belief that these words formed an essential part of every white mans salutation  this matter had barely been settled when a man came out of the woods and approached them  he was one of the red river settlers but personally unknown to any of them  from him they heard of the condition of the settlement  of course they asked many eager questions about their own kindred after he had mentioned the chief points of the disastrous flood  and what of my father samuel ravenshaw asked victor anxiously  what the old man at willow creek whose daughter is married to lambert  married to lambert exclaimed ian turning deadly pale  ay or engaged to be im not sure which replied the man  oh hes all right  the willow creek house stands too high to be washed away the family still lives in itin the upper rooms  and angus macdonald what of him asked ian  an ma meremy moder ole liz rollin an ole daddy has you hear of dem demanded rollin  at the mention of old liz the mans face became grave  angus macdonald and his sister he said are well and with the ravenshaws i believe or at the little mountain their house being considered in danger but old liz rollin he added turning to the anxious halfbreed has been carried away with her hut nobody knows where  they say that her old father and the mother of winklemann have gone along with her  words cannot describe the state of mind into which this information threw poor michel rollin  he insisted on seizing one of the canoes and setting off at once  as his companions were equally anxious to reach their flooded homes an arrangement was soon come to  petawanaquat put tony into the middle of his canoe with victor while ian took the bow paddle  michel took the steering paddle of the other canoe and meekeye seated herself in the bow  thus they launched out upon the waters of the flood and bidding adieu to the settler who had given them such startling information were soon paddling might and main in the direction of the settlement    chapter twenty one  return of the lost one  it chanced that on the morning of the arrival of victor and his comrades at the margin of the flood peegwish went afishing  that astute indian was fond of fishing  it suited his tastes and habits it was an art which was admirably adapted to his tendencies peegwish was naturally as well as by training lazy and what could be more congenial to a lazy man than a gentle art which involved nothing more than sitting on a river bank smoking a pipe and awaiting a bite it had a spice of intellectuality about it too for did it not foster a spirit of meditation contemplation and even of philosophical speculationwhen he chanced to be awake  moreover it saved him from harder labour and shut the mouths of those illnatured people who objected to drones and had a tendency to reproach them for was he not assiduously procuring for men and women a portion of that nourishment without which labour would be impossible  the peculiar action of the flood had favoured peegwish in regard to his beloved art for whereas in former days he was obliged to get up from his lair and go down to the river bank to fish now he had nothing more to do than open the window and cast out his line and wildcat was close at hand to fetch him a light when his pipe chanced to go out which it frequently did for the red old savage slept much  when therefore we say that peegwish went afishing it must be understood that he merely left his seat by the stove in the upper room at willow creek and opened the window  wildcat was as fond of fishing as her brother but there were a few difficulties in her way which did not exist in his  water had to be drawn wood to be chopped moccasins and leggings and coats to be made as well as meals to be cooked  she was therefore compelled to fish in moderation  bring a light said peegwish in that tone of mild entreaty with which he was wont to make his wants known  there being no one else in the room at the moment wildcat obeyed  peegwish looked into the room for a moment and extended his left hand for the piece of lighted stick with his right hand he held his line suddenly that hand received an amazing tug  peegwish unintentionally scattered the firebrand dropped his pipe from his lips and uttered a shout while with both hands he held on to the jerking line  one of mr ravenshaws largest pigs had been swept out of the outhouse lofts  struggling with the stream he passed under the window of the storeroom and came across the line of peegwish with his tail  every one must be familiar with the tendency of tails in general to shut down when touched  the unfortunate pig obeyed the natural law and the line continued to slip until the hook was reached when of course the natural result followed  there could be no hope of escape for the tail was remarkably tough and the line strong  peegwish held on stoutly wildcat lent her aid  the jerking on the tail depressed the snout of the pig whose shrieks being thus varied by intermittent gurgles rendered the noise more appalling and quickly drew the whole household to the windows  unfortunately there were none there but womenmr ravenshaw and the other men being still absent with the boat  the canoe had also been sent off that morning for a load of firewood so that the only way of relieving the pig was to haul him in at the window  but he was too heavy to be thus treated and as peegwish did not wish to break his line and lose his hook he could only hold on in despair while elsie and cora with their mother and wildcat stood by helpless and horrified yet amused by the novelty of the situation and the frightful noise  while this scene was being enacted at willow greek victor with the recovered tony and the rest of them were drawing quickly near  deeply though the hearts of most of these wanderers were filled with anxious fears they could not help being impressed with the scenes of desolationdeserted and submerged homesteads wreck and ruinthrough which they passed  at one moment the two canoes were skimming over the waters of a boundless lake at another they were winding out and in among the trees of a submerged bit of woodland  presently they found themselves among house tops and had to proceed cautiously for fear of sunken fences and then out they swept again over the wide sheet of water where the once familiar prairie lay many feet below  the mapletrees were by that time in full leaf and the rich green verdure of bush and tree was bursting out on all sides when not submerged  swallows skimmed about in hundreds dipping the tips of their blue wings in the flood as though to test its reality while flocks of little yellow birdslike canaries but rather larger with more black on their wingsflitted from bush to tree or from isle to isle  the month of may in those regions is styled the flower month and june the heartberry month but flowers and heartberries were alike drowned out that year in red river of the north and none of the wonted perfumes of the season regaled the noses of our voyagers as they returned home  there they are at last exclaimed victor with sparkling eyes the elms on the knoll  dye see them tony  i do believe i see the smokingbox  but for the bushes we might see the chimneys of willow creek  tonys excitement was great but the effect of his late training was seen in the suppression of all feeling save that which escaped through the eyes  paint and charcoal concealed the flush on his cheeks effectually  tonyquat sees he replied  victor received this with a loud laugh but tony although annoyed did not lose his dignity which the red man in the stern of the canoe observed with a look of pride and satisfaction  michel rollin in the other canoe close alongside was observed to hold up his hand  hush he said turning his head as if to listen  i do hear sometingsometing not meloderous  is it melliferous then asked vic with a smile  but rollin made no reply  he was far from jesting poor fellow at that moment  the thought of his old mother and grandfather and fears as to their fate weighed heavily on his heart and took all the fun out of him  it sounds like pigs said ian  oui  dey be killin porkers said rollin with a nod as he dipped his paddle again and pushed on  as they drew near the excitement of the voyagers increased so did their surprise at the prolonged and furious shrieking  gradually the vigour of their strokes was strengthened until they advanced at racing speed  finally they swept round the corner of the old house at willow creek and burst upon the gaze of its inhabitants while peegwish and the pig were at the height of their struggles  mrs ravenshaw chanced to be the first to observe them  ian macdonald she shouted for his form in the bow of the leading canoe was the most conspicuous  victor cried the sisters with a scream that quite eclipsed the pig  they rushed to another window under which the canoes were pulled up  oh  victor victor cried mrs ravenshaw with a deadly faintness at her heart you havent found  mother cried tony casting off his indian reserve and starting up with a hysterical shout mother  tony exclaimed everybody in the same breath for they all knew his voice though they did not believe their eyes  it was only four feet or so from the canoe to the window  mrs ravenshaw leaned over and seized tonys uplifted hands  elsie and cora lent assistance  a light vault and tony went in at the window from which immediately issued halfstifled cries of joy  at that moment peegwish uttered a terrible roar as he fell back into the room with the broken line in his hand accidentally driving wildcat into a corner  a last supreme effort had been made by the pig  he had broken the hook and went off with a final shriek of triumph  thus amid an appropriate whirlwind of confusion noise and disaster was the longlost tony restored to his mothers arms  seated calmly in the stern of his canoe petawanaquat observed the scene with a look of profound gravity  his revenge was complete  he had returned to his enemy the boy of whom he had become so fond that he felt as though tony really were his own son  he had bowed his head to the dictates of an enlightened conscience  he had returned good for evil a certain feeling of deep happiness pervaded the red mans heart but it was accompanied nevertheless by a vague sense of bereavement and sadness which he could not shake off just then  quite as calmly and as gravely sat ian macdonald  his eyes once more beheld elsie the angel of his dreams but he had no right to look upon her now with the old feelings  her troth was plighted to lambert  it might be that they were already married though he could not bring himself to believe that besides he argued hoping against hope if such were the case elsie would not be living with her fathers family no she was not yet married he felt sure of that but what mattered it a girl whose heart was true as steel could never be won from the man to whom she had freely given herself  no there was no hope and poor ian sat there in silent despair with no sign however of the bitter thoughts within on his grave thoughtful countenance  not less gravely sat michel rollin in the stern of his canoe  no sense of the ludicrous was left in his anxious brain  he had but one idea and that wasold liz  with some impatience he waited until the ladies inside the house were able to answer his queries about his mother  no sooner did he obtain all the information they possessed than he transferred meekeye to her husbands canoe and set off alone in the other to search for the lost hutas winklemann had done before him  meanwhile the remainder of the party were soon assembled in the family room on the upper floor doing justice to an excellent meal of which most of them stood much in need  let me wash that horrid stuff off your face darling before you sit down said miss trim to tony  the boy was about to comply but respect for the feelings of his indian father caused him to hesitate  perhaps the memory of ancient rebellion was roused by the old familiar voice as he replied  tonyquat loves his warpaint  it does not spoil his appetite  it was clear from a twinkle in tonys eye and a slight motion in his otherwise grave face that although this style of language now came quite naturally to him he was keeping it up to a large extent on purpose  tonyquat exclaimed mrs ravenshaw aghast with surprise what does the child mean  ill say tony mother if you like it better he said taking his mothers hand  hes become a redskin said victor halfamused halfanxious  tony said miss trim whose heart yearned towards her old but almost unrecognisable pupil dont you remember how we used to do lessons together and play sometimes  and fight added cora with a glance at ian which caused elsie to laugh  tonyquat does not forget replied the boy with profound gravity  he remembers the lessons and the punishments  he also remembers dancing on the teachers bonnet and scratching the teachers nose  this was received with a shout of delighted laughter for in it the spirit of the ancient tony was recognised  but ian macdonald did not laugh  he scarcely spoke except when spoken to  he seemed to have no appetite and his face was so pale from his long illness that he had quite the air of a sick man  come ian why dont you eat  why you look as white as you did after the grizzly had clawed you all over  this remark and the bearclaw collar on the youths neck drew forth a question or two but ian was modest  he could not be induced to talk of his adventure even when pressed to do so by elsie  come then if you wont tell it i will said victor and thereupon he gave a glowing account of the great fight with the bear the triumphant victory and the long illness which had wellnigh terminated fatally  but why did you not help him in the hunt asked elsie of victor in a tone of reproach  because he wouldnt let us the reason why is best known to himself perhaps native obstinacy had to do with it  it was a passing fancy a foolish one perhaps or a touch of vanity said ian with a smile but it is past now and i have paid for it did you make fast the canoe he added turning abruptly to the indian who was seated on his buffalo robe by the stove  without waiting for an answer he rose and descended the staircase to the passage where poor miss trim had nearly met a watery grave  here the canoe was floating and here he found one of the domestics  has the wedding come off yet he asked in a low but careless tone as he stooped to examine the fastening of the canoe  what wedding said the domestic with a look of surprise  why the wedding of mr ravenshaws daughter  oh no mr ian  it would be a strange time for a wedding  but its all fixed to come off whenever the flood goes down  and she do seem happy about it  you see sir they was throwd a good deal together here of late so it was sort of natural they should make it up and the master he is quite willin  this was enough  ian macdonald returned to the room above with the quiet air of a thoughtful schoolmaster and the callous solidity of a human petrifaction  duty and death were the prominent ideas stamped upon his soul  he would not become reckless or rebellious  he would go through life doing his duty and when the time came he would die  they were talking of course about the flood when he returned and sat down  elsie was speaking  ian was immediately fascinated as he listened to her telling victor with graphic power some details of the great disasterhow dwellings and barns and stores had been swept away and property wrecked everywhere though through the mercy of god no lives had been lost  all this and a great deal more did elsie and cora and mrs ravenshaw dilate upon until ian almost forgot his resolve  suddenly he remembered it  he also remembered that his fathers house still existed though it was tenantless his father and miss martha having gone up to see friends at the mountain  come vic he exclaimed starting up i must go home  the old place may be forsaken but it is not the less congenial on that account come  victor at once complied they descended to the canoe pushed out from the passage and soon crossed the flood to angus macdonalds dwelling    chapter twenty two  the impossible accomplished  and what a dwelling angus macdonalds house had become  what a homecoming exclaimed ian thinking in the bitterness of his soul of elsie as well as the house  its awful said victor with a sympathetic glance at his friend  the desolation was indeed completesymbolic ian thought of the condition of his own heart  besides having eight or ten feet of water on its walls all the lower rooms were utterly wrecked  a heavy log ready for the sawpit had come down with the torrent and taking upon it the duties of a batteringram had charged the parlour window  not only did it carry this bodily into the room but it forced it into the passage beyond where it jammed and stuck fast  the butt of this log projecting several feet from the window had intercepted straw and hay to such an extent that a miniature stack was formed in which all sorts of light articles of furniture and debris had been caught  with the stubborn determination of a celt angus had refused to remove his main door which faced up stream  the result was that the flood removed it for him with a degree of violence that had induced miss martha to exclaim the house is goin at last to which angus had replied doggedly  let it go  it will hef to go some day whatever  but the house had not gone  it was only as we have said the main door which went and was hurled through the passage into the kitchen where it charged the back door wrenched it off and accompanied it to lake winnipeg with a tail of miscellaneous cooking utensils  only shreds of the back windows remained hanging by twisted hinges to the frames telling with mute eloquence of heroic resistance to the last gasp  whatever had not been removed by angus from the groundfloor of his house had been swept out at the windows and doorways as with the besom of destruction  paddling in through the front door the two friends disembarked from their canoe on the staircase and ascended to the upper floor  here everything betokened a hurried departure  furniture was strewn about in disorder articles of clothing were scattered broadcast as if miss martha and her maid had been summoned to sudden departure and had rummaged recklessly for their most cherished possessions  in the principal bedroom on the best bed stood beauty in her native uglinessthe only living thing left to do the honours of the house  what a brute exclaimed victor  he seized a saucepan that stood handy and hurled it at her  beauty was equal to the emergency she leaped up allowed the pan to pass under her fled shrieking through the window and took refuge on the top of the house  im glad you missed her vic said ian in a slightly reproachful tone shes an old friend of the family and a harmless thing  miss trim would not agree with you in your opinion of her returned victor with a laugh but im also glad i missed her  it was a sudden impulse that i couldnt resist and you know a fellow is scarcely accountable for his impulses  true not for his impulses but he is very accountable for actions resulting from impulse  if you had killed beauty i should have had an irresistible impulse to pitch you over the window  if i were to do so in such circumstances would you hold me unaccountable  im not sure said victor with a grim smile  but well change the subject i dont like argument when im likely to get the worst of it its plain that you can do no good here i therefore propose that we return to willow creek take the small boat and go up to the mountain to see father taking tony and petawanaquat along with us  ian shook his head with an expression of sadness that surprised his friend  no vic no my work with you in search of your brother is done my fathers home now claims my chief care  you are wrong in saying i can do no good here look round at the wreck and mess  there is much to be done  now i tell you what ill do  ill remain here all day and all night too  you will return home and send me the little punt if it can be spared for i shall have to row to the outhouses a good deal and round the house too  as you see nothing can be done without a craft of some sort  send peegwish with it without wildcat she would only be in the way  victor tried to induce his friend to change his mind but ian was immoveable  he therefore returned to willow creek in the canoe and sent peegwish back with the punta tublike little boat with two small oars or sculls  left alone ian macdonald leaned on the sill of a window in the gable of the house from which he could see the house at willow creek and sighed deeply  so then he thought all my hopes are blighted my air castles are knocked down my bearhunting has been in vain elsie is engaged to louis lambert  there was no bitterness in his heart now only a feeling of profound loneliness  as he raised himself with another sigh the top of the window tipped off his cap which fell into the water  he cared little for the loss but stood watching the cap as it floated slowly away with the current and compared its receding form with his dwindling joys the current which was not strong there carried the cap straight to the knoll several hundred yards off on which stood the smokingbox of old sam ravenshaw and stranded it there  the incident turned the poor youths mind back to brighter days and other scenes especially to the last conversation which he had held with the owner of the smokingbox  he was mentally enacting that scene over again when peegwish pulled up to the house and passed under the window  come along you old savage said ian with a goodhumoured nod i want your help  go round to the front and shove into the passage  the doorways wide enough  peegwish who was fond of ian replied to the nod with a hideous smile in a few minutes the two were busily engaged in collecting loose articles and bringing things in general into order  while thus engaged they were interrupted by beauty cackling and screaming with tremendous violence  she was evidently in distress running up a ladder leading to the garret ian found that the creature had forced her way through a hole in the roof and entangled herself in a mass of cordage thrown in a heap along with several stout ropes or cables which angus had recently bought with the intention of rigging out a sloop with which to traverse the great lake winnipeg  setting the hen free ian returned to his work  a few minutes later he was again arrested suddenly but not by beauty this time  he became aware of a peculiar sensation which caused a slight throbbing of his heart and clearly proved that although lacerated or even severely crushed that organ was not quite broken  he looked round at peegwish and beheld that savage glaring as if transfixed with mouth and eyes equally wide open  did you feel that peegwish  yes peegwish had felt that and said so in an awful whisper without moving  surelyno it cannot have been the  he stopped short  there was a low grinding sound accompanied by a strange tremor in the planks on which they stood as if the house were gradually coming alive  there could be no mistake  the flood had risen sufficiently to float the house and it was beginning to slide from its foundations  peegwish he said quickly dropping the things with which he had been busy is there a stout rope anywhere  oh yes i forgot he added springing towards the attic  blessings on you beauty for having guided me here  in a few seconds a stout rope or cable was procured  the end of this ian ran out at the main doorway round through the parlour window and tied it in a trice  the other end he coiled in the punt and soon made it fast to a stout elm under whose grateful shade angus macdonald had enjoyed many a pipe and martha many a cup of tea in other days  the tree bent slowly forward the thick rope became rigid  ian and peegwish sat in the boat anxiously looking on  in that moment of enforced inaction ian conceived an idea  thought is quick quicker than light which we believe has reached the maximum of express speed in material things  by intermittent flashes so rapid that it resembled a stream of sparks the whole plan rushed through his mind from conception to completion  we can only give a suggestive outline as follows  the knoll the smokingbox the smoker his words mark what i say  i will sell this knoll to your father and give my daughter to you when you take that house and with your own unaided hands place it on this knoll  the impossible had in the wondrous course of recent events come just within the verge of possibilitya stout arm a strong will coupled with a high floodthere is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the floodimmortal and prophetic bard  there could be no chance of elsie now but even to win the right to claim her if she had been willing was better than nothing  in any case old angus and the knoll would be united  peegwish shouted ian turning on the unfortunate exbrewer with a flushed face and blazing eyes that caused him to shrink in alarm can you sit still and do nothing  eh exclaimed peegwish in surprise  bah said ian seizing the sculls  the punt whirled round leaped over the water dashed through the doorway and went crashing into the staircase  before peegwish could pick himself up ian had vanished up the stairs  the savage found him a moment later wildly selecting a rope from the heap that lay on the floor of the attic  as peegwish entered ian suddenly turned on him with a gaze of increased intensity  had the young man gone mad  peegwish felt very uncomfortable  he had some reason to  another thought had flashed into ians mindthe words your own unaided hands troubled him peegwish could be kept out of the boat but he could not be kept from rendering aid of some sort in some way or other  there was but one resource  ian sprang on peegwish like a lion  the savage was both bold and strong but he was elderly and ian was young and bolder besides he had the unusual strength of a halfmadman at that moment  down went the exbrewer  he struggled hard  ian crushed him in his arms raised him crammed him into a chair seized a pliant rope and bound him therewith winding him and the chair round and round in his hastefor there was no time to tie knotsuntil he resembled a gigantic spool of ravelled thread  not a moment too soon  there was a snap outside the rope was gone  a grind a slide and then a lurch as of a ship at sea  ian is on the staircase now in the punt and out upon the flood with a stout rope fast to the stern and to the doorpost  panting from his recent exertions and halfwild with the mingled excitement danger novelty and fun of the thing he draws two or three long breaths as he grasps the sculls and looks quickly round  the house moves sluggishly probably retarded by sunken shrubs or dragging debris connected with the foundation  this is somewhat of a relief  there is time  he pulls ahead till the rope tightens and then stands up in the punt to observe the situation critically  the current is bearing him straight towards the knoll  so far well but there are two slightly diverging currents on right and left caused by the knoll itself which are so strong that if the house should get fairly into either of them no power that he possessed could prevent its being swept on the one hand into the main current of the red river on the other hand away over the flooded plains  to watch with lynx eyes the slightest tendency to divergence on the part of the house now absorbs his whole being  but thought again intervenes  what if he should be observed by those at willow creek and they should send assistance horror  but by good fortune all the males at the creek have departed and none are left but women  he casts one of the lynx glances in that directionno one is coming  he breathes again freely  suddenly the house diverges a little to the right  away flies the punt to the left and he is just about to bend to the sculls with the force of goliath when he perceives his mistakethe divergence was to the left  in agonies of haste he shoots to the other side where he discovers that the divergence must have been in his own excited brain for the house still holds on the even tenor of its way and ian puffing straight ahead tightens the rope and helps it on its voyage  presently there is a sudden and this time a decided divergence to the rightprobably caused by some undercurrent acting on the foundations away goes the punt in the opposite direction and now goliath and david together were babes to ian  talk of horsepower elephantohippopotamuspower is a more appropriate term  the muscles of his arms rise up like rolls of guttapercha the knotted veins stand out on his flushed forehead but all in vainthe house continues to diverge and ian feeling the game to be all but lost pulls with the concentrated energy of rage and despair  the sculls bend like wands the rowlocks creak the tholepins crack  it wont do  as well might mortal man pull against niagara falls  at this moment of horrible disappointment the house touches something submergeda post a fence a mound he knows not nor cares whatwhich checks the divergence and turns the house back in the right direction  what a rebound there is in ians heart  he would cheer if there were a cubic inch of air to spare in his labouring chestbut there is not and what of it remains must be used in a tough pull to the opposite side for the sheer given to the building has been almost too strong  in a few minutes his efforts have been successful  the house is bearing steadily though slowly down in the right direction  ian rests on his oars a few seconds and wipes his heated brow  soin the great battle of life we sometimes are allowed to pause and breathe awhile in the very heat of conflict and happy is it for us if our thoughts and hearts go out towards him whose love is ever near to bless those who trust in it  he is drawing near to the knoll now and there seems every chance of success but the nearer he draws to the goal the greater becomes the risk of divergence for while the slack water at the head of the knoll becomes slacker so that the house seems to have ceased moving the diverging currents on either side become swifter and their suctionpower more dangerous  the anxiety of the pilot at this stage and his consequent shooting from side to side is far more trying than his more sustained efforts had been  at last the punt reaches the smokingbox which itself stands in several feet of water for the ground of the knoll is submerged its bushes alone being visible  there is only the length of the rope now between our hero and victory  in that length however there are innumerable possibilities  even while he gazes the house bumps on something slews round and is caught by the current on the right  before ian has time to recover from his agony of alarm and dip the sculls it bumps again and slews to the left a third favouring bump sends it back into the slack water  the combined bumps have given an impulse to the house under the influence of which it bears straight down upon the knoll with considerable force  its gableend is close to the smokingbox entranced with expectancy ian sits in the punt panting and with eyes flashing  there is a sudden shock  inside the house peegwish and his chair are tumbled head over heels  outside the gable has just touchedas it were kissedthe smokingbox elsies summerhouse beauty flapping her wings at that moment on the ridgepole crows and angus macdonalds dwelling is finally and fairly hard and fast upon sam ravenshaws knoll    chapter twenty three  found and saved  now it must not be imagined that old liz after being carried away by the flood submitted to her fate without a struggle  it was not in her nature to give in without good reason  she did not sit down and wring her hands or tear her hair or reproach her destiny or relieve her feelings by venting them on the old couple under her charge  in short she did not fall back in her distress on any of the refuges of the imbecile  her first care was to arrange daddy and mrs winklemann in such a manner that they could sleep with some degree of comfort in their chairs  this she did by means of pillows and blankets and after accomplishing it sat down on the wet bed to contemplate the pair  her satisfaction was soon marred however by the discovery that mrs winklemann was given to kicking in her sleep  in one of the spasmodic lunges with her lower limbs she gave daddys legs such a shake that the old gentleman was half awakened by the surprise  it will be remembered that the pair were seated visavis in their respective armchairs with a low table between them and their legs resting thereon  to prevent a recurrence of the kick liz put a piece of broken plank between them on the table and by means of a rope wound round legs and table effectually restrained the unruly members  she then returned to her place on the soaking trucklebed and leaning her wet shoulders against the wall endeavoured to think what was to be done when the return of day should enable her to act  to act was easy to liz but thought was difficult  in attempting it she fell sound asleep  her shape helped her she did not require to lie down  her head merely dropped on one of her fat shoulders  the rotundity of her frame rendered a collapse impossible  thus she slept and snored until daylight shone through the parchment windowsuntil daddy awoke her with a gasping cough  hough  hi  liz theres sumthin wrang wi my legs  hoots haud yer gab cried his polite daughter leaping from her damp couch into the water with no other evidence of feeling than a sharp hech as the cold element laved her limbs  theres naethin wrang wi yer legs only ive tied them to the table to keep them frae tumlin aff  mine boy have he comin back asked mrs winklemann who was awakened by the conversation  na hes no come back yet but hell be here afore lang nae doot  be quiet noo like guid bairns  i canna let yer legs doon yet for the floors dreedfu wat  there she added casting loose the ropes and arranging the limbs more comfortably jist let them lie where they are and ill gie ye yer brekfists in a meenit  she was as good as her word  in a few minutes the submissive pair were busy with bread and cheese which with a little cold water was the only breakfast poor liz had to give them  while the morning meal was being dispensed the anxious little woman thrust a bite or two into her own mouth and ate as she moved about then she told the old people she was gauin up the lum to look aboot her  without more ado she dipped into the fireplace and disappeared up the chimney  her surprise on reaching this point of vantage was very great  the cottage was no longer driven over the bosom of a wide sea but floated quietly in a calm basin surrounded by trees  during the night it had been carried far down in the direction of lake winnipeg and had got entangled in one of the clumps of wood with which some parts of that region were studded  the hut had been so completely thrust into the copse that it was quite encompassed by foliage and nothing of the surrounding country was visible from the chimneytop  the only thing that remained obvious to old liz was the fact that the hut still floated and was held in position by a stout branch which had caught the roof  we have said that thoughtthat is profound or consecutive thoughtwas a trouble to old liz  her mind leaped in an interjectional flashing manner  her actions were impulsive  a tall tree a squirrel and a birdseye view flashed into her brain at the same moment  she desired the last and proceeded to act like the second by seizing a limb of the first which hung conveniently at her elbow  but her emulation of the squirrel was not very successful for although a strong frame and powerful will are useful in climbing tall trees petticoats even when short are against that operation  it is needless to say however that in the case of old liz difficulties were only met to be overcome  in five or ten minutes she stood with dishevelled hair bleeding hands and torn garments among the topmost branches of the tall tree and surveyed the world beneath with feelings of mingled surprise and dismay  there was evidently no abatement of the flood  on her left hand lay a boundless lake on her right there spread out a little archipelago of trees and bushes  while she gazed her eye was arrested by two dark specks on the horizon  could they be boats  yes they moved  clearly they must be either boats or canoes  one of the old womans intellectual flashes occurred at this point there was a fishingrod in the hut below a primitive one such as adam might have used in edenthe branch of a tree  down came old liz much faster than she went up slipping scratching rending grasping and clutching until she gained the chimney down which she went unceremoniously alighting as formerly with a squash which not only alarmed but besprinkled the old couple  liz caught up the rod tied an apron to it and then using it as a lance charged the fireplace  it stuck of course but liz was in no mood to be baffled  she bent the rod powerfully and forced it up following it she emerged from the chimney and with a spirit worthy of excelsior bore her banner to the tall treetop and fastened it to the topmost bough with the last remnant of her torn neckerchief  it was in the morning of the day about which we now write that victor ravenshaw and his friends arrived at the settlement  we have said that michel rollin set off alone in a canoe in search of his mother the moment he obtained sufficient information to enable him to act  at first he paddled wildly over the watery plain as if mere exertion of muscle would accomplish his end but soon he began to consider that without giving definite direction to his energies he could not hope for success  he therefore made straight for the mission station where he found mr cockrans family and people encamped on the stage the minister himself being away in his canoe visiting some of his scattered flock and offering them such comfort as only those can who truly trust in christ  here he was advised to go to the mountain to which place it was probable his mother and grandfather would have been conveyed if picked up by any passing boat or canoe  deciding to do so he paddled away at once with diminishing hopes and a heavy heart for the evidences of total destruction around him were terribly real  he had not gone far when a canoe appeared on the horizon  there was one figure in it  as it drew near the figure seemed familiar  nearer still and he recognised it  vinklemann  michel  the friends arrested their canoes by grasping hands  i seek for ma mere said the halfbreed  i for mine moder returned the german  a hurried consultation ensued  it was of no use going to the mountain winklemann had just come from it having failed to find his mother  he was still suffering from the effects of his recent accident but he could not wait  he would continue the search till he died  rollin was of the same mind though neither he nor his friend appeared likely to die soon  they resolved to continue the search together  both of them were thoroughly acquainted with the red river plains in all directions but rollin was more versed in the action of water  the greater part of his boyhood had been spent in canoeing and hunting expeditions with his father from whom he inherited the french tongue and manners which showed so much more powerfully than the scotch element in his composition  after his fathers death he had consorted and hunted much with peegwish who spoke indian and french but remarkably little english  peegwish was also a splendid canoeman so that rollin had come to study with great intelligence the flow and effect of currents of water whether deep or shallow narrow or broad  hence when winklemann related circumstantially all he had done he shook his head and gave it as his opinion that he had not gone the right way to work at all and that according to the lie of the land and the height of the flood it was certain the hut must have been carried far below that part of the settlement in the direction of the lower fort  poor winklemann was so worn out with unsuccessful searching that he was only too glad to follow wherever michel rollin chose to lead  hence it came to pass that in the afternoon of the same day the searchers came in view of the tall tree where old liz had hoisted her flag of distress  voila exclaimed michel on first catching sight of the ensign  vat is dat said his companion paddling closer alongside of his friend and speaking in a hoarse whisper  it look like a flag said rollin pushing on with increased vigour theres something like one crow below it he added after a short time  it have stranch voice for von crow said the german  he was right  the yell of triumphant joy uttered by old liz when she saw that her signal had been observed was beyond the imitative powers of any crow  as the poor creature waved her free arm and continued to shout while her loose hair tossed wildly round her sooty face she presented a spectacle that might well have caused alarm not unmixed with awe even in a manly breast but there was a certain tone in the shouts which sent a sudden thrill to the heart of rollin causing him strange to say to think of lullabies and infant days  with eyeballs fixed on the treetop openmouthed and breathing quick he paddled swiftly on  michel said winklemann in a whisper even hoarser than before your moder  rollin replied not but gave a stentorian roar that rolled grandly over the water  why was it that old liz suddenly ceased her gesticulations lifted her black brows in unutterable surprise opened her mouth and became a listening statue  did she too recognise tones which recalled other daysand the puling cries of infancy  it might have been so  certain it is that when the shout was repeated she broke down in an effort to reply and burst into mingled laughter and tears at the same time waving her free arm more violently than ever  this was too much for the branch on which she had been performing  it gave way and old liz suddenly came down as sailors have it by the run  she crashed through the smaller branches of the treetop which happily broke her fall bounded from mass to mass of the thicker foliage below and finally came down on a massive bough which shunting her clear of the tree altogether and clear of the hut as well sent her headlong into the water  with something like frozen blood and marrow michel witnessed the fall a few seconds more and his canoe went crashing through the leafy screen that hid the hut  old liz was up and floundering about like a black seal or mermaid  she could not swim but owing to some peculiarity of her remarkable frame she could not sink  her son was at her side in a moment seized her and tried to kiss her  in his eagerness the canoe overturned and he fell into her arms and the water at the same time  it was a joyful though awkward meeting  much water could not quench the love wherewith the poor creature strained michel to her heart winklemann came up in time to rescue both and dragged them to the doorstep of the floating hut the door of which he burst open with a single kick and sprang in  who shall attempt to describe the meeting that followed  we ask the question because we feel unequal to the task  there issued from the hut a roll of german gutturals  winklemann rushing through two feet of water seized his mothers hand and fell on his knees beside her  he was thus of course submerged to the waist but he recked notnot he michel and old liz entered dripping like waternymphs and sat down on the soppy bed  daddy impressed with the idea that a good practical joke was being enacted smiled benignantly like a guardian angel  now den zee night draws on  ve must be gone said winklemann turning to rollin git zee canoes readyqveek  both canoes were soon got ready blankets and pillows were spread in the centre of each  mrs winklemann was lifted carefully into one daddy as carefully into the other  old liz quietly took her seat in the bow of daddys canoe her son sat down in the stern while herr winklemann took charge of that which contained his mother  no room to take any of de property tonight ma mere said michel  hoots niver heed replied liz  no i vill not heed  moreover veenklemann and moi ve vill retoorn demorrow  as he spoke he chanced to look up and saw the apron which had guided him to the spot waving gently at the treetop  in a few seconds he was beside it  cutting the staff free he descended and stuck it in the bow of his canoe as a trophy  thus they paddled away from the old home  it was night when they reached the camp of the settlers on the little mountain  the homeless people were busy with their evening meal and sad though their case was the aspect of things just then did not convey the idea of distress  the weather was fine campfires blazed cheerfully lighting up bronzed and swarthy men comely women and healthy children with a ruddy glow while merry laughter now and then rose above the general hum for children care little for unfelt distress and grown people easily forget it in present comfort  ruined though they were many of them felt only the warmth of the hour  there was a shout of welcome when winklemanns canoe was observed emerging from surrounding darkness and a cheer burst from those who first heard the glad newsthe old folk saved  but that was a mere chirp to the roar of congratulation that rang out when the little party landed and the rescuers strode into camp bearing the rescued in their arms    chapter twenty four  a surprising discoveryand more  when ian macdonald had seen his fathers house fairly stranded on the knoll and had made it fast there with innumerable ropes thin and thick as the lilliputians secured gulliver he bethought him that it was high time to visit the little mountain to which his father had gone on at that time and inform him of the amazing fact  before setting off however common propriety required that he should look in at willow creek in passing not only to let them know what had occurred if they had not already observed it but to ask if there was any message for mr ravenshaw  first releasing peegwish who now regarded him as a maniac he embarked with him in the punt and rowed over  it was by that time approaching the afternoon  before thatindeed before the house of angus had gone afloattony victor and petawanaquat had gone off to the little mountain in search of mr ravenshaw  those of the family who remained behind had been so busy about their various avocations that no one had observed the sudden removal of their neighbours dwelling  cora quick come here cried elsie in a tone that alarmed her sister  am i dreaming  cora looked out at the window where the other stood as if petrified angus macdonalds house on the knoll she screamed  the scream brought her mother and miss trim hurriedly into the room they stared in speechless amazement and rubbed their eyes but they could not rub the house of angus macdonald off the knoll  there comes ian in the punt said cora he will explain it  he seems to be miserable enough about it if one may judge from the expression of his face observed miss trim  poor ian was indeed profoundly miserable  the excitement of the recent event over his mind insisted on reverting to his forlorn condition so near he thought and yet to miss her  old ravenshaw could not refuse her to me now but of what avail is his consent without elsies ah lambert youre a lucky fellow and it is shameful in me to wish it were otherwise when it makes elsie happy  ian now tried to act philosophically but it would not do  in the upper room he gave the ladies a brief account of his adventure  he spoke in a cold passionless manner without looking once at elsie  of course he did not reveal the motives that had influenced him  when he had finished he rose abruptly to leave  dont go yet said mrs ravenshaw theres a bit of carpentering that i want done and there is not a man left at the house to do it  the last gale loosened some of the shingles on the roof and one of them slipped down today so that the place leaksgo elsie and show him the shingle near the attic window  ian looked at elsie and his resolves vanished like smoke  he went meekly to the attic  you are much changed said elsie since you went on this trip  changed  not for the worse i hope said ian  well scarcely for the better returned the girl with a smile  see here is the window and the loose shingle is close to the sill  you wont require to go out on the roof  there is fathers toolbox  if you want anything some of us will be in the room below  you may call or come down  stay elsie said the youth turning abruptly on her  you say i am changed  well perhaps i am  ive gone through pretty severe hardships since we parted and the injuries i received on gaining this have left their mark  he touched as he spoke the splendid bearclaw collar which still graced his neck  i doubt not you have suffered returned elsie in a softened tone but you are now well or nearly so and your reason is not a sufficient one to account for your being rude to all your old friends and taking no interest in anything  am i then so rude so callous rejoined ian drawing his hand across his brow  ah  elsie ififbut what am i saying  forgive me  i think that grizzly must have touched my brain when he had me under his paw  there can be no harm however in telling you that a wish lightly expressed by you long ago has been the motive power which led to the procuring of this collar  will you accept it of me now  it is but a trifle yet being a bad hunter and more used to grammars than to guns it cost me no trifle of anxiety and trouble before i won it  i am afraid that the hope of procuring it for you had almost as much to do with cheering me on as the hope of finding tony  nay dont refuse it elsie from one who has known you so long that he feels almost as if he might regard you as a sister  he took off the collar as he spoke and with a return of his wonted heartiness presented it to elsie  there was something in his manner however which induced her to blush and hesitate  your kindness in searching for tony we can never forget or repay she said quickly andand  she paused  well well continued ian a little impatiently i did not mean to talk of tony just now  surely you wont refuse a gift from so old a friend as i on the eve of my departure for canada  for canada echoed elsie in surprise  yes  i leave the instant i can get my affairs in red river settled  and you return  never  elsie looked at the youth in undisguised astonishment  she too began to suspect that a claw of the collar must have touched his brain  but why hesitate continued ian  surely you cannot refuse me so simple a favour  even lambert himself would approve of it in the circumstances  lambert exclaimed elsie with increasing amazement what has lambert got to do with it  it was now ians turn to look surprised  forgive me if i have touched on a forbidden subject but as every one in the settlement seems to know of your engagement to lambert i thought  my engagement interrupted elsie  it is cora who is engaged to lambert  a sudden and mighty shock seemed to fall on ian macdonald  he slightly staggered paled a little then became fiery red leaped forward and caught the girls hand  elsie  elsie he exclaimed in tones of suppressed eagerness will will you accept the collar  he put it over her head as he spoke and she blushed deeply but did not refuse it  and elsie he added in a deeper voice drawing her nearer will you accept the hunter  no answered elsie with such an arch smile but i would accept the schoolmaster if he were not going away to canada for  she did not finish the sentence because something shut her mouth  youre taking a very long time to that shingle called mrs ravenshaw from below  have you got everything you want ian  yes replied ian promptly ive got all that the world contains  whats that you say  it will soon be done now mother cried elsie breaking away with a soft laugh and hurrying downstairs  she was right  a few minutes sufficed to put the loose shingle to rights and then ian descended to the room below  what a time you have been about it said cora with a suspicious glance at the young mans face and how flushed you are  i had no idea that fixing a loose shingle was such hard work  oh yes its tremendously hard work said ian recovering himself you have to detach it from the roof you know and it is wonderful the tenacity with which nails hold on sometimes and then theres the fitting of the new shingle to the  come dont talk nonsense said cora you know that is not what kept you  you have been telling some secret to elsie  what was it  instead of answering ian turned with a twinkle in his eyes and asked abruptly  by the waywhen does louis lambert return  it was now coras turn to flush  i dont know she said bending quickly over her work how should i know  but you have not answered my questionoh look there  she pointed to the doorway where a huge rat was seen seated looking at them as if in solemn surprise at the trifling nature of their conversation  not sorry to have a reason for escaping ian uttered a laughing shout threw his cap at the creature missed and rushed out of the room in chase of it  of course he did not catch it but continuing his flight downstairs he jumped into the punt pushed through the passage and out at the front door  as he passed under the windows he looked up with a smile and saw cora shaking her little fist at him  you have not improved in your shooting she cried you missed the rat  never mind he replied lambert will fetch his rifle and hunt for it and i say cora ask elsie to explain how shingles are put on  she knows all about it  he kissed his hand as he turned the corner of the house and rowed away  a dark shadow falling over him at the moment caused him to turn round and there to his amazement stood one of his fathers largest barns it had been floated like many other houses from its foundation and having been caught by a diverging current had been stranded on the lawn at the side of mr ravenshaws house so as to completely shut out the view in that direction  intense amusement followed ians feeling of surprise  his first impulse was to return and let the inmates of willow creek know what had occurred but be thinking himself that they would find it out the first time they chanced to look from the windows on that side of the house and observing that the day was advancing he changed his mind and rowed away in the direction of the plains chuckling heartily as he meditated on the very peculiar alterations which the flood had effected on the properties of his father and samuel ravenshaw to say nothing of the probable result in regard to his own future  a stiffish breeze sprang up soon after he left  being a fair wind he set up a rag of sail that fortunately chanced to be in the punt and advanced swiftly on his voyage to the little mountain  on their way to the same place at an earlier part of the day victor and tony with petawanaquat and meekeye touched at the mission station many of the people were still on the stage but mrs cockran finding that the water had almost ceased to rise and that the parsonage still stood fast returned to the garret of her old home  here she received victor and the recovered tony with great delight  it chanced to be about the period which tony styled feedingtime so that although victor was anxious to reach his father as soon as possible he agreed to remain there for an hour or so  while they were enjoying the hospitality of the garret petawanaquat was entertained in a comparatively quiet corner of the stage by a youth named sinclair a scotch halfbreed who had been a pupil in ian macdonalds school and latterly an assistant  petawanaquat had made the acquaintance of young sinclair on his first visit to red river  they were kindred spirits  both were earnest men intensely desirous of finding out truthtruth in regard to everything that came under their notice but especially in reference to god and religion  this grave thoughtful disposition and earnest longing is by no means confined to men of refinement and culture  in all ranks and conditions among men from the socalled savage upwards there have been found more or less profound thinkers and honest logical reasoners who but for the lack of training might have become pillars in the world of intellect  both sinclair and petawanaquat were naturally quiet and modest men but they were not credulous  they did not absolutely disbelieve their opponents or teachers but while giving them full credit for honesty and sinceritybecause themselves were honest and sincerethey nevertheless demanded proof of every position advanced and utterly refused to take anything on credit  bigoted men found them obstinate and troublesome  capable reasoners found them interesting sinclair possessed a considerable amount of education and spoke the indian language fluently  petawanaquat although densely ignorant had an acute and logical mind  to look at them as they sat there spoon in hand over a pan of burgout one would not readily have guessed the drift of their conversation  it almost broke my heart said sinclair when i heard you had stolen mr ravenshaws boy and words cannot express my joy that you have repented and brought him back  what induced you to steal him  my bad heart replied the indian  was it then your good heart that made you bring him back asked sinclair with a keen glance at his friend  no it was the voice of the great spirit in petawanaquat that made him do it  the voice said forgive  return good for evil  ah you learned these words here and have been pondering them  petawanaquat heard them here he did not learn them here returned the red man quietly  listen he continued with a sudden glow of animation on his countenance my brother is young but he knows much and is wise  he will understand his friend  in the mountains i pitched my tent  it was a lonely spot  no trappers or indians came there but one day in winter a paleface came  he was a servant of the great spirit he talked much  i said little but listened  the paleface was very earnest  he spoke much of jesus  he told the story of his love his sufferings his death  he spoke of little else  when he was gone i asked jesus to forgive me  he forgave  then i was glad but i looked at tonyquat and my spirit was troubled  then it was that i heard the voice of the great spirit  it did not fall on my ear it fell upon my heart like the rippling of a mountain stream  it said send the child back to his father  i obeyed the voice and i am here  with sparkling eyes sinclair stretched out his right hand and grasping that of the red man said in a deep voicemy brother  petawanaquat returned the grasp in silence  before either of them could resume the conversation they were interrupted by victor shouting from a window of the parsonage to fetch the canoe  a few minutes later they were again on their way    chapter twenty five  brings things to a point  while tony was being received at the old home as already related and michel rollin and winklemann were rescuing their mothers and ian macdonald was busy transplanting his fathers house mr samuel ravenshaw was sitting disconsolate on the little mountain  lest the reader should still harbour a false impression in regard to that eminence we repeat that the little mountain was not a mountain it was not even a hill  it was merely a gentle elevation of the prairie only recognisable as a height because of the surrounding flatness  among the settlers encamped on this spot the children were the most prominent objects in the scene because of their noise and glee and mischievous rapidity of action  to them the great floods had been nothing but a splendid holiday  such camping out such paddling in many waters such games and romps round booths and tents such chasing of cattle and pigs and poultry and other live stock and above all such bonfires  it was a glorious time  no lessons no being looked after no restraint of any kind  oh it was such fun  it was the sight of this juvenile glee that made mr ravenshaw disconsolate  seated in the opening of a tent he smoked his pipe and looked on at the riotous crew with a tear in each eye and one that had overflowed at the point of his nose  the more these children laughed and shouted the more did the old gentleman feel inclined to weep  there was one small boya halfbreed with piercing black eyes and curly hair whose powers of mischief were so great that he was almost equal to the lost tony  he did his mischief quietly and as it were with restrained enthusiasm  for instance this imp chanced to be passing a group of canadian buffalohunters seated round one of the campfires enjoying a can of tea  one of them raised a pannikin to his lips  the imp was at his elbow like a flash of light the elbow was tipped by the merest accident and half of the tea went over the hunters legs  the awful look of hypocritical selfcondemnation put on by the imp was too much for the hunter who merely laughed and told him to get along which he did with a yell of triumph  old mr ravenshaw felt a strong desire to embrace that boy on the spot so vividly did he bring before his mind his beloved tony  sometimes the older people in that miscellaneous camp emulated the children in riotous behaviour  of course in such an assemblage there were bad as well as good people and some of the former taking advantage of the unprotected state of things went about the camp pilfering where opportunity offered  one of these was at last caught in the act and the exasperated people at once proceeded to execute summary justice  the thief was a big strong sulkylooking fellow  he was well known as an incorrigible idler who much preferred to live on the labours of other men than to work  the captor was baptiste warder the halfbreed chief who had acted so conspicuous a part in the buffalo hunt of the previous season  lets string him up cried john flett as warder grasping the thiefs collar led him into the middle of the camp  but there were two objections to this proceeding  first it was deemed too severe for the offence and second there was not a tree or a post or any convenient object whereon to hang him  roast him alive suggested david mowat but this also was laughed at as being disproportioned to the offence  duck him cried sam hayes  this was hailed as a good proposal though some were of opinion it was too gentle  however it was agreed to with this addition that the culprits capote should be cut to pieces  in order to accomplish the latter part of the ceremony with more ease one of the men removed the capote by the simple process of ripping the back up to the neck and slitting the sleeves with a scalpingknife  the man here showed a disposition to resist and began to struggle but a quiet squeeze from warder convinced him that it was useless  he was then seized by four men each of whom grasping an arm or a leg carried him down to the waters edge  they passed mr ravenshaw in the opening of his tent  he rose and followed them  serves him right said the old gentleman on hearing who it was and what he had done  ay hes done worse than that said one of the men who carried him its only last sunday that he stole a blanket out of old rentons tent and that too when mr cockran was holding service here but well put a stop to such doings  now then heave togetherone two three  the four powerful men hurled the thief into the air with vigour  he went well up and out came down with a sounding splash and disappeared amid shouts of laughter  he rose instantly and with much spluttering regained the shore where he was suffered to depart in peace by the executioners of the law who returned quietly to their tents  mr ravenshaw was left alone moralising on the depravity of human nature  the sun was setting in a blaze of golden light and tipping the calm waters of the flood with lines of liquid fire  turning from the lovely scene with a sigh the old trader was about to return to his tent when the sound of a voice arrested him  it came from a canoe which had shot suddenly from a clump of halfsubmerged trees by which it had been hitherto concealed  as the canoe approached mr ravenshaw ascended a neighbouring mound to watch it  soon it touched the shore and three of its occupants landedan indian and two boys  a woman who occupied the bow held the frail bark steady  the indian at once strode up towards the camp  in doing so he had to pass the mound where mr ravenshaw was seated on a ledge of rock  he looked at the trader and stopped  at the same moment the latter recognised petawanaquat  if a mine had been sprung beneath his feet he could not have leaped up with greater celerity  then he stood for a moment rooted to the spot as if transformed into stonewith mouth open and eyes glaring  to behold his enemy standing thus calmly before him as if they had only parted yesterday and were on the best of terms with no expression on his bronzed visage save that of grave solemnity was almost too much for him  he grasped convulsively the heavy stick which he usually carried the thought of the foul wrong done him by the red man rushed into his memory with overwhelming force  it did not occur to him to remember his own evil conduct  with a roar of rage worthy of a buffalo bull he rushed towards him  the red man stood firm  what the result would have been if they had met no one can tell for at that moment an indian boy ran forward and planted himself right in front of the angry man  father  mr ravenshaw dropped his cudgel and his jaw and stood aghast  the painted face was that of a savage but the voice was the voice of tony  the old man shut his mouth and opened his arms  tony sprang into them with a wild cheer that ended in a burst of joyful tears  the way in which that boy hugged his sire and painted his face all over by rubbing his own against it was a sight worth seeing  it had been a concerted plan between tony and victor that the latter was to keep a little in the background while the former should advance and perplex his father a little before making himself known but tony had overestimated his powers of restraint  his heart was too large for so trifling a part  he acted up to the promptings of nature as we have seen and absolutely howled with joy  dont choke him tony remonstrated victor mind you are stronger than you used to be  ha  choke me gasped mr ravenshaw try it my boy just try it  tony did try it  but we must not prolong this scene  it is enough to say that when tony had had his face washed and stood forth his old self in all respectsexcept that he looked two or three sizes larger more sunburnt and more manlyhis father quietly betook himself to his tent and remained there for a time in solitude  thereafter he came out and assuming a freeandeasy offhand look of composure which was clearly hypocritical ordered tea  this was soon got ready and the joyful party seated themselves round the campfire which now sent its ruddy blaze and towering column of sparks into the darkening sky  victor was not long in running over the chief outlines of their long chase and also explained the motives of the red manas far as he understood themin bringing tony back  well vic said mr ravenshaw with a puzzled look its a strange way of taking his revenge of me  but after all when i look at him there sucking away at his calumet with that pleased grave face i cant help thinkin that you and i christians though we call ourselves have something to learn from the savage  ive been mistaken vic in my opinion of petawanaquat  anyhow his notion of revenge is better than mine  it must be pleasanter to him now to have made us all so happy than if he had kept tony altogether or put a bullet through me  its a clever dodge too for the rascal has laid me under an obligation which i can never repaymade me his debtor for life in fact  its perplexing vic very much so but satisfactory at the same time  there were still more perplexing things in store for old samuel ravenshaw that night  but why did you not bring ian macdonald along with you vic he asked i expect his father here this evening from fort garry where he went in the morning for some pemmican  before victor had time to reply ian himself stepped out of the surrounding darkness  just previous to this the party had been joined by herr winklemann and michel rollin who after seeing their respective mothers made as comfortable as possible in the circumstances had been going about the camp chatting with their numerous friends  louis lambert had also joined the circle and peegwish stood modestly in the background  come along ian we were just talking of you said mr ravenshaw heartily as he rose and extended his hand for the disagreeables of his last meeting with the young man had been obliterated by the subsequent kindness of ian in going off to aid in the search for tony  ian returned the grasp with good will but he soon destroyed the good understanding by deliberately and it seemed unwisely referring to the two points which still rankled in the old mans breast  tut man said mr ravenshaw a little testily why drag in the subjects of the knoll and my elsie tonight of all nights in the year  because i cannot avoid it said ian  events have occurred today which compel me to speak of themof the knoll at least  oh for the matter of that interrupted the old gentleman angrily you may speak of elsie too and the old woman and cora and all the household to boot for all that i care  i come here to claim a right went on ian in a calm voice  it is well known that samuel ravenshaw is a man of his word that what he promises he is sure to perform that he never draws back from an agreement  this speech took mr ravenshaw by surprise  he looked round until his eyes rested on tony  then he said in a slightly sarcastic tone  what you say is true  even tony knows that  tonyquat knows that what ian says of his white father is true said the boy  at the name tonyquat which was the only word of the sentence he understood petawanaquat cast a look of affection on tony while his father and the others burst into a laugh at the childs sententious gravity  but tony maintained his indian air and gazed solemnly at the fire  well go on ian said the old gentleman in somewhat better humour  you remember our last meeting in the smokingbox on the knoll continued ian  too well said the other shortly  part of what you said was in the following words mark what i say  i will sell this knoll to your father and give my daughter to you when you take that house and with your own unaided hands place it on the top of this knoll  well you have a good memory ian  these are the words i used when i wished to convince you of the impossibility of your obtaining what you wanted said mr ravenshaw with the determined air of a man who is resolved not to be turned from his purpose  what you wanted to convince me of rejoined ian has nothing to do with the question  it is what you said that i have to do with  again the irascible furtraders temper gave way as he said  well what i said i have said and what i said ill stick to  just so returned ian with a peculiar smile and knowing this i have come here to claim the knoll for my father and elsie for myself  this was such a glaring absurdity in the old gentlemans eyes that he uttered a short contemptuous laugh  at that moment angus macdonald appeared upon the scene  his look of amazement at beholding his son may be imagined  angus was not however demonstrative  he only stepped across the fire and gave ian a crushing squeeze of the hand  it iss fery glad to see you i am my poy but it is taken py surprise i am whatever  an ho  as his eyes fell on tony it iss the child you hef found  well it iss a happy father you will pe this night mr ruvnshaw  i wish you choy  dont let me stop you whatever  it wass something interesting you would pe telling these chentlemen when i came up  i was just going to tell them father said ian resting a hand on his sires shoulder that i have come straight from willow creek with the news that this day i have with my own unaided handshe cast a sidelong glance at the old gentlemantransported your house to mr ravenshaws knoll and have asked elsie ravenshaw to be my wife and been accepted  moreover continued ian in a calm steady tone my fathers biggest barn has without any assistance from any one stranded itself on mr ravenshaws lawn  bless me ian iss it jokin ye are  no father  its in earnest i am  good reader the aspect of the partyespecially of old ravenshaw and anguson hearing these announcements is beyond our powers of description we therefore prefer to leave it to your own vivid imagination    chapter twenty six  the last  a changelike the flashing colours of a kaleidoscope like the phantoms of a dream  red river settlement is dry again or drying but ah what a scene of wreck and ruin  it looks as if the settlement had been devastated by fire and sword as well as water  brokendown houses uprooted fences and trees piles of debris beds and boxes billets of wood and blankets habiliments and hay carioles and cordage and carcasses of cattle all mixed up more or less and cemented together with mud  nearly every house in the settlement had been destroyed  of course many a day passed after the great catastrophe before red river was itself again with its river confined to the proper channel and its prairies rolling with grasswaves but it was not long before the energetic inhabitants returned to their labours and their desolated houses to begin the world anew  about the 1st of may the flood began by the 20th of the same month it had reached its height and on the 22nd the waters began to assuage  on that day they had made a decided fall of two inches  the height to which the waters had risen above the level of ordinary years was fifteen feet  the flood subsided very gradually about the middle of june the ploughs were at work again and the people busy sowing what was left to them of their seedbarley and potatoes  among the busiest of the busy at that bustling time was peegwish  while others were hard at work clearing rebuilding ploughing and sowing our noble savage was fishing  the labour of this occupation consisted chiefly in staring at his line while he sat on a mudheap on the river bank and smoked in the pleasant sunshine  occasionally he roused himself to haul out a goldeye  wildcat assisted him ably in his labours and still more ably in the after consumption of the goldeyes angus macdonald discovered them thus occupied and had difficulty in resisting his desire to pitch the lazy fellow into the river  what wass you doin there he cried  wass it wastin your time wi small fush you will pe doin an every wan else workin hard  go an putt the ox in the cart an haul watter  look sharp  angus concluded with some deep gutturals in gaelic which we cannot translate and peegwish rising hastily went off to do as he was bid but peegwish was a poor waterdrawer  the ox turned out to be more obstinate than himself and also more callous for when it became fatigued with hauling the waterbarrel to and fro it stopped at the foot of the slope near a corner of the garden and refused to budge peegwish lashed it but it did not feelat all events it did not care he tried to wheedle it but failed he became abusive and used bad language to the ox but without success  he was in the height of his distress when petawanaquat passed by with a load of firewood on his shoulder  the red man having been reconciled to his old enemy had remained at red river partly to assist him partly to see the end of the flood and partly to be near his friend sinclair and his adopted son tonyquat  from the latter he could not tear himself away  the indian stood and gazed solemnly at his brother savage for some minutes then he threw down his load and entering the garden cut the remains of a cabbage which had survived the flood  with this he went to the ox and held it to its nose  the animal advanced the indian retreated a few steps  the ox advanced again in the hope of obtaining a savoury mouthful but the indian still retreated  thus step by step the slope was ascended  wah said petawanaquat with a grave look as he handed the cabbage to peegwish who profited by the lesson and gained his ends  shes fery lazy muttered angus to himselfreferring to peegwishas he went up the river bank towards the knoll where his house now stood triumphantly fery lazy more lazy thanthan  failing to find a just comparison he tailed off in expressive but untranslatable gaelic  goot tay to you muster ruvnshaw said angus on reaching the summit of the knoll  it wass fery goot of you whatever to let my hoose stand here  dont mention it angus said the old gentleman removing his pipe with one hand and extending the other  it would be difficult to prevent it remaining where it is now  besides i passed my word you know and that cannot be broken  come sit down  im thankful your house was so considerate as to spare my smokingbox though it has given it a shove of a few feet to the southard  in other respects the house is an advantage for while it has not hurt the view it serves to protect my box from the quarter which used to be exposed to east winds but there is one stipulation i have to make angus before the bargain is closed  an what may that pe asked angus with a shade of anxiety  that this smokingbox and the ground on which it stands together with the footpath leading up to it shall remain my property as long as i live  angus smiled  he had the peculiarity of turning the corners of his mouth down instead of up when he did so which gave a remarkably knowing look to his smile  you shall pe fery welcome he said  and now muster ruvnshaw i came here to say a word for my poy  you know it iss natural that ian will pe getting anxious apout the wedding  it iss impatient he will pe whatever  he is a little shy to speak to you himself and he will pe botherin me to  all right angus i understand interrupted mr ravenshaw  you know both he and lambert are busy removing your barn from my lawn  when that is finished we shall have the weddings  my old woman wants em to be on the same day but nothing can be done till the barn is removed for i mean to have the dance on that lawn on the doublewedding day  so you can tell them that  angus did tell them that and it is a remarkable fact which every one in the establishment observed that the unsightly barn which had so long disfigured the lawn at willow creek disappeared as if by magic in one night as cora put it like the baseless fabric of a vision  time passed and changed the face of nature entirely  wrecks were swept away houses sprang up fences were repaired crops waved on the fields of red river as of yore and cattle browsed on the plains so that if a stranger had visited that outlying settlement there would have been little to inform his eyes of the great disaster which had so recently swept over the place  but there would have been much to inform his ears for it was many a day before the interest and excitement about the great flood went down  in fact for a long time afterwards the flood was so much in the thoughts and mouths of the people that they might have been mistaken for the immediate descendants of those who had swarmed on the slopes of ararat  let us now present a series of pictures for the readers inspection  the first is a little loghut embosomed in bushes with a stately tree rising close beside it  flowers and berries bedeck the surrounding shrubbery pleasant perfumes fill the air  a small garden in which the useful and ornamental are blended environs the hut  the two windows are filled with glass not parchment  a rustic porch covered with twining plants conceals the door and a general air of tidiness marks all the surroundings  need we say more to convince the intelligent reader that this is the hut of old liz  it occupies the spot where it was deposited by the flood the family having been allowed to remain there  under the genius of herr winklemann and michel rollin the old hut has displayed some characteristics of the cactus in sending forth offshoots from its own body  an offshoot in the rear is the kitchen another on the right is a mansion as large nearly as the parent in which winklemann has placed his mother to the great relief of daddy who never forgot and with difficulty forgave the old womans kicking habits when their legs reposed together on the table  it must be added however that the old people live on good terms and that mrs winklemann frequently visits daddy and smokes with him  the offshoot on the left built by michel is a stable and an excrescence beyond is a cowhouse  there are fowls in front of the hut and flour sugar pork and tea within so it may be concluded that the families are now in comfort  when the improvements just mentioned were completed michel rollin unable to settle down had arranged with peegwish and wildcat to go off on a fishing expedition  before starting he entered the hut and said to winklemann who was filling his moders pipe for her  you vill be here ven i come back  you vill not leave the ol peepil  no i vill stope till you retoorns  be sure i vill take care of zee old vons  but dere is not much fear of anodor flood joost now  what says he liz asked old daddy with a hand to his ear  speak oot  oh hes jist haverin aboot the flood  he says theres nae fear o anither flood an i think hes aboot right  im no sae sure o that returned daddy whose memory for the past was much stronger than for current events  its been said on the best authority that there was a seemilar flood i the year seeventeen hunner an seeventysax anither in seeventeen ninety an anither in aughteen hunner an nine  hoots haud yer gab  what div ye ken aboot floods  daddy hearing nothing and believing from the pleasant expression of lizs countenance that she appreciated his remarks nodded to mrs winklemann cheerily and smiled  ha laughed her son you is von stranch being old lizver stranch  having finished the filling of his moders pipe and lighted it for her herr winklemann arose and followed his friend michel out of the hut  let us look at another picture  it is a pair of cottages close to each other and about a stones cast from the farm at willow creek  the buildings are new and much alike in form and size  there are welltilled fields around and fat cattle and a few sheep  the insides of these mansions have not much to boast of in the way of ornament but there is enough to display the influence the good taste and the refinement of woman  immediately after the abating of the waters ian macdonald and louis lambert set to work to build these houses and you may be sure they were not long about it for the tyrannical old fatherinlaw elect not only compelled them to take down the barn on the lawn before the weddings but also to build houses for their brides  and after the knots were tied and the dance on the lawn at willow creek was over and the happy couples were fairly established in their own homes they kept open house for a long time and interchanged innumerable visits between bearclaw cottage that was ians and hunters lodge that was lamberts and the ark on ararat that was the house of angus and willow creek insomuch that tony was heard one day to inform miss trim confidentially that he found it difficult to tell where he lived or which was his proper homeand miss trim confessed that she was in much the same condition of mind  what an amazing time we have passed through said miss trim referring to the flood at one of their social gatherings  yes said victor hastily for he knew that miss trim was on the point of delivering one of her parenthetical and pointless orations it was indeed an amazing time  such boating on the plains and such camping out  to say nothing of tumbling into the water and being half drowned  by the way asked ian was not poor john flett nearly drowned about the beginning of the flood  of course he was said mr ravenshaw and if it had not been for your father he and his family would have been lost altogether  is not that so angus  well it iss droont he would have been in all probabeelity said angus for he was on the wrong road when i met him an he couldnt find the right wan whatever  shon flett iss a good man but he iss also foolish  you see when the watter came on him so strong that his hoose began to slup away he took two of his oxen an he tied them together wi ropes an put planks on their backs which he also tied ay an so he made a sort of livin stage on which he sat his wife and four children two of them wass poys and the other two wass girls whatever  the frightened craters went about the best way they could sometimes wadin an sometimes sweemin an shon he wass leadin them wi a line roond their horns an he wass wadin an sweemin also  i came across them wi my post an took them in  that was just pefore we saw the hoose on fire floatin down the river  the house on fire exclaimed cora i did not hear of that  no wonder said lambert  there have been so many strange incidents and hairbreadth escapes during the flood that we wont likely hear about them all for many a day to come  but what about the house on fire asked victor was any one in it  no it was only a house that had been left somewhat hastily by its owners who must have forgot to put out the fire or capsized something over it  at all events the house was seen floating down stream at night and a splendid sight it was burning furiously with the flames glittering in the water that swept it away  how sad said elsie whose mind dwelt on the evil rather than on the picturesque aspect of the incident  i cant imagine what ever was the cause of the flood remarked mrs ravenshaw  well my dear said her husband in a somewhat oracular tone no one can certainly tell what caused it but my own opinion is that it was caused by the unusual wetness of the fall  you remember how it rained well when the lakes and rivers were as full as they could hold and the ground was soaking like a full sponge the winter came on us suddenly and set all fast thus preventing the water getting away  then came the snow also unusually heavy  then came a late spring with a sudden burst of warm weather and a south wind for several days in succession turning all this accumulation into water  red lake ottertail lake and lake travers overflowed as you know the red river ice burst up and jammed against the solid ice of lake winnipeg which stopped the current and thus caused the overflow  thats my notion about the flood  whether its right or no who can tell  your observations sir are fery goot whatever said angus taking an unusually long draw at his pipe  turn we now to look upon one more picture  it is on the shores of the great lakelake winnipeg  there among a tangled but picturesque mass of reeds and bushes a canoe is resting on the reeds and not far from it a rude structure of boughs and bark has been set up  it is open in front and before it burns a large fire whose light however is paled by the effulgence of the glorious sun as it dips into the lake  petawanaquat is there seated with a book on his knee and a dignified yet slightly perplexed expression on his face  his friend sinclair is there too teaching him to read the word of god  meekeye faithful partner and sympathiser with the red man is also there and beside them reclines our friend tony  that childs taste for hunting is strong having beenaccording to miss trims reporta very good boy and remarkably diligent at his lessons he has been granted a holiday and permission to go ahunting with his red father  he is tired after the days hunt and reclines placidly awaiting supper which meekeye with downcast look prepares  having spent two hours over the book that evening petawanaquat closed it slowly and looked up  you find it rather difficult to understand said sinclair with a pleasant smile  the red man rose drew himself up and turning his black eyes like the eagle on the flashing sun stretched out his hand  my brother he said beholds the sun  can he tell where it comes from or whither it goes  no but he understands that the great spirit guides its course and he is satisfied  when petawanaquat was a child he understood very little  he is a man now and understands a little more  when the great spirit takes him up yonder no doubt his mind shall be made bigger and it shall be filled  the book that the great spirit has sent is very big  some things in it are hard to understand but the greatest thing of all is not hard  there is but one thing needful  is not jesus the one thing  petawanaquat wishes to live for ever  to know the great spirit and jesus is to live for ever petawanaquat has lived long and seen much  he has seen men torture men like evil spirits  he has seen scalps torn from men and women  he has seen little ones dashed against the stones  the spirit of petawanaquat has groaned within himhe knew not whyperhaps the great spirit was speaking to him in his heart  shall these deeds of evil never have an end he asked but there was no answer  now an answer has come jesus is the saviour from sin  all things shall be put under him when that time comes all things shall be good  at present good and evil are mixed  the red man paused a moment with a slightly troubled look but the shadow passed like a fleeting cloud as he dropped his arm and with an air of simple humility sat down again beside his friend  petawanaquat is only a child he added at present he is only learning  in good time he shall know all  the suns last rays were still gilding the horizon and flickering on the waves of winnipeg when the tired hunters lay down to rest  gradually the campfire lost its ruddy glow the evening breeze died slowly down one by one the stars came out and the soft curtain of night descending like a gentle spirit on the wilderness hid the red man and his comrades from mortal eyes and wrapped them in profound repose  the end
