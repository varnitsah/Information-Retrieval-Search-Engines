85335715	ivanhoe  a romance  by sir walter scott       now fitted the halter now traversed the cart      and often took leavebut seemed loath to depart 1      prior     introduction to ivanhoe   the author of the waverley novels had hitherto proceeded in an unabated course of popularity and might in his peculiar district of literature have been termed lenfant gate of success it was plain however that frequent publication must finally wear out the public favour unless some mode could be devised to give an appearance of novelty to subsequent productions scottish manners scottish dialect and scottish characters of note being those with which the author was most intimately and familiarly acquainted were the groundwork upon which he had hitherto relied for giving effect to his narrative it was however obvious that this kind of interest must in the end occasion a degree of sameness and repetition if exclusively resorted to and that the reader was likely at length to adopt the language of edwin in parnells tale  reverse the spell he cries and let it fairly now suffice the gambol has been shown  nothing can be more dangerous for the fame of a professor of the fine arts than to permit if he can possibly prevent it the character of a mannerist to be attached to him or that he should be supposed capable of success only in a particular and limited style the public are in general very ready to adopt the opinion that he who has pleased them in one peculiar mode of composition is by means of that very talent rendered incapable of venturing upon other subjects the effect of this disinclination on the part of the public towards the artificers of their pleasures when they attempt to enlarge their means of amusing may be seen in the censures usually passed by vulgar criticism upon actors or artists who venture to change the character of their efforts that in so doing they may enlarge the scale of their art  there is some justice in this opinion as there always is in such as attain general currency it may often happen on the stage that an actor by possessing in a preeminent degree the external qualities necessary to give effect to comedy may be deprived of the right to aspire to tragic excellence and in painting or literary composition an artist or poet may be master exclusively of modes of thought and powers of expression which confine him to a single course of subjects but much more frequently the same capacity which carries a man to popularity in one department will obtain for him success in another and that must be more particularly the case in literary composition than either in acting or painting because the adventurer in that department is not impeded in his exertions by any peculiarity of features or conformation of person proper for particular parts or by any peculiar mechanical habits of using the pencil limited to a particular class of subjects  whether this reasoning be correct or otherwise the present author felt that in confining himself to subjects purely scottish he was not only likely to weary out the indulgence of his readers but also greatly to limit his own power of affording them pleasure in a highly polished country where so much genius is monthly employed in catering for public amusement a fresh topic such as he had himself had the happiness to light upon is the untasted spring of the desert  men bless their stars and call it luxury  but when men and horses cattle camels and dromedaries have poached the spring into mud it becomes loathsome to those who at first drank of it with rapture and he who had the merit of discovering it if he would preserve his reputation with the tribe must display his talent by a fresh discovery of untasted fountains  if the author who finds himself limited to a particular class of subjects endeavours to sustain his reputation by striving to add a novelty of attraction to themes of the same character which have been formerly successful under his management there are manifest reasons why after a certain point he is likely to fail if the mine be not wrought out the strength and capacity of the miner become necessarily exhausted if he closely imitates the narratives which he has before rendered successful he is doomed to wonder that they please no more if he struggles to take a different view of the same class of subjects he speedily discovers that what is obvious graceful and natural has been exhausted and in order to obtain the indispensable charm of novelty he is forced upon caricature and to avoid being trite must become extravagant  it is not perhaps necessary to enumerate so many reasons why the author of the scottish novels as they were then exclusively termed should be desirous to make an experiment on a subject purely english it was his purpose at the same time to have rendered the experiment as complete as possible by bringing the intended work before the public as the effort of a new candidate for their favour in order that no degree of prejudice whether favourable or the reverse might attach to it as a new production of the author of waverley but this intention was afterwards departed from for reasons to be hereafter mentioned  the period of the narrative adopted was the reign of richard i not only as abounding with characters whose very names were sure to attract general attention but as affording a striking contrast betwixt the saxons by whom the soil was cultivated and the normans who still reigned in it as conquerors reluctant to mix with the vanquished or acknowledge themselves of the same stock the idea of this contrast was taken from the ingenious and unfortunate logans tragedy of runnamede in which about the same period of history the author had seen the saxon and norman barons opposed to each other on different sides of the stage he does not recollect that there was any attempt to contrast the two races in their habits and sentiments and indeed it was obvious that history was violated by introducing the saxons still existing as a highminded and martial race of nobles  they did however survive as a people and some of the ancient saxon families possessed wealth and power although they were exceptions to the humble condition of the race in general it seemed to the author that the existence of the two races in the same country the vanquished distinguished by their plain homely blunt manners and the free spirit infused by their ancient institutions and laws the victors by the high spirit of military fame personal adventure and whatever could distinguish them as the flower of chivalry might intermixed with other characters belonging to the same time and country interest the reader by the contrast if the author should not fail on his part  scotland however had been of late used so exclusively as the scene of what is called historical romance that the preliminary letter of mr laurence templeton became in some measure necessary to this as to an introduction the reader is referred as expressing authors purpose and opinions in undertaking this species of composition under the necessary reservation that he is far from thinking he has attained the point at which he aimed  it is scarcely necessary to add that there was no idea or wish to pass off the supposed mr templeton as a real person but a kind of continuation of the tales of my landlord had been recently attempted by a stranger and it was supposed this dedicatory epistle might pass for some imitation of the same kind and thus putting enquirers upon a false scent induce them to believe they had before them the work of some new candidate for their favour  after a considerable part of the work had been finished and printed the publishers who pretended to discern in it a germ of popularity remonstrated strenuously against its appearing as an absolutely anonymous production and contended that it should have the advantage of being announced as by the author of waverley the author did not make any obstinate opposition for he began to be of opinion with dr wheeler in miss edgeworths excellent tale of maneuvering that trick upon trick might be too much for the patience of an indulgent public and might be reasonably considered as trifling with their favour  the book therefore appeared as an avowed continuation of the waverley novels and it would be ungrateful not to acknowledge that it met with the same favourable reception as its predecessors  such annotations as may be useful to assist the reader in comprehending the characters of the jew the templar the captain of the mercenaries or free companions as they were called and others proper to the period are added but with a sparing hand since sufficient information on these subjects is to be found in general history  an incident in the tale which had the good fortune to find favour in the eyes of many readers is more directly borrowed from the stores of old romance i mean the meeting of the king with friar tuck at the cell of that buxom hermit the general tone of the story belongs to all ranks and all countries which emulate each other in describing the rambles of a disguised sovereign who going in search of information or amusement into the lower ranks of life meets with adventures diverting to the reader or hearer from the contrast betwixt the monarchs outward appearance and his real character the eastern taleteller has for his theme the disguised expeditions of haroun alraschid with his faithful attendants mesrour and giafar through the midnight streets of bagdad and scottish tradition dwells upon the similar exploits of james v distinguished during such excursions by the travelling name of the goodman of ballengeigh as the commander of the faithful when he desired to be incognito was known by that of il bondocani the french minstrels are not silent on so popular a theme there must have been a norman original of the scottish metrical romance of rauf colziar in which charlemagne is introduced as the unknown guest of a charcoalman 2  it seems to have been the original of other poems of the kind  in merry england there is no end of popular ballads on this theme the poem of john the reeve or steward mentioned by bishop percy in the reliques of english poetry 3 is said to have turned on such an incident and we have besides the king and the tanner of tamworth the king and the miller of mansfield and others on the same topic but the peculiar tale of this nature to which the author of ivanhoe has to acknowledge an obligation is more ancient by two centuries than any of these last mentioned  it was first communicated to the public in that curious record of ancient literature which has been accumulated by the combined exertions of sir egerton brydges and mr hazlewood in the periodical work entitled the british bibliographer from thence it has been transferred by the reverend charles henry hartsborne ma editor of a very curious volume entitled ancient metrical tales printed chiefly from original sources 1829 mr hartshorne gives no other authority for the present fragment except the article in the bibliographer where it is entitled the kyng and the hermite a short abstract of its contents will show its similarity to the meeting of king richard and friar tuck  king edward we are not told which among the monarchs of that name but from his temper and habits we may suppose edward iv sets forth with his court to a gallant huntingmatch in sherwood forest in which as is not unusual for princes in romance he falls in with a deer of extraordinary size and swiftness and pursues it closely till he has outstripped his whole retinue tired out hounds and horse and finds himself alone under the gloom of an extensive forest upon which night is descending under the apprehensions natural to a situation so uncomfortable the king recollects that he has heard how poor men when apprehensive of a bad nights lodging pray to saint julian who in the romish calendar stands quartermastergeneral to all forlorn travellers that render him due homage edward puts up his orisons accordingly and by the guidance doubtless of the good saint reaches a small path conducting him to a chapel in the forest having a hermits cell in its close vicinity the king hears the reverend man with a companion of his solitude telling his beads within and meekly requests of him quarters for the night i have no accommodation for such a lord as ye be said the hermit i live here in the wilderness upon roots and rinds and may not receive into my dwelling even the poorest wretch that lives unless it were to save his life the king enquires the way to the next town and understanding it is by a road which he cannot find without difficulty even if he had daylight to befriend him he declares that with or without the hermits consent he is determined to be his guest that night he is admitted accordingly not without a hint from the recluse that were he himself out of his priestly weeds he would care little for his threats of using violence and that he gives way to him not out of intimidation but simply to avoid scandal  the king is admitted into the celltwo bundles of straw are shaken down for his accommodation and he comforts himself that he is now under shelter and that       a night will soon be gone  other wants however arise the guest becomes clamorous for supper observing       for certainly as i you say      i ne had never so sorry a day      that i ne had a merry night  but this indication of his taste for good cheer joined to the annunciation of his being a follower of the court who had lost himself at the great huntingmatch cannot induce the niggard hermit to produce better fare than bread and cheese for which his guest showed little appetite and thin drink which was even less acceptable at length the king presses his host on a point to which he had more than once alluded without obtaining a satisfactory reply       then said the king by gods grace      thou wert in a merry place      to shoot should thou here      when the foresters go to rest      sometyme thou might have of the best      all of the wild deer      i wold hold it for no scathe      though thou hadst bow and arrows baith      althoff thou best a frere  the hermit in return expresses his apprehension that his guest means to drag him into some confession of offence against the forest laws which being betrayed to the king might cost him his life edward answers by fresh assurances of secrecy and again urges on him the necessity of procuring some venison the hermit replies by once more insisting on the duties incumbent upon him as a churchman and continues to affirm himself free from all such breaches of order       many day i have here been      and fleshmeat i eat never      but milk of the kye      warm thee well and go to sleep      and i will lap thee with my cope      softly to lye  it would seem that the manuscript is here imperfect for we do not find the reasons which finally induce the curtal friar to amend the kings cheer but acknowledging his guest to be such a good fellow as has seldom graced his board the holy man at length produces the best his cell affords two candles are placed on a table white bread and baked pasties are displayed by the light besides choice of venison both salt and fresh from which they select collops i might have eaten my bread dry said the king had i not pressed thee on the score of archery but now have i dined like a princeif we had but drink enow  this too is afforded by the hospitable anchorite who dispatches an assistant to fetch a pot of four gallons from a secret corner near his bed and the whole three set in to serious drinking this amusement is superintended by the friar according to the recurrence of certain fustian words to be repeated by every compotator in turn before he dranka species of high jinks as it were by which they regulated their potations as toasts were given in latter times the one toper says fusty bandias to which the other is obliged to reply strike pantnere and the friar passes many jests on the kings want of memory who sometimes forgets the words of action the night is spent in this jolly pastime before his departure in the morning the king invites his reverend host to court promises at least to requite his hospitality and expresses himself much pleased with his entertainment the jolly hermit at length agrees to venture thither and to enquire for jack fletcher which is the name assumed by the king after the hermit has shown edward some feats of archery the joyous pair separate the king rides home and rejoins his retinue as the romance is imperfect we are not acquainted how the discovery takes place but it is probably much in the same manner as in other narratives turning on the same subject where the host apprehensive of death for having trespassed on the respect due to his sovereign while incognito is agreeably surprised by receiving honours and reward  in mr hartshornes collection there is a romance on the same foundation called king edward and the shepherd 4  which considered as illustrating manners is still more curious than the king and the hermit but it is foreign to the present purpose the reader has here the original legend from which the incident in the romance is derived and the identifying the irregular eremite with the friar tuck of robin hoods story was an obvious expedient  the name of ivanhoe was suggested by an old rhyme all novelists have had occasion at some time or other to wish with falstaff that they knew where a commodity of good names was to be had on such an occasion the author chanced to call to memory a rhyme recording three names of the manors forfeited by the ancestor of the celebrated hampden for striking the black prince a blow with his racket when they quarrelled at tennis       tring wing and ivanhoe      for striking of a blow      hampden did forego      and glad he could escape so  the word suited the authors purpose in two material respectsfor first it had an ancient english sound and secondly it conveyed no indication whatever of the nature of the story he presumes to hold this last quality to be of no small importance what is called a taking title serves the direct interest of the bookseller or publisher who by this means sometimes sells an edition while it is yet passing the press but if the author permits an over degree of attention to be drawn to his work ere it has appeared he places himself in the embarrassing condition of having excited a degree of expectation which if he proves unable to satisfy is an error fatal to his literary reputation besides when we meet such a title as the gunpowder plot or any other connected with general history each reader before he has seen the book has formed to himself some particular idea of the sort of manner in which the story is to be conducted and the nature of the amusement which he is to derive from it in this he is probably disappointed and in that case may be naturally disposed to visit upon the author or the work the unpleasant feelings thus excited in such a case the literary adventurer is censured not for having missed the mark at which he himself aimed but for not having shot off his shaft in a direction he never thought of  on the footing of unreserved communication which the author has established with the reader he may here add the trifling circumstance that a roll of norman warriors occurring in the auchinleck manuscript gave him the formidable name of frontdeboeuf  ivanhoe was highly successful upon its appearance and may be said to have procured for its author the freedom of the rules since he has ever since been permitted to exercise his powers of fictitious composition in england as well as scotland  the character of the fair jewess found so much favour in the eyes of some fair readers that the writer was censured because when arranging the fates of the characters of the drama he had not assigned the hand of wilfred to rebecca rather than the less interesting rowena but not to mention that the prejudices of the age rendered such an union almost impossible the author may in passing observe that he thinks a character of a highly virtuous and lofty stamp is degraded rather than exalted by an attempt to reward virtue with temporal prosperity such is not the recompense which providence has deemed worthy of suffering merit and it is a dangerous and fatal doctrine to teach young persons the most common readers of romance that rectitude of conduct and of principle are either naturally allied with or adequately rewarded by the gratification of our passions or attainment of our wishes in a word if a virtuous and selfdenied character is dismissed with temporal wealth greatness rank or the indulgence of such a rashly formed or ill assorted passion as that of rebecca for ivanhoe the reader will be apt to say verily virtue has had its reward but a glance on the great picture of life will show that the duties of selfdenial and the sacrifice of passion to principle are seldom thus remunerated and that the internal consciousness of their highminded discharge of duty produces on their own reflections a more adequate recompense in the form of that peace which the world cannot give or take away  abbotsford 1st september 1830     dedicatory epistle  to  the rev dr dryasdust fas  residing in the castlegate york   much esteemed and dear sir  it is scarcely necessary to mention the various and concurring reasons which induce me to place your name at the head of the following work yet the chief of these reasons may perhaps be refuted by the imperfections of the performance could i have hoped to render it worthy of your patronage the public would at once have seen the propriety of inscribing a work designed to illustrate the domestic antiquities of england and particularly of our saxon forefathers to the learned author of the essays upon the horn of king ulphus and on the lands bestowed by him upon the patrimony of st peter i am conscious however that the slight unsatisfactory and trivial manner in which the result of my antiquarian researches has been recorded in the following pages takes the work from under that class which bears the proud motto detur digniori on the contrary i fear i shall incur the censure of presumption in placing the venerable name of dr jonas dryasdust at the head of a publication which the more grave antiquary will perhaps class with the idle novels and romances of the day i am anxious to vindicate myself from such a charge for although i might trust to your friendship for an apology in your eyes yet i would not willingly stand conviction in those of the public of so grave a crime as my fears lead me to anticipate my being charged with  i must therefore remind you that when we first talked over together that class of productions in one of which the private and family affairs of your learned northern friend mr oldbuck of monkbarns were so unjustifiably exposed to the public some discussion occurred between us concerning the cause of the popularity these works have attained in this idle age which whatever other merit they possess must be admitted to be hastily written and in violation of every rule assigned to the epopeia it seemed then to be your opinion that the charm lay entirely in the art with which the unknown author had availed himself like a second mpherson of the antiquarian stores which lay scattered around him supplying his own indolence or poverty of invention by the incidents which had actually taken place in his country at no distant period by introducing real characters and scarcely suppressing real names it was not above sixty or seventy years you observed since the whole north of scotland was under a state of government nearly as simple and as patriarchal as those of our good allies the mohawks and iroquois admitting that the author cannot himself be supposed to have witnessed those times he must have lived you observed among persons who had acted and suffered in them and even within these thirty years such an infinite change has taken place in the manners of scotland that men look back upon the habits of society proper to their immediate ancestors as we do on those of the reign of queen anne or even the period of the revolution having thus materials of every kind lying strewed around him there was little you observed to embarrass the author but the difficulty of choice it was no wonder therefore that having begun to work a mine so plentiful he should have derived from his works fully more credit and profit than the facility of his labours merited  admitting as i could not deny the general truth of these conclusions i cannot but think it strange that no attempt has been made to excite an interest for the traditions and manners of old england similiar to that which has been obtained in behalf of those of our poorer and less celebrated neighbours the kendal green though its date is more ancient ought surely to be as dear to our feelings as the variegated tartans of the north the name of robin hood if duly conjured with should raise a spirit as soon as that of rob roy and the patriots of england deserve no less their renown in our modern circles than the bruces and wallaces of caledonia if the scenery of the south be less romantic and sublime than that of the northern mountains it must be allowed to possess in the same proportion superior softness and beauty and upon the whole we feel ourselves entitled to exclaim with the patriotic syrianare not pharphar and abana rivers of damascus better than all the rivers of israel  your objections to such an attempt my dear doctor were you may remember twofold you insisted upon the advantages which the scotsman possessed from the very recent existence of that state of society in which his scene was to be laid many now alive you remarked well remembered persons who had not only seen the celebrated roy mgregor but had feasted and even fought with him all those minute circumstances belonging to private life and domestic character all that gives verisimilitude to a narrative and individuality to the persons introduced is still known and remembered in scotland whereas in england civilisation has been so long complete that our ideas of our ancestors are only to be gleaned from musty records and chronicles the authors of which seem perversely to have conspired to suppress in their narratives all interesting details in order to find room for flowers of monkish eloquence or trite reflections upon morals to match an english and a scottish author in the rival task of embodying and reviving the traditions of their respective countries would be you alleged in the highest degree unequal and unjust the scottish magician you said was like lucans witch at liberty to walk over the recent field of battle and to select for the subject of resuscitation by his sorceries a body whose limbs had recently quivered with existence and whose throat had but just uttered the last note of agony such a subject even the powerful erictho was compelled to select as alone capable of being reanimated even by her potent magic       gelidas leto scrutata medullas      pulmonis rigidi stantes sine vulnere fibras      invenit et vocem defuncto in corpore quaerit  the english author on the other hand without supposing him less of a conjuror than the northern warlock can you observed only have the liberty of selecting his subject amidst the dust of antiquity where nothing was to be found but dry sapless mouldering and disjointed bones such as those which filled the valley of jehoshaphat you expressed besides your apprehension that the unpatriotic prejudices of my countrymen would not allow fair play to such a work as that of which i endeavoured to demonstrate the probable success and this you said was not entirely owing to the more general prejudice in favour of that which is foreign but that it rested partly upon improbabilities arising out of the circumstances in which the english reader is placed if you describe to him a set of wild manners and a state of primitive society existing in the highlands of scotland he is much disposed to acquiesce in the truth of what is asserted and reason good if he be of the ordinary class of readers he has either never seen those remote districts at all or he has wandered through those desolate regions in the course of a summer tour eating bad dinners sleeping on truckle beds stalking from desolation to desolation and fully prepared to believe the strangest things that could be told him of a people wild and extravagant enough to be attached to scenery so extraordinary but the same worthy person when placed in his own snug parlour and surrounded by all the comforts of an englishmans fireside is not half so much disposed to believe that his own ancestors led a very different life from himself that the shattered tower which now forms a vista from his window once held a baron who would have hung him up at his own door without any form of trial that the hinds by whom his little petfarm is managed a few centuries ago would have been his slaves and that the complete influence of feudal tyranny once extended over the neighbouring village where the attorney is now a man of more importance than the lord of the manor  while i own the force of these objections i must confess at the same time that they do not appear to me to be altogether insurmountable the scantiness of materials is indeed a formidable difficulty but no one knows better than dr dryasdust that to those deeply read in antiquity hints concerning the private life of our ancestors lie scattered through the pages of our various historians bearing indeed a slender proportion to the other matters of which they treat but still when collected together sufficient to throw considerable light upon the vie prive of our forefathers indeed i am convinced that however i myself may fail in the ensuing attempt yet with more labour in collecting or more skill in using the materials within his reach illustrated as they have been by the labours of dr henry of the late mr strutt and above all of mr sharon turner an abler hand would have been successful and therefore i protest beforehand against any argument which may be founded on the failure of the present experiment  on the other hand i have already said that if any thing like a true picture of old english manners could be drawn i would trust to the goodnature and good sense of my countrymen for insuring its favourable reception  having thus replied to the best of my power to the first class of your objections or at least having shown my resolution to overleap the barriers which your prudence has raised i will be brief in noticing that which is more peculiar to myself it seems to be your opinion that the very office of an antiquary employed in grave and as the vulgar will sometimes allege in toilsome and minute research must be considered as incapacitating him from successfully compounding a tale of this sort but permit me to say my dear doctor that this objection is rather formal than substantial it is true that such slight compositions might not suit the severer genius of our friend mr oldbuck yet horace walpole wrote a goblin tale which has thrilled through many a bosom and george ellis could transfer all the playful fascination of a humour as delightful as it was uncommon into his abridgement of the ancient metrical romances so that however i may have occasion to rue my present audacity i have at least the most respectable precedents in my favour  still the severer antiquary may think that by thus intermingling fiction with truth i am polluting the well of history with modern inventions and impressing upon the rising generation false ideas of the age which i describe i cannot but in some sense admit the force of this reasoning which i yet hope to traverse by the following considerations  it is true that i neither can nor do pretend to the observation of complete accuracy even in matters of outward costume much less in the more important points of language and manners but the same motive which prevents my writing the dialogue of the piece in anglosaxon or in normanfrench and which prohibits my sending forth to the public this essay printed with the types of caxton or wynken de worde prevents my attempting to confine myself within the limits of the period in which my story is laid it is necessary for exciting interest of any kind that the subject assumed should be as it were translated into the manners as well as the language of the age we live in no fascination has ever been attached to oriental literature equal to that produced by mr gallands first translation of the arabian tales in which retaining on the one hand the splendour of eastern costume and on the other the wildness of eastern fiction he mixed these with just so much ordinary feeling and expression as rendered them interesting and intelligible while he abridged the longwinded narratives curtailed the monotonous reflections and rejected the endless repetitions of the arabian original the tales therefore though less purely oriental than in their first concoction were eminently better fitted for the european market and obtained an unrivalled degree of public favour which they certainly would never have gained had not the manners and style been in some degree familiarized to the feelings and habits of the western reader  in point of justice therefore to the multitudes who will i trust devour this book with avidity i have so far explained our ancient manners in modern language and so far detailed the characters and sentiments of my persons that the modern reader will not find himself i should hope much trammelled by the repulsive dryness of mere antiquity in this i respectfully contend i have in no respect exceeded the fair license due to the author of a fictitious composition the late ingenious mr strutt in his romance of queenhoohall 5 acted upon another principle and in distinguishing between what was ancient and modern forgot as it appears to me that extensive neutral ground the large proportion that is of manners and sentiments which are common to us and to our ancestors having been handed down unaltered from them to us or which arising out of the principles of our common nature must have existed alike in either state of society in this manner a man of talent and of great antiquarian erudition limited the popularity of his work by excluding from it every thing which was not sufficiently obsolete to be altogether forgotten and unintelligible  the license which i would here vindicate is so necessary to the execution of my plan that i will crave your patience while i illustrate my argument a little farther  he who first opens chaucer or any other ancient poet is so much struck with the obsolete spelling multiplied consonants and antiquated appearance of the language that he is apt to lay the work down in despair as encrusted too deep with the rust of antiquity to permit his judging of its merits or tasting its beauties but if some intelligent and accomplished friend points out to him that the difficulties by which he is startled are more in appearance than reality if by reading aloud to him or by reducing the ordinary words to the modern orthography he satisfies his proselyte that only about onetenth part of the words employed are in fact obsolete the novice may be easily persuaded to approach the well of english undefiled with the certainty that a slender degree of patience will enable him to to enjoy both the humour and the pathos with which old geoffrey delighted the age of cressy and of poictiers  to pursue this a little farther if our neophyte strong in the newborn love of antiquity were to undertake to imitate what he had learnt to admire it must be allowed he would act very injudiciously if he were to select from the glossary the obsolete words which it contains and employ those exclusively of all phrases and vocables retained in modern days this was the error of the unfortunate chatterton in order to give his language the appearance of antiquity he rejected every word that was modern and produced a dialect entirely different from any that had ever been spoken in great britain he who would imitate an ancient language with success must attend rather to its grammatical character turn of expression and mode of arrangement than labour to collect extraordinary and antiquated terms which as i have already averred do not in ancient authors approach the number of words still in use though perhaps somewhat altered in sense and spelling in the proportion of one to ten  what i have applied to language is still more justly applicable to sentiments and manners the passions the sources from which these must spring in all their modifications are generally the same in all ranks and conditions all countries and ages and it follows as a matter of course that the opinions habits of thinking and actions however influenced by the peculiar state of society must still upon the whole bear a strong resemblance to each other our ancestors were not more distinct from us surely than jews are from christians they had eyes hands organs dimensions senses affections passions were fed with the same food hurt with the same weapons subject to the same diseases warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as ourselves the tenor therefore of their affections and feelings must have borne the same general proportion to our own  it follows therefore that of the materials which an author has to use in a romance or fictitious composition such as i have ventured to attempt he will find that a great proportion both of language and manners is as proper to the present time as to those in which he has laid his time of action the freedom of choice which this allows him is therefore much greater and the difficulty of his task much more diminished than at first appears to take an illustration from a sister art the antiquarian details may be said to represent the peculiar features of a landscape under delineation of the pencil his feudal tower must arise in due majesty the figures which he introduces must have the costume and character of their age the piece must represent the peculiar features of the scene which he has chosen for his subject with all its appropriate elevation of rock or precipitate descent of cataract his general colouring too must be copied from nature the sky must be clouded or serene according to the climate and the general tints must be those which prevail in a natural landscape so far the painter is bound down by the rules of his art to a precise imitation of the features of nature but it is not required that he should descend to copy all her more minute features or represent with absolute exactness the very herbs flowers and trees with which the spot is decorated these as well as all the more minute points of light and shadow are attributes proper to scenery in general natural to each situation and subject to the artists disposal as his taste or pleasure may dictate  it is true that this license is confined in either case within legitimate bounds the painter must introduce no ornament inconsistent with the climate or country of his landscape he must not plant cypress trees upon inchmerrin or scottish firs among the ruins of persepolis and the author lies under a corresponding restraint however far he may venture in a more full detail of passions and feelings than is to be found in the ancient compositions which he imitates he must introduce nothing inconsistent with the manners of the age his knights squires grooms and yeomen may be more fully drawn than in the hard dry delineations of an ancient illuminated manuscript but the character and costume of the age must remain inviolate they must be the same figures drawn by a better pencil or to speak more modestly executed in an age when the principles of art were better understood his language must not be exclusively obsolete and unintelligible but he should admit if possible no word or turn of phraseology betraying an origin directly modern it is one thing to make use of the language and sentiments which are common to ourselves and our forefathers and it is another to invest them with the sentiments and dialect exclusively proper to their descendants  this my dear friend i have found the most difficult part of my task and to speak frankly i hardly expect to satisfy your less partial judgment and more extensive knowledge of such subjects since i have hardly been able to please my own  i am conscious that i shall be found still more faulty in the tone of keeping and costume by those who may be disposed rigidly to examine my tale with reference to the manners of the exact period in which my actors flourished it may be that i have introduced little which can positively be termed modern but on the other hand it is extremely probable that i may have confused the manners of two or three centuries and introduced during the reign of richard the first circumstances appropriated to a period either considerably earlier or a good deal later than that era it is my comfort that errors of this kind will escape the general class of readers and that i may share in the illdeserved applause of those architects who in their modern gothic do not hesitate to introduce without rule or method ornaments proper to different styles and to different periods of the art those whose extensive researches have given them the means of judging my backslidings with more severity will probably be lenient in proportion to their knowledge of the difficulty of my task my honest and neglected friend ingulphus has furnished me with many a valuable hint but the light afforded by the monk of croydon and geoffrey de vinsauff is dimmed by such a conglomeration of uninteresting and unintelligible matter that we gladly fly for relief to the delightful pages of the gallant froissart although he flourished at a period so much more remote from the date of my history if therefore my dear friend you have generosity enough to pardon the presumptuous attempt to frame for myself a minstrel coronet partly out of the pearls of pure antiquity and partly from the bristol stones and paste with which i have endeavoured to imitate them i am convinced your opinion of the difficulty of the task will reconcile you to the imperfect manner of its execution  of my materials i have but little to say they may be chiefly found in the singular anglonorman ms which sir arthur wardour preserves with such jealous care in the third drawer of his oaken cabinet scarcely allowing any one to touch it and being himself not able to read one syllable of its contents i should never have got his consent on my visit to scotland to read in those precious pages for so many hours had i not promised to designate it by some emphatic mode of printing as the wardour manuscript giving it thereby an individuality as important as the bannatyne ms the auchinleck ms and any other monument of the patience of a gothic scrivener i have sent for your private consideration a list of the contents of this curious piece which i shall perhaps subjoin with your approbation to the third volume of my tale in case the printers devil should continue impatient for copy when the whole of my narrative has been imposed  adieu my dear friend i have said enough to explain if not to vindicate the attempt which i have made and which in spite of your doubts and my own incapacity i am still willing to believe has not been altogether made in vain  i hope you are now well recovered from your spring fit of the gout and shall be happy if the advice of your learned physician should recommend a tour to these parts several curiosities have been lately dug up near the wall as well as at the ancient station of habitancum talking of the latter i suppose you have long since heard the news that a sulky churlish boor has destroyed the ancient statue or rather basrelief popularly called robin of redesdale it seems robins fame attracted more visitants than was consistent with the growth of the heather upon a moor worth a shilling an acre reverend as you write yourself be revengeful for once and pray with me that he may be visited with such a fit of the stone as if he had all the fragments of poor robin in that region of his viscera where the disease holds its seat tell this not in gath lest the scots rejoice that they have at length found a parallel instance among their neighbours to that barbarous deed which demolished arthurs oven but there is no end to lamentation when we betake ourselves to such subjects my respectful compliments attend miss dryasdust i endeavoured to match the spectacles agreeable to her commission during my late journey to london and hope she has received them safe and found them satisfactory i send this by the blind carrier so that probably it may be some time upon its journey 6  the last news which i hear from edinburgh is that the gentleman who fills the situation of secretary to the society of antiquaries of scotland 7 is the best amateur draftsman in that kingdom and that much is expected from his skill and zeal in delineating those specimens of national antiquity which are either mouldering under the slow touch of time or swept away by modern taste with the same besom of destruction which john knox used at the reformation once more adieu vale tandem

odyssey   in that pleasant district of merry england which is watered by the river don there extended in ancient times a large forest covering the greater part of the beautiful hills and valleys which lie between sheffield and the pleasant town of doncaster the remains of this extensive wood are still to be seen at the noble seats of wentworth of warncliffe park and around rotherham here haunted of yore the fabulous dragon of wantley here were fought many of the most desperate battles during the civil wars of the roses and here also flourished in ancient times those bands of gallant outlaws whose deeds have been rendered so popular in english song  such being our chief scene the date of our story refers to a period towards the end of the reign of richard i when his return from his long captivity had become an event rather wished than hoped for by his despairing subjects who were in the meantime subjected to every species of subordinate oppression the nobles whose power had become exorbitant during the reign of stephen and whom the prudence of henry the second had scarce reduced to some degree of subjection to the crown had now resumed their ancient license in its utmost extent despising the feeble interference of the english council of state fortifying their castles increasing the number of their dependants reducing all around them to a state of vassalage and striving by every means in their power to place themselves each at the head of such forces as might enable him to make a figure in the national convulsions which appeared to be impending  the situation of the inferior gentry or franklins as they were called who by the law and spirit of the english constitution were entitled to hold themselves independent of feudal tyranny became now unusually precarious if as was most generally the case they placed themselves under the protection of any of the petty kings in their vicinity accepted of feudal offices in his household or bound themselves by mutual treaties of alliance and protection to support him in his enterprises they might indeed purchase temporary repose but it must be with the sacrifice of that independence which was so dear to every english bosom and at the certain hazard of being involved as a party in whatever rash expedition the ambition of their protector might lead him to undertake on the other hand such and so multiplied were the means of vexation and oppression possessed by the great barons that they never wanted the pretext and seldom the will to harass and pursue even to the very edge of destruction any of their less powerful neighbours who attempted to separate themselves from their authority and to trust for their protection during the dangers of the times to their own inoffensive conduct and to the laws of the land  a circumstance which greatly tended to enhance the tyranny of the nobility and the sufferings of the inferior classes arose from the consequences of the conquest by duke william of normandy four generations had not sufficed to blend the hostile blood of the normans and anglosaxons or to unite by common language and mutual interests two hostile races one of which still felt the elation of triumph while the other groaned under all the consequences of defeat the power had been completely placed in the hands of the norman nobility by the event of the battle of hastings and it had been used as our histories assure us with no moderate hand the whole race of saxon princes and nobles had been extirpated or disinherited with few or no exceptions nor were the numbers great who possessed land in the country of their fathers even as proprietors of the second or of yet inferior classes the royal policy had long been to weaken by every means legal or illegal the strength of a part of the population which was justly considered as nourishing the most inveterate antipathy to their victor all the monarchs of the norman race had shown the most marked predilection for their norman subjects the laws of the chase and many others equally unknown to the milder and more free spirit of the saxon constitution had been fixed upon the necks of the subjugated inhabitants to add weight as it were to the feudal chains with which they were loaded at court and in the castles of the great nobles where the pomp and state of a court was emulated normanfrench was the only language employed in courts of law the pleadings and judgments were delivered in the same tongue in short french was the language of honour of chivalry and even of justice while the far more manly and expressive anglosaxon was abandoned to the use of rustics and hinds who knew no other still however the necessary intercourse between the lords of the soil and those oppressed inferior beings by whom that soil was cultivated occasioned the gradual formation of a dialect compounded betwixt the french and the anglosaxon in which they could render themselves mutually intelligible to each other and from this necessity arose by degrees the structure of our present english language in which the speech of the victors and the vanquished have been so happily blended together and which has since been so richly improved by importations from the classical languages and from those spoken by the southern nations of europe  this state of things i have thought it necessary to premise for the information of the general reader who might be apt to forget that although no great historical events such as war or insurrection mark the existence of the anglosaxons as a separate people subsequent to the reign of william the second yet the great national distinctions betwixt them and their conquerors the recollection of what they had formerly been and to what they were now reduced continued down to the reign of edward the third to keep open the wounds which the conquest had inflicted and to maintain a line of separation betwixt the descendants of the victor normans and the vanquished saxons  the sun was setting upon one of the rich grassy glades of that forest which we have mentioned in the beginning of the chapter hundreds of broadheaded shortstemmed widebranched oaks which had witnessed perhaps the stately march of the roman soldiery flung their gnarled arms over a thick carpet of the most delicious green sward in some places they were intermingled with beeches hollies and copsewood of various descriptions so closely as totally to intercept the level beams of the sinking sun in others they receded from each other forming those long sweeping vistas in the intricacy of which the eye delights to lose itself while imagination considers them as the paths to yet wilder scenes of silvan solitude here the red rays of the sun shot a broken and discoloured light that partially hung upon the shattered boughs and mossy trunks of the trees and there they illuminated in brilliant patches the portions of turf to which they made their way a considerable open space in the midst of this glade seemed formerly to have been dedicated to the rites of druidical superstition for on the summit of a hillock so regular as to seem artificial there still remained part of a circle of rough unhewn stones of large dimensions seven stood upright the rest had been dislodged from their places probably by the zeal of some convert to christianity and lay some prostrate near their former site and others on the side of the hill one large stone only had found its way to the bottom and in stopping the course of a small brook which glided smoothly round the foot of the eminence gave by its opposition a feeble voice of murmur to the placid and elsewhere silent streamlet  the human figures which completed this landscape were in number two partaking in their dress and appearance of that wild and rustic character which belonged to the woodlands of the westriding of yorkshire at that early period the eldest of these men had a stern savage and wild aspect his garment was of the simplest form imaginable being a close jacket with sleeves composed of the tanned skin of some animal on which the hair had been originally left but which had been worn off in so many places that it would have been difficult to distinguish from the patches that remained to what creature the fur had belonged this primeval vestment reached from the throat to the knees and served at once all the usual purposes of bodyclothing there was no wider opening at the collar than was necessary to admit the passage of the head from which it may be inferred that it was put on by slipping it over the head and shoulders in the manner of a modern shirt or ancient hauberk sandals bound with thongs made of boars hide protected the feet and a roll of thin leather was twined artificially round the legs and ascending above the calf left the knees bare like those of a scottish highlander to make the jacket sit yet more close to the body it was gathered at the middle by a broad leathern belt secured by a brass buckle to one side of which was attached a sort of scrip and to the other a rams horn accoutred with a mouthpiece for the purpose of blowing in the same belt was stuck one of those long broad sharppointed and twoedged knives with a buckshorn handle which were fabricated in the neighbourhood and bore even at this early period the name of a sheffield whittle the man had no covering upon his head which was only defended by his own thick hair matted and twisted together and scorched by the influence of the sun into a rusty darkred colour forming a contrast with the overgrown beard upon his cheeks which was rather of a yellow or amber hue one part of his dress only remains but it is too remarkable to be suppressed it was a brass ring resembling a dogs collar but without any opening and soldered fast round his neck so loose as to form no impediment to his breathing yet so tight as to be incapable of being removed excepting by the use of the file on this singular gorget was engraved in saxon characters an inscription of the following purportgurth the son of beowulph is the born thrall of cedric of rotherwood  beside the swineherd for such was gurths occupation was seated upon one of the fallen druidical monuments a person about ten years younger in appearance and whose dress though resembling his companions in form was of better materials and of a more fantastic appearance his jacket had been stained of a bright purple hue upon which there had been some attempt to paint grotesque ornaments in different colours to the jacket he added a short cloak which scarcely reached half way down his thigh it was of crimson cloth though a good deal soiled lined with bright yellow and as he could transfer it from one shoulder to the other or at his pleasure draw it all around him its width contrasted with its want of longitude formed a fantastic piece of drapery he had thin silver bracelets upon his arms and on his neck a collar of the same metal bearing the inscription wamba the son of witless is the thrall of cedric of rotherwood this personage had the same sort of sandals with his companion but instead of the roll of leather thong his legs were cased in a sort of gaiters of which one was red and the other yellow he was provided also with a cap having around it more than one bell about the size of those attached to hawks which jingled as he turned his head to one side or other and as he seldom remained a minute in the same posture the sound might be considered as incessant around the edge of this cap was a stiff bandeau of leather cut at the top into open work resembling a coronet while a prolonged bag arose from within it and fell down on one shoulder like an oldfashioned nightcap or a jellybag or the headgear of a modern hussar it was to this part of the cap that the bells were attached which circumstance as well as the shape of his headdress and his own halfcrazed halfcunning expression of countenance sufficiently pointed him out as belonging to the race of domestic clowns or jesters maintained in the houses of the wealthy to help away the tedium of those lingering hours which they were obliged to spend within doors he bore like his companion a scrip attached to his belt but had neither horn nor knife being probably considered as belonging to a class whom it is esteemed dangerous to intrust with edgetools in place of these he was equipped with a sword of lath resembling that with which harlequin operates his wonders upon the modern stage  the outward appearance of these two men formed scarce a stronger contrast than their look and demeanour that of the serf or bondsman was sad and sullen his aspect was bent on the ground with an appearance of deep dejection which might be almost construed into apathy had not the fire which occasionally sparkled in his red eye manifested that there slumbered under the appearance of sullen despondency a sense of oppression and a disposition to resistance the looks of wamba on the other hand indicated as usual with his class a sort of vacant curiosity and fidgetty impatience of any posture of repose together with the utmost selfsatisfaction respecting his own situation and the appearance which he made the dialogue which they maintained between them was carried on in anglosaxon which as we said before was universally spoken by the inferior classes excepting the norman soldiers and the immediate personal dependants of the great feudal nobles but to give their conversation in the original would convey but little information to the modern reader for whose benefit we beg to offer the following translation  the curse of st withold upon these infernal porkers said the swineherd after blowing his horn obstreperously to collect together the scattered herd of swine which answering his call with notes equally melodious made however no haste to remove themselves from the luxurious banquet of beechmast and acorns on which they had fattened or to forsake the marshy banks of the rivulet where several of them half plunged in mud lay stretched at their ease altogether regardless of the voice of their keeper the curse of st withold upon them and upon me said gurth if the twolegged wolf snap not up some of them ere nightfall i am no true man here fangs fangs he ejaculated at the top of his voice to a ragged wolfishlooking dog a sort of lurcher half mastiff half greyhound which ran limping about as if with the purpose of seconding his master in collecting the refractory grunters but which in fact from misapprehension of the swineherds signals ignorance of his own duty or malice prepense only drove them hither and thither and increased the evil which he seemed to design to remedy a devil draw the teeth of him said gurth and the mother of mischief confound the ranger of the forest that cuts the foreclaws off our dogs and makes them unfit for their trade 8 wamba up and help me an thou best a man take a turn round the back o the hill to gain the wind on them and when thoust got the weathergage thou mayst drive them before thee as gently as so many innocent lambs  truly said wamba without stirring from the spot i have consulted my legs upon this matter and they are altogether of opinion that to carry my gay garments through these sloughs would be an act of unfriendship to my sovereign person and royal wardrobe wherefore gurth i advise thee to call off fangs and leave the herd to their destiny which whether they meet with bands of travelling soldiers or of outlaws or of wandering pilgrims can be little else than to be converted into normans before morning to thy no small ease and comfort  the swine turned normans to my comfort quoth gurth expound that to me wamba for my brain is too dull and my mind too vexed to read riddles  why how call you those grunting brutes running about on their four legs demanded wamba  swine fool swine said the herd every fool knows that  and swine is good saxon said the jester but how call you the sow when she is flayed and drawn and quartered and hung up by the heels like a traitor  pork answered the swineherd  i am very glad every fool knows that too said wamba and pork i think is good normanfrench and so when the brute lives and is in the charge of a saxon slave she goes by her saxon name but becomes a norman and is called pork when she is carried to the castlehall to feast among the nobles what dost thou think of this friend gurth ha  it is but too true doctrine friend wamba however it got into thy fools pate  nay i can tell you more said wamba in the same tone there is old alderman ox continues to hold his saxon epithet while he is under the charge of serfs and bondsmen such as thou but becomes beef a fiery french gallant when he arrives before the worshipful jaws that are destined to consume him mynheer calf too becomes monsieur de veau in the like manner he is saxon when he requires tendance and takes a norman name when he becomes matter of enjoyment  by st dunstan answered gurth thou speakest but sad truths little is left to us but the air we breathe and that appears to have been reserved with much hesitation solely for the purpose of enabling us to endure the tasks they lay upon our shoulders the finest and the fattest is for their board the loveliest is for their couch the best and bravest supply their foreign masters with soldiers and whiten distant lands with their bones leaving few here who have either will or the power to protect the unfortunate saxon gods blessing on our master cedric he hath done the work of a man in standing in the gap but reginald frontdeboeuf is coming down to this country in person and we shall soon see how little cedrics trouble will avail himhere here he exclaimed again raising his voice so ho so ho well done fangs thou hast them all before thee now and bringst them on bravely lad  gurth said the jester i know thou thinkest me a fool or thou wouldst not be so rash in putting thy head into my mouth one word to reginald frontdeboeuf or philip de malvoisin that thou hast spoken treason against the normanand thou art but a castaway swineherdthou wouldst waver on one of these trees as a terror to all evil speakers against dignities  dog thou wouldst not betray me said gurth after having led me on to speak so much at disadvantage  betray thee answered the jester no that were the trick of a wise man a fool cannot half so well help himselfbut soft whom have we here he said listening to the trampling of several horses which became then audible  never mind whom answered gurth who had now got his herd before him and with the aid of fangs was driving them down one of the long dim vistas which we have endeavoured to describe  nay but i must see the riders answered wamba perhaps they are come from fairyland with a message from king oberon  a murrain take thee rejoined the swineherd wilt thou talk of such things while a terrible storm of thunder and lightning is raging within a few miles of us hark how the thunder rumbles and for summer rain i never saw such broad downright flat drops fall out of the clouds the oaks too notwithstanding the calm weather sob and creak with their great boughs as if announcing a tempest thou canst play the rational if thou wilt credit me for once and let us home ere the storm begins to rage for the night will be fearful  wamba seemed to feel the force of this appeal and accompanied his companion who began his journey after catching up a long quarterstaff which lay upon the grass beside him this second eumaeus strode hastily down the forest glade driving before him with the assistance of fangs the whole herd of his inharmonious charge     chapter ii       a monk there was a fayre for the maistrie      an outrider that loved venerie      a manly man to be an abbot able      full many a daintie horse had he in stable      and whan he rode men might his bridle hear      gingeling in a whistling wind as clear      and eke as loud as doth the chapell bell      there as this lord was keeper of the cell      chaucer  notwithstanding the occasional exhortation and chiding of his companion the noise of the horsemens feet continuing to approach wamba could not be prevented from lingering occasionally on the road upon every pretence which occurred now catching from the hazel a cluster of halfripe nuts and now turning his head to leer after a cottage maiden who crossed their path the horsemen therefore soon overtook them on the road  their numbers amounted to ten men of whom the two who rode foremost seemed to be persons of considerable importance and the others their attendants it was not difficult to ascertain the condition and character of one of these personages he was obviously an ecclesiastic of high rank his dress was that of a cistercian monk but composed of materials much finer than those which the rule of that order admitted his mantle and hood were of the best flanders cloth and fell in ample and not ungraceful folds around a handsome though somewhat corpulent person his countenance bore as little the marks of selfdenial as his habit indicated contempt of worldly splendour his features might have been called good had there not lurked under the penthouse of his eye that sly epicurean twinkle which indicates the cautious voluptuary in other respects his profession and situation had taught him a ready command over his countenance which he could contract at pleasure into solemnity although its natural expression was that of goodhumoured social indulgence in defiance of conventual rules and the edicts of popes and councils the sleeves of this dignitary were lined and turned up with rich furs his mantle secured at the throat with a golden clasp and the whole dress proper to his order as much refined upon and ornamented as that of a quaker beauty of the present day who while she retains the garb and costume of her sect continues to give to its simplicity by the choice of materials and the mode of disposing them a certain air of coquettish attraction savouring but too much of the vanities of the world  this worthy churchman rode upon a wellfed ambling mule whose furniture was highly decorated and whose bridle according to the fashion of the day was ornamented with silver bells in his seat he had nothing of the awkwardness of the convent but displayed the easy and habitual grace of a welltrained horseman indeed it seemed that so humble a conveyance as a mule in however good case and however well broken to a pleasant and accommodating amble was only used by the gallant monk for travelling on the road a lay brother one of those who followed in the train had for his use on other occasions one of the most handsome spanish jennets ever bred at andalusia which merchants used at that time to import with great trouble and risk for the use of persons of wealth and distinction the saddle and housings of this superb palfrey were covered by a long footcloth which reached nearly to the ground and on which were richly embroidered mitres crosses and other ecclesiastical emblems another lay brother led a sumpter mule loaded probably with his superiors baggage and two monks of his own order of inferior station rode together in the rear laughing and conversing with each other without taking much notice of the other members of the cavalcade  the companion of the church dignitary was a man past forty thin strong tall and muscular an athletic figure which long fatigue and constant exercise seemed to have left none of the softer part of the human form having reduced the whole to brawn bones and sinews which had sustained a thousand toils and were ready to dare a thousand more his head was covered with a scarlet cap faced with furof that kind which the french call mortier from its resemblance to the shape of an inverted mortar his countenance was therefore fully displayed and its expression was calculated to impress a degree of awe if not of fear upon strangers high features naturally strong and powerfully expressive had been burnt almost into negro blackness by constant exposure to the tropical sun and might in their ordinary state be said to slumber after the storm of passion had passed away but the projection of the veins of the forehead the readiness with which the upper lip and its thick black moustaches quivered upon the slightest emotion plainly intimated that the tempest might be again and easily awakened his keen piercing dark eyes told in every glance a history of difficulties subdued and dangers dared and seemed to challenge opposition to his wishes for the pleasure of sweeping it from his road by a determined exertion of courage and of will a deep scar on his brow gave additional sternness to his countenance and a sinister expression to one of his eyes which had been slightly injured on the same occasion and of which the vision though perfect was in a slight and partial degree distorted  the upper dress of this personage resembled that of his companion in shape being a long monastic mantle but the colour being scarlet showed that he did not belong to any of the four regular orders of monks on the right shoulder of the mantle there was cut in white cloth a cross of a peculiar form this upper robe concealed what at first view seemed rather inconsistent with its form a shirt namely of linked mail with sleeves and gloves of the same curiously plaited and interwoven as flexible to the body as those which are now wrought in the stockingloom out of less obdurate materials the forepart of his thighs where the folds of his mantle permitted them to be seen were also covered with linked mail the knees and feet were defended by splints or thin plates of steel ingeniously jointed upon each other and mail hose reaching from the ankle to the knee effectually protected the legs and completed the riders defensive armour in his girdle he wore a long and doubleedged dagger which was the only offensive weapon about his person  he rode not a mule like his companion but a strong hackney for the road to save his gallant warhorse which a squire led behind fully accoutred for battle with a chamfron or plaited headpiece upon his head having a short spike projecting from the front on one side of the saddle hung a short battleaxe richly inlaid with damascene carving on the other the riders plumed headpiece and hood of mail with a long twohanded sword used by the chivalry of the period a second squire held aloft his masters lance from the extremity of which fluttered a small banderole or streamer bearing a cross of the same form with that embroidered upon his cloak he also carried his small triangular shield broad enough at the top to protect the breast and from thence diminishing to a point it was covered with a scarlet cloth which prevented the device from being seen  these two squires were followed by two attendants whose dark visages white turbans and the oriental form of their garments showed them to be natives of some distant eastern country 9  the whole appearance of this warrior and his retinue was wild and outlandish the dress of his squires was gorgeous and his eastern attendants wore silver collars round their throats and bracelets of the same metal upon their swarthy arms and legs of which the former were naked from the elbow and the latter from midleg to ankle silk and embroidery distinguished their dresses and marked the wealth and importance of their master forming at the same time a striking contrast with the martial simplicity of his own attire they were armed with crooked sabres having the hilt and baldric inlaid with gold and matched with turkish daggers of yet more costly workmanship each of them bore at his saddlebow a bundle of darts or javelins about four feet in length having sharp steel heads a weapon much in use among the saracens and of which the memory is yet preserved in the martial exercise called el jerrid still practised in the eastern countries  the steeds of these attendants were in appearance as foreign as their riders they were of saracen origin and consequently of arabian descent and their fine slender limbs small fetlocks thin manes and easy springy motion formed a marked contrast with the largejointed heavy horses of which the race was cultivated in flanders and in normandy for mounting the menatarms of the period in all the panoply of plate and mail and which placed by the side of those eastern coursers might have passed for a personification of substance and of shadow  the singular appearance of this cavalcade not only attracted the curiosity of wamba but excited even that of his less volatile companion the monk he instantly knew to be the prior of jorvaulx abbey well known for many miles around as a lover of the chase of the banquet and if fame did him not wrong of other worldly pleasures still more inconsistent with his monastic vows  yet so loose were the ideas of the times respecting the conduct of the clergy whether secular or regular that the prior aymer maintained a fair character in the neighbourhood of his abbey his free and jovial temper and the readiness with which he granted absolution from all ordinary delinquencies rendered him a favourite among the nobility and principal gentry to several of whom he was allied by birth being of a distinguished norman family the ladies in particular were not disposed to scan too nicely the morals of a man who was a professed admirer of their sex and who possessed many means of dispelling the ennui which was too apt to intrude upon the halls and bowers of an ancient feudal castle the prior mingled in the sports of the field with more than due eagerness and was allowed to possess the besttrained hawks and the fleetest greyhounds in the north riding circumstances which strongly recommended him to the youthful gentry with the old he had another part to play which when needful he could sustain with great decorum his knowledge of books however superficial was sufficient to impress upon their ignorance respect for his supposed learning and the gravity of his deportment and language with the high tone which he exerted in setting forth the authority of the church and of the priesthood impressed them no less with an opinion of his sanctity even the common people the severest critics of the conduct of their betters had commiseration with the follies of prior aymer he was generous and charity as it is well known covereth a multitude of sins in another sense than that in which it is said to do so in scripture the revenues of the monastery of which a large part was at his disposal while they gave him the means of supplying his own very considerable expenses afforded also those largesses which he bestowed among the peasantry and with which he frequently relieved the distresses of the oppressed if prior aymer rode hard in the chase or remained long at the banquetif prior aymer was seen at the early peep of dawn to enter the postern of the abbey as he glided home from some rendezvous which had occupied the hours of darkness men only shrugged up their shoulders and reconciled themselves to his irregularities by recollecting that the same were practised by many of his brethren who had no redeeming qualities whatsoever to atone for them prior aymer therefore and his character were well known to our saxon serfs who made their rude obeisance and received his benedicite mes filz in return  but the singular appearance of his companion and his attendants arrested their attention and excited their wonder and they could scarcely attend to the prior of jorvaulx question when he demanded if they knew of any place of harbourage in the vicinity so much were they surprised at the half monastic half military appearance of the swarthy stranger and at the uncouth dress and arms of his eastern attendants it is probable too that the language in which the benediction was conferred and the information asked sounded ungracious though not probably unintelligible in the ears of the saxon peasants  i asked you my children said the prior raising his voice and using the lingua franca or mixed language in which the norman and saxon races conversed with each other if there be in this neighbourhood any good man who for the love of god and devotion to mother church will give two of her humblest servants with their train a nights hospitality and refreshment  this he spoke with a tone of conscious importance which formed a strong contrast to the modest terms which he thought it proper to employ  two of the humblest servants of mother church repeated wamba to himselfbut fool as he was taking care not to make his observation audible i should like to see her seneschals her chief butlers and other principal domestics  after this internal commentary on the priors speech he raised his eyes and replied to the question which had been put  if the reverend fathers he said loved good cheer and soft lodging few miles of riding would carry them to the priory of brinxworth where their quality could not but secure them the most honourable reception or if they preferred spending a penitential evening they might turn down yonder wild glade which would bring them to the hermitage of copmanhurst where a pious anchoret would make them sharers for the night of the shelter of his roof and the benefit of his prayers  the prior shook his head at both proposals  mine honest friend said he if the jangling of thy bells had not dizzied thine understanding thou mightst know clericus clericum non decimat that is to say we churchmen do not exhaust each others hospitality but rather require that of the laity giving them thus an opportunity to serve god in honouring and relieving his appointed servants  it is true replied wamba that i being but an ass am nevertheless honoured to hear the bells as well as your reverences mule notwithstanding i did conceive that the charity of mother church and her servants might be said with other charity to begin at home  a truce to thine insolence fellow said the armed rider breaking in on his prattle with a high and stern voice and tell us if thou canst the road tohow calld you your franklin prior aymer  cedric answered the prior cedric the saxontell me good fellow are we near his dwelling and can you show us the road  the road will be uneasy to find answered gurth who broke silence for the first time and the family of cedric retire early to rest  tush tell not me fellow said the military rider tis easy for them to arise and supply the wants of travellers such as we are who will not stoop to beg the hospitality which we have a right to command  i know not said gurth sullenly if i should show the way to my masters house to those who demand as a right the shelter which most are fain to ask as a favour  do you dispute with me slave said the soldier and setting spurs to his horse he caused him make a demivolte across the path raising at the same time the riding rod which he held in his hand with a purpose of chastising what he considered as the insolence of the peasant  gurth darted at him a savage and revengeful scowl and with a fierce yet hesitating motion laid his hand on the haft of his knife but the interference of prior aymer who pushed his mule betwixt his companion and the swineherd prevented the meditated violence  nay by st mary brother brian you must not think you are now in palestine predominating over heathen turks and infidel saracens we islanders love not blows save those of holy church who chasteneth whom she lovethtell me good fellow said he to wamba and seconded his speech by a small piece of silver coin the way to cedric the saxons you cannot be ignorant of it and it is your duty to direct the wanderer even when his character is less sanctified than ours  in truth venerable father answered the jester the saracen head of your right reverend companion has frightened out of mine the way homei am not sure i shall get there tonight myself  tush said the abbot thou canst tell us if thou wilt this reverend brother has been all his life engaged in fighting among the saracens for the recovery of the holy sepulchre he is of the order of knights templars whom you may have heard of he is half a monk half a soldier  if he is but half a monk said the jester he should not be wholly unreasonable with those whom he meets upon the road even if they should be in no hurry to answer questions that no way concern them  i forgive thy wit replied the abbot on condition thou wilt show me the way to cedrics mansion  well then answered wamba your reverences must hold on this path till you come to a sunken cross of which scarce a cubits length remains above ground then take the path to the left for there are four which meet at sunken cross and i trust your reverences will obtain shelter before the storm comes on  the abbot thanked his sage adviser and the cavalcade setting spurs to their horses rode on as men do who wish to reach their inn before the bursting of a nightstorm as their horses hoofs died away gurth said to his companion if they follow thy wise direction the reverend fathers will hardly reach rotherwood this night  no said the jester grinning but they may reach sheffield if they have good luck and that is as fit a place for them i am not so bad a woodsman as to show the dog where the deer lies if i have no mind he should chase him  thou art right said gurth it were ill that aymer saw the lady rowena and it were worse it may be for cedric to quarrel as is most likely he would with this military monk but like good servants let us hear and see and say nothing  we return to the riders who had soon left the bondsmen far behind them and who maintained the following conversation in the normanfrench language usually employed by the superior classes with the exception of the few who were still inclined to boast their saxon descent  what mean these fellows by their capricious insolence said the templar to the benedictine and why did you prevent me from chastising it  marry brother brian replied the prior touching the one of them it were hard for me to render a reason for a fool speaking according to his folly and the other churl is of that savage fierce intractable race some of whom as i have often told you are still to be found among the descendants of the conquered saxons and whose supreme pleasure it is to testify by all means in their power their aversion to their conquerors  i would soon have beat him into courtesy observed brian i am accustomed to deal with such spirits our turkish captives are as fierce and intractable as odin himself could have been yet two months in my household under the management of my master of the slaves has made them humble submissive serviceable and observant of your will marry sir you must be aware of the poison and the dagger for they use either with free will when you give them the slightest opportunity  ay but answered prior aymer every land has its own manners and fashions and besides that beating this fellow could procure us no information respecting the road to cedrics house it would have been sure to have established a quarrel betwixt you and him had we found our way thither remember what i told you this wealthy franklin is proud fierce jealous and irritable a withstander of the nobility and even of his neighbors reginald frontdeboeuf and philip malvoisin who are no babies to strive with he stands up sternly for the privileges of his race and is so proud of his uninterrupted descend from hereward a renowned champion of the heptarchy that he is universally called cedric the saxon and makes a boast of his belonging to a people from whom many others endeaver to hide their descent lest they should encounter a share of the vae victis or severities imposed upon the vanquished  prior aymer said the templar you are a man of gallantry learned in the study of beauty and as expert as a troubadour in all matters concerning the arrets of love but i shall expect much beauty in this celebrated rowena to counterbalance the selfdenial and forbearance which i must exert if i am to court the favor of such a seditious churl as you have described her father cedric  cedric is not her father replied the prior and is but of remote relation she is descended from higher blood than even he pretends to and is but distantly connected with him by birth her guardian however he is selfconstituted as i believe but his ward is as dear to him as if she were his own child of her beauty you shall soon be judge and if the purity of her complexion and the majestic yet soft expression of a mild blue eye do not chase from your memory the blacktressed girls of palestine ay or the houris of old mahounds paradise i am an infidel and no true son of the church  should your boasted beauty said the templar be weighed in the balance and found wanting you know our wager  my gold collar answered the prior against ten butts of chian winethey are mine as securely as if they were already in the convent vaults under the key of old dennis the cellarer  and i am myself to be judge said the templar and am only to be convicted on my own admission that i have seen no maiden so beautiful since pentecost was a twelvemonth ran it not soprior your collar is in danger i will wear it over my gorget in the lists of ashbydelazouche  win it fairly said the prior and wear it as ye will i will trust your giving true response on your word as a knight and as a churchman yet brother take my advice and file your tongue to a little more courtesy than your habits of predominating over infidel captives and eastern bondsmen have accustomed you cedric the saxon if offendedand he is noway slack in taking offenceis a man who without respect to your knighthood my high office or the sanctity of either would clear his house of us and send us to lodge with the larks though the hour were midnight and be careful how you look on rowena whom he cherishes with the most jealous care an he take the least alarm in that quarter we are but lost men it is said he banished his only son from his family for lifting his eyes in the way of affection towards this beauty who may be worshipped it seems at a distance but is not to be approached with other thoughts than such as we bring to the shrine of the blessed virgin  well you have said enough answered the templar i will for a night put on the needful restraint and deport me as meekly as a maiden but as for the fear of his expelling us by violence myself and squires with hamet and abdalla will warrant you against that disgrace doubt not that we shall be strong enough to make good our quarters  we must not let it come so far answered the prior but here is the clowns sunken cross and the night is so dark that we can hardly see which of the roads we are to follow he bid us turn i think to the left  to the right said brian to the best of my remembrance  to the left certainly the left i remember his pointing with his wooden sword  ay but he held his sword in his left hand and so pointed across his body with it said the templar  each maintained his opinion with sufficient obstinacy as is usual in all such cases the attendants were appealed to but they had not been near enough to hear wambas directions at length brian remarked what had at first escaped him in the twilight here is some one either asleep or lying dead at the foot of this crosshugo stir him with the buttend of thy lance  this was no sooner done than the figure arose exclaiming in good french whosoever thou art it is discourteous in you to disturb my thoughts  we did but wish to ask you said the prior the road to rotherwood the abode of cedric the saxon  i myself am bound thither replied the stranger and if i had a horse i would be your guide for the way is somewhat intricate though perfectly well known to me  thou shalt have both thanks and reward my friend said the prior if thou wilt bring us to cedrics in safety  and he caused one of his attendants to mount his own led horse and give that upon which he had hitherto ridden to the stranger who was to serve for a guide  their conductor pursued an opposite road from that which wamba had recommended for the purpose of misleading them the path soon led deeper into the woodland and crossed more than one brook the approach to which was rendered perilous by the marshes through which it flowed but the stranger seemed to know as if by instinct the soundest ground and the safest points of passage and by dint of caution and attention brought the party safely into a wilder avenue than any they had yet seen and pointing to a large low irregular building at the upper extremity he said to the prior yonder is rotherwood the dwelling of cedric the saxon  this was a joyful intimation to aymer whose nerves were none of the strongest and who had suffered such agitation and alarm in the course of passing through the dangerous bogs that he had not yet had the curiosity to ask his guide a single question finding himself now at his ease and near shelter his curiosity began to awake and he demanded of the guide who and what he was  a palmer just returned from the holy land was the answer  you had better have tarried there to fight for the recovery of the holy sepulchre said the templar  true reverend sir knight answered the palmer to whom the appearance of the templar seemed perfectly familiar but when those who are under oath to recover the holy city are found travelling at such a distance from the scene of their duties can you wonder that a peaceful peasant like me should decline the task which they have abandoned  the templar would have made an angry reply but was interrupted by the prior who again expressed his astonishment that their guide after such long absence should be so perfectly acquainted with the passes of the forest  i was born a native of these parts answered their guide and as he made the reply they stood before the mansion of cedrica low irregular building containing several courtyards or enclosures extending over a considerable space of ground and which though its size argued the inhabitant to be a person of wealth differed entirely from the tall turretted and castellated buildings in which the norman nobility resided and which had become the universal style of architecture throughout england  rotherwood was not however without defences no habitation in that disturbed period could have been so without the risk of being plundered and burnt before the next morning a deep fosse or ditch was drawn round the whole building and filled with water from a neighbouring stream a double stockade or palisade composed of pointed beams which the adjacent forest supplied defended the outer and inner bank of the trench there was an entrance from the west through the outer stockade which communicated by a drawbridge with a similar opening in the interior defences some precautions had been taken to place those entrances under the protection of projecting angles by which they might be flanked in case of need by archers or slingers  before this entrance the templar wound his horn loudly for the rain which had long threatened began now to descend with great violence     chapter iii       then sad relief from the bleak coast that hears      the german ocean roar deepblooming strong      and yellow haird the blueeyed saxon came      thomsons liberty  in a hall the height of which was greatly disproportioned to its extreme length and width a long oaken table formed of planks roughhewn from the forest and which had scarcely received any polish stood ready prepared for the evening meal of cedric the saxon the roof composed of beams and rafters had nothing to divide the apartment from the sky excepting the planking and thatch there was a huge fireplace at either end of the hall but as the chimneys were constructed in a very clumsy manner at least as much of the smoke found its way into the apartment as escaped by the proper vent the constant vapour which this occasioned had polished the rafters and beams of the lowbrowed hall by encrusting them with a black varnish of soot on the sides of the apartment hung implements of war and of the chase and there were at each corner folding doors which gave access to other parts of the extensive building  the other appointments of the mansion partook of the rude simplicity of the saxon period which cedric piqued himself upon maintaining the floor was composed of earth mixed with lime trodden into a hard substance such as is often employed in flooring our modern barns for about one quarter of the length of the apartment the floor was raised by a step and this space which was called the dais was occupied only by the principal members of the family and visitors of distinction for this purpose a table richly covered with scarlet cloth was placed transversely across the platform from the middle of which ran the longer and lower board at which the domestics and inferior persons fed down towards the bottom of the hall the whole resembled the form of the letter t or some of those ancient dinnertables which arranged on the same principles may be still seen in the antique colleges of oxford or cambridge massive chairs and settles of carved oak were placed upon the dais and over these seats and the more elevated table was fastened a canopy of cloth which served in some degree to protect the dignitaries who occupied that distinguished station from the weather and especially from the rain which in some places found its way through the illconstructed roof  the walls of this upper end of the hall as far as the dais extended were covered with hangings or curtains and upon the floor there was a carpet both of which were adorned with some attempts at tapestry or embroidery executed with brilliant or rather gaudy colouring over the lower range of table the roof as we have noticed had no covering the rough plastered walls were left bare and the rude earthen floor was uncarpeted the board was uncovered by a cloth and rude massive benches supplied the place of chairs  in the centre of the upper table were placed two chairs more elevated than the rest for the master and mistress of the family who presided over the scene of hospitality and from doing so derived their saxon title of honour which signifies the dividers of bread  to each of these chairs was added a footstool curiously carved and inlaid with ivory which mark of distinction was peculiar to them one of these seats was at present occupied by cedric the saxon who though but in rank a thane or as the normans called him a franklin felt at the delay of his evening meal an irritable impatience which might have become an alderman whether of ancient or of modern times  it appeared indeed from the countenance of this proprietor that he was of a frank but hasty and choleric temper he was not above the middle stature but broadshouldered longarmed and powerfully made like one accustomed to endure the fatigue of war or of the chase his face was broad with large blue eyes open and frank features fine teeth and a well formed head altogether expressive of that sort of goodhumour which often lodges with a sudden and hasty temper pride and jealousy there was in his eye for his life had been spent in asserting rights which were constantly liable to invasion and the prompt fiery and resolute disposition of the man had been kept constantly upon the alert by the circumstances of his situation his long yellow hair was equally divided on the top of his head and upon his brow and combed down on each side to the length of his shoulders it had but little tendency to grey although cedric was approaching to his sixtieth year  his dress was a tunic of forest green furred at the throat and cuffs with what was called minever a kind of fur inferior in quality to ermine and formed it is believed of the skin of the grey squirrel this doublet hung unbuttoned over a close dress of scarlet which sat tight to his body he had breeches of the same but they did not reach below the lower part of the thigh leaving the knee exposed his feet had sandals of the same fashion with the peasants but of finer materials and secured in the front with golden clasps he had bracelets of gold upon his arms and a broad collar of the same precious metal around his neck about his waist he wore a richlystudded belt in which was stuck a short straight twoedged sword with a sharp point so disposed as to hang almost perpendicularly by his side behind his seat was hung a scarlet cloth cloak lined with fur and a cap of the same materials richly embroidered which completed the dress of the opulent landholder when he chose to go forth a short boarspear with a broad and bright steel head also reclined against the back of his chair which served him when he walked abroad for the purposes of a staff or of a weapon as chance might require  several domestics whose dress held various proportions betwixt the richness of their masters and the coarse and simple attire of gurth the swineherd watched the looks and waited the commands of the saxon dignitary two or three servants of a superior order stood behind their master upon the dais the rest occupied the lower part of the hall other attendants there were of a different description two or three large and shaggy greyhounds such as were then employed in hunting the stag and wolf as many slowhounds of a large bony breed with thick necks large heads and long ears and one or two of the smaller dogs now called terriers which waited with impatience the arrival of the supper but with the sagacious knowledge of physiognomy peculiar to their race forbore to intrude upon the moody silence of their master apprehensive probably of a small white truncheon which lay by cedrics trencher for the purpose of repelling the advances of his fourlegged dependants one grisly old wolfdog alone with the liberty of an indulged favourite had planted himself close by the chair of state and occasionally ventured to solicit notice by putting his large hairy head upon his masters knee or pushing his nose into his hand even he was repelled by the stern command down balder down i am not in the humour for foolery  in fact cedric as we have observed was in no very placid state of mind the lady rowena who had been absent to attend an evening mass at a distant church had but just returned and was changing her garments which had been wetted by the storm there were as yet no tidings of gurth and his charge which should long since have been driven home from the forest and such was the insecurity of the period as to render it probable that the delay might be explained by some depreciation of the outlaws with whom the adjacent forest abounded or by the violence of some neighbouring baron whose consciousness of strength made him equally negligent of the laws of property the matter was of consequence for great part of the domestic wealth of the saxon proprietors consisted in numerous herds of swine especially in forestland where those animals easily found their food  besides these subjects of anxiety the saxon thane was impatient for the presence of his favourite clown wamba whose jests such as they were served for a sort of seasoning to his evening meal and to the deep draughts of ale and wine with which he was in the habit of accompanying it add to all this cedric had fasted since noon and his usual supper hour was long past a cause of irritation common to country squires both in ancient and modern times his displeasure was expressed in broken sentences partly muttered to himself partly addressed to the domestics who stood around and particularly to his cupbearer who offered him from time to time as a sedative a silver goblet filled with winewhy tarries the lady rowena  she is but changing her headgear replied a female attendant with as much confidence as the favourite ladysmaid usually answers the master of a modern family you would not wish her to sit down to the banquet in her hood and kirtle and no lady within the shire can be quicker in arraying herself than my mistress  this undeniable argument produced a sort of acquiescent umph on the part of the saxon with the addition i wish her devotion may choose fair weather for the next visit to st johns kirkbut what in the name of ten devils continued he turning to the cupbearer and raising his voice as if happy to have found a channel into which he might divert his indignation without fear or controlwhat in the name of ten devils keeps gurth so long afield i suppose we shall have an evil account of the herd he was wont to be a faithful and cautious drudge and i had destined him for something better perchance i might even have made him one of my warders 11  oswald the cupbearer modestly suggested that it was scarce an hour since the tolling of the curfew an illchosen apology since it turned upon a topic so harsh to saxon ears  the foul fiend exclaimed cedric take the curfewbell and the tyrannical bastard by whom it was devised and the heartless slave who names it with a saxon tongue to a saxon ear the curfew he added pausing ay the curfew which compels true men to extinguish their lights that thieves and robbers may work their deeds in darknessay the curfewreginald frontdeboeuf and philip de malvoisin know the use of the curfew as well as william the bastard himself or eer a norman adventurer that fought at hastings i shall hear i guess that my property has been swept off to save from starving the hungry banditti whom they cannot support but by theft and robbery my faithful slave is murdered and my goods are taken for a preyand wambawhere is wamba said not some one he had gone forth with gurth  oswald replied in the affirmative  ay why this is better and better he is carried off too the saxon fool to serve the norman lord fools are we all indeed that serve them and fitter subjects for their scorn and laughter than if we were born with but half our wits but i will be avenged he added starting from his chair in impatience at the supposed injury and catching hold of his boarspear i will go with my complaint to the great council i have friends i have followersman to man will i appeal the norman to the lists let him come in his plate and his mail and all that can render cowardice bold i have sent such a javelin as this through a stronger fence than three of their war shieldshaply they think me old but they shall find alone and childless as i am the blood of hereward is in the veins of cedricah wilfred wilfred he exclaimed in a lower tone couldst thou have ruled thine unreasonable passion thy father had not been left in his age like the solitary oak that throws out its shattered and unprotected branches against the full sweep of the tempest the reflection seemed to conjure into sadness his irritated feelings replacing his javelin he resumed his seat bent his looks downward and appeared to be absorbed in melancholy reflection  from his musing cedric was suddenly awakened by the blast of a horn which was replied to by the clamorous yells and barking of all the dogs in the hall and some twenty or thirty which were quartered in other parts of the building it cost some exercise of the white truncheon well seconded by the exertions of the domestics to silence this canine clamour  to the gate knaves said the saxon hastily as soon as the tumult was so much appeased that the dependants could hear his voice see what tidings that horn tells us ofto announce i ween some hership 12 and robbery which has been done upon my lands  returning in less than three minutes a warder announced that the prior aymer of jorvaulx and the good knight brian de boisguilbert commander of the valiant and venerable order of knights templars with a small retinue requested hospitality and lodging for the night being on their way to a tournament which was to be held not far from ashbydelazouche on the second day from the present  aymer the prior aymer brian de boisguilbertmuttered cedric normans bothbut norman or saxon the hospitality of rotherwood must not be impeached they are welcome since they have chosen to haltmore welcome would they have been to have ridden further on their waybut it were unworthy to murmur for a nights lodging and a nights food in the quality of guests at least even normans must suppress their insolencego hundebert he added to a sort of majordomo who stood behind him with a white wand take six of the attendants and introduce the strangers to the guests lodging look after their horses and mules and see their train lack nothing let them have change of vestments if they require it and fire and water to wash and wine and ale and bid the cooks add what they hastily can to our evening meal and let it be put on the board when those strangers are ready to share it say to them hundebert that cedric would himself bid them welcome but he is under a vow never to step more than three steps from the dais of his own hall to meet any who shares not the blood of saxon royalty begone see them carefully tended let them not say in their pride the saxon churl has shown at once his poverty and his avarice  the majordomo departed with several attendants to execute his masters commands  the prior aymer repeated cedric looking to oswald the brother if i mistake not of giles de mauleverer now lord of middleham  oswald made a respectful sign of assent his brother sits in the seat and usurps the patrimony of a better race the race of ulfgar of middleham but what norman lord doth not the same this prior is they say a free and jovial priest who loves the winecup and the buglehorn better than bell and book good let him come he shall be welcome how named ye the templar  brian de boisguilbert  boisguilbert said cedric still in the musing halfarguing tone which the habit of living among dependants had accustomed him to employ and which resembled a man who talks to himself rather than to those around himboisguilbert that name has been spread wide both for good and evil they say he is valiant as the bravest of his order but stained with their usual vices pride arrogance cruelty and voluptuousness a hardhearted man who knows neither fear of earth nor awe of heaven so say the few warriors who have returned from palestinewell it is but for one night he shall be welcome toooswald broach the oldest winecask place the best mead the mightiest ale the richest morat the most sparkling cider the most odoriferous pigments upon the board fill the largest horns 13 templars and abbots love good wines and good measureelgitha let thy lady rowena know we shall not this night expect her in the hall unless such be her especial pleasure  but it will be her especial pleasure answered elgitha with great readiness for she is ever desirous to hear the latest news from palestine  cedric darted at the forward damsel a glance of hasty resentment but rowena and whatever belonged to her were privileged and secure from his anger he only replied silence maiden thy tongue outruns thy discretion say my message to thy mistress and let her do her pleasure here at least the descendant of alfred still reigns a princess elgitha left the apartment  palestine repeated the saxon palestine how many ears are turned to the tales which dissolute crusaders or hypocritical pilgrims bring from that fatal land i too might aski too might enquirei too might listen with a beating heart to fables which the wily strollers devise to cheat us into hospitalitybut nothe son who has disobeyed me is no longer mine nor will i concern myself more for his fate than for that of the most worthless among the millions that ever shaped the cross on their shoulder rushed into excess and bloodguiltiness and called it an accomplishment of the will of god  he knit his brows and fixed his eyes for an instant on the ground as he raised them the folding doors at the bottom of the hall were cast wide and preceded by the majordomo with his wand and four domestics bearing blazing torches the guests of the evening entered the apartment     chapter iv       with sheep and shaggy goats the porkers bled      and the proud steer was on the marble spread      with fire prepared they deal the morsels round      wine rosy bright the brimming goblets crownd                disposed apart ulysses shares the treat      a trivet table and ignobler seat      the prince assigns      odyssey book xxi  the prior aymer had taken the opportunity afforded him of changing his riding robe for one of yet more costly materials over which he wore a cope curiously embroidered besides the massive golden signet ring which marked his ecclesiastical dignity his fingers though contrary to the canon were loaded with precious gems his sandals were of the finest leather which was imported from spain his beard trimmed to as small dimensions as his order would possibly permit and his shaven crown concealed by a scarlet cap richly embroidered  the appearance of the knight templar was also changed and though less studiously bedecked with ornament his dress was as rich and his appearance far more commanding than that of his companion he had exchanged his shirt of mail for an under tunic of dark purple silk garnished with furs over which flowed his long robe of spotless white in ample folds the eightpointed cross of his order was cut on the shoulder of his mantle in black velvet the high cap no longer invested his brows which were only shaded by short and thick curled hair of a raven blackness corresponding to his unusually swart complexion nothing could be more gracefully majestic than his step and manner had they not been marked by a predominant air of haughtiness easily acquired by the exercise of unresisted authority  these two dignified persons were followed by their respective attendants and at a more humble distance by their guide whose figure had nothing more remarkable than it derived from the usual weeds of a pilgrim a cloak or mantle of coarse black serge enveloped his whole body it was in shape something like the cloak of a modern hussar having similar flaps for covering the arms and was called a sclaveyn or sclavonian coarse sandals bound with thongs on his bare feet a broad and shadowy hat with cockleshells stitched on its brim and a long staff shod with iron to the upper end of which was attached a branch of palm completed the palmers attire he followed modestly the last of the train which entered the hall and observing that the lower table scarce afforded room sufficient for the domestics of cedric and the retinue of his guests he withdrew to a settle placed beside and almost under one of the large chimneys and seemed to employ himself in drying his garments until the retreat of some one should make room at the board or the hospitality of the steward should supply him with refreshments in the place he had chosen apart  cedric rose to receive his guests with an air of dignified hospitality and descending from the dais or elevated part of his hall made three steps towards them and then awaited their approach  i grieve he said reverend prior that my vow binds me to advance no farther upon this floor of my fathers even to receive such guests as you and this valiant knight of the holy temple but my steward has expounded to you the cause of my seeming discourtesy let me also pray that you will excuse my speaking to you in my native language and that you will reply in the same if your knowledge of it permits if not i sufficiently understand norman to follow your meaning  vows said the abbot must be unloosed worthy franklin or permit me rather to say worthy thane though the title is antiquated vows are the knots which tie us to heaventhey are the cords which bind the sacrifice to the horns of the altarand are thereforeas i said beforeto be unloosened and discharged unless our holy mother church shall pronounce the contrary and respecting language i willingly hold communication in that spoken by my respected grandmother hilda of middleham who died in odour of sanctity little short if we may presume to say so of her glorious namesake the blessed saint hilda of whitby god be gracious to her soul  when the prior had ceased what he meant as a conciliatory harangue his companion said briefly and emphatically i speak ever french the language of king richard and his nobles but i understand english sufficiently to communicate with the natives of the country  cedric darted at the speaker one of those hasty and impatient glances which comparisons between the two rival nations seldom failed to call forth but recollecting the duties of hospitality he suppressed further show of resentment and motioning with his hand caused his guests to assume two seats a little lower than his own but placed close beside him and gave a signal that the evening meal should be placed upon the board  while the attendants hastened to obey cedrics commands his eye distinguished gurth the swineherd who with his companion wamba had just entered the hall send these loitering knaves up hither said the saxon impatiently and when the culprits came before the daishow comes it villains that you have loitered abroad so late as this hast thou brought home thy charge sirrah gurth or hast thou left them to robbers and marauders  the herd is safe so please ye said gurth  but it does not please me thou knave said cedric that i should be made to suppose otherwise for two hours and sit here devising vengeance against my neighbours for wrongs they have not done me i tell thee shackles and the prisonhouse shall punish the next offence of this kind  gurth knowing his masters irritable temper attempted no exculpation but the jester who could presume upon cedrics tolerance by virtue of his privileges as a fool replied for them both in troth uncle cedric you are neither wise nor reasonable tonight  how sir said his master you shall to the porters lodge and taste of the discipline there if you give your foolery such license  first let your wisdom tell me said wamba is it just and reasonable to punish one person for the fault of another  certainly not fool answered cedric  then why should you shackle poor gurth uncle for the fault of his dog fangs for i dare be sworn we lost not a minute by the way when we had got our herd together which fangs did not manage until we heard the vesperbell  then hang up fangs said cedric turning hastily towards the swineherd if the fault is his and get thee another dog  under favour uncle said the jester that were still somewhat on the bowhand of fair justice for it was no fault of fangs that he was lame and could not gather the herd but the fault of those that struck off two of his foreclaws an operation for which if the poor fellow had been consulted he would scarce have given his voice  and who dared to lame an animal which belonged to my bondsman said the saxon kindling in wrath  marry that did old hubert said wamba sir philip de malvoisins keeper of the chase he caught fangs strolling in the forest and said he chased the deer contrary to his masters right as warden of the walk  the foul fiend take malvoisin answered the saxon and his keeper both i will teach them that the wood was disforested in terms of the great forest charter but enough of this go to knave go to thy placeand thou gurth get thee another dog and should the keeper dare to touch it i will mar his archery the curse of a coward on my head if i strike not off the forefinger of his right handhe shall draw bowstring no morei crave your pardon my worthy guests i am beset here with neighbours that match your infidels sir knight in holy land but your homely fare is before you feed and let welcome make amends for hard fare  the feast however which was spread upon the board needed no apologies from the lord of the mansion swines flesh dressed in several modes appeared on the lower part of the board as also that of fowls deer goats and hares and various kinds of fish together with huge loaves and cakes of bread and sundry confections made of fruits and honey the smaller sorts of wildfowl of which there was abundance were not served up in platters but brought in upon small wooden spits or broaches and offered by the pages and domestics who bore them to each guest in succession who cut from them such a portion as he pleased beside each person of rank was placed a goblet of silver the lower board was accommodated with large drinking horns  when the repast was about to commence the majordomo or steward suddenly raising his wand said aloudforbearplace for the lady rowena  a sidedoor at the upper end of the hall now opened behind the banquet table and rowena followed by four female attendants entered the apartment cedric though surprised and perhaps not altogether agreeably so at his ward appearing in public on this occasion hastened to meet her and to conduct her with respectful ceremony to the elevated seat at his own right hand appropriated to the lady of the mansion all stood up to receive her and replying to their courtesy by a mute gesture of salutation she moved gracefully forward to assume her place at the board ere she had time to do so the templar whispered to the prior i shall wear no collar of gold of yours at the tournament the chian wine is your own  said i not so answered the prior but check your raptures the franklin observes you  unheeding this remonstrance and accustomed only to act upon the immediate impulse of his own wishes brian de boisguilbert kept his eyes riveted on the saxon beauty more striking perhaps to his imagination because differing widely from those of the eastern sultanas  formed in the best proportions of her sex rowena was tall in stature yet not so much so as to attract observation on account of superior height her complexion was exquisitely fair but the noble cast of her head and features prevented the insipidity which sometimes attaches to fair beauties her clear blue eye which sat enshrined beneath a graceful eyebrow of brown sufficiently marked to give expression to the forehead seemed capable to kindle as well as melt to command as well as to beseech if mildness were the more natural expression of such a combination of features it was plain that in the present instance the exercise of habitual superiority and the reception of general homage had given to the saxon lady a loftier character which mingled with and qualified that bestowed by nature her profuse hair of a colour betwixt brown and flaxen was arranged in a fanciful and graceful manner in numerous ringlets to form which art had probably aided nature these locks were braided with gems and being worn at full length intimated the noble birth and freeborn condition of the maiden a golden chain to which was attached a small reliquary of the same metal hung round her neck she wore bracelets on her arms which were bare her dress was an undergown and kirtle of pale seagreen silk over which hung a long loose robe which reached to the ground having very wide sleeves which came down however very little below the elbow this robe was crimson and manufactured out of the very finest wool a veil of silk interwoven with gold was attached to the upper part of it which could be at the wearers pleasure either drawn over the face and bosom after the spanish fashion or disposed as a sort of drapery round the shoulders  when rowena perceived the knight templars eyes bent on her with an ardour that compared with the dark caverns under which they moved gave them the effect of lighted charcoal she drew with dignity the veil around her face as an intimation that the determined freedom of his glance was disagreeable cedric saw the motion and its cause sir templar said he the cheeks of our saxon maidens have seen too little of the sun to enable them to bear the fixed glance of a crusader  if i have offended replied sir brian i crave your pardonthat is i crave the lady rowenas pardonfor my humility will carry me no lower  the lady rowena said the prior has punished us all in chastising the boldness of my friend let me hope she will be less cruel to the splendid train which are to meet at the tournament  our going thither said cedric is uncertain i love not these vanities which were unknown to my fathers when england was free  let us hope nevertheless said the prior our company may determine you to travel thitherward when the roads are so unsafe the escort of sir brian de boisguilbert is not to be despised  sir prior answered the saxon wheresoever i have travelled in this land i have hitherto found myself with the assistance of my good sword and faithful followers in no respect needful of other aid at present if we indeed journey to ashbydelazouche we do so with my noble neighbour and countryman athelstane of coningsburgh and with such a train as would set outlaws and feudal enemies at defiancei drink to you sir prior in this cup of wine which i trust your taste will approve and i thank you for your courtesy should you be so rigid in adhering to monastic rule he added as to prefer your acid preparation of milk i hope you will not strain courtesy to do me reason  nay said the priest laughing it is only in our abbey that we confine ourselves to the lac dulce or the lac acidum either conversing with the world we use the worlds fashions and therefore i answer your pledge in this honest wine and leave the weaker liquor to my laybrother  and i said the templar filling his goblet drink wassail to the fair rowena for since her namesake introduced the word into england has never been one more worthy of such a tribute by my faith i could pardon the unhappy vortigern had he half the cause that we now witness for making shipwreck of his honour and his kingdom  i will spare your courtesy sir knight said rowena with dignity and without unveiling herself or rather i will tax it so far as to require of you the latest news from palestine a theme more agreeable to our english ears than the compliments which your french breeding teaches  i have little of importance to say lady answered sir brian de boisguilbert excepting the confirmed tidings of a truce with saladin  he was interrupted by wamba who had taken his appropriated seat upon a chair the back of which was decorated with two asss ears and which was placed about two steps behind that of his master who from time to time supplied him with victuals from his own trencher a favour however which the jester shared with the favourite dogs of whom as we have already noticed there were several in attendance here sat wamba with a small table before him his heels tucked up against the bar of the chair his cheeks sucked up so as to make his jaws resemble a pair of nutcrackers and his eyes halfshut yet watching with alertness every opportunity to exercise his licensed foolery  these truces with the infidels he exclaimed without caring how suddenly he interrupted the stately templar make an old man of me  go to knave how so said cedric his features prepared to receive favourably the expected jest  because answered wamba i remember three of them in my day each of which was to endure for the course of fifty years so that by computation i must be at least a hundred and fifty years old  i will warrant you against dying of old age however said the templar who now recognised his friend of the forest i will assure you from all deaths but a violent one if you give such directions to wayfarers as you did this night to the prior and me  how sirrah said cedric misdirect travellers we must have you whipt you are at least as much rogue as fool  i pray thee uncle answered the jester let my folly for once protect my roguery i did but make a mistake between my right hand and my left and he might have pardoned a greater who took a fool for his counsellor and guide  conversation was here interrupted by the entrance of the porters page who announced that there was a stranger at the gate imploring admittance and hospitality  admit him said cedric be he who or what he maya night like that which roars without compels even wild animals to herd with tame and to seek the protection of man their mortal foe rather than perish by the elements let his wants be ministered to with all carelook to it oswald  and the steward left the banqueting hall to see the commands of his patron obeyed     chapter v     hath not a jew eyes hath not a jew hands organs dimensions   senses affections passions fed with the same food hurt with   the same weapons subject to the same diseases healed by the   same means warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as   a christian is   merchant of venice  oswald returning whispered into the ear of his master it is a jew who calls himself isaac of york is it fit i should marshall him into the hall  let gurth do thine office oswald said wamba with his usual effrontery the swineherd will be a fit usher to the jew  st mary said the abbot crossing himself an unbelieving jew and admitted into this presence  a dog jew echoed the templar to approach a defender of the holy sepulchre  by my faith said wamba it would seem the templars love the jews inheritance better than they do their company  peace my worthy guests said cedric my hospitality must not be bounded by your dislikes if heaven bore with the whole nation of stiffnecked unbelievers for more years than a layman can number we may endure the presence of one jew for a few hours but i constrain no man to converse or to feed with himlet him have a board and a morsel apartunless he said smiling these turband strangers will admit his society  sir franklin answered the templar my saracen slaves are true moslems and scorn as much as any christian to hold intercourse with a jew  now in faith said wamba i cannot see that the worshippers of mahound and termagaunt have so greatly the advantage over the people once chosen of heaven  he shall sit with thee wamba said cedric the fool and the knave will be well met  the fool answered wamba raising the relics of a gammon of bacon will take care to erect a bulwark against the knave  hush said cedric for here he comes  introduced with little ceremony and advancing with fear and hesitation and many a bow of deep humility a tall thin old man who however had lost by the habit of stooping much of his actual height approached the lower end of the board his features keen and regular with an aquiline nose and piercing black eyes his high and wrinkled forehead and long grey hair and beard would have been considered as handsome had they not been the marks of a physiognomy peculiar to a race which during those dark ages was alike detested by the credulous and prejudiced vulgar and persecuted by the greedy and rapacious nobility and who perhaps owing to that very hatred and persecution had adopted a national character in which there was much to say the least mean and unamiable  the jews dress which appeared to have suffered considerably from the storm was a plain russet cloak of many folds covering a dark purple tunic he had large boots lined with fur and a belt around his waist which sustained a small knife together with a case for writing materials but no weapon he wore a high square yellow cap of a peculiar fashion assigned to his nation to distinguish them from christians and which he doffed with great humility at the door of the hall  the reception of this person in the hall of cedric the saxon was such as might have satisfied the most prejudiced enemy of the tribes of israel cedric himself coldly nodded in answer to the jews repeated salutations and signed to him to take place at the lower end of the table where however no one offered to make room for him on the contrary as he passed along the file casting a timid supplicating glance and turning towards each of those who occupied the lower end of the board the saxon domestics squared their shoulders and continued to devour their supper with great perseverance paying not the least attention to the wants of the new guest the attendants of the abbot crossed themselves with looks of pious horror and the very heathen saracens as isaac drew near them curled up their whiskers with indignation and laid their hands on their poniards as if ready to rid themselves by the most desperate means from the apprehended contamination of his nearer approach  probably the same motives which induced cedric to open his hall to this son of a rejected people would have made him insist on his attendants receiving isaac with more courtesy but the abbot had at this moment engaged him in a most interesting discussion on the breed and character of his favourite hounds which he would not have interrupted for matters of much greater importance than that of a jew going to bed supperless while isaac thus stood an outcast in the present society like his people among the nations looking in vain for welcome or resting place the pilgrim who sat by the chimney took compassion upon him and resigned his seat saying briefly old man my garments are dried my hunger is appeased thou art both wet and fasting so saying he gathered together and brought to a flame the decaying brands which lay scattered on the ample hearth took from the larger board a mess of pottage and seethed kid placed it upon the small table at which he had himself supped and without waiting the jews thanks went to the other side of the hallwhether from unwillingness to hold more close communication with the object of his benevolence or from a wish to draw near to the upper end of the table seemed uncertain  had there been painters in those days capable to execute such a subject the jew as he bent his withered form and expanded his chilled and trembling hands over the fire would have formed no bad emblematical personification of the winter season having dispelled the cold he turned eagerly to the smoking mess which was placed before him and ate with a haste and an apparent relish that seemed to betoken long abstinence from food  meanwhile the abbot and cedric continued their discourse upon hunting the lady rowena seemed engaged in conversation with one of her attendant females and the haughty templar whose eye wandered from the jew to the saxon beauty revolved in his mind thoughts which appeared deeply to interest him  i marvel worthy cedric said the abbot as their discourse proceeded that great as your predilection is for your own manly language you do not receive the normanfrench into your favour so far at least as the mystery of woodcraft and hunting is concerned surely no tongue is so rich in the various phrases which the fieldsports demand or furnishes means to the experienced woodman so well to express his jovial art  good father aymer said the saxon be it known to you i care not for those oversea refinements without which i can well enough take my pleasure in the woods i can wind my horn though i call not the blast either a recheate or a mortei can cheer my dogs on the prey and i can flay and quarter the animal when it is brought down without using the newfangled jargon of curee arbor nombles and all the babble of the fabulous sir tristrem 14  the french said the templar raising his voice with the presumptuous and authoritative tone which he used upon all occasions is not only the natural language of the chase but that of love and of war in which ladies should be won and enemies defied  pledge me in a cup of wine sir templar said cedric and fill another to the abbot while i look back some thirty years to tell you another tale as cedric the saxon then was his plain english tale needed no garnish from french troubadours when it was told in the ear of beauty and the field of northallerton upon the day of the holy standard could tell whether the saxon warcry was not heard as far within the ranks of the scottish host as the cri de guerre of the boldest norman baron to the memory of the brave who fought therepledge me my guests he drank deep and went on with increasing warmth ay that was a day of cleaving of shields when a hundred banners were bent forwards over the heads of the valiant and blood flowed round like water and death was held better than flight a saxon bard had called it a feast of the swordsa gathering of the eagles to the preythe clashing of bills upon shield and helmet the shouting of battle more joyful than the clamour of a bridal but our bards are no more he said our deeds are lost in those of another raceour languageour very nameis hastening to decay and none mourns for it save one solitary old mancupbearer knave fill the gobletsto the strong in arms sir templar be their race or language what it will who now bear them best in palestine among the champions of the cross  it becomes not one wearing this badge to answer said sir brian de boisguilbert yet to whom besides the sworn champions of the holy sepulchre can the palm be assigned among the champions of the cross  to the knights hospitallers said the abbot i have a brother of their order  i impeach not their fame said the templar nevertheless  i think friend cedric said wamba interfering that had richard of the lions heart been wise enough to have taken a fools advice he might have staid at home with his merry englishmen and left the recovery of jerusalem to those same knights who had most to do with the loss of it  were there then none in the english army said the lady rowena whose names are worthy to be mentioned with the knights of the temple and of st john  forgive me lady replied de boisguilbert the english monarch did indeed bring to palestine a host of gallant warriors second only to those whose breasts have been the unceasing bulwark of that blessed land  second to none said the pilgrim who had stood near enough to hear and had listened to this conversation with marked impatience all turned toward the spot from whence this unexpected asseveration was heard  i say repeated the pilgrim in a firm and strong voice that the english chivalry were second to none who ever drew sword in defence of the holy land i say besides for i saw it that king richard himself and five of his knights held a tournament after the taking of st johndeacre as challengers against all comers i say that on that day each knight ran three courses and cast to the ground three antagonists i add that seven of these assailants were knights of the templeand sir brian de boisguilbert well knows the truth of what i tell you  it is impossible for language to describe the bitter scowl of rage which rendered yet darker the swarthy countenance of the templar in the extremity of his resentment and confusion his quivering fingers griped towards the handle of his sword and perhaps only withdrew from the consciousness that no act of violence could be safely executed in that place and presence cedric whose feelings were all of a right onward and simple kind and were seldom occupied by more than one object at once omitted in the joyous glee with which he heard of the glory of his countrymen to remark the angry confusion of his guest i would give thee this golden bracelet pilgrim he said couldst thou tell me the names of those knights who upheld so gallantly the renown of merry england  that will i do blithely replied the pilgrim and without guerdon my oath for a time prohibits me from touching gold  i will wear the bracelet for you if you will friend palmer said wamba  the first in honour as in arms in renown as in place said the pilgrim was the brave richard king of england  i forgive him said cedric i forgive him his descent from the tyrant duke william  the earl of leicester was the second continued the pilgrim sir thomas multon of gilsland was the third  of saxon descent he at least said cedric with exultation  sir foulk doilly the fourth proceeded the pilgrim  saxon also at least by the mothers side continued cedric who listened with the utmost eagerness and forgot in part at least his hatred to the normans in the common triumph of the king of england and his islanders and who was the fifth he demanded  the fifth was sir edwin turneham  genuine saxon by the soul of hengist shouted cedricand the sixth he continued with eagernesshow name you the sixth  the sixth said the palmer after a pause in which he seemed to recollect himself was a young knight of lesser renown and lower rank assumed into that honourable company less to aid their enterprise than to make up their numberhis name dwells not in my memory  sir palmer said sir brian de boisguilbert scornfully this assumed forgetfulness after so much has been remembered comes too late to serve your purpose i will myself tell the name of the knight before whose lance fortune and my horses fault occasioned my fallingit was the knight of ivanhoe nor was there one of the six that for his years had more renown in armsyet this will i say and loudlythat were he in england and durst repeat in this weeks tournament the challenge of st johndeacre i mounted and armed as i now am would give him every advantage of weapons and abide the result  your challenge would soon be answered replied the palmer were your antagonist near you as the matter is disturb not the peaceful hall with vaunts of the issue of the conflict which you well know cannot take place if ivanhoe ever returns from palestine i will be his surety that he meets you  a goodly security said the knight templar and what do you proffer as a pledge  this reliquary said the palmer taking a small ivory box from his bosom and crossing himself containing a portion of the true cross brought from the monastery of mount carmel  the prior of jorvaulx crossed himself and repeated a pater noster in which all devoutly joined excepting the jew the mahomedans and the templar the latter of whom without vailing his bonnet or testifying any reverence for the alleged sanctity of the relic took from his neck a gold chain which he flung on the board sayinglet prior aymer hold my pledge and that of this nameless vagrant in token that when the knight of ivanhoe comes within the four seas of britain he underlies the challenge of brian de boisguilbert which if he answer not i will proclaim him as a coward on the walls of every temple court in europe  it will not need said the lady rowena breaking silence my voice shall be heard if no other in this hall is raised in behalf of the absent ivanhoe i affirm he will meet fairly every honourable challenge could my weak warrant add security to the inestimable pledge of this holy pilgrim i would pledge name and fame that ivanhoe gives this proud knight the meeting he desires  a crowd of conflicting emotions seemed to have occupied cedric and kept him silent during this discussion gratified pride resentment embarrassment chased each other over his broad and open brow like the shadow of clouds drifting over a harvestfield while his attendants on whom the name of the sixth knight seemed to produce an effect almost electrical hung in suspense upon their masters looks but when rowena spoke the sound of her voice seemed to startle him from his silence  lady said cedric this beseems not were further pledge necessary i myself offended and justly offended as i am would yet gage my honour for the honour of ivanhoe but the wager of battle is complete even according to the fantastic fashions of norman chivalryis it not father aymer  it is replied the prior and the blessed relic and rich chain will i bestow safely in the treasury of our convent until the decision of this warlike challenge  having thus spoken he crossed himself again and again and after many genuflections and muttered prayers he delivered the reliquary to brother ambrose his attendant monk while he himself swept up with less ceremony but perhaps with no less internal satisfaction the golden chain and bestowed it in a pouch lined with perfumed leather which opened under his arm and now sir cedric he said my ears are chiming vespers with the strength of your good winepermit us another pledge to the welfare of the lady rowena and indulge us with liberty to pass to our repose  by the rood of bromholme said the saxon you do but small credit to your fame sir prior report speaks you a bonny monk that would hear the matin chime ere he quitted his bowl and old as i am i feared to have shame in encountering you but by my faith a saxon boy of twelve in my time would not so soon have relinquished his goblet  the prior had his own reasons however for persevering in the course of temperance which he had adopted he was not only a professional peacemaker but from practice a hater of all feuds and brawls it was not altogether from a love to his neighbour or to himself or from a mixture of both on the present occasion he had an instinctive apprehension of the fiery temper of the saxon and saw the danger that the reckless and presumptuous spirit of which his companion had already given so many proofs might at length produce some disagreeable explosion he therefore gently insinuated the incapacity of the native of any other country to engage in the genial conflict of the bowl with the hardy and strongheaded saxons something he mentioned but slightly about his own holy character and ended by pressing his proposal to depart to repose  the gracecup was accordingly served round and the guests after making deep obeisance to their landlord and to the lady rowena arose and mingled in the hall while the heads of the family by separate doors retired with their attendants  unbelieving dog said the templar to isaac the jew as he passed him in the throng dost thou bend thy course to the tournament  i do so propose replied isaac bowing in all humility if it please your reverend valour  ay said the knight to gnaw the bowels of our nobles with usury and to gull women and boys with gauds and toysi warrant thee store of shekels in thy jewish scrip  not a shekel not a silver penny not a halflingso help me the god of abraham said the jew clasping his hands i go but to seek the assistance of some brethren of my tribe to aid me to pay the fine which the exchequer of the jews have imposed upon mefather jacob be my speed i am an impoverished wretchthe very gaberdine i wear is borrowed from reuben of tadcaster 15  the templar smiled sourly as he replied beshrew thee for a falsehearted liar and passing onward as if disdaining farther conference he communed with his moslem slaves in a language unknown to the bystanders the poor israelite seemed so staggered by the address of the military monk that the templar had passed on to the extremity of the hall ere he raised his head from the humble posture which he had assumed so far as to be sensible of his departure and when he did look around it was with the astonished air of one at whose feet a thunderbolt has just burst and who hears still the astounding report ringing in his ears  the templar and prior were shortly after marshalled to their sleeping apartments by the steward and the cupbearer each attended by two torchbearers and two servants carrying refreshments while servants of inferior condition indicated to their retinue and to the other guests their respective places of repose     chapter vi       to buy his favour i extend this friendship      if he will take it so if not adieu      and for my love i pray you wrong me not      merchant of venice  as the palmer lighted by a domestic with a torch passed through the intricate combination of apartments of this large and irregular mansion the cupbearer coming behind him whispered in his ear that if he had no objection to a cup of good mead in his apartment there were many domestics in that family who would gladly hear the news he had brought from the holy land and particularly that which concerned the knight of ivanhoe wamba presently appeared to urge the same request observing that a cup after midnight was worth three after curfew without disputing a maxim urged by such grave authority the palmer thanked them for their courtesy but observed that he had included in his religious vow an obligation never to speak in the kitchen on matters which were prohibited in the hall that vow said wamba to the cupbearer would scarce suit a servingman  the cupbearer shrugged up his shoulders in displeasure i thought to have lodged him in the solere chamber said he but since he is so unsocial to christians een let him take the next stall to isaac the jewsanwold said he to the torchbearer carry the pilgrim to the southern celli give you goodnight he added sir palmer with small thanks for short courtesy  goodnight and our ladys benison said the palmer with composure and his guide moved forward  in a small antechamber into which several doors opened and which was lighted by a small iron lamp they met a second interruption from the waitingmaid of rowena who saying in a tone of authority that her mistress desired to speak with the palmer took the torch from the hand of anwold and bidding him await her return made a sign to the palmer to follow apparently he did not think it proper to decline this invitation as he had done the former for though his gesture indicated some surprise at the summons he obeyed it without answer or remonstrance  a short passage and an ascent of seven steps each of which was composed of a solid beam of oak led him to the apartment of the lady rowena the rude magnificence of which corresponded to the respect which was paid to her by the lord of the mansion the walls were covered with embroidered hangings on which differentcoloured silks interwoven with gold and silver threads had been employed with all the art of which the age was capable to represent the sports of hunting and hawking the bed was adorned with the same rich tapestry and surrounded with curtains dyed with purple the seats had also their stained coverings and one which was higher than the rest was accommodated with a footstool of ivory curiously carved  no fewer than four silver candelabras holding great waxen torches served to illuminate this apartment yet let not modern beauty envy the magnificence of a saxon princess the walls of the apartment were so ill finished and so full of crevices that the rich hangings shook in the night blast and in despite of a sort of screen intended to protect them from the wind the flame of the torches streamed sideways into the air like the unfurled pennon of a chieftain magnificence there was with some rude attempt at taste but of comfort there was little and being unknown it was unmissed  the lady rowena with three of her attendants standing at her back and arranging her hair ere she lay down to rest was seated in the sort of throne already mentioned and looked as if born to exact general homage the pilgrim acknowledged her claim to it by a low genuflection  rise palmer said she graciously the defender of the absent has a right to favourable reception from all who value truth and honour manhood she then said to her train retire excepting only elgitha i would speak with this holy pilgrim  the maidens without leaving the apartment retired to its further extremity and sat down on a small bench against the wall where they remained mute as statues though at such a distance that their whispers could not have interrupted the conversation of their mistress  pilgrim said the lady after a moments pause during which she seemed uncertain how to address him you this night mentioned a namei mean she said with a degree of effort the name of ivanhoe in the halls where by nature and kindred it should have sounded most acceptably and yet such is the perverse course of fate that of many whose hearts must have throbbed at the sound i only dare ask you where and in what condition you left him of whom you spokewe heard that having remained in palestine on account of his impaired health after the departure of the english army he had experienced the persecution of the french faction to whom the templars are known to be attached  i know little of the knight of ivanhoe answered the palmer with a troubled voice i would i knew him better since you lady are interested in his fate he hath i believe surmounted the persecution of his enemies in palestine and is on the eve of returning to england where you lady must know better than i what is his chance of happiness  the lady rowena sighed deeply and asked more particularly when the knight of ivanhoe might be expected in his native country and whether he would not be exposed to great dangers by the road on the first point the palmer professed ignorance on the second he said that the voyage might be safely made by the way of venice and genoa and from thence through france to england ivanhoe he said was so well acquainted with the language and manners of the french that there was no fear of his incurring any hazard during that part of his travels  would to god said the lady rowena he were here safely arrived and able to bear arms in the approaching tourney in which the chivalry of this land are expected to display their address and valour should athelstane of coningsburgh obtain the prize ivanhoe is like to hear evil tidings when he reaches englandhow looked he stranger when you last saw him had disease laid her hand heavy upon his strength and comeliness  he was darker said the palmer and thinner than when he came from cyprus in the train of coeurdelion and care seemed to sit heavy on his brow but i approached not his presence because he is unknown to me  he will said the lady i fear find little in his native land to clear those clouds from his countenance thanks good pilgrim for your information concerning the companion of my childhoodmaidens she said draw nearoffer the sleeping cup to this holy man whom i will no longer detain from repose  one of the maidens presented a silver cup containing a rich mixture of wine and spice which rowena barely put to her lips it was then offered to the palmer who after a low obeisance tasted a few drops  accept this alms friend continued the lady offering a piece of gold in acknowledgment of thy painful travail and of the shrines thou hast visited  the palmer received the boon with another low reverence and followed edwina out of the apartment  in the anteroom he found his attendant anwold who taking the torch from the hand of the waitingmaid conducted him with more haste than ceremony to an exterior and ignoble part of the building where a number of small apartments or rather cells served for sleeping places to the lower order of domestics and to strangers of mean degree  in which of these sleeps the jew said the pilgrim  the unbelieving dog answered anwold kennels in the cell next your holinessst dunstan how it must be scraped and cleansed ere it be again fit for a christian  and where sleeps gurth the swineherd said the stranger  gurth replied the bondsman sleeps in the cell on your right as the jew on that to your left you serve to keep the child of circumcision separate from the abomination of his tribe you might have occupied a more honourable place had you accepted of oswalds invitation  it is as well as it is said the palmer the company even of a jew can hardly spread contamination through an oaken partition  so saying he entered the cabin allotted to him and taking the torch from the domestics hand thanked him and wished him goodnight having shut the door of his cell he placed the torch in a candlestick made of wood and looked around his sleeping apartment the furniture of which was of the most simple kind it consisted of a rude wooden stool and still ruder hutch or bedframe stuffed with clean straw and accommodated with two or three sheepskins by way of bedclothes  the palmer having extinguished his torch threw himself without taking off any part of his clothes on this rude couch and slept or at least retained his recumbent posture till the earliest sunbeams found their way through the little grated window which served at once to admit both air and light to his uncomfortable cell he then started up and after repeating his matins and adjusting his dress he left it and entered that of isaac the jew lifting the latch as gently as he could  the inmate was lying in troubled slumber upon a couch similar to that on which the palmer himself had passed the night such parts of his dress as the jew had laid aside on the preceding evening were disposed carefully around his person as if to prevent the hazard of their being carried off during his slumbers there was a trouble on his brow amounting almost to agony his hands and arms moved convulsively as if struggling with the nightmare and besides several ejaculations in hebrew the following were distinctly heard in the normanenglish or mixed language of the country for the sake of the god of abraham spare an unhappy old man i am poor i am pennilessshould your irons wrench my limbs asunder i could not gratify you  the palmer awaited not the end of the jews vision but stirred him with his pilgrims staff the touch probably associated as is usual with some of the apprehensions excited by his dream for the old man started up his grey hair standing almost erect upon his head and huddling some part of his garments about him while he held the detached pieces with the tenacious grasp of a falcon he fixed upon the palmer his keen black eyes expressive of wild surprise and of bodily apprehension  fear nothing from me isaac said the palmer i come as your friend  the god of israel requite you said the jew greatly relieved i dreamedbut father abraham be praised it was but a dream then collecting himself he added in his usual tone and what may it be your pleasure to want at so early an hour with the poor jew  it is to tell you said the palmer that if you leave not this mansion instantly and travel not with some haste your journey may prove a dangerous one  holy father said the jew whom could it interest to endanger so poor a wretch as i am  the purpose you can best guess said the pilgrim but rely on this that when the templar crossed the hall yesternight he spoke to his mussulman slaves in the saracen language which i well understand and charged them this morning to watch the journey of the jew to seize upon him when at a convenient distance from the mansion and to conduct him to the castle of philip de malvoisin or to that of reginald frontdeboeuf  it is impossible to describe the extremity of terror which seized upon the jew at this information and seemed at once to overpower his whole faculties his arms fell down to his sides and his head drooped on his breast his knees bent under his weight every nerve and muscle of his frame seemed to collapse and lose its energy and he sunk at the foot of the palmer not in the fashion of one who intentionally stoops kneels or prostrates himself to excite compassion but like a man borne down on all sides by the pressure of some invisible force which crushes him to the earth without the power of resistance  holy god of abraham was his first exclamation folding and elevating his wrinkled hands but without raising his grey head from the pavement oh holy moses o blessed aaron the dream is not dreamed for nought and the vision cometh not in vain i feel their irons already tear my sinews i feel the rack pass over my body like the saws and harrows and axes of iron over the men of rabbah and of the cities of the children of ammon  stand up isaac and hearken to me said the palmer who viewed the extremity of his distress with a compassion in which contempt was largely mingled you have cause for your terror considering how your brethren have been used in order to extort from them their hoards both by princes and nobles but stand up i say and i will point out to you the means of escape leave this mansion instantly while its inmates sleep sound after the last nights revel i will guide you by the secret paths of the forest known as well to me as to any forester that ranges it and i will not leave you till you are under safe conduct of some chief or baron going to the tournament whose goodwill you have probably the means of securing  as the ears of isaac received the hopes of escape which this speech intimated he began gradually and inch by inch as it were to raise himself up from the ground until he fairly rested upon his knees throwing back his long grey hair and beard and fixing his keen black eyes upon the palmers face with a look expressive at once of hope and fear not unmingled with suspicion but when he heard the concluding part of the sentence his original terror appeared to revive in full force and he dropt once more on his face exclaiming i possess the means of securing goodwill alas there is but one road to the favour of a christian and how can the poor jew find it whom extortions have already reduced to the misery of lazarus then as if suspicion had overpowered his other feelings he suddenly exclaimed for the love of god young man betray me notfor the sake of the great father who made us all jew as well as gentile israelite and ishmaelitedo me no treason i have not means to secure the goodwill of a christian beggar were he rating it at a single penny as he spoke these last words he raised himself and grasped the palmers mantle with a look of the most earnest entreaty the pilgrim extricated himself as if there were contamination in the touch  wert thou loaded with all the wealth of thy tribe he said what interest have i to injure theein this dress i am vowed to poverty nor do i change it for aught save a horse and a coat of mail yet think not that i care for thy company or propose myself advantage by it remain here if thou wiltcedric the saxon may protect thee  alas said the jew he will not let me travel in his trainsaxon or norman will be equally ashamed of the poor israelite and to travel by myself through the domains of philip de malvoisin and reginald frontdeboeufgood youth i will go with youlet us hastelet us gird up our loinslet us fleehere is thy staff why wilt thou tarry  i tarry not said the pilgrim giving way to the urgency of his companion but i must secure the means of leaving this placefollow me  he led the way to the adjoining cell which as the reader is apprised was occupied by gurth the swineherdarise gurth said the pilgrim arise quickly undo the postern gate and let out the jew and me  gurth whose occupation though now held so mean gave him as much consequence in saxon england as that of eumaeus in ithaca was offended at the familiar and commanding tone assumed by the palmer the jew leaving rotherwood said he raising himself on his elbow and looking superciliously at him without quitting his pallet and travelling in company with the palmer to boot  i should as soon have dreamt said wamba who entered the apartment at the instant of his stealing away with a gammon of bacon  nevertheless said gurth again laying down his head on the wooden log which served him for a pillow both jew and gentile must be content to abide the opening of the great gatewe suffer no visitors to depart by stealth at these unseasonable hours  nevertheless said the pilgrim in a commanding tone you will not i think refuse me that favour  so saying he stooped over the bed of the recumbent swineherd and whispered something in his ear in saxon gurth started up as if electrified the pilgrim raising his finger in an attitude as if to express caution added gurth bewarethou are wont to be prudent i say undo the posternthou shalt know more anon  with hasty alacrity gurth obeyed him while wamba and the jew followed both wondering at the sudden change in the swineherds demeanour my mule my mule said the jew as soon as they stood without the postern  fetch him his mule said the pilgrim and hearest thoulet me have another that i may bear him company till he is beyond these partsi will return it safely to some of cedrics train at ashby and do thouhe whispered the rest in gurths ear  willingly most willingly shall it be done said gurth and instantly departed to execute the commission  i wish i knew said wamba when his comrades back was turned what you palmers learn in the holy land  to say our orisons fool answered the pilgrim to repent our sins and to mortify ourselves with fastings vigils and long prayers  something more potent than that answered the jester for when would repentance or prayer make gurth do a courtesy or fasting or vigil persuade him to lend you a mulei trow you might as well have told his favourite black boar of thy vigils and penance and wouldst have gotten as civil an answer  go to said the pilgrim thou art but a saxon fool  thou sayst well said the jester had i been born a norman as i think thou art i would have had luck on my side and been next door to a wise man  at this moment gurth appeared on the opposite side of the moat with the mules the travellers crossed the ditch upon a drawbridge of only two planks breadth the narrowness of which was matched with the straitness of the postern and with a little wicket in the exterior palisade which gave access to the forest no sooner had they reached the mules than the jew with hasty and trembling hands secured behind the saddle a small bag of blue buckram which he took from under his cloak containing as he muttered a change of raimentonly a change of raiment then getting upon the animal with more alacrity and haste than could have been anticipated from his years he lost no time in so disposing of the skirts of his gabardine as to conceal completely from observation the burden which he had thus deposited en croupe  the pilgrim mounted with more deliberation reaching as he departed his hand to gurth who kissed it with the utmost possible veneration the swineherd stood gazing after the travellers until they were lost under the boughs of the forest path when he was disturbed from his reverie by the voice of wamba  knowest thou said the jester my good friend gurth that thou art strangely courteous and most unwontedly pious on this summer morning i would i were a black prior or a barefoot palmer to avail myself of thy unwonted zeal and courtesycertes i would make more out of it than a kiss of the hand  thou art no fool thus far wamba answered gurth though thou arguest from appearances and the wisest of us can do no morebut it is time to look after my charge  so saying he turned back to the mansion attended by the jester  meanwhile the travellers continued to press on their journey with a dispatch which argued the extremity of the jews fears since persons at his age are seldom fond of rapid motion the palmer to whom every path and outlet in the wood appeared to be familiar led the way through the most devious paths and more than once excited anew the suspicion of the israelite that he intended to betray him into some ambuscade of his enemies  his doubts might have been indeed pardoned for except perhaps the flying fish there was no race existing on the earth in the air or the waters who were the object of such an unintermitting general and relentless persecution as the jews of this period upon the slightest and most unreasonable pretences as well as upon accusations the most absurd and groundless their persons and property were exposed to every turn of popular fury for norman saxon dane and briton however adverse these races were to each other contended which should look with greatest detestation upon a people whom it was accounted a point of religion to hate to revile to despise to plunder and to persecute the kings of the norman race and the independent nobles who followed their example in all acts of tyranny maintained against this devoted people a persecution of a more regular calculated and selfinterested kind it is a wellknown story of king john that he confined a wealthy jew in one of the royal castles and daily caused one of his teeth to be torn out until when the jaw of the unhappy israelite was half disfurnished he consented to pay a large sum which it was the tyrants object to extort from him the little ready money which was in the country was chiefly in possession of this persecuted people and the nobility hesitated not to follow the example of their sovereign in wringing it from them by every species of oppression and even personal torture yet the passive courage inspired by the love of gain induced the jews to dare the various evils to which they were subjected in consideration of the immense profits which they were enabled to realize in a country naturally so wealthy as england in spite of every kind of discouragement and even of the special court of taxations already mentioned called the jews exchequer erected for the very purpose of despoiling and distressing them the jews increased multiplied and accumulated huge sums which they transferred from one hand to another by means of bills of exchangean invention for which commerce is said to be indebted to them and which enabled them to transfer their wealth from land to land that when threatened with oppression in one country their treasure might be secured in another  the obstinacy and avarice of the jews being thus in a measure placed in opposition to the fanaticism that tyranny of those under whom they lived seemed to increase in proportion to the persecution with which they were visited and the immense wealth they usually acquired in commerce while it frequently placed them in danger was at other times used to extend their influence and to secure to them a certain degree of protection on these terms they lived and their character influenced accordingly was watchful suspicious and timidyet obstinate uncomplying and skilful in evading the dangers to which they were exposed  when the travellers had pushed on at a rapid rate through many devious paths the palmer at length broke silence  that large decayed oak he said marks the boundaries over which frontdeboeuf claims authoritywe are long since far from those of malvoisin there is now no fear of pursuit  may the wheels of their chariots be taken off said the jew like those of the host of pharaoh that they may drive heavilybut leave me not good pilgrimthink but of that fierce and savage templar with his saracen slavesthey will regard neither territory nor manor nor lordship  our road said the palmer should here separate for it beseems not men of my character and thine to travel together longer than needs must be besides what succour couldst thou have from me a peaceful pilgrim against two armed heathens  o good youth answered the jew thou canst defend me and i know thou wouldst poor as i am i will requite itnot with money for money so help me my father abraham i have nonebut  money and recompense said the palmer interrupting him i have already said i require not of thee guide thee i can and it may be even in some sort defend thee since to protect a jew against a saracen can scarce be accounted unworthy of a christian therefore jew i will see thee safe under some fitting escort we are now not far from the town of sheffield where thou mayest easily find many of thy tribe with whom to take refuge  the blessing of jacob be upon thee good youth said the jew in sheffield i can harbour with my kinsman zareth and find some means of travelling forth with safety  be it so said the palmer at sheffield then we part and halfanhours riding will bring us in sight of that town  the half hour was spent in perfect silence on both parts the pilgrim perhaps disdaining to address the jew except in case of absolute necessity and the jew not presuming to force a conversation with a person whose journey to the holy sepulchre gave a sort of sanctity to his character they paused on the top of a gently rising bank and the pilgrim pointing to the town of sheffield which lay beneath them repeated the words here then we part  not till you have had the poor jews thanks said isaac for i presume not to ask you to go with me to my kinsman zareths who might aid me with some means of repaying your good offices  i have already said answered the pilgrim that i desire no recompense if among the huge list of thy debtors thou wilt for my sake spare the gyves and the dungeon to some unhappy christian who stands in thy danger i shall hold this mornings service to thee well bestowed  stay stay said the jew laying hold of his garment something would i do more than this something for thyselfgod knows the jew is pooryes isaac is the beggar of his tribebut forgive me should i guess what thou most lackest at this moment  if thou wert to guess truly said the palmer it is what thou canst not supply wert thou as wealthy as thou sayst thou art poor  as i say echoed the jew o believe it i say but the truth i am a plundered indebted distressed man hard hands have wrung from me my goods my money my ships and all that i possessedyet i can tell thee what thou lackest and it may be supply it too thy wish even now is for a horse and armour  the palmer started and turned suddenly towards the jewwhat fiend prompted that guess said he hastily  no matter said the jew smiling so that it be a true oneand as i can guess thy want so i can supply it  but consider said the palmer my character my dress my vow  i know you christians replied the jew and that the noblest of you will take the staff and sandal in superstitious penance and walk afoot to visit the graves of dead men  blaspheme not jew said the pilgrim sternly  forgive me said the jew i spoke rashly but there dropt words from you last night and this morning that like sparks from flint showed the metal within and in the bosom of that palmers gown is hidden a knights chain and spurs of gold they glanced as you stooped over my bed in the morning  the pilgrim could not forbear smiling were thy garments searched by as curious an eye isaac said he what discoveries might not be made  no more of that said the jew changing colour and drawing forth his writing materials in haste as if to stop the conversation he began to write upon a piece of paper which he supported on the top of his yellow cap without dismounting from his mule when he had finished he delivered the scroll which was in the hebrew character to the pilgrim saying in the town of leicester all men know the rich jew kirjath jairam of lombardy give him this scrollhe hath on sale six milan harnesses the worst would suit a crowned headten goodly steeds the worst might mount a king were he to do battle for his throne of these he will give thee thy choice with every thing else that can furnish thee forth for the tournament when it is over thou wilt return them safelyunless thou shouldst have wherewith to pay their value to the owner  but isaac said the pilgrim smiling dost thou know that in these sports the arms and steed of the knight who is unhorsed are forfeit to his victor now i may be unfortunate and so lose what i cannot replace or repay  the jew looked somewhat astounded at this possibility but collecting his courage he replied hastily nononoit is impossiblei will not think so the blessing of our father will be upon thee thy lance will be powerful as the rod of moses  so saying he was turning his mules head away when the palmer in his turn took hold of his gaberdine nay but isaac thou knowest not all the risk the steed may be slain the armour injuredfor i will spare neither horse nor man besides those of thy tribe give nothing for nothing something there must be paid for their use  the jew twisted himself in the saddle like a man in a fit of the colic but his better feelings predominated over those which were most familiar to him i care not he said i care notlet me go if there is damage it will cost you nothingif there is usage money kirjath jairam will forgive it for the sake of his kinsman isaac fare thee wellyet hark thee good youth said he turning about thrust thyself not too forward into this vain hurlyburlyi speak not for endangering the steed and coat of armour but for the sake of thine own life and limbs  gramercy for thy caution said the palmer again smiling i will use thy courtesy frankly and it will go hard with me but i will requite it  they parted and took different roads for the town of sheffield     chapter vii       knights with a long retinue of their squires      in gaudy liveries march and quaint attires      one laced the helm another held the lance      a third the shining buckler did advance      the courser pawd the ground with restless feet      and snorting foamd and champd the golden bit      the smiths and armourers on palfreys

crowding on with cudgels in their hands      palamon and arcite  the condition of the english nation was at this time sufficiently miserable king richard was absent a prisoner and in the power of the perfidious and cruel duke of austria even the very place of his captivity was uncertain and his fate but very imperfectly known to the generality of his subjects who were in the meantime a prey to every species of subaltern oppression  prince john in league with philip of france coeurdelions mortal enemy was using every species of influence with the duke of austria to prolong the captivity of his brother richard to whom he stood indebted for so many favours in the meantime he was strengthening his own faction in the kingdom of which he proposed to dispute the succession in case of the kings death with the legitimate heir arthur duke of brittany son of geoffrey plantagenet the elder brother of john this usurpation it is well known he afterwards effected his own character being light profligate and perfidious john easily attached to his person and faction not only all who had reason to dread the resentment of richard for criminal proceedings during his absence but also the numerous class of lawless resolutes whom the crusades had turned back on their country accomplished in the vices of the east impoverished in substance and hardened in character and who placed their hopes of harvest in civil commotion to these causes of public distress and apprehension must be added the multitude of outlaws who driven to despair by the oppression of the feudal nobility and the severe exercise of the forest laws banded together in large gangs and keeping possession of the forests and the wastes set at defiance the justice and magistracy of the country the nobles themselves each fortified within his own castle and playing the petty sovereign over his own dominions were the leaders of bands scarce less lawless and oppressive than those of the avowed depredators to maintain these retainers and to support the extravagance and magnificence which their pride induced them to affect the nobility borrowed sums of money from the jews at the most usurious interest which gnawed into their estates like consuming cankers scarce to be cured unless when circumstances gave them an opportunity of getting free by exercising upon their creditors some act of unprincipled violence  under the various burdens imposed by this unhappy state of affairs the people of england suffered deeply for the present and had yet more dreadful cause to fear for the future to augment their misery a contagious disorder of a dangerous nature spread through the land and rendered more virulent by the uncleanness the indifferent food and the wretched lodging of the lower classes swept off many whose fate the survivors were tempted to envy as exempting them from the evils which were to come  yet amid these accumulated distresses the poor as well as the rich the vulgar as well as the noble in the event of a tournament which was the grand spectacle of that age felt as much interested as the halfstarved citizen of madrid who has not a real left to buy provisions for his family feels in the issue of a bullfeast neither duty nor infirmity could keep youth or age from such exhibitions the passage of arms as it was called which was to take place at ashby in the county of leicester as champions of the first renown were to take the field in the presence of prince john himself who was expected to grace the lists had attracted universal attention and an immense confluence of persons of all ranks hastened upon the appointed morning to the place of combat  the scene was singularly romantic on the verge of a wood which approached to within a mile of the town of ashby was an extensive meadow of the finest and most beautiful green turf surrounded on one side by the forest and fringed on the other by straggling oaktrees some of which had grown to an immense size the ground as if fashioned on purpose for the martial display which was intended sloped gradually down on all sides to a level bottom which was enclosed for the lists with strong palisades forming a space of a quarter of a mile in length and about half as broad the form of the enclosure was an oblong square save that the corners were considerably rounded off in order to afford more convenience for the spectators the openings for the entry of the combatants were at the northern and southern extremities of the lists accessible by strong wooden gates each wide enough to admit two horsemen riding abreast at each of these portals were stationed two heralds attended by six trumpets as many pursuivants and a strong body of menatarms for maintaining order and ascertaining the quality of the knights who proposed to engage in this martial game  on a platform beyond the southern entrance formed by a natural elevation of the ground were pitched five magnificent pavilions adorned with pennons of russet and black the chosen colours of the five knights challengers the cords of the tents were of the same colour before each pavilion was suspended the shield of the knight by whom it was occupied and beside it stood his squire quaintly disguised as a salvage or silvan man or in some other fantastic dress according to the taste of his master and the character he was pleased to assume during the game 16  the central pavilion as the place of honour had been assigned to brian be boisguilbert whose renown in all games of chivalry no less than his connexions with the knights who had undertaken this passage of arms had occasioned him to be eagerly received into the company of the challengers and even adopted as their chief and leader though he had so recently joined them on one side of his tent were pitched those of reginald frontdeboeuf and richard de malvoisin and on the other was the pavilion of hugh de grantmesnil a noble baron in the vicinity whose ancestor had been lord high steward of england in the time of the conqueror and his son william rufus ralph de vipont a knight of st john of jerusalem who had some ancient possessions at a place called heather near ashbydelazouche occupied the fifth pavilion from the entrance into the lists a gently sloping passage ten yards in breadth led up to the platform on which the tents were pitched it was strongly secured by a palisade on each side as was the esplanade in front of the pavilions and the whole was guarded by menatarms  the northern access to the lists terminated in a similar entrance of thirty feet in breadth at the extremity of which was a large enclosed space for such knights as might be disposed to enter the lists with the challengers behind which were placed tents containing refreshments of every kind for their accommodation with armourers tarriers and other attendants in readiness to give their services wherever they might be necessary  the exterior of the lists was in part occupied by temporary galleries spread with tapestry and carpets and accommodated with cushions for the convenience of those ladies and nobles who were expected to attend the tournament a narrow space betwixt these galleries and the lists gave accommodation for yeomanry and spectators of a better degree than the mere vulgar and might be compared to the pit of a theatre the promiscuous multitude arranged themselves upon large banks of turf prepared for the purpose which aided by the natural elevation of the ground enabled them to overlook the galleries and obtain a fair view into the lists besides the accommodation which these stations afforded many hundreds had perched themselves on the branches of the trees which surrounded the meadow and even the steeple of a country church at some distance was crowded with spectators  it only remains to notice respecting the general arrangement that one gallery in the very centre of the eastern side of the lists and consequently exactly opposite to the spot where the shock of the combat was to take place was raised higher than the others more richly decorated and graced by a sort of throne and canopy on which the royal arms were emblazoned squires pages and yeomen in rich liveries waited around this place of honour which was designed for prince john and his attendants opposite to this royal gallery was another elevated to the same height on the western side of the lists and more gaily if less sumptuously decorated than that destined for the prince himself a train of pages and of young maidens the most beautiful who could be selected gaily dressed in fancy habits of green and pink surrounded a throne decorated in the same colours among pennons and flags bearing wounded hearts burning hearts bleeding hearts bows and quivers and all the commonplace emblems of the triumphs of cupid a blazoned inscription informed the spectators that this seat of honour was designed for la royne de las beaulte et des amours but who was to represent the queen of beauty and of love on the present occasion no one was prepared to guess  meanwhile spectators of every description thronged forward to occupy their respective stations and not without many quarrels concerning those which they were entitled to hold some of these were settled by the menatarms with brief ceremony the shafts of their battleaxes and pummels of their swords being readily employed as arguments to convince the more refractory others which involved the rival claims of more elevated persons were determined by the heralds or by the two marshals of the field william de wyvil and stephen de martival who armed at all points rode up and down the lists to enforce and preserve good order among the spectators  gradually the galleries became filled with knights and nobles in their robes of peace whose long and richtinted mantles were contrasted with the gayer and more splendid habits of the ladies who in a greater proportion than even the men themselves thronged to witness a sport which one would have thought too bloody and dangerous to afford their sex much pleasure the lower and interior space was soon filled by substantial yeomen and burghers and such of the lesser gentry as from modesty poverty or dubious title durst not assume any higher place it was of course amongst these that the most frequent disputes for precedence occurred  dog of an unbeliever said an old man whose threadbare tunic bore witness to his poverty as his sword and dagger and golden chain intimated his pretensions to rankwhelp of a shewolf darest thou press upon a christian and a norman gentleman of the blood of montdidier  this rough expostulation was addressed to no other than our acquaintance isaac who richly and even magnificently dressed in a gaberdine ornamented with lace and lined with fur was endeavouring to make place in the foremost row beneath the gallery for his daughter the beautiful rebecca who had joined him at ashby and who was now hanging on her fathers arm not a little terrified by the popular displeasure which seemed generally excited by her parents presumption but isaac though we have seen him sufficiently timid on other occasions knew well that at present he had nothing to fear it was not in places of general resort or where their equals were assembled that any avaricious or malevolent noble durst offer him injury at such meetings the jews were under the protection of the general law and if that proved a weak assurance it usually happened that there were among the persons assembled some barons who for their own interested motives were ready to act as their protectors on the present occasion isaac felt more than usually confident being aware that prince john was even then in the very act of negotiating a large loan from the jews of york to be secured upon certain jewels and lands isaacs own share in this transaction was considerable and he well knew that the princes eager desire to bring it to a conclusion would ensure him his protection in the dilemma in which he stood  emboldened by these considerations the jew pursued his point and jostled the norman christian without respect either to his descent quality or religion the complaints of the old man however excited the indignation of the bystanders one of these a stout wellset yeoman arrayed in lincoln green having twelve arrows stuck in his belt with a baldric and badge of silver and a bow of six feet length in his hand turned short round and while his countenance which his constant exposure to weather had rendered brown as a hazel nut grew darker with anger he advised the jew to remember that all the wealth he had acquired by sucking the blood of his miserable victims had but swelled him like a bloated spider which might be overlooked while he kept in a comer but would be crushed if it ventured into the light this intimation delivered in normanenglish with a firm voice and a stern aspect made the jew shrink back and he would have probably withdrawn himself altogether from a vicinity so dangerous had not the attention of every one been called to the sudden entrance of prince john who at that moment entered the lists attended by a numerous and gay train consisting partly of laymen partly of churchmen as light in their dress and as gay in their demeanour as their companions among the latter was the prior of jorvaulx in the most gallant trim which a dignitary of the church could venture to exhibit fur and gold were not spared in his garments and the points of his boots outheroding the preposterous fashion of the time turned up so very far as to be attached not to his knees merely but to his very girdle and effectually prevented him from putting his foot into the stirrup this however was a slight inconvenience to the gallant abbot who perhaps even rejoicing in the opportunity to display his accomplished horsemanship before so many spectators especially of the fair sex dispensed with the use of these supports to a timid rider the rest of prince johns retinue consisted of the favourite leaders of his mercenary troops some marauding barons and profligate attendants upon the court with several knights templars and knights of st john  it may be here remarked that the knights of these two orders were accounted hostile to king richard having adopted the side of philip of france in the long train of disputes which took place in palestine betwixt that monarch and the lionhearted king of england it was the wellknown consequence of this discord that richards repeated victories had been rendered fruitless his romantic attempts to besiege jerusalem disappointed and the fruit of all the glory which he had acquired had dwindled into an uncertain truce with the sultan saladin with the same policy which had dictated the conduct of their brethren in the holy land the templars and hospitallers in england and normandy attached themselves to the faction of prince john having little reason to desire the return of richard to england or the succession of arthur his legitimate heir for the opposite reason prince john hated and contemned the few saxon families of consequence which subsisted in england and omitted no opportunity of mortifying and affronting them being conscious that his person and pretensions were disliked by them as well as by the greater part of the english commons who feared farther innovation upon their rights and liberties from a sovereign of johns licentious and tyrannical disposition  attended by this gallant equipage himself well mounted and splendidly dressed in crimson and in gold bearing upon his hand a falcon and having his head covered by a rich fur bonnet adorned with a circle of precious stones from which his long curled hair escaped and overspread his shoulders prince john upon a grey and highmettled palfrey caracoled within the lists at the head of his jovial party laughing loud with his train and eyeing with all the boldness of royal criticism the beauties who adorned the lofty galleries  those who remarked in the physiognomy of the prince a dissolute audacity mingled with extreme haughtiness and indifference to the feelings of others could not yet deny to his countenance that sort of comeliness which belongs to an open set of features well formed by nature modelled by art to the usual rules of courtesy yet so far frank and honest that they seemed as if they disclaimed to conceal the natural workings of the soul such an expression is often mistaken for manly frankness when in truth it arises from the reckless indifference of a libertine disposition conscious of superiority of birth of wealth or of some other adventitious advantage totally unconnected with personal merit to those who did not think so deeply and they were the greater number by a hundred to one the splendour of prince johns rheno ie fur tippet the richness of his cloak lined with the most costly sables his maroquin boots and golden spurs together with the grace with which he managed his palfrey were sufficient to merit clamorous applause  in his joyous caracole round the lists the attention of the prince was called by the commotion not yet subsided which had attended the ambitious movement of isaac towards the higher places of the assembly the quick eye of prince john instantly recognised the jew but was much more agreeably attracted by the beautiful daughter of zion who terrified by the tumult clung close to the arm of her aged father  the figure of rebecca might indeed have compared with the proudest beauties of england even though it had been judged by as shrewd a connoisseur as prince john her form was exquisitely symmetrical and was shown to advantage by a sort of eastern dress which she wore according to the fashion of the females of her nation her turban of yellow silk suited well with the darkness of her complexion the brilliancy of her eyes the superb arch of her eyebrows her wellformed aquiline nose her teeth as white as pearl and the profusion of her sable tresses which each arranged in its own little spiral of twisted curls fell down upon as much of a lovely neck and bosom as a simarre of the richest persian silk exhibiting flowers in their natural colours embossed upon a purple ground permitted to be visibleall these constituted a combination of loveliness which yielded not to the most beautiful of the maidens who surrounded her it is true that of the golden and pearlstudded clasps which closed her vest from the throat to the waist the three uppermost were left unfastened on account of the heat which something enlarged the prospect to which we allude a diamond necklace with pendants of inestimable value were by this means also made more conspicuous the feather of an ostrich fastened in her turban by an agraffe set with brilliants was another distinction of the beautiful jewess scoffed and sneered at by the proud dames who sat above her but secretly envied by those who affected to deride them  by the bald scalp of abraham said prince john yonder jewess must be the very model of that perfection whose charms drove frantic the wisest king that ever lived what sayest thou prior aymerby the temple of that wise king which our wiser brother richard proved unable to recover she is the very bride of the canticles  the rose of sharon and the lily of the valleyanswered the prior in a sort of snuffling tone but your grace must remember she is still but a jewess  ay added prince john without heeding him and there is my mammon of unrighteousness toothe marquis of marks the baron of byzants contesting for place with penniless dogs whose threadbare cloaks have not a single cross in their pouches to keep the devil from dancing there by the body of st mark my prince of supplies with his lovely jewess shall have a place in the gallerywhat is she isaac thy wife or thy daughter that eastern houri that thou lockest under thy arm as thou wouldst thy treasurecasket  my daughter rebecca so please your grace answered isaac with a low congee nothing embarrassed by the princes salutation in which however there was at least as much mockery as courtesy  the wiser man thou said john with a peal of laughter in which his gay followers obsequiously joined but daughter or wife she should be preferred according to her beauty and thy meritswho sits above there he continued bending his eye on the gallery saxon churls lolling at their lazy lengthout upon themlet them sit close and make room for my prince of usurers and his lovely daughter ill make the hinds know they must share the high places of the synagogue with those whom the synagogue properly belongs to  those who occupied the gallery to whom this injurious and unpolite speech was addressed were the family of cedric the saxon with that of his ally and kinsman athelstane of coningsburgh a personage who on account of his descent from the last saxon monarchs of england was held in the highest respect by all the saxon natives of the north of england but with the blood of this ancient royal race many of their infirmities had descended to athelstane he was comely in countenance bulky and strong in person and in the flower of his ageyet inanimate in expression dulleyed heavybrowed inactive and sluggish in all his motions and so slow in resolution that the soubriquet of one of his ancestors was conferred upon him and he was very generally called athelstane the unready his friends and he had many who as well as cedric were passionately attached to him contended that this sluggish temper arose not from want of courage but from mere want of decision others alleged that his hereditary vice of drunkenness had obscured his faculties never of a very acute order and that the passive courage and meek goodnature which remained behind were merely the dregs of a character that might have been deserving of praise but of which all the valuable parts had flown off in the progress of a long course of brutal debauchery  it was to this person such as we have described him that the prince addressed his imperious command to make place for isaac and rebecca athelstane utterly confounded at an order which the manners and feelings of the times rendered so injuriously insulting unwilling to obey yet undetermined how to resist opposed only the vis inertiae to the will of john and without stirring or making any motion whatever of obedience opened his large grey eyes and stared at the prince with an astonishment which had in it something extremely ludicrous but the impatient john regarded it in no such light  the saxon porker he said is either asleep or minds me notprick him with your lance de bracy speaking to a knight who rode near him the leader of a band of free companions or condottieri that is of mercenaries belonging to no particular nation but attached for the time to any prince by whom they were paid there was a murmur even among the attendants of prince john but de bracy whose profession freed him from all scruples extended his long lance over the space which separated the gallery from the lists and would have executed the commands of the prince before athelstane the unready had recovered presence of mind sufficient even to draw back his person from the weapon had not cedric as prompt as his companion was tardy unsheathed with the speed of lightning the short sword which he wore and at a single blow severed the point of the lance from the handle the blood rushed into the countenance of prince john he swore one of his deepest oaths and was about to utter some threat corresponding in violence when he was diverted from his purpose partly by his own attendants who gathered around him conjuring him to be patient partly by a general exclamation of the crowd uttered in loud applause of the spirited conduct of cedric the prince rolled his eyes in indignation as if to collect some safe and easy victim and chancing to encounter the firm glance of the same archer whom we have already noticed and who seemed to persist in his gesture of applause in spite of the frowning aspect which the prince bent upon him he demanded his reason for clamouring thus  i always add my hollo said the yeoman when i see a good shot or a gallant blow  sayst thou answered the prince then thou canst hit the white thyself ill warrant  a woodsmans mark and at woodsmans distance i can hit answered the yeoman  and wat tyrrels mark at a hundred yards said a voice from behind but by whom uttered could not be discerned  this allusion to the fate of william rufus his relative at once incensed and alarmed prince john he satisfied himself however with commanding the menatarms who surrounded the lists to keep an eye on the braggart pointing to the yeoman  by st grizzel he added we will try his own skill who is so ready to give his voice to the feats of others  i shall not fly the trial said the yeoman with the composure which marked his whole deportment  meanwhile stand up ye saxon churls said the fiery prince for by the light of heaven since i have said it the jew shall have his seat amongst ye  by no means an it please your graceit is not fit for such as we to sit with the rulers of the land said the jew whose ambition for precedence though it had led him to dispute place with the extenuated and impoverished descendant of the line of montdidier by no means stimulated him to an intrusion upon the privileges of the wealthy saxons  up infidel dog when i command you said prince john or i will have thy swarthy hide stript off and tanned for horsefurniture  thus urged the jew began to ascend the steep and narrow steps which led up to the gallery  let me see said the prince who dare stop him fixing his eye on cedric whose attitude intimated his intention to hurl the jew down headlong  the catastrophe was prevented by the clown wamba who springing betwixt his master and isaac and exclaiming in answer to the princes defiance marry that will i opposed to the beard of the jew a shield of brawn which he plucked from beneath his cloak and with which doubtless he had furnished himself lest the tournament should have proved longer than his appetite could endure abstinence finding the abomination of his tribe opposed to his very nose while the jester at the same time flourished his wooden sword above his head the jew recoiled missed his footing and rolled down the stepsan excellent jest to the spectators who set up a loud laughter in which prince john and his attendants heartily joined  deal me the prize cousin prince said wamba i have vanquished my foe in fair fight with sword and shield he added brandishing the brawn in one hand and the wooden sword in the other  who and what art thou noble champion said prince john still laughing  a fool by right of descent answered the jester i am wamba the son of witless who was the son of weatherbrain who was the son of an alderman  make room for the jew in front of the lower ring said prince john not unwilling perhaps to seize an apology to desist from his original purpose to place the vanquished beside the victor were false heraldry  knave upon fool were worse answered the jester and jew upon bacon worst of all  gramercy good fellow cried prince john thou pleasest mehere isaac lend me a handful of byzants  as the jew stunned by the request afraid to refuse and unwilling to comply fumbled in the furred bag which hung by his girdle and was perhaps endeavouring to ascertain how few coins might pass for a handful the prince stooped from his jennet and settled isaacs doubts by snatching the pouch itself from his side and flinging to wamba a couple of the gold pieces which it contained he pursued his career round the lists leaving the jew to the derision of those around him and himself receiving as much applause from the spectators as if he had done some honest and honourable action     chapter viii       at this the challenger with fierce defy      his trumpet sounds the challenged makes reply      with clangour rings the field resounds the vaulted sky      their visors closed their lances in the rest      or at the helmet pointed or the crest      they vanish from the barrier speed the race      and spurring see decrease the middle space      palamon and arcite  in the midst of prince johns cavalcade he suddenly stopt and appealing to the prior of jorvaulx declared the principal business of the day had been forgotten  by my halidom said he we have forgotten sir prior to name the fair sovereign of love and of beauty by whose white hand the palm is to be distributed for my part i am liberal in my ideas and i care not if i give my vote for the blackeyed rebecca  holy virgin answered the prior turning up his eyes in horror a jewesswe should deserve to be stoned out of the lists and i am not yet old enough to be a martyr besides i swear by my patron saint that she is far inferior to the lovely saxon rowena  saxon or jew answered the prince saxon or jew dog or hog what matters it i say name rebecca were it only to mortify the saxon churls  a murmur arose even among his own immediate attendants  this passes a jest my lord said de bracy no knight here will lay lance in rest if such an insult is attempted  it is the mere wantonness of insult said one of the oldest and most important of prince johns followers waldemar fitzurse and if your grace attempt it cannot but prove ruinous to your projects  i entertained you sir said john reining up his palfrey haughtily for my follower but not for my counsellor  those who follow your grace in the paths which you tread said waldemar but speaking in a low voice acquire the right of counsellors for your interest and safety are not more deeply gaged than their own  from the tone in which this was spoken john saw the necessity of acquiescence i did but jest he said and you turn upon me like so many adders name whom you will in the fiends name and please yourselves  nay nay said de bracy let the fair sovereigns throne remain unoccupied until the conqueror shall be named and then let him choose the lady by whom it shall be filled it will add another grace to his triumph and teach fair ladies to prize the love of valiant knights who can exalt them to such distinction  if brian de boisguilbert gain the prize said the prior i will gage my rosary that i name the sovereign of love and beauty  boisguilbert answered de bracy is a good lance but there are others around these lists sir prior who will not fear to encounter him  silence sirs said waldemar and let the prince assume his seat the knights and spectators are alike impatient the time advances and highly fit it is that the sports should commence  prince john though not yet a monarch had in waldemar fitzurse all the inconveniences of a favourite minister who in serving his sovereign must always do so in his own way the prince acquiesced however although his disposition was precisely of that kind which is apt to be obstinate upon trifles and assuming his throne and being surrounded by his followers gave signal to the heralds to proclaim the laws of the tournament which were briefly as follows  first the five challengers were to undertake all comers  secondly any knight proposing to combat might if he pleased select a special antagonist from among the challengers by touching his shield if he did so with the reverse of his lance the trial of skill was made with what were called the arms of courtesy that is with lances at whose extremity a piece of round flat board was fixed so that no danger was encountered save from the shock of the horses and riders but if the shield was touched with the sharp end of the lance the combat was understood to be at outrance that is the knights were to fight with sharp weapons as in actual battle  thirdly when the knights present had accomplished their vow by each of them breaking five lances the prince was to declare the victor in the first days tourney who should receive as prize a warhorse of exquisite beauty and matchless strength and in addition to this reward of valour it was now declared he should have the peculiar honour of naming the queen of love and beauty by whom the prize should be given on the ensuing day  fourthly it was announced that on the second day there should be a general tournament in which all the knights present who were desirous to win praise might take part and being divided into two bands of equal numbers might fight it out manfully until the signal was given by prince john to cease the combat the elected queen of love and beauty was then to crown the knight whom the prince should adjudge to have borne himself best in this second day with a coronet composed of thin gold plate cut into the shape of a laurel crown on this second day the knightly games ceased but on that which was to follow feats of archery of bullbaiting and other popular amusements were to be practised for the more immediate amusement of the populace in this manner did prince john endeavour to lay the foundation of a popularity which he was perpetually throwing down by some inconsiderate act of wanton aggression upon the feelings and prejudices of the people  the lists now presented a most splendid spectacle the sloping galleries were crowded with all that was noble great wealthy and beautiful in the northern and midland parts of england and the contrast of the various dresses of these dignified spectators rendered the view as gay as it was rich while the interior and lower space filled with the substantial burgesses and yeomen of merry england formed in their more plain attire a dark fringe or border around this circle of brilliant embroidery relieving and at the same time setting off its splendour  the heralds finished their proclamation with their usual cry of largesse largesse gallant knights and gold and silver pieces were showered on them from the galleries it being a high point of chivalry to exhibit liberality towards those whom the age accounted at once the secretaries and the historians of honour the bounty of the spectators was acknowledged by the customary shouts of love of ladiesdeath of championshonour to the generousglory to the brave to which the more humble spectators added their acclamations and a numerous band of trumpeters the flourish of their martial instruments when these sounds had ceased the heralds withdrew from the lists in gay and glittering procession and none remained within them save the marshals of the field who armed capapie sat on horseback motionless as statues at the opposite ends of the lists meantime the enclosed space at the northern extremity of the lists large as it was was now completely crowded with knights desirous to prove their skill against the challengers and when viewed from the galleries presented the appearance of a sea of waving plumage intermixed with glistening helmets and tall lances to the extremities of which were in many cases attached small pennons of about a spans breadth which fluttering in the air as the breeze caught them joined with the restless motion of the feathers to add liveliness to the scene  at length the barriers were opened and five knights chosen by lot advanced slowly into the area a single champion riding in front and the other four following in pairs all were splendidly armed and my saxon authority in the wardour manuscript records at great length their devices their colours and the embroidery of their horse trappings it is unnecessary to be particular on these subjects to borrow lines from a contemporary poet who has written but too little       the knights are dust      and their good swords are rust      their souls are with the saints we trust 17  their escutcheons have long mouldered from the walls of their castles their castles themselves are but green mounds and shattered ruinsthe place that once knew them knows them no morenay many a race since theirs has died out and been forgotten in the very land which they occupied with all the authority of feudal proprietors and feudal lords what then would it avail the reader to know their names or the evanescent symbols of their martial rank  now however no whit anticipating the oblivion which awaited their names and feats the champions advanced through the lists restraining their fiery steeds and compelling them to move slowly while at the same time they exhibited their paces together with the grace and dexterity of the riders as the procession entered the lists the sound of a wild barbaric music was heard from behind the tents of the challengers where the performers were concealed it was of eastern origin having been brought from the holy land and the mixture of the cymbals and bells seemed to bid welcome at once and defiance to the knights as they advanced with the eyes of an immense concourse of spectators fixed upon them the five knights advanced up the platform upon which the tents of the challengers stood and there separating themselves each touched slightly and with the reverse of his lance the shield of the antagonist to whom he wished to oppose himself the lower orders of spectators in generalnay many of the higher class and it is even said several of the ladies were rather disappointed at the champions choosing the arms of courtesy for the same sort of persons who in the present day applaud most highly the deepest tragedies were then interested in a tournament exactly in proportion to the danger incurred by the champions engaged  having intimated their more pacific purpose the champions retreated to the extremity of the lists where they remained drawn up in a line while the challengers sallying each from his pavilion mounted their horses and headed by brian de boisguilbert descended from the platform and opposed themselves individually to the knights who had touched their respective shields  at the flourish of clarions and trumpets they started out against each other at full gallop and such was the superior dexterity or good fortune of the challengers that those opposed to boisguilbert malvoisin and frontdeboeuf rolled on the ground the antagonist of grantmesnil instead of bearing his lancepoint fair against the crest or the shield of his enemy swerved so much from the direct line as to break the weapon athwart the person of his opponenta circumstance which was accounted more disgraceful than that of being actually unhorsed because the latter might happen from accident whereas the former evinced awkwardness and want of management of the weapon and of the horse the fifth knight alone maintained the honour of his party and parted fairly with the knight of st john both splintering their lances without advantage on either side  the shouts of the multitude together with the acclamations of the heralds and the clangour of the trumpets announced the triumph of the victors and the defeat of the vanquished the former retreated to their pavilions and the latter gathering themselves up as they could withdrew from the lists in disgrace and dejection to agree with their victors concerning the redemption of their arms and their horses which according to the laws of the tournament they had forfeited the fifth of their number alone tarried in the lists long enough to be greeted by the applauses of the spectators amongst whom he retreated to the aggravation doubtless of his companions mortification  a second and a third party of knights took the field and although they had various success yet upon the whole the advantage decidedly remained with the challengers not one of whom lost his seat or swerved from his chargemisfortunes which befell one or two of their antagonists in each encounter the spirits therefore of those opposed to them seemed to be considerably damped by their continued success three knights only appeared on the fourth entry who avoiding the shields of boisguilbert and frontdeboeuf contented themselves with touching those of the three other knights who had not altogether manifested the same strength and dexterity this politic selection did not alter the fortune of the field the challengers were still successful one of their antagonists was overthrown and both the others failed in the attaint 18 that is in striking the helmet and shield of their antagonist firmly and strongly with the lance held in a direct line so that the weapon might break unless the champion was overthrown  after this fourth encounter there was a considerable pause nor did it appear that any one was very desirous of renewing the contest the spectators murmured among themselves for among the challengers malvoisin and frontdeboeuf were unpopular from their characters and the others except grantmesnil were disliked as strangers and foreigners  but none shared the general feeling of dissatisfaction so keenly as cedric the saxon who saw in each advantage gained by the norman challengers a repeated triumph over the honour of england his own education had taught him no skill in the games of chivalry although with the arms of his saxon ancestors he had manifested himself on many occasions a brave and determined soldier he looked anxiously to athelstane who had learned the accomplishments of the age as if desiring that he should make some personal effort to recover the victory which was passing into the hands of the templar and his associates but though both stout of heart and strong of person athelstane had a disposition too inert and unambitious to make the exertions which cedric seemed to expect from him  the day is against england my lord said cedric in a marked tone are you not tempted to take the lance  i shall tilt tomorrow answered athelstane in the melee it is not worth while for me to arm myself today  two things displeased cedric in this speech it contained the norman word melee to express the general conflict and it evinced some indifference to the honour of the country but it was spoken by athelstane whom he held in such profound respect that he would not trust himself to canvass his motives or his foibles moreover he had no time to make any remark for wamba thrust in his word observing it was better though scarce easier to be the best man among a hundred than the best man of two  athelstane took the observation as a serious compliment but cedric who better understood the jesters meaning darted at him a severe and menacing look and lucky it was for wamba perhaps that the time and place prevented his receiving notwithstanding his place and service more sensible marks of his masters resentment  the pause in the tournament was still uninterrupted excepting by the voices of the heralds exclaiminglove of ladies splintering of lances stand forth gallant knights fair eyes look upon your deeds  the music also of the challengers breathed from time to time wild bursts expressive of triumph or defiance while the clowns grudged a holiday which seemed to pass away in inactivity and old knights and nobles lamented in whispers the decay of martial spirit spoke of the triumphs of their younger days but agreed that the land did not now supply dames of such transcendent beauty as had animated the jousts of former times prince john began to talk to his attendants about making ready the banquet and the necessity of adjudging the prize to brian de boisguilbert who had with a single spear overthrown two knights and foiled a third  at length as the saracenic music of the challengers concluded one of those long and high flourishes with which they had broken the silence of the lists it was answered by a solitary trumpet which breathed a note of defiance from the northern extremity all eyes were turned to see the new champion which these sounds announced and no sooner were the barriers opened than he paced into the lists as far as could be judged of a man sheathed in armour the new adventurer did not greatly exceed the middle size and seemed to be rather slender than strongly made his suit of armour was formed of steel richly inlaid with gold and the device on his shield was a young oaktree pulled up by the roots with the spanish word desdichado signifying disinherited he was mounted on a gallant black horse and as he passed through the lists he gracefully saluted the prince and the ladies by lowering his lance the dexterity with which he managed his steed and something of youthful grace which he displayed in his manner won him the favour of the multitude which some of the lower classes expressed by calling out touch ralph de viponts shieldtouch the hospitallers shield he has the least sure seat he is your cheapest bargain  the champion moving onward amid these wellmeant hints ascended the platform by the sloping alley which led to it from the lists and to the astonishment of all present riding straight up to the central pavilion struck with the sharp end of his spear the shield of brian de boisguilbert until it rung again all stood astonished at his presumption but none more than the redoubted knight whom he had thus defied to mortal combat and who little expecting so rude a challenge was standing carelessly at the door of the pavilion  have you confessed yourself brother said the templar and have you heard mass this morning that you peril your life so frankly  i am fitter to meet death than thou art answered the disinherited knight for by this name the stranger had recorded himself in the books of the tourney  then take your place in the lists said boisguilbert and look your last upon the sun for this night thou shalt sleep in paradise  gramercy for thy courtesy replied the disinherited knight and to requite it i advise thee to take a fresh horse and a new lance for by my honour you will need both  having expressed himself thus confidently he reined his horse backward down the slope which he had ascended and compelled him in the same manner to move backward through the lists till he reached the northern extremity where he remained stationary in expectation of his antagonist this feat of horsemanship again attracted the applause of the multitude  however incensed at his adversary for the precautions which he recommended brian de boisguilbert did not neglect his advice for his honour was too nearly concerned to permit his neglecting any means which might ensure victory over his presumptuous opponent he changed his horse for a proved and fresh one of great strength and spirit he chose a new and a tough spear lest the wood of the former might have been strained in the previous encounters he had sustained lastly he laid aside his shield which had received some little damage and received another from his squires his first had only borne the general device of his rider representing two knights riding upon one horse an emblem expressive of the original humility and poverty of the templars qualities which they had since exchanged for the arrogance and wealth that finally occasioned their suppression boisguilberts new shield bore a raven in full flight holding in its claws a skull and bearing the motto gare le corbeau  when the two champions stood opposed to each other at the two extremities of the lists the public expectation was strained to the highest pitch few augured the possibility that the encounter could terminate well for the disinherited knight yet his courage and gallantry secured the general good wishes of the spectators  the trumpets had no sooner given the signal than the champions vanished from their posts with the speed of lightning and closed in the centre of the lists with the shock of a thunderbolt the lances burst into shivers up to the very grasp and it seemed at the moment that both knights had fallen for the shock had made each horse recoil backwards upon its haunches the address of the riders recovered their steeds by use of the bridle and spur and having glared on each other for an instant with eyes which seemed to flash fire through the bars of their visors each made a demivolte and retiring to the extremity of the lists received a fresh lance from the attendants  a loud shout from the spectators waving of scarfs and handkerchiefs and general acclamations attested the interest taken by the spectators in this encounter the most equal as well as the best performed which had graced the day but no sooner had the knights resumed their station than the clamour of applause was hushed into a silence so deep and so dead that it seemed the multitude were afraid even to breathe  a few minutes pause having been allowed that the combatants and their horses might recover breath prince john with his truncheon signed to the trumpets to sound the onset the champions a second time sprung from their stations and closed in the centre of the lists with the same speed the same dexterity the same violence but not the same equal fortune as before  in this second encounter the templar aimed at the centre of his antagonists shield and struck it so fair and forcibly that his spear went to shivers and the disinherited knight reeled in his saddle on the other hand that champion had in the beginning of his career directed the point of his lance towards boisguilberts shield but changing his aim almost in the moment of encounter he addressed it to the helmet a mark more difficult to hit but which if attained rendered the shock more irresistible fair and true he hit the norman on the visor where his lances point kept hold of the bars yet even at this disadvantage the templar sustained his high reputation and had not the girths of his saddle burst he might not have been unhorsed as it chanced however saddle horse and man rolled on the ground under a cloud of dust  to extricate himself from the stirrups and fallen steed was to the templar scarce the work of a moment and stung with madness both at his disgrace and at the acclamations with which it was hailed by the spectators he drew his sword and waved it in defiance of his conqueror the disinherited knight sprung from his steed and also unsheathed his sword the marshals of the field however spurred their horses between them and reminded them that the laws of the tournament did not on the present occasion permit this species of encounter  we shall meet again i trust said the templar casting a resentful glance at his antagonist and where there are none to separate us  if we do not said the disinherited knight the fault shall not be mine on foot or horseback with spear with axe or with sword i am alike ready to encounter thee  more and angrier words would have been exchanged but the marshals crossing their lances betwixt them compelled them to separate the disinherited knight returned to his first station and boisguilbert to his tent where he remained for the rest of the day in an agony of despair  without alighting from his horse the conqueror called for a bowl of wine and opening the beaver or lower part of his helmet announced that he quaffed it to all true english hearts and to the confusion of foreign tyrants he then commanded his trumpet to sound a defiance to the challengers and desired a herald to announce to them that he should make no election but was willing to encounter them in the order in which they pleased to advance against him  the gigantic frontdeboeuf armed in sable armour was the first who took the field he bore on a white shield a black bulls head half defaced by the numerous encounters which he had undergone and bearing the arrogant motto cave adsum over this champion the disinherited knight obtained a slight but decisive advantage both knights broke their lances fairly but frontdeboeuf who lost a stirrup in the encounter was adjudged to have the disadvantage  in the strangers third encounter with sir philip malvoisin he was equally successful striking that baron so forcibly on the casque that the laces of the helmet broke and malvoisin only saved from falling by being unhelmeted was declared vanquished like his companions  in his fourth combat with de grantmesnil the disinherited knight showed as much courtesy as he had hitherto evinced courage and dexterity de grantmesnils horse which was young and violent reared and plunged in the course of the career so as to disturb the riders aim and the stranger declining to take the advantage which this accident afforded him raised his lance and passing his antagonist without touching him wheeled his horse and rode back again to his own end of the lists offering his antagonist by a herald the chance of a second encounter this de grantmesnil declined avowing himself vanquished as much by the courtesy as by the address of his opponent  ralph de vipont summed up the list of the strangers triumphs being hurled to the ground with such force that the blood gushed from his nose and his mouth and he was borne senseless from the lists  the acclamations of thousands applauded the unanimous award of the prince and marshals announcing that days honours to the disinherited knight     chapter ix       in the midst was seen      a lady of a more majestic mien      by stature and by beauty markd their sovereign queen                and as in beauty she surpassd the choir      so nobler than the rest was her attire      a crown of ruddy gold enclosed her brow      plain without pomp and rich without a show      a branch of agnus castus in her hand      she bore aloft her symbol of command      the flower and the leaf  william de wyvil and stephen de martival the marshals of the field were the first to offer their congratulations to the victor praying him at the same time to suffer his helmet to be unlaced or at least that he would raise his visor ere they conducted him to receive the prize of the days tourney from the hands of prince john the disinherited knight with all knightly courtesy declined their request alleging that he could not at this time suffer his face to be seen for reasons which he had assigned to the heralds when he entered the lists the marshals were perfectly satisfied by this reply for amidst the frequent and capricious vows by which knights were accustomed to bind themselves in the days of chivalry there were none more common than those by which they engaged to remain incognito for a certain space or until some particular adventure was achieved the marshals therefore pressed no farther into the mystery of the disinherited knight but announcing to prince john the conquerors desire to remain unknown they requested permission to bring him before his grace in order that he might receive the reward of his valour  johns curiosity was excited by the mystery observed by the stranger and being already displeased with the issue of the tournament in which the challengers whom he favoured had been successively defeated by one knight he answered haughtily to the marshals by the light of our ladys brow this same knight hath been disinherited as well of his courtesy as of his lands since he desires to appear before us without uncovering his facewot ye my lords he said turning round to his train who this gallant can be that bears himself thus proudly  i cannot guess answered de bracy nor did i think there had been within the four seas that girth britain a champion that could bear down these five knights in one days jousting by my faith i shall never forget the force with which he shocked de vipont the poor hospitaller was hurled from his saddle like a stone from a sling  boast not of that said a knight of st john who was present your temple champion had no better luck i saw your brave lance boisguilbert roll thrice over grasping his hands full of sand at every turn  de bracy being attached to the templars would have replied but was prevented by prince john silence sirs he said what unprofitable debate have we here  the victor said de wyvil still waits the pleasure of your highness  it is our pleasure answered john that he do so wait until we learn whether there is not some one who can at least guess at his name and quality should he remain there till nightfall he has had work enough to keep him warm  your grace said waldemar fitzurse will do less than due honour to the victor if you compel him to wait till we tell your highness that which we cannot know at least i can form no guessunless he be one of the good lances who accompanied king richard to palestine and who are now straggling homeward from the holy land  it may be the earl of salisbury said de bracy he is about the same pitch  sir thomas de multon the knight of gilsland rather said fitzurse salisbury is bigger in the bones a whisper arose among the train but by whom first suggested could not be ascertained it might be the kingit might be richard coeurdelion himself  over gods forbode said prince john involuntarily turning at the same time as pale as death and shrinking as if blighted by a flash of lightning waldemarde bracy brave knights and gentlemen remember your promises and stand truly by me  here is no danger impending said waldemar fitzurse are you so little acquainted with the gigantic limbs of your fathers son as to think they can be held within the circumference of yonder suit of armourde wyvil and martival you will best serve the prince by bringing forward the victor to the throne and ending an error that has conjured all the blood from his cheekslook at him more closely he continued your highness will see that he wants three inches of king richards height and twice as much of his shoulderbreadth the very horse he backs could not have carried the ponderous weight of king richard through a single course  while he was yet speaking the marshals brought forward the disinherited knight to the foot of a wooden flight of steps which formed the ascent from the lists to prince johns throne still discomposed with the idea that his brother so much injured and to whom he was so much indebted had suddenly arrived in his native kingdom even the distinctions pointed out by fitzurse did not altogether remove the princes apprehensions and while with a short and embarrassed eulogy upon his valour he caused to be delivered to him the warhorse assigned as the prize he trembled lest from the barred visor of the mailed form before him an answer might be returned in the deep and awful accents of richard the lionhearted  but the disinherited knight spoke not a word in reply to the compliment of the prince which he only acknowledged with a profound obeisance  the horse was led into the lists by two grooms richly dressed the animal itself being fully accoutred with the richest warfurniture which however scarcely added to the value of the noble creature in the eyes of those who were judges laying one hand upon the pommel of the saddle the disinherited knight vaulted at once upon the back of the steed without making use of the stirrup and brandishing aloft his lance rode twice around the lists exhibiting the points and paces of the horse with the skill of a perfect horseman  the appearance of vanity which might otherwise have been attributed to this display was removed by the propriety shown in exhibiting to the best advantage the princely reward with which he had been just honoured and the knight was again greeted by the acclamations of all present  in the meanwhile the bustling prior of jorvaulx had reminded prince john in a whisper that the victor must now display his good judgment instead of his valour by selecting from among the beauties who graced the galleries a lady who should fill the throne of the queen of beauty and of love and deliver the prize of the tourney upon the ensuing day the prince accordingly made a sign with his truncheon as the knight passed him in his second career around the lists the knight turned towards the throne and sinking his lance until the point was within a foot of the ground remained motionless as if expecting johns commands while all admired the sudden dexterity with which he instantly reduced his fiery steed from a state of violent emotion and high excitation to the stillness of an equestrian statue  sir disinherited knight said prince john since that is the only title by which we can address you it is now your duty as well as privilege to name the fair lady who as queen of honour and of love is to preside over next days festival if as a stranger in our land you should require the aid of other judgment to guide your own we can only say that alicia the daughter of our gallant knight waldemar fitzurse has at our court been long held the first in beauty as in place nevertheless it is your undoubted prerogative to confer on whom you please this crown by the delivery of which to the lady of your choice the election of tomorrows queen will be formal and completeraise your lance  the knight obeyed and prince john placed upon its point a coronet of green satin having around its edge a circlet of gold the upper edge of which was relieved by arrowpoints and hearts placed interchangeably like the strawberry leaves and balls upon a ducal crown  in the broad hint which he dropped respecting the daughter of waldemar fitzurse john had more than one motive each the offspring of a mind which was a strange mixture of carelessness and presumption with low artifice and cunning he wished to banish from the minds of the chivalry around him his own indecent and unacceptable jest respecting the jewess rebecca he was desirous of conciliating alicias father waldemar of whom he stood in awe and who had more than once shown himself dissatisfied during the course of the days proceedings he had also a wish to establish himself in the good graces of the lady for john was at least as licentious in his pleasures as profligate in his ambition but besides all these reasons he was desirous to raise up against the disinherited knight towards whom he already entertained a strong dislike a powerful enemy in the person of waldemar fitzurse who was likely he thought highly to resent the injury done to his daughter in case as was not unlikely the victor should make another choice  and so indeed it proved for the disinherited knight passed the gallery close to that of the prince in which the lady alicia was seated in the full pride of triumphant beauty and pacing forwards as slowly as he had hitherto rode swiftly around the lists he seemed to exercise his right of examining the numerous fair faces which adorned that splendid circle  it was worth while to see the different conduct of the beauties who underwent this examination during the time it was proceeding some blushed some assumed an air of pride and dignity some looked straight forward and essayed to seem utterly unconscious of what was going on some drew back in alarm which was perhaps affected some endeavoured to forbear smiling and there were two or three who laughed outright there were also some who dropped their veils over their charms but as the wardour manuscript says these were fair ones of ten years standing it may be supposed that having had their full share of such vanities they were willing to withdraw their claim in order to give a fair chance to the rising beauties of the age  at length the champion paused beneath the balcony in which the lady rowena was placed and the expectation of the spectators was excited to the utmost  it must be owned that if an interest displayed in his success could have bribed the disinherited knight the part of the lists before which he paused had merited his predilection cedric the saxon overjoyed at the discomfiture of the templar and still more so at the miscarriage of his two malevolent neighbours frontdeboeuf and malvoisin had with his body half stretched over the balcony accompanied the victor in each course not with his eyes only but with his whole heart and soul the lady rowena had watched the progress of the day with equal attention though without openly betraying the same intense interest even the unmoved athelstane had shown symptoms of shaking off his apathy when calling for a huge goblet of muscadine he quaffed it to the health of the disinherited knight another group stationed under the gallery occupied by the saxons had shown no less interest in the fate of the day  father abraham said isaac of york when the first course was run betwixt the templar and the disinherited knight how fiercely that gentile rides ah the good horse that was brought all the long way from barbary he takes no more care of him than if he were a wild asss coltand the noble armour that was worth so many zecchins to joseph pareira the armourer of milan besides seventy in the hundred of profits he cares for it as little as if he had found it in the highways  if he risks his own person and limbs father said rebecca in doing such a dreadful battle he can scarce be expected to spare his horse and armour  child replied isaac somewhat heated thou knowest not what thou speakesthis neck and limbs are his own but his horse and armour belong toholy jacob what was i about to saynevertheless it is a good youthsee rebecca see he is again about to go up to battle against the philistinepray childpray for the safety of the good youthand of the speedy horse and the rich armourgod of my fathers he again exclaimed he hath conquered and the uncircumcised philistine hath fallen before his lanceeven as og the king of bashan and sihon king of the amorites fell before the sword of our fatherssurely he shall take their gold and their silver and their warhorses and their armour of brass and of steel for a prey and for a spoil  the same anxiety did the worthy jew display during every course that was run seldom failing to hazard a hasty calculation concerning the value of the horse and armour which was forfeited to the champion upon each new success there had been therefore no small interest taken in the success of the disinherited knight by those who occupied the part of the lists before which he now paused  whether from indecision or some other motive of hesitation the champion of the day remained stationary for more than a minute while the eyes of the silent audience were riveted upon his motions and then gradually and gracefully sinking the point of his lance he deposited the coronet which it supported at the feet of the fair rowena the trumpets instantly sounded while the heralds proclaimed the lady rowena the queen of beauty and of love for the ensuing day menacing with suitable penalties those who should be disobedient to her authority they then repeated their cry of largesse to which cedric in the height of his joy replied by an ample donative and to which athelstane though less promptly added one equally large  there was some murmuring among the damsels of norman descent who were as much unused to see the preference given to a saxon beauty as the norman nobles were to sustain defeat in the games of chivalry which they themselves had introduced but these sounds of disaffection were drowned by the popular shout of long live the lady rowena the chosen and lawful queen of love and of beauty to which many in the lower area added long live the saxon princess long live the race of the immortal alfred  however unacceptable these sounds might be to prince john and to those around him he saw himself nevertheless obliged to confirm the nomination of the victor and accordingly calling to horse he left his throne and mounting his jennet accompanied by his train he again entered the lists the prince paused a moment beneath the gallery of the lady alicia to whom he paid his compliments observing at the same time to those around himby my halidome sirs if the knights feats in arms have shown that he hath limbs and sinews his choice hath no less proved that his eyes are none of the clearest  it was on this occasion as during his whole life johns misfortune not perfectly to understand the characters of those whom he wished to conciliate waldemar fitzurse was rather offended than pleased at the prince stating thus broadly an opinion that his daughter had been slighted  i know no right of chivalry he said more precious or inalienable than that of each free knight to choose his ladylove by his own judgment my daughter courts distinction from no one and in her own character and in her own sphere will never fail to receive the full proportion of that which is her due  prince john replied not but spurring his horse as if to give vent to his vexation he made the animal bound forward to the gallery where rowena was seated with the crown still at her feet  assume he said fair lady the mark of your sovereignty to which none vows homage more sincerely than ourself john of anjou and if it please you today with your noble sire and friends to grace our banquet in the castle of ashby we shall learn to know the empress to whose service we devote tomorrow  rowena remained silent and cedric answered for her in his native saxon  the lady rowena he said possesses not the language in which to reply to your courtesy or to sustain her part in your festival i also and the noble athelstane of coningsburgh speak only the language and practise only the manners of our fathers we therefore decline with thanks your highnesss courteous invitation to the banquet tomorrow the lady rowena will take upon her the state to which she has been called by the free election of the victor knight confirmed by the acclamations of the people  so saying he lifted the coronet and placed it upon rowenas head in token of her acceptance of the temporary authority assigned to her  what says he said prince john affecting not to understand the saxon language in which however he was well skilled the purport of cedrics speech was repeated to him in french it is well he said tomorrow we will ourself conduct this mute sovereign to her seat of dignityyou at least sir knight he added turning to the victor who had remained near the gallery will this day share our banquet  the knight speaking for the first time in a low and hurried voice excused himself by pleading fatigue and the necessity of preparing for tomorrows encounter  it is well said prince john haughtily although unused to such refusals we will endeavour to digest our banquet as we may though ungraced by the most successful in arms and his elected queen of beauty  so saying he prepared to leave the lists with his glittering train and his turning his steed for that purpose was the signal for the breaking up and dispersion of the spectators  yet with the vindictive memory proper to offended pride especially when combined with conscious want of desert john had hardly proceeded three paces ere again turning around he fixed an eye of stern resentment upon the yeoman who had displeased him in the early part of the day and issued his commands to the menatarms who stood nearon your life suffer not that fellow to escape  the yeoman stood the angry glance of the prince with the same unvaried steadiness which had marked his former deportment saying with a smile i have no intention to leave ashby until the day after tomorrowi must see how staffordshire and leicestershire can draw their bowsthe forests of needwood and charnwood must rear good archers  i said prince john to his attendants but not in direct replyi will see how he can draw his own and woe betide him unless his skill should prove some apology for his insolence  it is full time said de bracy that the outrecuidance 19 of these peasants should be restrained by some striking example  waldemar fitzurse who probably thought his patron was not taking the readiest road to popularity shrugged up his shoulders and was silent prince john resumed his retreat from the lists and the dispersion of the multitude became general  in various routes according to the different quarters from which they came and in groups of various numbers the spectators were seen retiring over the plain by far the most numerous part streamed towards the town of ashby where many of the distinguished persons were lodged in the castle and where others found accommodation in the town itself among these were most of the knights who had already appeared in the tournament or who proposed to fight there the ensuing day and who as they rode slowly along talking over the events of the day were greeted with loud shouts by the populace the same acclamations were bestowed upon prince john although he was indebted for them rather to the splendour of his appearance and train than to the popularity of his character  a more sincere and more general as well as a bettermerited acclamation attended the victor of the day until anxious to withdraw himself from popular notice he accepted the accommodation of one of those pavilions pitched at the extremities of the lists the use of which was courteously tendered him by the marshals of the field on his retiring to his tent many who had lingered in the lists to look upon and form conjectures concerning him also dispersed  the signs and sounds of a tumultuous concourse of men lately crowded together in one place and agitated by the same passing events were now exchanged for the distant hum of voices of different groups retreating in all directions and these speedily died away in silence no other sounds were heard save the voices of the menials who stripped the galleries of their cushions and tapestry in order to put them in safety for the night and wrangled among themselves for the halfused bottles of wine and relics of the refreshment which had been served round to the spectators  beyond the precincts of the lists more than one forge was erected and these now began to glimmer through the twilight announcing the toil of the armourers which was to continue through the whole night in order to repair or alter the suits of armour to be used again on the morrow  a strong guard of menatarms renewed at intervals from two hours to two hours surrounded the lists and kept watch during the night     chapter x       thus like the sad presaging raven that tolls      the sick mans passport in her hollow beak      and in the shadow of the silent night      doth shake contagion from her sable wings      vexd and tormented runs poor barrabas      with fatal curses towards these christians      jew of malta  the disinherited knight had no sooner reached his pavilion than squires and pages in abundance tendered their services to disarm him to bring fresh attire and to offer him the refreshment of the bath their zeal on this occasion was perhaps sharpened by curiosity since every one desired to know who the knight was that had gained so many laurels yet had refused even at the command of prince john to lift his visor or to name his name but their officious inquisitiveness was not gratified the disinherited knight refused all other assistance save that of his own squire or rather yeomana clownishlooking man who wrapt in a cloak of darkcoloured felt and having his head and face halfburied in a norman bonnet made of black fur seemed to affect the incognito as much as his master all others being excluded from the tent this attendant relieved his master from the more burdensome parts of his armour and placed food and wine before him which the exertions of the day rendered very acceptable  the knight had scarcely finished a hasty meal ere his menial announced to him that five men each leading a barbed steed desired to speak with him the disinherited knight had exchanged his armour for the long robe usually worn by those of his condition which being furnished with a hood concealed the features when such was the pleasure of the wearer almost as completely as the visor of the helmet itself but the twilight which was now fast darkening would of itself have rendered a disguise unnecessary unless to persons to whom the face of an individual chanced to be particularly well known  the disinherited knight therefore stept boldly forth to the front of his tent and found in attendance the squires of the challengers whom he easily knew by their russet and black dresses each of whom led his masters charger loaded with the armour in which he had that day fought  according to the laws of chivalry said the foremost of these men i baldwin de oyley squire to the redoubted knight brian de boisguilbert make offer to you styling yourself for the present the disinherited knight of the horse and armour used by the said brian de boisguilbert in this days passage of arms leaving it with your nobleness to retain or to ransom the same according to your pleasure for such is the law of arms  the other squires repeated nearly the same formula and then stood to await the decision of the disinherited knight  to you four sirs replied the knight addressing those who had last spoken and to your honourable and valiant masters i have one common reply commend me to the noble knights your masters and say i should do ill to deprive them of steeds and arms which can never be used by braver cavaliersi would i could here end my message to these gallant knights but being as i term myself in truth and earnest the disinherited i must be thus far bound to your masters that they will of their courtesy be pleased to ransom their steeds and armour since that which i wear i can hardly term mine own  we stand commissioned each of us answered the squire of reginald frontdeboeuf to offer a hundred zecchins in ransom of these horses and suits of armour  it is sufficient said the disinherited knight half the sum my present necessities compel me to accept of the remaining half distribute one moiety among yourselves sir squires and divide the other half betwixt the heralds and the pursuivants and minstrels and attendants  the squires with cap in hand and low reverences expressed their deep sense of a courtesy and generosity not often practised at least upon a scale so extensive the disinherited knight then addressed his discourse to baldwin the squire of brian de boisguilbert from your master said he i will accept neither arms nor ransom say to him in my name that our strife is not endedno not till we have fought as well with swords as with lancesas well on foot as on horseback to this mortal quarrel he has himself defied me and i shall not forget the challengemeantime let him be assured that i hold him not as one of his companions with whom i can with pleasure exchange courtesies but rather as one with whom i stand upon terms of mortal defiance  my master answered baldwin knows how to requite scorn with scorn and blows with blows as well as courtesy with courtesy since you disdain to accept from him any share of the ransom at which you have rated the arms of the other knights i must leave his armour and his horse here being well assured that he will never deign to mount the one nor wear the other  you have spoken well good squire said the disinherited knight well and boldly as it beseemeth him to speak who answers for an absent master leave not however the horse and armour here restore them to thy master or if he scorns to accept them retain them good friend for thine own use so far as they are mine i bestow them upon you freely  baldwin made a deep obeisance and retired with his companions and the disinherited knight entered the pavilion  thus far gurth said he addressing his attendant the reputation of english chivalry hath not suffered in my hands  and i said gurth for a saxon swineherd have not ill played the personage of a norman squireatarms  yea but answered the disinherited knight thou hast ever kept me in anxiety lest thy clownish bearing should discover thee  tush said gurth i fear discovery from none saving my playfellow wamba the jester of whom i could never discover whether he were most knave or fool yet i could scarce choose but laugh when my old master passed so near to me dreaming all the while that gurth was keeping his porkers many a mile off in the thickets and swamps of rotherwood if i am discovered  enough said the disinherited knight thou knowest my promise  nay for that matter said gurth i will never fail my friend for fear of my skincutting i have a tough hide that will bear knife or scourge as well as any boars hide in my herd  trust me i will requite the risk you run for my love gurth said the knight meanwhile i pray you to accept these ten pieces of gold  i am richer said gurth putting them into his pouch than ever was swineherd or bondsman  take this bag of gold to ashby continued his master and find out isaac the jew of york and let him pay himself for the horse and arms with which his credit supplied me  nay by st dunstan replied gurth that i will not do  how knave replied his master wilt thou not obey my commands  so they be honest reasonable and christian commands replied gurth but this is none of these to suffer the jew to pay himself would be dishonest for it would be cheating my master and unreasonable for it were the part of a fool and unchristian since it would be plundering a believer to enrich an infidel  see him contented however thou stubborn varlet said the disinherited knight  i will do so said gurth taking the bag under his cloak and leaving the apartment and it will go hard he muttered but i content him with onehalf of his own asking so saying he departed and left the disinherited knight to his own perplexed ruminations which upon more accounts than it is now possible to communicate to the reader were of a nature peculiarly agitating and painful  we must now change the scene to the village of ashby or rather to a country house in its vicinity belonging to a wealthy israelite with whom isaac his daughter and retinue had taken up their quarters the jews it is well known being as liberal in exercising the duties of hospitality and charity among their own people as they were alleged to be reluctant and churlish in extending them to those whom they termed gentiles and whose treatment of them certainly merited little hospitality at their hand  in an apartment small indeed but richly furnished with decorations of an oriental taste rebecca was seated on a heap of embroidered cushions which piled along a low platform that surrounded the chamber served like the estrada of the spaniards instead of chairs and stools she was watching the motions of her father with a look of anxious and filial affection while he paced the apartment with a dejected mien and disordered step sometimes clasping his hands togethersometimes casting his eyes to the roof of the apartment as one who laboured under great mental tribulation o jacob he exclaimedo all ye twelve holy fathers of our tribe what a losing venture is this for one who hath duly kept every jot and tittle of the law of mosesfifty zecchins wrenched from me at one clutch and by the talons of a tyrant  but father said rebecca you seemed to give the gold to prince john willingly  willingly the blotch of egypt upon himwillingly saidst thouay as willingly as when in the gulf of lyons i flung over my merchandise to lighten the ship while she laboured in the tempestrobed the seething billows in my choice silksperfumed their briny foam with myrrh and aloesenriched their caverns with gold and silver work and was not that an hour of unutterable misery though my own hands made the sacrifice  but it was a sacrifice which heaven exacted to save our lives answered rebecca and the god of our fathers has since blessed your store and your gettings  ay answered isaac but if the tyrant lays hold on them as he did today and compels me to smile while he is robbing meo daughter disinherited and wandering as we are the worst evil which befalls our race is that when we are wronged and plundered all the world laughs around and we are compelled to suppress our sense of injury and to smile tamely when we would revenge bravely  think not thus of it my father said rebecca we also have advantages these gentiles cruel and oppressive as they are are in some sort dependent on the dispersed children of zion whom they despise and persecute without the aid of our wealth they could neither furnish forth their hosts in war nor their triumphs in peace and the gold which we lend them returns with increase to our coffers we are like the herb which flourisheth most when it is most trampled on even this days pageant had not proceeded without the consent of the despised jew who furnished the means  daughter said isaac thou hast harped upon another string of sorrow the goodly steed and the rich armour equal to the full profit of my adventure with our kirjath jairam of leicesterthere is a dead loss tooay a loss which swallows up the gains of a week ay of the space between two sabbathsand yet it may end better than i now think for tis a good youth  assuredly said rebecca you shall not repent you of requiting the good deed received of the stranger knight  i trust so daughter said isaac and i trust too in the rebuilding of zion but as well do i hope with my own bodily eyes to see the walls and battlements of the new temple as to see a christian yea the very best of christians repay a debt to a jew unless under the awe of the judge and jailor  so saying he resumed his discontented walk through the apartment and rebecca perceiving that her attempts at consolation only served to awaken new subjects of complaint wisely desisted from her unavailing effortsa prudential line of conduct and we recommend to all who set up for comforters and advisers to follow it in the like circumstances  the evening was now becoming dark when a jewish servant entered the apartment and placed upon the table two silver lamps fed with perfumed oil the richest wines and the most delicate refreshments were at the same time displayed by another israelitish domestic on a small ebony table inlaid with silver for in the interior of their houses the jews refused themselves no expensive indulgences at the same time the servant informed isaac that a nazarene so they termed christians while conversing among themselves desired to speak with him he that would live by traffic must hold himself at the disposal of every one claiming business with him isaac at once replaced on the table the untasted glass of greek wine which he had just raised to his lips and saying hastily to his daughter rebecca veil thyself commanded the stranger to be admitted  just as rebecca had dropped over her fine features a screen of silver gauze which reached to her feet the door opened and gurth entered wrapt in the ample folds of his norman mantle his appearance was rather suspicious than prepossessing especially as instead of doffing his bonnet he pulled it still deeper over his rugged brow  art thou isaac the jew of york said gurth in saxon  i am replied isaac in the same language for his traffic had rendered every tongue spoken in britain familiar to himand who art thou  that is not to the purpose answered gurth  as much as my name is to thee replied isaac for without knowing thine how can i hold intercourse with thee  easily answered gurth i being to pay money must know that i deliver it to the right person thou who are to receive it will not i think care very greatly by whose hands it is delivered  o said the jew you are come to pay moneysholy father abraham that altereth our relation to each other and from whom dost thou bring it  from the disinherited knight said gurth victor in this days tournament it is the price of the armour supplied to him by kirjath jairam of leicester on thy recommendation the steed is restored to thy stable i desire to know the amount of the sum which i am to pay for the armour  i said he was a good youth exclaimed isaac with joyful exultation a cup of wine will do thee no harm he added filling and handing to the swineherd a richer drought than gurth had ever before tasted and how much money continued isaac has thou brought with thee  holy virgin said gurth setting down the cup what nectar these unbelieving dogs drink while true christians are fain to quaff ale as muddy and thick as the draff we give to hogswhat money have i brought with me continued the saxon when he had finished this uncivil ejaculation even but a small sum something in hand the whilst what isaac thou must bear a conscience though it be a jewish one  nay but said isaac thy master has won goodly steeds and rich armours with the strength of his lance and of his right handbut tis a good youththe jew will take these in present payment and render him back the surplus  my master has disposed of them already said gurth  ah that was wrong said the jew that was the part of a fool no christians here could buy so many horses and armourno jew except myself would give him half the values but thou hast a hundred zecchins with thee in that bag said isaac prying under gurths cloak it is a heavy one  i have heads for crossbow bolts in it said gurth readily  well thensaid isaac panting and hesitating between habitual love of gain and a newborn desire to be liberal in the present instance if i should say that i would take eighty zecchins for the good steed and the rich armour which leaves me not a guilders profit have you money to pay me  barely said gurth though the sum demanded was more reasonable than he expected and it will leave my master nigh penniless nevertheless if such be your least offer i must be content  fill thyself another goblet of wine said the jew ah eighty zecchins is too little it leaveth no profit for the usages of the moneys and besides the good horse may have suffered wrong in this days encounter o it was a hard and a dangerous meeting man and steed rushing on each other like wild bulls of bashan the horse cannot but have had wrong  and i say replied gurth he is sound wind and limb and you may see him now in your stable and i say over and above that seventy zecchins is enough for the armour and i hope a christians word is as good as a jews if you will not take seventy i will carry this bag and he shook it till the contents jingled back to my master  nay nay said isaac lay down the talentsthe shekelsthe eighty zecchins and thou shalt see i will consider thee liberally  gurth at length complied and telling out eighty zecchins upon the table the jew delivered out to him an acquittance for the horse and suit of armour the jews hand trembled for joy as he wrapped up the first seventy pieces of gold the last ten he told over with much deliberation pausing and saying something as he took each piece from the table and dropt it into his purse it seemed as if his avarice were struggling with his better nature and compelling him to pouch zecchin after zecchin while his generosity urged him to restore some part at least to his benefactor or as a donation to his agent his whole speech ran nearly thus  seventyoneseventytwo thy master is a good youthseventythree an excellent youthseventyfourthat piece hath been clipt within the ringseventyfiveand that looketh light of weightseventysixwhen thy master wants money let him come to isaac of yorkseventyseventhat is with reasonable security here he made a considerable pause and gurth had good hope that the last three pieces might escape the fate of their comrades but the enumeration proceededseventyeightthou art a good fellowseventynineand deservest something for thyself  here the jew paused again and looked at the last zecchin intending doubtless to bestow it upon gurth he weighed it upon the tip of his finger and made it ring by dropping it upon the table had it rung too flat or had it felt a hairs breadth too light generosity had carried the day but unhappily for gurth the chime was full and true the zecchin plump newly coined and a grain above weight isaac could not find in his heart to part with it so dropt it into his purse as if in absence of mind with the words eighty completes the tale and i trust thy master will reward thee handsomelysurely he added looking earnestly at the bag thou hast more coins in that pouch  gurth grinned which was his nearest approach to a laugh as he replied about the same quantity which thou hast just told over so carefully he then folded the quittance and put it under his cap addingperil of thy beard jew see that this be full and ample he filled himself unbidden a third goblet of wine and left the apartment without ceremony  rebecca said the jew that ishmaelite hath gone somewhat beyond me nevertheless his master is a good youthay and i am well pleased that he hath gained shekels of gold and shekels of silver even by the speed of his horse and by the strength of his lance which like that of goliath the philistine might vie with a weavers beam  as he turned to receive rebeccas answer he observed that during his chattering with gurth she had left the apartment unperceived  in the meanwhile gurth had descended the stair and having reached the dark antechamber or hall was puzzling about to discover the entrance when a figure in white shown by a small silver lamp which she held in her hand beckoned him into a side apartment gurth had some reluctance to obey the summons rough and impetuous as a wild boar where only earthly force was to be apprehended he had all the characteristic terrors of a saxon respecting fawns forestfiends white women and the whole of the superstitions which his ancestors had brought with them from the wilds of germany he remembered moreover that he was in the house of a jew a people who besides the other unamiable qualities which popular report ascribed to them were supposed to be profound necromancers and cabalists nevertheless after a moments pause he obeyed the beckoning summons of the apparition and followed her into the apartment which she indicated where he found to his joyful surprise that his fair guide was the beautiful jewess whom he had seen at the tournament and a short time in her fathers apartment  she asked him the particulars of his transaction with isaac which he detailed accurately  my father did but jest with thee good fellow said rebecca he owes thy master deeper kindness than these arms and steed could pay were their value tenfold what sum didst thou pay my father even now  eighty zecchins said gurth surprised at the question  in this purse said rebecca thou wilt find a hundred restore to thy master that which is his due and enrich thyself with the remainder hastebegonestay not to render thanks and beware how you pass through this crowded town where thou mayst easily lose both thy burden and thy lifereuben she added clapping her hands together light forth this stranger and fail not to draw lock and bar behind him reuben a darkbrowd and blackbearded israelite obeyed her summons with a torch in his hand undid the outward door of the house and conducting gurth across a paved court let him out through a wicket in the entrancegate which he closed behind him with such bolts and chains as would well have become that of a prison  by st dunstan said gurth as he stumbled up the dark avenue this is no jewess but an angel from heaven ten zecchins from my brave young mastertwenty from this pearl of zionoh happy daysuch another gurth will redeem thy bondage and make thee a brother as free of thy guild as the best and then do i lay down my swineherds horn and staff and take the freemans sword and buckler and follow my young master to the death without hiding either my face or my name     chapter xi       1st outlaw stand sir and throw us that you have about you      if not well make you sit and rifle you      speed sir we are undone these are the villains      that all the travellers do fear so much      val my friends      1st out thats not so sir we are your enemies      2d out peace well hear him      3d out ay by my beard will we      for hes a proper man      two gentlemen of verona  the nocturnal adventures of gurth were not yet concluded indeed he himself became partly of that mind when after passing one or two straggling houses which stood in the outskirts of the village he found himself in a deep lane running between two banks overgrown with hazel and holly while here and there a dwarf oak flung its arms altogether across the path the lane was moreover much rutted and broken up by the carriages which had recently transported articles of various kinds to the tournament and it was dark for the banks and bushes intercepted the light of the harvest moon  from the village were heard the distant sounds of revelry mixed occasionally with loud laughter sometimes broken by screams and sometimes by wild strains of distant music all these sounds intimating the disorderly state of the town crowded with military nobles and their dissolute attendants gave gurth some uneasiness the jewess was right he said to himself by heaven and st dunstan i would i were safe at my journeys end with all this treasure here are such numbers i will not say of arrant thieves but of errant knights and errant squires errant monks and errant minstrels errant jugglers and errant jesters that a man with a single merk would be in danger much more a poor swineherd with a whole bagful of zecchins would i were out of the shade of these infernal bushes that i might at least see any of st nicholass clerks before they spring on my shoulders  gurth accordingly hastened his pace in order to gain the open common to which the lane led but was not so fortunate as to accomplish his object just as he had attained the upper end of the lane where the underwood was thickest four men sprung upon him even as his fears anticipated two from each side of the road and seized him so fast that resistance if at first practicable would have been now too latesurrender your charge said one of them we are the deliverers of the commonwealth who ease every man of his burden  you should not ease me of mine so lightly muttered gurth whose surly honesty could not be tamed even by the pressure of immediate violencehad i it but in my power to give three strokes in its defence  we shall see that presently said the robber and speaking to his companions he added bring along the knave i see he would have his head broken as well as his purse cut and so be let blood in two veins at once  gurth was hurried along agreeably to this mandate and having been dragged somewhat roughly over the bank on the lefthand side of the lane found himself in a straggling thicket which lay betwixt it and the open common he was compelled to follow his rough conductors into the very depth of this cover where they stopt unexpectedly in an irregular open space free in a great measure from trees and on which therefore the beams of the moon fell without much interruption from boughs and leaves here his captors were joined by two other persons apparently belonging to the gang they had short swords by their sides and quarterstaves in their hands and gurth could now observe that all six wore visors which rendered their occupation a matter of no question even had their former proceedings left it in doubt  what money hast thou churl said one of the thieves  thirty zecchins of my own property answered gurth doggedly  a forfeita forfeit shouted the robbers a saxon hath thirty zecchins and returns sober from a village an undeniable and unredeemable forfeit of all he hath about him  i hoarded it to purchase my freedom said gurth  thou art an ass replied one of the thieves three quarts of double ale had rendered thee as free as thy master ay and freer too if he be a saxon like thyself  a sad truth replied gurth but if these same thirty zecchins will buy my freedom from you unloose my hands and i will pay them to you  hold said one who seemed to exercise some authority over the others this bag which thou bearest as i can feel through thy cloak contains more coin than thou hast told us of  it is the good knight my masters answered gurth of which assuredly i would not have spoken a word had you been satisfied with working your will upon mine own property  thou art an honest fellow replied the robber i warrant thee and we worship not st nicholas so devoutly but what thy thirty zecchins may yet escape if thou deal uprightly with us meantime render up thy trust for a time so saying he took from gurths breast the large leathern pouch in which the purse given him by rebecca was enclosed as well as the rest of the zecchins and then continued his interrogationwho is thy master  the disinherited knight said gurth  whose good lance replied the robber won the prize in todays tourney what is his name and lineage  it is his pleasure answered gurth that they be concealed and from me assuredly you will learn nought of them  what is thine own name and lineage  to tell that said gurth might reveal my masters  thou art a saucy groom said the robber but of that anon how comes thy master by this gold is it of his inheritance or by what means hath it accrued to him  by his good lance answered gurththese bags contain the ransom of four good horses and four good suits of armour  how much is there demanded the robber  two hundred zecchins  only two hundred zecchins said the bandit your master hath dealt liberally by the vanquished and put them to a cheap ransom name those who paid the gold  gurth did so  the armour and horse of the templar brian de boisguilbert at what ransom were they heldthou seest thou canst not deceive me  my master replied gurth will take nought from the templar save his lifesblood they are on terms of mortal defiance and cannot hold courteous intercourse together  indeedrepeated the robber and paused after he had said the word and what wert thou now doing at ashby with such a charge in thy custody  i went thither to render to isaac the jew of york replied gurth the price of a suit of armour with which he fitted my master for this tournament  and how much didst thou pay to isaacmethinks to judge by weight there is still two hundred zecchins in this pouch  i paid to isaac said the saxon eighty zecchins and he restored me a hundred in lieu thereof  how what exclaimed all the robbers at once darest thou trifle with us that thou tellest such improbable lies  what i tell you said gurth is as true as the moon is in heaven you will find the just sum in a silken purse within the leathern pouch and separate from the rest of the gold  bethink thee man said the captain thou speakest of a jewof an israeliteas unapt to restore gold as the dry sand of his deserts to return the cup of water which the pilgrim spills upon them  there is no more mercy in them said another of the banditti than in an unbribed sheriffs officer  it is however as i say said gurth  strike a light instantly said the captain i will examine this said purse and if it be as this fellow says the jews bounty is little less miraculous than the stream which relieved his fathers in the wilderness  a light was procured accordingly and the robber proceeded to examine the purse the others crowded around him and even two who had hold of gurth relaxed their grasp while they stretched their necks to see the issue of the search availing himself of their negligence by a sudden exertion of strength and activity gurth shook himself free of their hold and might have escaped could he have resolved to leave his masters property behind him but such was no part of his intention he wrenched a quarterstaff from one of the fellows struck down the captain who was altogether unaware of his purpose and had wellnigh repossessed himself of the pouch and treasure the thieves however were too nimble for him and again secured both the bag and the trusty gurth  knave said the captain getting up thou hast broken my head and with other men of our sort thou wouldst fare the worse for thy insolence but thou shalt know thy fate instantly first let us speak of thy master the knights matters must go before the squires according to the due order of chivalry stand thou fast in the meantimeif thou stir again thou shalt have that will make thee quiet for thy lifecomrades he then said addressing his gang this purse is embroidered with hebrew characters and i well believe the yeomans tale is true the errant knight his master must needs pass us tollfree he is too like ourselves for us to make booty of him since dogs should not worry dogs where wolves and foxes are to be found in abundance  like us answered one of the gang i should like to hear how that is made good  why thou fool answered the captain is he not poor and disinherited as we aredoth he not win his substance at the swords point as we dohath he not beaten frontdeboeuf and malvoisin even as we would beat them if we could is he not the enemy to life and death of brian de boisguilbert whom we have so much reason to fear and were all this otherwise wouldst thou have us show a worse conscience than an unbeliever a hebrew jew  nay that were a shame muttered the other fellow and yet when i served in the band of stout old gandelyn we had no such scruples of conscience and this insolent peasanthe too i warrant me is to be dismissed scatheless  not if thou canst scathe him replied the captainhere fellow continued he addressing gurth canst thou use the staff that thou starts to it so readily  i think said gurth thou shouldst be best able to reply to that question  nay by my troth thou gavest me a round knock replied the captain do as much for this fellow and thou shalt pass scotfree and if thou dost notwhy by my faith as thou art such a sturdy knave i think i must pay thy ransom myselftake thy staff miller he added and keep thy head and do you others let the fellow go and give him a staffthere is light enough to lay on load by  the two champions being alike armed with quarterstaves stepped forward into the centre of the open space in order to have the full benefit of the moonlight the thieves in the meantime laughing and crying to their comrade miller beware thy tolldish the miller on the other hand holding his quarterstaff by the middle and making it flourish round his head after the fashion which the french call faire le moulinet exclaimed boastfully come on churl an thou darest thou shalt feel the strength of a millers thumb  if thou best a miller answered gurth undauntedly making his weapon play around his head with equal dexterity thou art doubly a thief and i as a true man bid thee defiance  so saying the two champions closed together and for a few minutes they displayed great equality in strength courage and skill intercepting and returning the blows of their adversary with the most rapid dexterity while from the continued clatter of their weapons a person at a distance might have supposed that there were at least six persons engaged on each side less obstinate and even less dangerous combats have been described in good heroic verse but that of gurth and the miller must remain unsung for want of a sacred poet to do justice to its eventful progress yet though quarterstaff play be out of date what we can in prose we will do for these bold champions  long they fought equally until the miller began to lose temper at finding himself so stoutly opposed and at hearing the laughter of his companions who as usual in such cases enjoyed his vexation this was not a state of mind favourable to the noble game of quarterstaff in which as in ordinary cudgelplaying the utmost coolness is requisite and it gave gurth whose temper was steady though surly the opportunity of acquiring a decided advantage in availing himself of which he displayed great mastery  the miller pressed furiously forward dealing blows with either end of his weapon alternately and striving to come to halfstaff distance while gurth defended himself against the attack keeping his hands about a yard asunder and covering himself by shifting his weapon with great celerity so as to protect his head and body thus did he maintain the defensive making his eye foot and hand keep true time until observing his antagonist to lose wind he darted the staff at his face with his left hand and as the miller endeavoured to parry the thrust he slid his right hand down to his left and with the full swing of the weapon struck his opponent on the left side of the head who instantly measured his length upon the green sward  well and yeomanly done shouted the robbers fair play and old england for ever the saxon hath saved both his purse and his hide and the miller has met his match  thou mayst go thy ways my friend said the captain addressing gurth in special confirmation of the general voice and i will cause two of my comrades to guide thee by the best way to thy masters pavilion and to guard thee from nightwalkers that might have less tender consciences than ours for there is many one of them upon the amble in such a night as this take heed however he added sternly remember thou hast refused to tell thy nameask not after ours nor endeavour to discover who or what we are for if thou makest such an attempt thou wilt come by worse fortune than has yet befallen thee  gurth thanked the captain for his courtesy and promised to attend to his recommendation two of the outlaws taking up their quarterstaves and desiring gurth to follow close in the rear walked roundly forward along a bypath which traversed the thicket and the broken ground adjacent to it on the very verge of the thicket two men spoke to his conductors and receiving an answer in a whisper withdrew into the wood and suffered them to pass unmolested this circumstance induced gurth to believe both that the gang was strong in numbers and that they kept regular guards around their place of rendezvous  when they arrived on the open heath where gurth might have had some trouble in finding his road the thieves guided him straight forward to the top of a little eminence whence he could see spread beneath him in the moonlight the palisades of the lists the glimmering pavilions pitched at either end with the pennons which adorned them fluttering in the moonbeams and from which could be heard the hum of the song with which the sentinels were beguiling their nightwatch  here the thieves stopt  we go with you no farther said they it were not safe that we should do soremember the warning you have receivedkeep secret what has this night befallen you and you will have no room to repent itneglect what is now told you and the tower of london shall not protect you against our revenge  good night to you kind sirs said gurth i shall remember your orders and trust that there is no offence in wishing you a safer and an honester trade  thus they parted the outlaws returning in the direction from whence they had come and gurth proceeding to the tent of his master to whom notwithstanding the injunction he had received he communicated the whole adventures of the evening  the disinherited knight was filled with astonishment no less at the generosity of rebecca by which however he resolved he would not profit than that of the robbers to whose profession such a quality seemed totally foreign his course of reflections upon these singular circumstances was however interrupted by the necessity for taking repose which the fatigue of the preceding day and the propriety of refreshing himself for the morrows encounter rendered alike indispensable  the knight therefore stretched himself for repose upon a rich couch with which the tent was provided and the faithful gurth extending his hardy limbs upon a bearskin which formed a sort of carpet to the pavilion laid himself across the opening of the tent so that no one could enter without awakening him     chapter xii       the heralds left their pricking up and down      now ringen trumpets loud and clarion      there is no more to say but east

with stern streames red      chaucer  morning arose in unclouded splendour and ere the sun was much above the horizon the idlest or the most eager of the spectators appeared on the common moving to the lists as to a general centre in order to secure a favourable situation for viewing the continuation of the expected games  the marshals and their attendants appeared next on the field together with the heralds for the purpose of receiving the names of the knights who intended to joust with the side which each chose to espouse this was a necessary precaution in order to secure equality betwixt the two bodies who should be opposed to each other  according to due formality the disinherited knight was to be considered as leader of the one body while brian de boisguilbert who had been rated as having done secondbest in the preceding day was named first champion of the other band those who had concurred in the challenge adhered to his party of course excepting only ralph de vipont whom his fall had rendered unfit so soon to put on his armour there was no want of distinguished and noble candidates to fill up the ranks on either side  in fact although the general tournament in which all knights fought at once was more dangerous than single encounters they were nevertheless more frequented and practised by the chivalry of the age many knights who had not sufficient confidence in their own skill to defy a single adversary of high reputation were nevertheless desirous of displaying their valour in the general combat where they might meet others with whom they were more upon an equality on the present occasion about fifty knights were inscribed as desirous of combating upon each side when the marshals declared that no more could be admitted to the disappointment of several who were too late in preferring their claim to be included  about the hour of ten oclock the whole plain was crowded with horsemen horsewomen and footpassengers hastening to the tournament and shortly after a grand flourish of trumpets announced prince john and his retinue attended by many of those knights who meant to take share in the game as well as others who had no such intention  about the same time arrived cedric the saxon with the lady rowena unattended however by athelstane this saxon lord had arrayed his tall and strong person in armour in order to take his place among the combatants and considerably to the surprise of cedric had chosen to enlist himself on the part of the knight templar the saxon indeed had remonstrated strongly with his friend upon the injudicious choice he had made of his party but he had only received that sort of answer usually given by those who are more obstinate in following their own course than strong in justifying it  his best if not his only reason for adhering to the party of brian de boisguilbert athelstane had the prudence to keep to himself though his apathy of disposition prevented his taking any means to recommend himself to the lady rowena he was nevertheless by no means insensible to her charms and considered his union with her as a matter already fixed beyond doubt by the assent of cedric and her other friends it had therefore been with smothered displeasure that the proud though indolent lord of coningsburgh beheld the victor of the preceding day select rowena as the object of that honour which it became his privilege to confer in order to punish him for a preference which seemed to interfere with his own suit athelstane confident of his strength and to whom his flatterers at least ascribed great skill in arms had determined not only to deprive the disinherited knight of his powerful succour but if an opportunity should occur to make him feel the weight of his battleaxe  de bracy and other knights attached to prince john in obedience to a hint from him had joined the party of the challengers john being desirous to secure if possible the victory to that side on the other hand many other knights both english and norman natives and strangers took part against the challengers the more readily that the opposite band was to be led by so distinguished a champion as the disinherited knight had approved himself  as soon as prince john observed that the destined queen of the day had arrived upon the field assuming that air of courtesy which sat well upon him when he was pleased to exhibit it he rode forward to meet her doffed his bonnet and alighting from his horse assisted the lady rowena from her saddle while his followers uncovered at the same time and one of the most distinguished dismounted to hold her palfrey  it is thus said prince john that we set the dutiful example of loyalty to the queen of love and beauty and are ourselves her guide to the throne which she must this day occupyladies he said attend your queen as you wish in your turn to be distinguished by like honours  so saying the prince marshalled rowena to the seat of honour opposite his own while the fairest and most distinguished ladies present crowded after her to obtain places as near as possible to their temporary sovereign  no sooner was rowena seated than a burst of music halfdrowned by the shouts of the multitude greeted her new dignity meantime the sun shone fierce and bright upon the polished arms of the knights of either side who crowded the opposite extremities of the lists and held eager conference together concerning the best mode of arranging their line of battle and supporting the conflict  the heralds then proclaimed silence until the laws of the tourney should be rehearsed these were calculated in some degree to abate the dangers of the day a precaution the more necessary as the conflict was to be maintained with sharp swords and pointed lances  the champions were therefore prohibited to thrust with the sword and were confined to striking a knight it was announced might use a mace or battleaxe at pleasure but the dagger was a prohibited weapon a knight unhorsed might renew the fight on foot with any other on the opposite side in the same predicament but mounted horsemen were in that case forbidden to assail him when any knight could force his antagonist to the extremity of the lists so as to touch the palisade with his person or arms such opponent was obliged to yield himself vanquished and his armour and horse were placed at the disposal of the conqueror a knight thus overcome was not permitted to take farther share in the combat if any combatant was struck down and unable to recover his feet his squire or page might enter the lists and drag his master out of the press but in that case the knight was adjudged vanquished and his arms and horse declared forfeited the combat was to cease as soon as prince john should throw down his leading staff or truncheon another precaution usually taken to prevent the unnecessary effusion of blood by the too long endurance of a sport so desperate any knight breaking the rules of the tournament or otherwise transgressing the rules of honourable chivalry was liable to be stript of his arms and having his shield reversed to be placed in that posture astride upon the bars of the palisade and exposed to public derision in punishment of his unknightly conduct having announced these precautions the heralds concluded with an exhortation to each good knight to do his duty and to merit favour from the queen of beauty and of love  this proclamation having been made the heralds withdrew to their stations the knights entering at either end of the lists in long procession arranged themselves in a double file precisely opposite to each other the leader of each party being in the centre of the foremost rank a post which he did not occupy until each had carefully marshalled the ranks of his party and stationed every one in his place  it was a goodly and at the same time an anxious sight to behold so many gallant champions mounted bravely and armed richly stand ready prepared for an encounter so formidable seated on their warsaddles like so many pillars of iron and awaiting the signal of encounter with the same ardour as their generous steeds which by neighing and pawing the ground gave signal of their impatience  as yet the knights held their long lances upright their bright points glancing to the sun and the streamers with which they were decorated fluttering over the plumage of the helmets thus they remained while the marshals of the field surveyed their ranks with the utmost exactness lest either party had more or fewer than the appointed number the tale was found exactly complete the marshals then withdrew from the lists and william de wyvil with a voice of thunder pronounced the signal wordslaissez aller the trumpets sounded as he spokethe spears of the champions were at once lowered and placed in the reststhe spurs were dashed into the flanks of the horses and the two foremost ranks of either party rushed upon each other in full gallop and met in the middle of the lists with a shock the sound of which was heard at a miles distance the rear rank of each party advanced at a slower pace to sustain the defeated and follow up the success of the victors of their party  the consequences of the encounter were not instantly seen for the dust raised by the trampling of so many steeds darkened the air and it was a minute ere the anxious spectator could see the fate of the encounter when the fight became visible half the knights on each side were dismounted some by the dexterity of their adversarys lancesome by the superior weight and strength of opponents which had borne down both horse and mansome lay stretched on earth as if never more to risesome had already gained their feet and were closing hand to hand with those of their antagonists who were in the same predicamentand several on both sides who had received wounds by which they were disabled were stopping their blood by their scarfs and endeavouring to extricate themselves from the tumult the mounted knights whose lances had been almost all broken by the fury of the encounter were now closely engaged with their swords shouting their warcries and exchanging buffets as if honour and life depended on the issue of the combat  the tumult was presently increased by the advance of the second rank on either side which acting as a reserve now rushed on to aid their companions the followers of brian de boisguilbert shoutedha beauseant beauseant 20  for the templefor the temple the opposite party shouted in answerdesdichado desdichadowhich watchword they took from the motto upon their leaders shield  the champions thus encountering each other with the utmost fury and with alternate success the tide of battle seemed to flow now toward the southern now toward the northern extremity of the lists as the one or the other party prevailed meantime the clang of the blows and the shouts of the combatants mixed fearfully with the sound of the trumpets and drowned the groans of those who fell and lay rolling defenceless beneath the feet of the horses the splendid armour of the combatants was now defaced with dust and blood and gave way at every stroke of the sword and battleaxe the gay plumage shorn from the crests drifted upon the breeze like snowflakes all that was beautiful and graceful in the martial array had disappeared and what was now visible was only calculated to awake terror or compassion  yet such is the force of habit that not only the vulgar spectators who are naturally attracted by sights of horror but even the ladies of distinction who crowded the galleries saw the conflict with a thrilling interest certainly but without a wish to withdraw their eyes from a sight so terrible here and there indeed a fair cheek might turn pale or a faint scream might be heard as a lover a brother or a husband was struck from his horse but in general the ladies around encouraged the combatants not only by clapping their hands and waving their veils and kerchiefs but even by exclaiming brave lance good sword when any successful thrust or blow took place under their observation  such being the interest taken by the fair sex in this bloody game that of the men is the more easily understood it showed itself in loud acclamations upon every change of fortune while all eyes were so riveted on the lists that the spectators seemed as if they themselves had dealt and received the blows which were there so freely bestowed and between every pause was heard the voice of the heralds exclaiming fight on brave knights man dies but glory livesfight ondeath is better than defeatfight on brave knightsfor bright eyes behold your deeds  amid the varied fortunes of the combat the eyes of all endeavoured to discover the leaders of each band who mingling in the thick of the fight encouraged their companions both by voice and example both displayed great feats of gallantry nor did either boisguilbert or the disinherited knight find in the ranks opposed to them a champion who could be termed their unquestioned match they repeatedly endeavoured to single out each other spurred by mutual animosity and aware that the fall of either leader might be considered as decisive of victory such however was the crowd and confusion that during the earlier part of the conflict their efforts to meet were unavailing and they were repeatedly separated by the eagerness of their followers each of whom was anxious to win honour by measuring his strength against the leader of the opposite party  but when the field became thin by the numbers on either side who had yielded themselves vanquished had been compelled to the extremity of the lists or been otherwise rendered incapable of continuing the strife the templar and the disinherited knight at length encountered hand to hand with all the fury that mortal animosity joined to rivalry of honour could inspire such was the address of each in parrying and striking that the spectators broke forth into a unanimous and involuntary shout expressive of their delight and admiration  but at this moment the party of the disinherited knight had the worst the gigantic arm of frontdeboeuf on the one flank and the ponderous strength of athelstane on the other bearing down and dispersing those immediately exposed to them finding themselves freed from their immediate antagonists it seems to have occurred to both these knights at the same instant that they would render the most decisive advantage to their party by aiding the templar in his contest with his rival turning their horses therefore at the same moment the norman spurred against the disinherited knight on the one side and the saxon on the other it was utterly impossible that the object of this unequal and unexpected assault could have sustained it had he not been warned by a general cry from the spectators who could not but take interest in one exposed to such disadvantage  beware beware sir disinherited was shouted so universally that the knight became aware of his danger and striking a full blow at the templar he reined back his steed in the same moment so as to escape the charge of athelstane and frontdeboeuf these knights therefore their aim being thus eluded rushed from opposite sides betwixt the object of their attack and the templar almost running their horses against each other ere they could stop their career recovering their horses however and wheeling them round the whole three pursued their united purpose of bearing to the earth the disinherited knight  nothing could have saved him except the remarkable strength and activity of the noble horse which he had won on the preceding day  this stood him in the more stead as the horse of boisguilbert was wounded and those of frontdeboeuf and athelstane were both tired with the weight of their gigantic masters clad in complete armour and with the preceding exertions of the day the masterly horsemanship of the disinherited knight and the activity of the noble animal which he mounted enabled him for a few minutes to keep at swords point his three antagonists turning and wheeling with the agility of a hawk upon the wing keeping his enemies as far separate as he could and rushing now against the one now against the other dealing sweeping blows with his sword without waiting to receive those which were aimed at him in return  but although the lists rang with the applauses of his dexterity it was evident that he must at last be overpowered and the nobles around prince john implored him with one voice to throw down his warder and to save so brave a knight from the disgrace of being overcome by odds  not i by the light of heaven answered prince john this same springald who conceals his name and despises our proffered hospitality hath already gained one prize and may now afford to let others have their turn as he spoke thus an unexpected incident changed the fortune of the day  there was among the ranks of the disinherited knight a champion in black armour mounted on a black horse large of size tall and to all appearance powerful and strong like the rider by whom he was mounted this knight who bore on his shield no device of any kind had hitherto evinced very little interest in the event of the fight beating off with seeming ease those combatants who attacked him but neither pursuing his advantages nor himself assailing any one in short he had hitherto acted the part rather of a spectator than of a party in the tournament a circumstance which procured him among the spectators the name of le noir faineant or the black sluggard  at once this knight seemed to throw aside his apathy when he discovered the leader of his party so hard bestead for setting spurs to his horse which was quite fresh he came to his assistance like a thunderbolt exclaiming in a voice like a trumpetcall desdichado to the rescue it was high time for while the disinherited knight was pressing upon the templar frontdeboeuf had got nigh to him with his uplifted sword but ere the blow could descend the sable knight dealt a stroke on his head which glancing from the polished helmet lighted with violence scarcely abated on the chamfron of the steed and frontdeboeuf rolled on the ground both horse and man equally stunned by the fury of the blow le noir faineant then turned his horse upon athelstane of coningsburgh and his own sword having been broken in his encounter with frontdeboeuf he wrenched from the hand of the bulky saxon the battleaxe which he wielded and like one familiar with the use of the weapon bestowed him such a blow upon the crest that athelstane also lay senseless on the field having achieved this double feat for which he was the more highly applauded that it was totally unexpected from him the knight seemed to resume the sluggishness of his character returning calmly to the northern extremity of the lists leaving his leader to cope as he best could with brian de boisguilbert this was no longer matter of so much difficulty as formerly the templars horse had bled much and gave way under the shock of the disinherited knights charge brian de boisguilbert rolled on the field encumbered with the stirrup from which he was unable to draw his foot his antagonist sprung from horseback waved his fatal sword over the head of his adversary and commanded him to yield himself when prince john more moved by the templars dangerous situation than he had been by that of his rival saved him the mortification of confessing himself vanquished by casting down his warder and putting an end to the conflict  it was indeed only the relics and embers of the fight which continued to burn for of the few knights who still continued in the lists the greater part had by tacit consent forborne the conflict for some time leaving it to be determined by the strife of the leaders  the squires who had found it a matter of danger and difficulty to attend their masters during the engagement now thronged into the lists to pay their dutiful attendance to the wounded who were removed with the utmost care and attention to the neighbouring pavilions or to the quarters prepared for them in the adjoining village  thus ended the memorable field of ashbydelazouche one of the most gallantly contested tournaments of that age for although only four knights including one who was smothered by the heat of his armour had died upon the field yet upwards of thirty were desperately wounded four or five of whom never recovered several more were disabled for life and those who escaped best carried the marks of the conflict to the grave with them hence it is always mentioned in the old records as the gentle and joyous passage of arms of ashby  it being now the duty of prince john to name the knight who had done best he determined that the honour of the day remained with the knight whom the popular voice had termed le noir faineant it was pointed out to the prince in impeachment of this decree that the victory had been in fact won by the disinherited knight who in the course of the day had overcome six champions with his own hand and who had finally unhorsed and struck down the leader of the opposite party but prince john adhered to his own opinion on the ground that the disinherited knight and his party had lost the day but for the powerful assistance of the knight of the black armour to whom therefore he persisted in awarding the prize  to the surprise of all present however the knight thus preferred was nowhere to be found he had left the lists immediately when the conflict ceased and had been observed by some spectators to move down one of the forest glades with the same slow pace and listless and indifferent manner which had procured him the epithet of the black sluggard after he had been summoned twice by sound of trumpet and proclamation of the heralds it became necessary to name another to receive the honours which had been assigned to him prince john had now no further excuse for resisting the claim of the disinherited knight whom therefore he named the champion of the day  through a field slippery with blood and encumbered with broken armour and the bodies of slain and wounded horses the marshals of the lists again conducted the victor to the foot of prince johns throne  disinherited knight said prince john since by that title only you will consent to be known to us we a second time award to you the honours of this tournament and announce to you your right to claim and receive from the hands of the queen of love and beauty the chaplet of honour which your valour has justly deserved the knight bowed low and gracefully but returned no answer  while the trumpets sounded while the heralds strained their voices in proclaiming honour to the brave and glory to the victorwhile ladies waved their silken kerchiefs and embroidered veils and while all ranks joined in a clamorous shout of exultation the marshals conducted the disinherited knight across the lists to the foot of that throne of honour which was occupied by the lady rowena  on the lower step of this throne the champion was made to kneel down indeed his whole action since the fight had ended seemed rather to have been upon the impulse of those around him than from his own free will and it was observed that he tottered as they guided him the second time across the lists rowena descending from her station with a graceful and dignified step was about to place the chaplet which she held in her hand upon the helmet of the champion when the marshals exclaimed with one voice it must not be thushis head must be bare the knight muttered faintly a few words which were lost in the hollow of his helmet but their purport seemed to be a desire that his casque might not be removed  whether from love of form or from curiosity the marshals paid no attention to his expressions of reluctance but unhelmed him by cutting the laces of his casque and undoing the fastening of his gorget when the helmet was removed the wellformed yet sunburnt features of a young man of twentyfive were seen amidst a profusion of short fair hair his countenance was as pale as death and marked in one or two places with streaks of blood  rowena had no sooner beheld him than she uttered a faint shriek but at once summoning up the energy of her disposition and compelling herself as it were to proceed while her frame yet trembled with the violence of sudden emotion she placed upon the drooping head of the victor the splendid chaplet which was the destined reward of the day and pronounced in a clear and distinct tone these words i bestow on thee this chaplet sir knight as the meed of valour assigned to this days victor here she paused a moment and then firmly added and upon brows more worthy could a wreath of chivalry never be placed  the knight stooped his head and kissed the hand of the lovely sovereign by whom his valour had been rewarded and then sinking yet farther forward lay prostrate at her feet  there was a general consternation cedric who had been struck mute by the sudden appearance of his banished son now rushed forward as if to separate him from rowena but this had been already accomplished by the marshals of the field who guessing the cause of ivanhoes swoon had hastened to undo his armour and found that the head of a lance had penetrated his breastplate and inflicted a wound in his side     chapter xiii       heroes approach atrides thus aloud      stand forth distinguishd from the circling crowd

waldemar fitzurse this gallant is likely to reclaim the castle and manor which richard assigned to him and which your highnesss generosity has since given to frontdeboeuf  frontdeboeuf replied john is

followers who are around me and ready to perform the usual military service in the room of those who have wandered to foreign countries and can neither render homage nor service when called upon  the audience were too much interested in the question not to pronounce the princes assumed right altogether indubitable a generous princea most noble lord who thus takes upon himself the task of rewarding his faithful followers  such were the words which burst from the train expectants all of them of similar grants at the expense of king richards followers and favourites if indeed they had not as yet received such prior aymer also assented to the general proposition observing however that the blessed jerusalem could not indeed be termed a foreign country she was communis materthe mother of all christians but he saw not he declared how the knight of ivanhoe could plead any advantage from this since he the prior was assured that the crusaders under richard had never proceeded much farther than askalon which as all the world knew was a town of the philistines and entitled to none of the privileges of the holy city  waldemar whose curiosity had led him towards the place where ivanhoe had fallen to the ground now returned the gallant said he is likely to give your highness little disturbance and to leave frontdeboeuf in the quiet possession of his gainshe is severely wounded  whatever becomes of him said prince john he is victor of the day and were he tenfold our enemy or the devoted friend of our brother which is perhaps the same his wounds must be looked toour own physician shall attend him  a stern smile curled the princes lip as he spoke waldemar fitzurse hastened to reply that ivanhoe was already removed from the lists and in the custody of his friends  i was somewhat afflicted he said to see the grief of the queen of love and beauty whose sovereignty of a day this event has changed into mourning i am not a man to be moved by a womans lament for her lover but this same lady rowena suppressed her sorrow with such dignity of manner that it could only be discovered by her folded hands and her tearless eye which trembled as it remained fixed on the lifeless form before her  who is this lady rowena said prince john of whom we have heard so much  a saxon heiress of large possessions replied the prior aymer a rose of loveliness and a jewel of wealth the fairest among a thousand a bundle of myrrh and a cluster of camphire  we shall cheer her sorrows said prince john and amend her blood by wedding her to a norman she seems a minor and must therefore be at our royal disposal in marriagehow sayst thou de bracy what thinkst thou of gaining fair lands and livings by wedding a saxon after the fashion of the followers of the conqueror  if the lands are to my liking my lord answered de bracy it will be hard to displease me with a bride and deeply will i hold myself bound to your highness for a good deed which will fulfil all promises made in favour of your servant and vassal  we will not forget it said prince john and that we may instantly go to work command our seneschal presently to order the attendance of the lady rowena and her companythat is the rude churl her guardian and the saxon ox whom the black knight struck down in the tournament upon this evenings banquetde bigot he added to his seneschal thou wilt word this our second summons so courteously as to gratify the pride of these saxons and make it impossible for them again to refuse although by the bones of becket courtesy to them is casting pearls before swine  prince john had proceeded thus far and was about to give the signal for retiring from the lists when a small billet was put into his hand  from whence said prince john looking at the person by whom it was delivered  from foreign parts my lord but from whence i know not replied his attendant a frenchman brought it hither who said he had ridden night and day to put it into the hands of your highness  the prince looked narrowly at the superscription and then at the seal placed so as to secure the flexsilk with which the billet was surrounded and which bore the impression of three fleursdelis john then opened the billet with apparent agitation which visibly and greatly increased when he had perused the contents which were expressed in these words  take heed to yourself for the devil is unchained  the prince turned as pale as death looked first on the earth and then up to heaven like a man who has received news that sentence of execution has been passed upon him recovering from the first effects of his surprise he took waldemar fitzurse and de bracy aside and put the billet into their hands successively it means he added in a faltering voice that my brother richard has obtained his freedom  this may be a false alarm or a forged letter said de bracy  it is frances own hand and seal replied prince john  it is time then said fitzurse to draw our party to a head either at york or some other centrical place a few days later and it will be indeed too late your highness must break short this present mummery  the yeomen and commons said de bracy must not be dismissed discontented for lack of their share in the sports  the day said waldemar is not yet very far spentlet the archers shoot a few rounds at the target and the prize be adjudged this will be an abundant fulfilment of the princes promises so far as this herd of saxon serfs is concerned  i thank thee waldemar said the prince thou remindest me too that i have a debt to pay to that insolent peasant who yesterday insulted our person our banquet also shall go forward tonight as we proposed were this my last hour of power it should be an hour sacred to revenge and to pleasurelet new cares come with tomorrows new day  the sound of the trumpets soon recalled those spectators who had already begun to leave the field and proclamation was made that prince john suddenly called by high and peremptory public duties held himself obliged to discontinue the entertainments of tomorrows festival nevertheless that unwilling so many good yeoman should depart without a trial of skill he was pleased to appoint them before leaving the ground presently to execute the competition of archery intended for the morrow to the best archer a prize was to be awarded being a buglehorn mounted with silver and a silken baldric richly ornamented with a medallion of st hubert the patron of silvan sport  more than thirty yeomen at first presented themselves as competitors several of whom were rangers and underkeepers in the royal forests of needwood and charnwood when however the archers understood with whom they were to be matched upwards of twenty withdrew themselves from the contest unwilling to encounter the dishonour of almost certain defeat for in those days the skill of each celebrated marksman was as well known for many miles round him as the qualities of a horse trained at newmarket are familiar to those who frequent that wellknown meeting  the diminished list of competitors for silvan fame still amounted to eight prince john stepped from his royal seat to view more nearly the persons of these chosen yeomen several of whom wore the royal livery having satisfied his curiosity by this investigation he looked for the object of his resentment whom he observed standing on the same spot and with the same composed countenance which he had exhibited upon the preceding day  fellow said prince john i guessed by thy insolent babble that thou wert no true lover of the longbow and i see thou darest not adventure thy skill among such merrymen as stand yonder  under favour sir replied the yeoman i have another reason for refraining to shoot besides the fearing discomfiture and disgrace  and what is thy other reason said prince john who for some cause which perhaps he could not himself have explained felt a painful curiosity respecting this individual  because replied the woodsman i know not if these yeomen and i are used to shoot at the same marks and because moreover i know not how your grace might relish the winning of a third prize by one who has unwittingly fallen under your displeasure  prince john coloured as he put the question what is thy name yeoman  locksley answered the yeoman  then locksley said prince john thou shalt shoot in thy turn when these yeomen have displayed their skill if thou carriest the prize i will add to it twenty nobles but if thou losest it thou shalt be stript of thy lincoln green and scourged out of the lists with bowstrings for a wordy and insolent braggart  and how if i refuse to shoot on such a wager said the yeomanyour graces power supported as it is by so many menatarms may indeed easily strip and scourge me but cannot compel me to bend or to draw my bow  if thou refusest my fair proffer said the prince the provost of the lists shall cut thy bowstring break thy bow and arrows and expel thee from the presence as a fainthearted craven  this is no fair chance you put on me proud prince said the yeoman to compel me to peril myself against the best archers of leicester and staffordshire under the penalty of infamy if they should overshoot me nevertheless i will obey your pleasure  look to him close menatarms said prince john his heart is sinking i am jealous lest he attempt to escape the trialand do you good fellows shoot boldly round a buck and a butt of wine are ready for your refreshment in yonder tent when the prize is won  a target was placed at the upper end of the southern avenue which led to the lists the contending archers took their station in turn at the bottom of the southern access the distance between that station and the mark allowing full distance for what was called a shot at rovers the archers having previously determined by lot their order of precedence were to shoot each three shafts in succession the sports were regulated by an officer of inferior rank termed the provost of the games for the high rank of the marshals of the lists would have been held degraded had they condescended to superintend the sports of the yeomanry  one by one the archers stepping forward delivered their shafts yeomanlike and bravely of twentyfour arrows shot in succession ten were fixed in the target and the others ranged so near it that considering the distance of the mark it was accounted good archery of the ten shafts which hit the target two within the inner ring were shot by hubert a forester in the service of malvoisin who was accordingly pronounced victorious  now locksley said prince john to the bold yeoman with a bitter smile wilt thou try conclusions with hubert or wilt thou yield up bow baldric and quiver to the provost of the sports  sith it be no better said locksley i am content to try my fortune on condition that when i have shot two shafts at yonder mark of huberts he shall be bound to shoot one at that which i shall propose  that is but fair answered prince john and it shall not be refused theeif thou dost beat this braggart hubert i will fill the bugle with silverpennies for thee  a man can do but his best answered hubert but my grandsire drew a good long bow at hastings and i trust not to dishonour his memory  the former target was now removed and a fresh one of the same size placed in its room hubert who as victor in the first trial of skill had the right to shoot first took his aim with great deliberation long measuring the distance with his eye while he held in his hand his bended bow with the arrow placed on the string at length he made a step forward and raising the bow at the full stretch of his left arm till the centre or graspingplace was nigh level with his face he drew his bowstring to his ear the arrow whistled through the air and lighted within the inner ring of the target but not exactly in the centre  you have not allowed for the wind hubert said his antagonist bending his bow or that had been a better shot  so saying and without showing the least anxiety to pause upon his aim locksley stept to the appointed station and shot his arrow as carelessly in appearance as if he had not even looked at the mark he was speaking almost at the instant that the shaft left the bowstring yet it alighted in the target two inches nearer to the white spot which marked the centre than that of hubert  by the light of heaven said prince john to hubert an thou suffer that runagate knave to overcome thee thou art worthy of the gallows  hubert had but one set speech for all occasions an your highness were to hang me he said a man can but do his best nevertheless my grandsire drew a good bow  the foul fiend on thy grandsire and all his generation interrupted john shoot knave and shoot thy best or it shall be the worse for thee  thus exhorted hubert resumed his place and not neglecting the caution which he had received from his adversary he made the necessary allowance for a very light air of wind which had just arisen and shot so successfully that his arrow alighted in the very centre of the target  a hubert a hubert shouted the populace more interested in a known person than in a stranger in the cloutin the clouta hubert for ever  thou canst not mend that shot locksley said the prince with an insulting smile  i will notch his shaft for him however replied locksley  and letting fly his arrow with a little more precaution than before it lighted right upon that of his competitor which it split to shivers the people who stood around were so astonished at his wonderful dexterity that they could not even give vent to their surprise in their usual clamour this must be the devil and no man of flesh and blood whispered the yeomen to each other such archery was never seen since a bow was first bent in britain  and now said locksley i will crave your graces permission to plant such a mark as is used in the north country and welcome every brave yeoman who shall try a shot at it to win a smile from the bonny lass he loves best  he then turned to leave the lists let your guards attend me he said if you pleasei go but to cut a rod from the next willowbush  prince john made a signal that some attendants should follow him in case of his escape but the cry of shame shame which burst from the multitude induced him to alter his ungenerous purpose  locksley returned almost instantly with a willow wand about six feet in length perfectly straight and rather thicker than a mans thumb he began to peel this with great composure observing at the same time that to ask a good woodsman to shoot at a target so broad as had hitherto been used was to put shame upon his skill for his own part he said and in the land where he was bred men would as soon take for their mark king arthurs roundtable which held sixty knights around it a child of seven years old he said might hit yonder target with a headless shaft but added he walking deliberately to the other end of the lists and sticking the willow wand upright in the ground he that hits that rod at fivescore yards i call him an archer fit to bear both bow and quiver before a king an it were the stout king richard himself  my grandsire said hubert drew a good bow at the battle of hastings and never shot at such a mark in his lifeand neither will i if this yeoman can cleave that rod i give him the bucklersor rather i yield to the devil that is in his jerkin and not to any human skill a man can but do his best and i will not shoot where i am sure to miss i might as well shoot at the edge of our parsons whittle or at a wheat straw or at a sunbeam as at a twinkling white streak which i can hardly see  cowardly dog said prince johnsirrah locksley do thou shoot but if thou hittest such a mark i will say thou art the first man ever did so however it be thou shalt not crow over us with a mere show of superior skill  i will do my best as hubert says answered locksley no man can do more  so saying he again bent his bow but on the present occasion looked with attention to his weapon and changed the string which he thought was no longer truly round having been a little frayed by the two former shots he then took his aim with some deliberation and the multitude awaited the event in breathless silence the archer vindicated their opinion of his skill his arrow split the willow rod against which it was aimed a jubilee of acclamations followed and even prince john in admiration of locksleys skill lost for an instant his dislike to his person these twenty nobles he said which with the bugle thou hast fairly won are thine own we will make them fifty if thou wilt take livery and service with us as a yeoman of our body guard and be near to our person for never did so strong a hand bend a bow or so true an eye direct a shaft  pardon me noble prince said locksley but i have vowed that if ever i take service it should be with your royal brother king richard these twenty nobles i leave to hubert who has this day drawn as brave a bow as his grandsire did at hastings had his modesty not refused the trial he would have hit the wand as well i  hubert shook his head as he received with reluctance the bounty of the stranger and locksley anxious to escape further observation mixed with the crowd and was seen no more  the victorious archer would not perhaps have escaped johns attention so easily had not that prince had other subjects of anxious and more important meditation pressing upon his mind at that instant he called upon his chamberlain as he gave the signal for retiring from the lists and commanded him instantly to gallop to ashby and seek out isaac the jew tell the dog he said to send me before sundown two thousand crowns he knows the security but thou mayst show him this ring for a token the rest of the money must be paid at york within six days if he neglects i will have the unbelieving villains head look that thou pass him not on the way for the circumcised slave was displaying his stolen finery amongst us  so saying the prince resumed his horse and returned to ashby the whole crowd breaking up and dispersing upon his retreat     chapter xiv       in rough magnificence arrayd      when ancient chivalry displayd      the pomp of her heroic games      and crested chiefs and tissued dames      assembled at the clarions call      in some proud castles high archd hall      warton  prince john held his high festival in the castle of ashby this was not the same building of which the stately ruins still interest the traveller and which was erected at a later period by the lord hastings high chamberlain of england one of the first victims of the tyranny of richard the third and yet better known as one of shakspeares characters than by his historical fame the castle and town of ashby at this time belonged to roger de quincy earl of winchester who during the period of our history was absent in the holy land prince john in the meanwhile occupied his castle and disposed of his domains without scruple and seeking at present to dazzle mens eyes by his hospitality and magnificence had given orders for great preparations in order to render the banquet as splendid as possible  the purveyors of the prince who exercised on this and other occasions the full authority of royalty had swept the country of all that could be collected which was esteemed fit for their masters table guests also were invited in great numbers and in the necessity in which he then found himself of courting popularity prince john had extended his invitation to a few distinguished saxon and danish families as well as to the norman nobility and gentry of the neighbourhood however despised and degraded on ordinary occasions the great numbers of the anglosaxons must necessarily render them formidable in the civil commotions which seemed approaching and it was an obvious point of policy to secure popularity with their leaders  it was accordingly the princes intention which he for some time maintained to treat these unwonted guests with a courtesy to which they had been little accustomed but although no man with less scruple made his ordinary habits and feelings bend to his interest it was the misfortune of this prince that his levity and petulance were perpetually breaking out and undoing all that had been gained by his previous dissimulation  of this fickle temper he gave a memorable example in ireland when sent thither by his father henry the second with the purpose of buying golden opinions of the inhabitants of that new and important acquisition to the english crown upon this occasion the irish chieftains contended which should first offer to the young prince their loyal homage and the kiss of peace but instead of receiving their salutations with courtesy john and his petulant attendants could not resist the temptation of pulling the long beards of the irish chieftains a conduct which as might have been expected was highly resented by these insulted dignitaries and produced fatal consequences to the english domination in ireland it is necessary to keep these inconsistencies of johns character in view that the reader may understand his conduct during the present evening  in execution of the resolution which he had formed during his cooler moments prince john received cedric and athelstane with distinguished courtesy and expressed his disappointment without resentment when the indisposition of rowena was alleged by the former as a reason for her not attending upon his gracious summons cedric and athelstane were both dressed in the ancient saxon garb which although not unhandsome in itself and in the present instance composed of costly materials was so remote in shape and appearance from that of the other guests that prince john took great credit to himself with waldemar fitzurse for refraining from laughter at a sight which the fashion of the day rendered ridiculous yet in the eye of sober judgment the short close tunic and long mantle of the saxons was a more graceful as well as a more convenient dress than the garb of the normans whose under garment was a long doublet so loose as to resemble a shirt or waggoners frock covered by a cloak of scanty dimensions neither fit to defend the wearer from cold or from rain and the only purpose of which appeared to be to display as much fur embroidery and jewellery work as the ingenuity of the tailor could contrive to lay upon it the emperor charlemagne in whose reign they were first introduced seems to have been very sensible of the inconveniences arising from the fashion of this garment in heavens name said he to what purpose serve these abridged cloaks if we are in bed they are no cover on horseback they are no protection from the wind and rain and when seated they do not guard our legs from the damp or the frost  nevertheless spite of this imperial objurgation the short cloaks continued in fashion down to the time of which we treat and particularly among the princes of the house of anjou they were therefore in universal use among prince johns courtiers and the long mantle which formed the upper garment of the saxons was held in proportional derision  the guests were seated at a table which groaned under the quantity of good cheer the numerous cooks who attended on the princes progress having exerted all their art in varying the forms in which the ordinary provisions were served up had succeeded almost as well as the modern professors of the culinary art in rendering them perfectly unlike their natural appearance besides these dishes of domestic origin there were various delicacies brought from foreign parts and a quantity of rich pastry as well as of the simnelbread and wastle cakes which were only used at the tables of the highest nobility the banquet was crowned with the richest wines both foreign and domestic  but though luxurious the norman nobles were not generally speaking an intemperate race while indulging themselves in the pleasures of the table they aimed at delicacy but avoided excess and were apt to attribute gluttony and drunkenness to the vanquished saxons as vices peculiar to their inferior station prince john indeed and those who courted his pleasure by imitating his foibles were apt to indulge to excess in the pleasures of the trencher and the goblet and indeed it is well known that his death was occasioned by a surfeit upon peaches and new ale his conduct however was an exception to the general manners of his countrymen  with sly gravity interrupted only by private signs to each other the norman knights and nobles beheld the ruder demeanour of athelstane and cedric at a banquet to the form and fashion of which they were unaccustomed and while their manners were thus the subject of sarcastic observation the untaught saxons unwittingly transgressed several of the arbitrary rules established for the regulation of society now it is well known that a man may with more impunity be guilty of an actual breach either of real good breeding or of good morals than appear ignorant of the most minute point of fashionable etiquette thus cedric who dried his hands with a towel instead of suffering the moisture to exhale by waving them gracefully in the air incurred more ridicule than his companion athelstane when he swallowed to his own single share the whole of a large pasty composed of the most exquisite foreign delicacies and termed at that time a karumpie when however it was discovered by a serious crossexamination that the thane of coningsburgh or franklin as the normans termed him had no idea what he had been devouring and that he had taken the contents of the karumpie for larks and pigeons whereas they were in fact beccaficoes and nightingales his ignorance brought him in for an ample share of the ridicule which would have been more justly bestowed on his gluttony  the long feast had at length its end and while the goblet circulated freely men talked of the feats of the preceding tournamentof the unknown victor in the archery games of the black knight whose selfdenial had induced him to withdraw from the honours he had wonand of the gallant ivanhoe who had so dearly bought the honours of the day the topics were treated with military frankness and the jest and laugh went round the hall the brow of prince john alone was overclouded during these discussions some overpowering care seemed agitating his mind and it was only when he received occasional hints from his attendants that he seemed to take interest in what was passing around him on such occasions he would start up quaff a cup of wine as if to raise his spirits and then mingle in the conversation by some observation made abruptly or at random  we drink this beaker said he to the health of wilfred of ivanhoe champion of this passage of arms and grieve that his wound renders him absent from our boardlet all fill to the pledge and especially cedric of rotherwood the worthy father of a son so promising  no my lord replied cedric standing up and placing on the table his untasted cup i yield not the name of son to the disobedient youth who at once despises my commands and relinquishes the manners and customs of his fathers  tis impossible cried prince john with wellfeigned astonishment that so gallant a knight should be an unworthy or disobedient son  yet my lord answered cedric so it is with this wilfred he left my homely dwelling to mingle with the gay nobility of your brothers court where he learned to do those tricks of horsemanship which you prize so highly he left it contrary to my wish and command and in the days of alfred that would have been termed disobedienceay and a crime severely punishable  alas replied prince john with a deep sigh of affected sympathy since your son was a follower of my unhappy brother it need not be enquired where or from whom he learned the lesson of filial disobedience  thus spake prince john wilfully forgetting that of all the sons of henry the second though no one was free from the charge he himself had been most distinguished for rebellion and ingratitude to his father  i think said he after a moments pause that my brother proposed to confer upon his favourite the rich manor of ivanhoe  he did endow him with it answered cedric nor is it my least quarrel with my son that he stooped to hold as a feudal vassal the very domains which his fathers possessed in free and independent right  we shall then have your willing sanction good cedric said prince john to confer this fief upon a person whose dignity will not be diminished by holding land of the british crownsir reginald frontdeboeuf he said turning towards that baron i trust you will so keep the goodly barony of ivanhoe that sir wilfred shall not incur his fathers farther displeasure by again entering upon that fief  by st anthony answered the blackbrowd giant i will consent that your highness shall hold me a saxon if either cedric or wilfred or the best that ever bore english blood shall wrench from me the gift with which your highness has graced me  whoever shall call thee saxon sir baron replied cedric offended at a mode of expression by which the normans frequently expressed their habitual contempt of the english will do thee an honour as great as it is undeserved  frontdeboeuf would have replied but prince johns petulance and levity got the start  assuredly said be my lords the noble cedric speaks truth and his race may claim precedence over us as much in the length of their pedigrees as in the longitude of their cloaks  they go before us indeed in the fieldas deer before dogs said malvoisin  and with good right may they go before usforget not said the prior aymer the superior decency and decorum of their manners  their singular abstemiousness and temperance said de bracy forgetting the plan which promised him a saxon bride  together with the courage and conduct said brian de boisguilbert by which they distinguished themselves at hastings and elsewhere  while with smooth and smiling cheek the courtiers each in turn followed their princes example and aimed a shaft of ridicule at cedric the face of the saxon became inflamed with passion and he glanced his eyes fiercely from one to another as if the quick succession of so many injuries had prevented his replying to them in turn or like a baited bull who surrounded by his tormentors is at a loss to choose from among them the immediate object of his revenge at length he spoke in a voice half choked with passion and addressing himself to prince john as the head and front of the offence which he had received whatever he said have been the follies and vices of our race a saxon would have been held nidering 21 the most emphatic term for abject worthlessness who should in his own hall and while his own winecup passed have treated or suffered to be treated an unoffending guest as your highness has this day beheld me used and whatever was the misfortune of our fathers on the field of hastings those may at least be silent here he looked at frontdeboeuf and the templar who have within these few hours once and again lost saddle and stirrup before the lance of a saxon  by my faith a biting jest said prince john how like you it sirsour saxon subjects rise in spirit and courage become shrewd in wit and bold in bearing in these unsettled timeswhat say ye my lordsby this good light i hold it best to take our galleys and return to normandy in time  for fear of the saxons said de bracy laughing we should need no weapon but our hunting spears to bring these boars to bay  a truce with your raillery sir knights said fitzurseand it were well he added addressing the prince that your highness should assure the worthy cedric there is no insult intended him by jests which must sound but harshly in the ear of a stranger  insult answered prince john resuming his courtesy of demeanour i trust it will not be thought that i could mean or permit any to be offered in my presence here i fill my cup to cedric himself since he refuses to pledge his sons health  the cup went round amid the welldissembled applause of the courtiers which however failed to make the impression on the mind of the saxon that had been designed he was not naturally acute of perception but those too much undervalued his understanding who deemed that this flattering compliment would obliterate the sense of the prior insult he was silent however when the royal pledge again passed round to sir athelstane of coningsburgh  the knight made his obeisance and showed his sense of the honour by draining a huge goblet in answer to it  and now sirs said prince john who began to be warmed with the wine which he had drank having done justice to our saxon guests we will pray of them some requital to our courtesyworthy thane he continued addressing cedric may we pray you to name to us some norman whose mention may least sully your mouth and to wash down with a goblet of wine all bitterness which the sound may leave behind it  fitzurse arose while prince john spoke and gliding behind the seat of the saxon whispered to him not to omit the opportunity of putting an end to unkindness betwixt the two races by naming prince john the saxon replied not to this politic insinuation but rising up and filling his cup to the brim he addressed prince john in these words your highness has required that i should name a norman deserving to be remembered at our banquet this perchance is a hard task since it calls on the slave to sing the praises of the masterupon the vanquished while pressed by all the evils of conquest to sing the praises of the conqueror yet i will name a normanthe first in arms and in placethe best and the noblest of his race and the lips that shall refuse to pledge me to his wellearned fame i term false and dishonoured and will so maintain them with my lifei quaff this goblet to the health of richard the lionhearted  prince john who had expected that his own name would have closed the saxons speech started when that of his injured brother was so unexpectedly introduced he raised mechanically the winecup to his lips then instantly set it down to view the demeanour of the company at this unexpected proposal which many of them felt it as unsafe to oppose as to comply with some of them ancient and experienced courtiers closely imitated the example of the prince himself raising the goblet to their lips and again replacing it before them there were many who with a more generous feeling exclaimed long live king richard and may he be speedily restored to us and some few among whom were frontdeboeuf and the templar in sullen disdain suffered their goblets to stand untasted before them but no man ventured directly to gainsay a pledge filled to the health of the reigning monarch  having enjoyed his triumph for about a minute cedric said to his companion up noble athelstane we have remained here long enough since we have requited the hospitable courtesy of prince johns banquet those who wish to know further of our rude saxon manners must henceforth seek us in the homes of our fathers since we have seen enough of royal banquets and enough of norman courtesy  so saying he arose and left the banqueting room followed by athelstane and by several other guests who partaking of the saxon lineage held themselves insulted by the sarcasms of prince john and his courtiers  by the bones of st thomas said prince john as they retreated the saxon churls have borne off the best of the day and have retreated with triumph  conclamatum est poculatum est said prior aymer we have drunk and we have shoutedit were time we left our wine flagons  the monk hath some fair penitent to shrive tonight that he is in such a hurry to depart said de bracy  not so sir knight replied the abbot but i must move several miles forward this evening upon my homeward journey  they are breaking up said the prince in a whisper to fitzurse their fears anticipate the event and this coward prior is the first to shrink from me  fear not my lord said waldemar i will show him such reasons as shall induce him to join us when we hold our meeting at yorksir prior he said i must speak with you in private before you mount your palfrey  the other guests were now fast dispersing with the exception of those immediately attached to prince johns faction and his retinue  this then is the result of your advice said the prince turning an angry countenance upon fitzurse that i should be bearded at my own board by a drunken saxon churl and that on the mere sound of my brothers name men should fall off from me as if i had the leprosy  have patience sir replied his counsellor i might retort your accusation and blame the inconsiderate levity which foiled my design and misled your own better judgment but this is no time for recrimination de bracy and i will instantly go among these shuffling cowards and convince them they have gone too far to recede  it will be in vain said prince john pacing the apartment with disordered steps and expressing himself with an agitation to which the wine he had drank partly contributedit will be in vainthey have seen the handwriting on the wallthey have marked the paw of the lion in the sandthey have heard his approaching roar shake the woodnothing will reanimate their courage  would to god said fitzurse to de bracy that aught could reanimate his own his brothers very name is an ague to him unhappy are the counsellors of a prince who wants fortitude and perseverance alike in good and in evil     chapter xv       and yet he thinksha ha ha hahe thinks      i am the tool and servant of his will      well let it be through all the maze of trouble      his plots and base oppression must create      ill shape myself a way to higher things      and who will say tis wrong      basil a tragedy  no spider ever took more pains to repair the shattered meshes of his web than did waldemar fitzurse to reunite and combine the scattered members of prince johns cabal few of these were attached to him from inclination and none from personal regard it was therefore necessary that fitzurse should open to them new prospects of advantage and remind them of those which they at present enjoyed to the young and wild nobles he held out the prospect of unpunished license and uncontrolled revelry to the ambitious that of power and to the covetous that of increased wealth and extended domains the leaders of the mercenaries received a donation in gold an argument the most persuasive to their minds and without which all others would have proved in vain promises were still more liberally distributed than money by this active agent and in fine nothing was left undone that could determine the wavering or animate the disheartened the return of king richard he spoke of as an event altogether beyond the reach of probability yet when he observed from the doubtful looks and uncertain answers which he received that this was the apprehension by which the minds of his accomplices were most haunted he boldly treated that event should it really take place as one which ought not to alter their political calculations  if richard returns said fitzurse he returns to enrich his needy and impoverished crusaders at the expense of those who did not follow him to the holy land he returns to call to a fearful reckoning those who during his absence have done aught that can be construed offence or encroachment upon either the laws of the land or the privileges of the crown he returns to avenge upon the orders of the temple and the hospital the preference which they showed to philip of france during the wars in the holy land he returns in fine to punish as a rebel every adherent of his brother prince john are ye afraid of his power continued the artful confident of that prince we acknowledge him a strong and valiant knight but these are not the days of king arthur when a champion could encounter an army if richard indeed comes back it must be aloneunfollowedunfriended the bones of his gallant army have whitened the sands of palestine the few of his followers who have returned have straggled hither like this wilfred of ivanhoe beggared and broken menand what talk ye of richards right of birth he proceeded in answer to those who objected scruples on that head is richards title of primogeniture more decidedly certain than that of duke robert of normandy the conquerors eldest son and yet william the red and henry his second and third brothers were successively preferred to him by the voice of the nation robert had every merit which can be pleaded for richard he was a bold knight a good leader generous to his friends and to the church and to crown the whole a crusader and a conqueror of the holy sepulchre and yet he died a blind and miserable prisoner in the castle of cardiff because he opposed himself to the will of the people who chose that he should not rule over them it is our right he said to choose from the blood royal the prince who is best qualified to hold the supreme powerthat is said he correcting himself him whose election will best promote the interests of the nobility in personal qualifications he added it was possible that prince john might be inferior to his brother richard but when it was considered that the latter returned with the sword of vengeance in his hand while the former held out rewards immunities privileges wealth and honours it could not be doubted which was the king whom in wisdom the nobility were called on to support  these and many more arguments some adapted to the peculiar circumstances of those whom he addressed had the expected weight with the nobles of prince johns faction most of them consented to attend the proposed meeting at york for the purpose of making general arrangements for placing the crown upon the head of prince john  it was late at night when worn out and exhausted with his various exertions however gratified with the result fitzurse returning to the castle of ashby met with de bracy who had exchanged his banqueting garments for a short green kirtle with hose of the same cloth and colour a leathern cap or headpiece a short sword a horn slung over his shoulder a long bow in his hand and a bundle of arrows stuck in his belt had fitzurse met this figure in an outer apartment he would have passed him without notice as one of the yeomen of the guard but finding him in the inner hall he looked at him with more attention and recognised the norman knight in the dress of an english yeoman  what mummery is this de bracy said fitzurse somewhat angrily is this a time for christmas gambols and quaint maskings when the fate of our master prince john is on the very verge of decision why hast thou not been like me among these heartless cravens whom the very name of king richard terrifies as it is said to do the children of the saracens  i have been attending to mine own business answered de bracy calmly as you fitzurse have been minding yours  i minding mine own business echoed waldemar i have been engaged in that of prince john our joint patron  as if thou hadst any other reason for that waldemar said de bracy than the promotion of thine own individual interest come fitzurse we know each otherambition is thy pursuit pleasure is mine and they become our different ages of prince john thou thinkest as i do that he is too weak to be a determined monarch too tyrannical to be an easy monarch too insolent and presumptuous to be a popular monarch and too fickle and timid to be long a monarch of any kind but he is a monarch by whom fitzurse and de bracy hope to rise and thrive and therefore you aid him with your policy and i with the lances of my free companions  a hopeful auxiliary said fitzurse impatiently playing the fool in the very moment of utter necessitywhat on earth dost thou purpose by this absurd disguise at a moment so urgent  to get me a wife answered de bracy coolly after the manner of the tribe of benjamin  the tribe of benjamin said fitzurse i comprehend thee not  wert thou not in presence yestereven said de bracy when we heard the prior aymer tell us a tale in reply to the romance which was sung by the minstrelhe told how long since in palestine a deadly feud arose between the tribe of benjamin and the rest of the israelitish nation and how they cut to pieces wellnigh all the chivalry of that tribe and how they swore by our blessed lady that they would not permit those who remained to marry in their lineage and how they became grieved for their vow and sent to consult his holiness the pope how they might be absolved from it and how by the advice of the holy father the youth of the tribe of benjamin carried off from a superb tournament all the ladies who were there present and thus won them wives without the consent either of their brides or their brides families  i have heard the story said fitzurse though either the prior or thou has made some singular alterations in date and circumstances  i tell thee said de bracy that i mean to purvey me a wife after the fashion of the tribe of benjamin which is as much as to say that in this same equipment i will fall upon that herd of saxon bullocks who have this night left the castle and carry off from them the lovely rowena  art thou mad de bracy said fitzurse bethink thee that though the men be saxons they are rich and powerful and regarded with the more respect by their countrymen that wealth and honour are but the lot of few of saxon descent  and should belong to none said de bracy the work of the conquest should be completed  this is no time for it at least said fitzurse the approaching crisis renders the favour of the multitude indispensable and prince john cannot refuse justice to any one who injures their favourites  let him grant it if he dare said de bracy he will soon see the difference betwixt the support of such a lusty lot of spears as mine and that of a heartless mob of saxon churls yet i mean no immediate discovery of myself seem i not in this garb as bold a forester as ever blew horn the blame of the violence shall rest with the outlaws of the yorkshire forests i have sure spies on the saxons motionstonight they sleep in the convent of saint wittol or withold or whatever they call that churl of a saxon saint at burtonontrent next days march brings them within our reach and falconways we swoop on them at once presently after i will appear in mine own shape play the courteous knight rescue the unfortunate and afflicted fair one from the hands of the rude ravishers conduct her to frontdeboeufs castle or to normandy if it should be necessary and produce her not again to her kindred until she be the bride and dame of maurice de bracy  a marvellously sage plan said fitzurse and as i think not entirely of thine own devicecome be frank de bracy who aided thee in the invention and who is to assist in the execution for as i think thine own band lies as far off as york  marry if thou must needs know said de bracy it was the templar brian de boisguilbert that shaped out the enterprise which the adventure of the men of benjamin suggested to me he is to aid me in the onslaught and he and his followers will personate the outlaws from whom my valorous arm is after changing my garb to rescue the lady  by my halidome said fitzurse the plan was worthy of your united wisdom and thy prudence de bracy is most especially manifested in the project of leaving the lady in the hands of thy worthy confederate thou mayst i think succeed in taking her from her saxon friends but how thou wilt rescue her afterwards from the clutches of boisguilbert seems considerably more doubtfulhe is a falcon well accustomed to pounce on a partridge and to hold his prey fast  he is a templar said de bracy and cannot therefore rival me in my plan of wedding this heiressand to attempt aught dishonourable against the intended bride of de bracyby heaven were he a whole chapter of his order in his single person he dared not do me such an injury  then since nought that i can say said fitzurse will put this folly from thy imagination for well i know the obstinacy of thy disposition at least waste as little time as possiblelet not thy folly be lasting as well as untimely  i tell thee answered de bracy that it will be the work of a few hours and i shall be at yorkat the head of my daring and valorous fellows as ready to support any bold design as thy policy can be to form onebut i hear my comrades assembling and the steeds stamping and neighing in the outer courtfarewelli go like a true knight to win the smiles of beauty  like a true knight repeated fitzurse looking after him like a fool i should say or like a child who will leave the most serious and needful occupation to chase the down of the thistle that drives past himbut it is with such tools that i must workand for whose advantagefor that of a prince as unwise as he is profligate and as likely to be an ungrateful master as he has already proved a rebellious son and an unnatural brotherbut hehe too is but one of the tools with which i labour and proud as he is should he presume to separate his interest from mine this is a secret which he shall soon learn  the meditations of the statesman were here interrupted by the voice of the prince from an interior apartment calling out noble waldemar fitzurse and with bonnet doffed the future chancellor for to such high preferment did the wily norman aspire hastened to receive the orders of the future sovereign     chapter xvi       far in a wild unknown to public view      from youth to age a reverend hermit grew      the moss his bed the cave his humble cell      his food the fruits his drink the crystal well      remote from man with god he passd his days      prayer all his businessall his pleasure praise      parnell  the reader cannot have forgotten that the event of the tournament was decided by the exertions of an unknown knight whom on account of the passive and indifferent conduct which he had manifested on the former part of the day the spectators had entitled le noir faineant this knight had left the field abruptly when the victory was achieved and when he was called upon to receive the reward of his valour he was nowhere to be found in the meantime while summoned by heralds and by trumpets the knight was holding his course northward avoiding all frequented paths and taking the shortest road through the woodlands he paused for the night at a small hostelry lying out of the ordinary route where however he obtained from a wandering minstrel news of the event of the tourney  on the next morning the knight departed early with the intention of making a long journey the condition of his horse which he had carefully spared during the preceding morning being such as enabled him to travel far without the necessity of much repose yet his purpose was baffled by the devious paths through which he rode so that when evening closed upon him he only found himself on the frontiers of the west riding of yorkshire by this time both horse and man required refreshment and it became necessary moreover to look out for some place in which they might spend the night which was now fast approaching  the place where the traveller found himself seemed unpropitious for obtaining either shelter or refreshment and he was likely to be reduced to the usual expedient of knightserrant who on such occasions turned their horses to graze and laid themselves down to meditate on their ladymistress with an oaktree for a canopy but the black knight either had no mistress to meditate upon or being as indifferent in love as he seemed to be in war was not sufficiently occupied by passionate reflections upon her beauty and cruelty to be able to parry the effects of fatigue and hunger and suffer love to act as a substitute for the solid comforts of a bed and supper he felt dissatisfied therefore when looking around he found himself deeply involved in woods through which indeed there were many open glades and some paths but such as seemed only formed by the numerous herds of cattle which grazed in the forest or by the animals of chase and the hunters who made prey of them  the sun by which the knight had chiefly directed his course had now sunk behind the derbyshire hills on his left and every effort which he might make to pursue his journey was as likely to lead him out of his road as to advance him on his route after having in vain endeavoured to select the most beaten path in hopes it might lead to the cottage of some herdsman or the silvan lodge of a forester and having repeatedly found himself totally unable to determine on a choice the knight resolved to trust to the sagacity of his horse experience having on former occasions made him acquainted with the wonderful talent possessed by these animals for extricating themselves and their riders on such emergencies  the good steed grievously fatigued with so long a days journey under a rider cased in mail had no sooner found by the slackened reins that he was abandoned to his own guidance than he seemed to assume new strength and spirit and whereas formerly he had scarce replied to the spur otherwise than by a groan he now as if proud of the confidence reposed in him pricked up his ears and assumed of his own accord a more lively motion the path which the animal adopted rather turned off from the course pursued by the knight during the day but as the horse seemed confident in his choice the rider abandoned himself to his discretion  he was justified by the event for the footpath soon after appeared a little wider and more worn and the tinkle of a small bell gave the knight to understand that he was in the vicinity of some chapel or hermitage  accordingly he soon reached an open plat of turf on the opposite side of which a rock rising abruptly from a gently sloping plain offered its grey and weatherbeaten front to the traveller ivy mantled its sides in some places and in others oaks and holly bushes whose roots found nourishment in the cliffs of the crag waved over the precipices below like the plumage of the warrior over his steel helmet giving grace to that whose chief expression was terror at the bottom of the rock and leaning as it were against it was constructed a rude hut built chiefly of the trunks of trees felled in the neighbouring forest and secured against the weather by having its crevices stuffed with moss mingled with clay the stem of a young firtree lopped of its branches with a piece of wood tied across near the top was planted upright by the door as a rude emblem of the holy cross at a little distance on the right hand a fountain of the purest water trickled out of the rock and was received in a hollow stone which labour had formed into a rustic basin escaping from thence the stream murmured down the descent by a channel which its course had long worn and so wandered through the little plain to lose itself in the neighbouring wood  beside this fountain were the ruins of a very small chapel of which the roof had partly fallen in the building when entire had never been above sixteen feet long by twelve feet in breadth and the roof low in proportion rested upon four concentric arches which sprung from the four corners of the building each supported upon a short and heavy pillar the ribs of two of these arches remained though the roof had fallen down betwixt them over the others it remained entire the entrance to this ancient place of devotion was under a very low round arch ornamented by several courses of that zigzag moulding resembling sharks teeth which appears so often in the more ancient saxon architecture a belfry rose above the porch on four small pillars within which hung the green and weatherbeaten bell the feeble sounds of which had been some time before heard by the black knight  the whole peaceful and quiet scene lay glimmering in twilight before the eyes of the traveller giving him good assurance of lodging for the night since it was a special duty of those hermits who dwelt in the woods to exercise hospitality towards benighted or bewildered passengers  accordingly the knight took no time to consider minutely the particulars which we have detailed but thanking saint julian the patron of travellers who had sent him good harbourage he leaped from his horse and assailed the door of the hermitage with the butt of his lance in order to arouse attention and gain admittance  it was some time before he obtained any answer and the reply when made was unpropitious  pass on whosoever thou art was the answer given by a deep hoarse voice from within the hut and disturb not the servant of god and st dunstan in his evening devotions  worthy father answered the knight here is a poor wanderer bewildered in these woods who gives thee the opportunity of exercising thy charity and hospitality  good brother replied the inhabitant of the hermitage it has pleased our lady and st dunstan to destine me for the object of those virtues instead of the exercise thereof i have no provisions here which even a dog would share with me and a horse of any tenderness of nurture would despise my couchpass therefore on thy way and god speed thee  but how replied the knight is it possible for me to find my way through such a wood as this when darkness is coming on i pray you reverend father as you are a christian to undo your door and at least point out to me my road  and i pray you good christian brother replied the anchorite to disturb me no more you have already interrupted one pater two aves and a credo which i miserable sinner that i am should according to my vow have said before moonrise  the roadthe road vociferated the knight give me directions for the road if i am to expect no more from thee  the road replied the hermit is easy to hit the path from the wood leads to a morass and from thence to a ford which as the rains have abated may now be passable when thou hast crossed the ford thou wilt take care of thy footing up the left bank as it is somewhat precipitous and the path which hangs over the river has lately as i learn for i seldom leave the duties of my chapel given way in sundry places thou wilt then keep straight forward  a broken patha precipicea ford and a morass said the knight interrupting himsir hermit if you were the holiest that ever wore beard or told bead you shall scarce prevail on me to hold this road tonight i tell thee that thou who livest by the charity of the countryill deserved as i doubt it ishast no right to refuse shelter to the wayfarer when in distress either open the door quickly or by the rood i will beat it down and make entry for myself  friend wayfarer replied the hermit be not importunate if thou puttest me to use the carnal weapon in mine own defence it will be een the worse for you  at this moment a distant noise of barking and growling which the traveller had for some time heard became extremely loud and furious and made the knight suppose that the hermit alarmed by his threat of making forcible entry had called the dogs who made this clamour to aid him in his defence out of some inner recess in which they had been kennelled incensed at this preparation on the hermits part for making good his inhospitable purpose the knight struck the door so furiously with his foot that posts as well as staples shook with violence  the anchorite not caring again to expose his door to a similar shock now called out aloud patience patiencespare thy strength good traveller and i will presently undo the door though it may be my doing so will be little to thy pleasure  the door accordingly was opened and the hermit a large strongbuilt man in his sackcloth gown and hood girt with a rope of rushes stood before the knight he had in one hand a lighted torch or link and in the other a baton of crabtree so thick and heavy that it might well be termed a club two large shaggy dogs half greyhound half mastiff stood ready to rush upon the traveller as soon as the door should be opened but when the torch glanced upon the lofty crest and golden spurs of the knight who stood without the hermit altering probably his original intentions repressed the rage of his auxiliaries and changing his tone to a sort of churlish courtesy invited the knight to enter his hut making excuse for his unwillingness to open his lodge after sunset by alleging the multitude of robbers and outlaws who were abroad and who gave no honour to our lady or st dunstan nor to those holy men who spent life in their service  the poverty of your cell good father said the knight looking around him and seeing nothing but a bed of leaves a crucifix rudely carved in oak a missal with a roughhewn table and two stools and one or two clumsy articles of furniturethe poverty of your cell should seem a sufficient defence against any risk of thieves not to mention the aid of two trusty dogs large and strong enough i think to pull down a stag and of course to match with most men  the good keeper of the forest said the hermit hath allowed me the use of these animals to protect my solitude until the times shall mend  having said this he fixed his torch in a twisted branch of iron which served for a candlestick and placing the oaken trivet before the embers of the fire which he refreshed with some dry wood he placed a stool upon one side of the table and beckoned to the knight to do the same upon the other  they sat down and gazed with great gravity at each other each thinking in his heart that he had seldom seen a stronger or more athletic figure than was placed opposite to him  reverend hermit said the knight after looking long and fixedly at his host were it not to interrupt your devout meditations i would pray to know three things of your holiness first where i am to put my horsesecondly what i can have for supperthirdly where i am to take up my couch for the night  i will reply to you said the hermit with my finger it being against my rule to speak by words where signs can answer the purpose so saying he pointed successively to two corners of the hut your stable said he is thereyour bed there and reaching down a platter with two handfuls of parched pease upon it from the neighbouring shelf and placing it upon the table he added your supper is here  the knight shrugged his shoulders and leaving the hut brought in his horse which in the interim he had fastened to a tree unsaddled him with much attention and spread upon the steeds weary back his own mantle  the hermit was apparently somewhat moved to compassion by the anxiety as well as address which the stranger displayed in tending his horse for muttering something about provender left for the keepers palfrey he dragged out of a recess a bundle of forage which he spread before the knights charger and immediately afterwards shook down a quantity of dried fern in the corner which he had assigned for the riders couch the knight returned him thanks for his courtesy and this duty done both resumed their seats by the table whereon stood the trencher of pease placed between them the hermit after a long grace which had once been latin but of which original language few traces remained excepting here and there the long rolling termination of some word or phrase set example to his guest by modestly putting into a very large mouth furnished with teeth which might have ranked with those of a boar both in sharpness and whiteness some three or four dried pease a miserable grist as it seemed for so large and able a mill  the knight in order to follow so laudable an example laid aside his helmet his corslet and the greater part of his armour and showed to the hermit a head thickcurled with yellow hair high features blue eyes remarkably bright and sparkling a mouth well formed having an upper lip clothed with mustachoes darker than his hair and bearing altogether the look of a bold daring and enterprising man with which his strong form well corresponded  the hermit as if wishing to answer to the confidence of his guest threw back his cowl and showed a round bullet head belonging to a man in the prime of life his closeshaven crown surrounded by a circle of stiff curled black hair had something the appearance of a parish pinfold begirt by its high hedge the features expressed nothing of monastic austerity or of ascetic privations on the contrary it was a bold bluff countenance with broad black eyebrows a wellturned forehead and cheeks as round and vermilion as those of a trumpeter from which descended a long and curly black beard such a visage joined to the brawny form of the holy man spoke rather of sirloins and haunches than of pease and pulse this incongruity did not escape the guest after he had with great difficulty accomplished the mastication of a mouthful of the dried pease he found it absolutely necessary to request his pious entertainer to furnish him with some liquor who replied to his request by placing before him a large can of the purest water from the fountain  it is from the well of st dunstan said he in which betwixt sun and sun he baptized five hundred heathen danes and britonsblessed be his name and applying his black beard to the pitcher he took a draught much more moderate in quantity than his encomium seemed to warrant  it seems to me reverend father said the knight that the small morsels which you eat together with this holy but somewhat thin beverage have thriven with you marvellously you appear a man more fit to win the ram at a wrestling match or the ring at a bout at quarterstaff or the bucklers at a swordplay than to linger out your time in this desolate wilderness saying masses and living upon parched pease and cold water  sir knight answered the hermit your thoughts like those of the ignorant laity are according to the flesh it has pleased our lady and my patron saint to bless the pittance to which i restrain myself even as the pulse and water was blessed to the children shadrach meshech and abednego who drank the same rather than defile themselves with the wine and meats which were appointed them by the king of the saracens  holy father said the knight upon whose countenance it hath pleased heaven to work such a miracle permit a sinful layman to crave thy name  thou mayst call me answered the hermit the clerk of copmanhurst for so i am termed in these partsthey add it is true the epithet holy but i stand not upon that as being unworthy of such additionand now valiant knight may i pray ye for the name of my honourable guest  truly said the knight holy clerk of copmanhurst men call me in these parts the black knightmany sir add to it the epithet of sluggard whereby i am no way ambitious to be distinguished  the hermit could scarcely forbear from smiling at his guests reply  i see said he sir sluggish knight that thou art a man of prudence and of counsel and moreover i see that my poor monastic fare likes thee not accustomed perhaps as thou hast been to the license of courts and of camps and the luxuries of cities and now i bethink me sir sluggard that when the charitable keeper of this forestwalk left those dogs for my protection and also those bundles of forage he left me also some food which being unfit for my use the very recollection of it had escaped me amid my more weighty meditations  i dare be sworn he did so said the knight i was convinced that there was better food in the cell holy clerk since you first doffed your cowlyour keeper is ever a jovial fellow and none who beheld thy grinders contending with these pease and thy throat flooded with this ungenial element could see thee doomed to such horseprovender and horsebeverage pointing to the provisions upon the table and refrain from mending thy cheer let us see the keepers bounty therefore without delay  the hermit cast a wistful look upon the knight in which there was a sort of comic expression of hesitation as if uncertain how far he should act prudently in trusting his guest there was however as much of bold frankness in the knights countenance as was possible to be expressed by features his smile too had something in it irresistibly comic and gave an assurance of faith and loyalty with which his host could not refrain from sympathizing  after exchanging a mute glance or two the hermit went to the further side of the hut and opened a hutch which was concealed with great care and some ingenuity out of the recesses of a dark closet into which this aperture gave admittance he brought a large pasty baked in a pewter platter of unusual dimensions this mighty dish he placed before his guest who using his poniard to cut it open lost no time in making himself acquainted with its contents  how long is it since the good keeper has been here said the knight to his host after having swallowed several hasty morsels of this reinforcement to the hermits good cheer  about two months answered the father hastily  by the true lord answered the knight every thing in your hermitage is miraculous holy clerk for i would have been sworn that the fat buck which furnished this venison had been running on foot within the week  the hermit was somewhat discountenanced by this observation and moreover he made but a poor figure while gazing on the diminution of the pasty on which his guest was making desperate inroads a warfare in which his previous profession of abstinence left him no pretext for joining  i have been in palestine sir clerk said the knight stopping short of a sudden and i bethink me it is a custom there that every host who entertains a guest shall assure him of the wholesomeness of his food by partaking of it along with him far be it from me to suspect so holy a man of aught inhospitable nevertheless i will be highly bound to you would you comply with this eastern custom  to ease your unnecessary scruples sir knight i will for once depart from my rule replied the hermit and as there were no forks in those days his clutches were instantly in the bowels of the pasty  the ice of ceremony being once broken it seemed matter of rivalry between the guest and the entertainer which should display the best appetite and although the former had probably fasted longest yet the hermit fairly surpassed him  holy clerk said the knight when his hunger was appeased i would gage my good horse yonder against a zecchin that that same honest keeper to whom we are obliged for the venison has left thee a stoup of wine or a runlet of canary or some such trifle by way of ally to this noble pasty this would be a circumstance doubtless totally unworthy to dwell in the memory of so rigid an anchorite yet i think were you to search yonder crypt once more you would find that i am right in my conjecture  the hermit only replied by a grin and returning to the hutch he produced a leathern bottle which might contain about four quarts he also brought forth two large drinking cups made out of the horn of the urus and hooped with silver having made this goodly provision for washing down the supper he seemed to think no farther ceremonious scruple necessary on his part but filling both cups and saying in the saxon fashion waes hael sir sluggish knight he emptied his own at a draught  drink hael holy clerk of copmanhurst answered the warrior and did his host reason in a similar brimmer  holy clerk said the stranger after the first cup was thus swallowed i cannot but marvel that a man possessed of such thews and sinews as thine and who therewithal shows the talent of so goodly a trencherman should think of abiding by himself in this wilderness in my judgment you are fitter to keep a castle or a fort eating of the fat and drinking of the strong than to live here upon pulse and water or even upon the charity of the keeper at least were i as thou i should find myself both disport and plenty out of the kings deer there is many a goodly herd in these forests and a buck will never be missed that goes to the use of saint dunstans chaplain  sir sluggish knight replied the clerk these are dangerous words and i pray you to forbear them i am true hermit to the king and law and were i to spoil my lieges game i should be sure of the prison and an my gown saved me not were in some peril of hanging  nevertheless were i as thou said the knight i would take my walk by moonlight when foresters and keepers were warm in bed and ever and anonas i pattered my prayersi would let fly a shaft among the herds of dun deer that feed in the gladesresolve me holy clerk hast thou never practised such a pastime  friend sluggard answered the hermit thou hast seen all that can concern thee of my housekeeping and something more than he deserves who takes up his quarters by violence credit me it is better to enjoy the good which god sends thee than to be impertinently curious how it comes fill thy cup and welcome and do not i pray thee by further impertinent enquiries put me to show that thou couldst hardly have made good thy lodging had i been earnest to oppose thee  by my faith said the knight thou makest me more curious than ever thou art the most mysterious hermit i ever met and i will know more of thee ere we part as for thy threats know holy man thou speakest to one whose trade it is to find out danger wherever it is to be met with  sir sluggish knight i drink to thee said the hermit respecting thy valour much but deeming wondrous slightly of thy discretion if thou wilt take equal arms with me i will give thee in all friendship and brotherly love such sufficing penance and complete absolution that thou shalt not for the next twelve months sin the sin of excess of curiosity  the knight pledged him and desired him to name his weapons  there is none replied the hermit from the scissors of delilah and the tenpenny nail of jael to the scimitar of goliath at which i am not a match for theebut if i am to make the election what sayst thou good friend to these trinkets  thus speaking he opened another hutch and took out from it a couple of broadswords and bucklers such as were used by the yeomanry of the period the knight who watched his motions observed that this second place of concealment was furnished with two or three good longbows a crossbow a bundle of bolts for the latter and halfadozen sheaves of arrows for the former a harp and other matters of a very uncanonical appearance were also visible when this dark recess was opened  i promise thee brother clerk said he i will ask thee no more offensive questions the contents of that cupboard are an answer to all my enquiries and i see a weapon there here he stooped and took out the harp on which i would more gladly prove my skill with thee than at the sword and buckler  i hope sir knight said the hermit thou hast given no good reason for thy surname of the sluggard i do promise thee i suspect thee grievously nevertheless thou art my guest and i will not put thy manhood to the proof without thine own free will sit thee down then and fill thy cup let us drink sing and be merry if thou knowest ever a good lay thou shalt be welcome to a nook of pasty at copmanhurst so long as i serve the chapel of st dunstan which please god shall be till i change my grey covering for one of green turf but come fill a flagon for it will crave some time to tune the harp and nought pitches the voice and sharpens the ear like a cup of wine for my part i love to feel the grape at my very fingerends before they make the harpstrings tinkle 22     chapter xvii       at eve within yon

prescription of the genial hermit with which his guest willingly complied he found it no easy matter to bring the harp to harmony  methinks holy father said he the instrument wants one string and the rest have been somewhat misused  ay markst thou that replied the hermit that shows thee a master of the craft wine and wassail he added gravely casting up his eyesall the fault of wine and wassaili told allanadale the northern minstrel that he would damage the harp if he touched it after the seventh cup but he would not be controlledfriend i drink to thy successful performance  so saying he took off his cup with much gravity at the same time shaking his head at the intemperance of the scottish harper  the knight in the meantime had brought the strings into some order and after a short prelude asked his host whether he would choose a sirvente in the language of oc or a lai in the language of oui or a virelai or a ballad in the vulgar english 23  a ballad a ballad said the hermit against all the ocs and ouis of france downright english am i sir knight and downright english was my patron st dunstan and scorned oc and oui as he would have scorned the parings of the devils hoofdownright english alone shall be sung in this cell  i will assay then said the knight a ballad composed by a saxon gleeman whom i knew in holy land  it speedily appeared that if the knight was not a complete master of the minstrel art his taste for it had at least been cultivated under the best instructors art had taught him to soften the faults of a voice which had little compass and was naturally rough rather than mellow and in short had done all that culture can do in supplying natural deficiencies his performance therefore might have been termed very respectable by abler judges than the hermit especially as the knight threw into the notes now a degree of spirit and now of plaintive enthusiasm which gave force and energy to the verses which he sung        the crusaders return       1       high deeds achieved of knightly fame      from palestine the champion came      the cross upon his shoulders borne      battle and blast had dimmd and torn      each dint upon his batterd shield

and grant him bliss who brings thee fame  during this performance the hermit demeaned himself much like a firstrate critic of the present day at a new opera he reclined back upon his seat with his eyes half shut now folding his hands and twisting his thumbs he seemed absorbed in attention and anon balancing his expanded palms he gently flourished them in time to the music at one or two favourite cadences he threw in a little assistance of his own where the knights voice seemed unable to carry the air so high as his worshipful taste approved when the song was ended the anchorite emphatically declared it a good one and well sung  and yet said he i think my saxon countrymen had herded long enough with the normans to fall into the tone of their melancholy ditties what took the honest knight from home or what could he expect but to find his mistress agreeably engaged with a rival on his return and his serenade as they call it as little regarded as the caterwauling of a cat in the gutter nevertheless sir knight i drink this cup to thee to the success of all true loversi fear you are none he added on observing that the knight whose brain began to be heated with these repeated draughts qualified his flagon from the water pitcher  why said the knight did you not tell me that this water was from the well of your blessed patron st dunstan  ay truly said the hermit and many a hundred of pagans did he baptize there but i never heard that he drank any of it every thing should be put to its proper use in this world st dunstan knew as well as any one the prerogatives of a jovial friar  and so saying he reached the harp and entertained his guest with the following characteristic song to a sort of derrydown chorus appropriate to an old english ditty 24        the barefooted friar       1       ill give thee good fellow a twelvemonth or twain      to search europe through from byzantium to spain      but neer shall you find should you search till you tire

knight thou hast sung well and lustily and in high praise of thine order and talking of the devil holy clerk are you not afraid that he may pay you a visit during some of your uncanonical pastimes  i

excepting moonlight nights when the venison is in season said his guest  exceptis excipiendis replied the hermit as our old abbot taught me to say when impertinent laymen should ask me if i kept every punctilio of mine order  true holy father said the knight but the devil is apt to keep an eye on such exceptions he goes about thou knowest like a roaring lion  let him roar here if he dares said the

speak upon such subjects my friend until after morning vespers  he changed the conversation fast and furious grew the mirth of the parties and many a song was exchanged betwixt them when their revels were interrupted by a loud knocking at the door of the hermitage  the occasion of this interruption we can only explain by resuming the adventures of another set of our characters for like old ariosto we do not pique ourselves upon continuing uniformly to keep company with any one personage of our drama     chapter xviii       away our journey lies through dell and dingle      where the blithe fawn trips by its timid mother      where the broad oak with intercepting boughs      chequers the sunbeam in the greensward alley      up and awayfor lovely paths are these      to tread when the glad sun is on his throne      less pleasant and less safe when cynthias lamp      with doubtful glimmer lights the dreary forest      ettrick forest  when cedric the saxon saw his son drop down senseless in the lists at ashby his first impulse was to order him into the custody and care of his own attendants but the words choked in his throat he could not bring himself to acknowledge in presence of such an assembly the son whom he had renounced and disinherited he ordered however oswald to keep an eye upon him and directed that officer with two of his serfs to convey ivanhoe to ashby as soon as the crowd had dispersed oswald however was anticipated in this good office the crowd dispersed indeed but the knight was nowhere to be seen  it was in vain that cedrics cupbearer looked around for his young masterhe saw the bloody spot on which he had lately sunk down but himself he saw no longer it seemed as if the fairies had conveyed him from the spot perhaps oswald for the saxons were very superstitious might have adopted some such hypothesis to account for ivanhoes disappearance had he not suddenly cast his eye upon a person attired like a squire in whom he recognised the features of his fellowservant gurth anxious concerning his masters fate and in despair at his sudden disappearance the translated swineherd was searching for him everywhere and had neglected in doing so the concealment on which his own safety depended oswald deemed it his duty to secure gurth as a fugitive of whose fate his master was to judge  renewing his enquiries concerning the fate of ivanhoe the only information which the cupbearer could collect from the bystanders was that the knight had been raised with care by certain wellattired grooms and placed in a litter belonging to a lady among the spectators which had immediately transported him out of the press oswald on receiving this intelligence resolved to return to his master for farther instructions carrying along with him gurth whom he considered in some sort as a deserter from the service of cedric  the saxon had been under very intense and agonizing apprehensions concerning his son for nature had asserted her rights in spite of the patriotic stoicism which laboured to disown her but no sooner was he informed that ivanhoe was in careful and probably in friendly hands than the paternal anxiety which had been excited by the dubiety of his fate gave way anew to the feeling of injured pride and resentment at what he termed wilfreds filial disobedience  let him wander his way said helet those leech his wounds for whose sake he encountered them he is fitter to do the juggling tricks of the norman chivalry than to maintain the fame and honour of his english ancestry with the glaive and brownbill the good old weapons of his country  if to maintain the honour of ancestry said rowena who was present it is sufficient to be wise in council and brave in executionto be boldest among the bold and gentlest among the gentle i know no voice save his fathers  be silent lady rowenaon this subject only i hear you not prepare yourself for the princes festival we have been summoned thither with unwonted circumstance of honour and of courtesy such as the haughty normans have rarely used to our race since the fatal day of hastings thither will i go were it only to show these proud normans how little the fate of a son who could defeat their bravest can affect a saxon  thither said rowena do i not go and i pray you to beware lest what you mean for courage and constancy shall be accounted hardness of heart  remain at home then ungrateful lady answered cedric thine is the hard heart which can sacrifice the weal of an oppressed people to an idle and unauthorized attachment i seek the noble athelstane and with him attend the banquet of john of anjou  he went accordingly to the banquet of which we have already mentioned the principal events immediately upon retiring from the castle the saxon thanes with their attendants took horse and it was during the bustle which attended their doing so that cedric for the first time cast his eyes upon the deserter gurth the noble saxon had returned from the banquet as we have seen in no very placid humour and wanted but a pretext for wreaking his anger upon some one  the gyves he said the gyvesoswaldhundibertdogs and villainswhy leave ye the knave unfettered  without daring to remonstrate the companions of gurth bound him with a halter as the readiest cord which occurred he submitted to the operation without remonstrance except that darting a reproachful look at his master he said this comes of loving your flesh and blood better than mine own  to horse and forward said cedric  it is indeed full time said the noble athelstane for if we ride not the faster the worthy abbot waltheoffs preparations for a reresupper 25 will be altogether spoiled  the travellers however used such speed as to reach the convent of st witholds before the apprehended evil took place the abbot himself of ancient saxon descent received the noble saxons with the profuse and exuberant hospitality of their nation wherein they indulged to a late or rather an early hour nor did they take leave of their reverend host the next morning until they had shared with him a sumptuous refection  as the cavalcade left the court of the monastery an incident happened somewhat alarming to the saxons who of all people of europe were most addicted to a superstitious observance of omens and to whose opinions can be traced most of those notions upon such subjects still to be found among our popular antiquities for the normans being a mixed race and better informed according to the information of the times had lost most of the superstitious prejudices which their ancestors had brought from scandinavia and piqued themselves upon thinking freely on such topics  in the present instance the apprehension of impending evil was inspired by no less respectable a prophet than a large lean black dog which sitting upright howled most piteously as the foremost riders left the gate and presently afterwards barking wildly and jumping to and fro seemed bent upon attaching itself to the party  i like not that music father cedric said athelstane for by this title of respect he was accustomed to address him  nor i either uncle said wamba i greatly fear we shall have to pay the piper  in my mind said athelstane upon whose memory the abbots good ale for burton was already famous for that genial liquor had made a favourable impressionin my mind we had better turn back and abide with the abbot until the afternoon it is unlucky to travel where your path is crossed by a monk a hare or a howling dog until you have eaten your next meal  away said cedric impatiently the day is already too short for our journey for the dog i know it to be the cur of the runaway slave gurth a useless fugitive like its master  so saying and rising at the same time in his stirrups impatient at the interruption of his journey he launched his javelin at poor fangsfor fangs it was who having traced his master thus far upon his stolen expedition had here lost him and was now in his uncouth way rejoicing at his reappearance the javelin inflicted a wound upon the animals shoulder and narrowly missed pinning him to the earth and fangs fled howling from the presence of the enraged thane gurths heart swelled within him for he felt this meditated slaughter of his faithful adherent in a degree much deeper than the harsh treatment he had himself received having in vain attempted to raise his hand to his eyes he said to wamba who seeing his masters ill humour had prudently retreated to the rear i pray thee do me the kindness to wipe my eyes with the skirt of thy mantle the dust offends me and these bonds will not let me help myself one way or another  wamba did him the service he required and they rode side by side for some time during which gurth maintained a moody silence at length he could repress his feelings no longer  friend wamba said he of all those who are fools enough to serve cedric thou alone hast dexterity enough to make thy folly acceptable to him go to him therefore and tell him that neither for love nor fear will gurth serve him longer he may strike the head from mehe may scourge mehe may load me with ironsbut henceforth he shall never compel me either to love or to obey him go to him then and tell him that gurth the son of beowulph renounces his service  assuredly said wamba fool as i am i shall not do your fools errand cedric hath another javelin stuck into his girdle and thou knowest he does not always miss his mark  i care not replied gurth how soon he makes a mark of me yesterday he left wilfred my young master in his blood today he has striven to kill before my face the only other living creature that ever showed me kindness by st edmund st dunstan st withold st edward the confessor and every other saxon saint in the calendar for cedric never swore by any that was not of saxon lineage and all his household had the same limited devotion i will never forgive him  to my thinking now said the jester who was frequently wont to act as peacemaker in the family our master did not propose to hurt fangs but only to affright him for if you observed he rose in his stirrups as thereby meaning to overcast the mark and so he would have done but fangs happening to bound up at the very moment received a scratch which i will be bound to heal with a pennys breadth of tar  if i thought so said gurthif i could but think sobut noi saw the javelin was well aimedi heard it whizz through the air with all the wrathful malevolence of him who cast it and it quivered after it had pitched in the ground as if with regret for having missed its mark by the hog dear to st anthony i renounce him  and the indignant swineherd resumed his sullen silence which no efforts of the jester could again induce him to break  meanwhile cedric and athelstane the leaders of the troop conversed together on the state of the land on the dissensions of the royal family on the feuds and quarrels among the norman nobles and on the chance which there was that the oppressed saxons might be able to free themselves from the yoke of the normans or at least to elevate themselves into national consequence and independence during the civil convulsions which were likely to ensue on this subject cedric was all animation the restoration of the independence of his race was the idol of his heart to which he had willingly sacrificed domestic happiness and the interests of his own son but in order to achieve this great revolution in favour of the native english it was necessary that they should be united among themselves and act under an acknowledged head the necessity of choosing their chief from the saxon bloodroyal was not only evident in itself but had been made a solemn condition by those whom cedric had intrusted with his secret plans and hopes athelstane had this quality at least and though he had few mental accomplishments or talents to recommend him as a leader he had still a goodly person was no coward had been accustomed to martial exercises and seemed willing to defer to the advice of counsellors more wise than himself above all he was known to be liberal and hospitable and believed to be goodnatured but whatever pretensions athelstane had to be considered as head of the saxon confederacy many of that nation were disposed to prefer to the title of the lady rowena who drew her descent from alfred and whose father having been a chief renowned for wisdom courage and generosity his memory was highly honoured by his oppressed countrymen  it would have been no difficult thing for cedric had he been so disposed to have placed himself at the head of a third party as formidable at least as any of the others to counterbalance their royal descent he had courage activity energy and above all that devoted attachment to the cause which had procured him the epithet of the saxon and his birth was inferior to none excepting only that of athelstane and his ward these qualities however were unalloyed by the slightest shade of selfishness and instead of dividing yet farther his weakened nation by forming a faction of his own it was a leading part of cedrics plan to extinguish that which already existed by promoting a marriage betwixt rowena and athelstane an obstacle occurred to this his favourite project in the mutual attachment of his ward and his son and hence the original cause of the banishment of wilfred from the house of his father  this stern measure cedric had adopted in hopes that during wilfreds absence rowena might relinquish her preference but in this hope he was disappointed a disappointment which might be attributed in part to the mode in which his ward had been educated cedric to whom the name of alfred was as that of a deity had treated the sole remaining scion of that great monarch with a degree of observance such as perhaps was in those days scarce paid to an acknowledged princess rowenas will had been in almost all cases a law to his household and cedric himself as if determined that her sovereignty should be fully acknowledged within that little circle at least seemed to take a pride in acting as the first of her subjects thus trained in the exercise not only of free will but despotic authority rowena was by her previous education disposed both to resist and to resent any attempt to control her affections or dispose of her hand contrary to her inclinations and to assert her independence in a case in which even those females who have been trained up to obedience and subjection are not infrequently apt to dispute the authority of guardians and parents the opinions which she felt strongly she avowed boldly and cedric who could not free himself from his habitual deference to her opinions felt totally at a loss how to enforce his authority of guardian  it was in vain that he attempted to dazzle her with the prospect of a visionary throne rowena who possessed strong sense neither considered his plan as practicable nor as desirable so far as she was concerned could it have been achieved without attempting to conceal her avowed preference of wilfred of ivanhoe she declared that were that favoured knight out of question she would rather take refuge in a convent than share a throne with athelstane whom having always despised she now began on account of the trouble she received on his account thoroughly to detest  nevertheless cedric whose opinions of womens constancy was far from strong persisted in using every means in his power to bring about the proposed match in which he conceived he was rendering an important service to the saxon cause the sudden and romantic appearance of his son in the lists at ashby he had justly regarded as almost a deaths blow to his hopes his paternal affection it is true had for an instant gained the victory over pride and patriotism but both had returned in full force and under their joint operation he was now bent upon making a determined effort for the union of athelstane and rowena together with expediting those other measures which seemed necessary to forward the restoration of saxon independence  on this last subject he was now labouring with athelstane not without having reason every now and then to lament like hotspur that he should have moved such a dish of skimmed milk to so honourable an action athelstane it is true was vain enough and loved to have his ears tickled with tales of his high descent and of his right by inheritance to homage and sovereignty but his petty vanity was sufficiently gratified by receiving this homage at the hands of his immediate attendants and of the saxons who approached him if he had the courage to encounter danger he at least hated the trouble of going to seek it and while he agreed in the general principles laid down by cedric concerning the claim of the saxons to independence and was still more easily convinced of his own title to reign over them when that independence should be attained yet when the means of asserting these rights came to be discussed he was still athelstane the unready slow irresolute procrastinating and unenterprising the warm and impassioned exhortations of cedric had as little effect upon his impassive temper as redhot balls alighting in the water which produce a little sound and smoke and are instantly extinguished  if leaving this task which might be compared to spurring a tired jade or to hammering upon cold iron cedric fell back to his ward rowena he received little more satisfaction from conferring with her for as his presence interrupted the discourse between the lady and her favourite attendant upon the gallantry and fate of wilfred elgitha failed not to revenge both her mistress and herself by recurring to the overthrow of athelstane in the lists the most disagreeable subject which could greet the ears of cedric to this sturdy saxon therefore the days journey was fraught with all manner of displeasure and discomfort so that he more than once internally cursed the tournament and him who had proclaimed it together with his own folly in ever thinking of going thither  at noon upon the motion of athelstane the travellers paused in a woodland shade by a fountain to repose their horses and partake of some provisions with which the hospitable abbot had loaded a sumpter mule their repast was a pretty long one and these several interruptions rendered it impossible for them to hope to reach rotherwood without travelling all night a conviction which induced them to proceed on their way at a more hasty pace than they had hitherto used     chapter xix       a train of armed men some noble dame      escorting so their scatterd words discoverd      as unperceived i hung upon their rear      are close at hand and mean to pass the night      within the castle      orra a tragedy  the travellers had now reached the verge of the wooded country and were about to plunge into its recesses held dangerous at that time from the number of outlaws whom oppression and poverty had driven to despair and who occupied the forests in such large bands as could easily bid defiance to the feeble police of the period from these rovers however notwithstanding the lateness of the hour cedric and athelstane accounted themselves secure as they had in attendance ten servants besides wamba and gurth whose aid could not be counted upon the one being a jester and the other a captive it may be added that in travelling thus late through the forest cedric and athelstane relied on their descent and character as well as their courage the outlaws whom the severity of the forest laws had reduced to this roving and desperate mode of life were chiefly peasants and yeomen of saxon descent and were generally supposed to respect the persons and property of their countrymen  as the travellers journeyed on their way they were alarmed by repeated cries for assistance and when they rode up to the place from whence they came they were surprised to find a horselitter placed upon the ground beside which sat a young woman richly dressed in the jewish fashion while an old man whose yellow cap proclaimed him to belong to the same nation walked up and down with gestures expressive of the deepest despair and wrung his hands as if affected by some strange disaster  to the enquiries of athelstane and cedric the old jew could for some time only answer by invoking the protection of all the patriarchs of the old testament successively against the sons of ishmael who were coming to smite them hip and thigh with the edge of the sword when he began to come to himself out of this agony of terror isaac of york for it was our old friend was at length able to explain that he had hired a bodyguard of six men at ashby together with mules for carrying the litter of a sick friend this party had undertaken to escort him as far as doncaster they had come thus far in safety but having received information from a woodcutter that there was a strong band of outlaws lying in wait in the woods before them isaacs mercenaries had not only taken flight but had carried off with them the horses which bore the litter and left the jew and his daughter without the means either of defence or of retreat to be plundered and probably murdered by the banditti who they expected every moment would bring down upon them would it but please your valours added isaac in a tone of deep humiliation to permit the poor jews to travel under your safeguard i swear by the tables of our law that never has favour been conferred upon a child of israel since the days of our captivity which shall be more gratefully acknowledged  dog of a jew said athelstane whose memory was of that petty kind which stores up trifles of all kinds but particularly trifling offences dost not remember how thou didst beard us in the gallery at the tiltyard fight or flee or compound with the outlaws as thou dost list ask neither aid nor company from us and if they rob only such as thee who rob all the world i for mine own share shall hold them right honest folk  cedric did not assent to the severe proposal of his companion we shall do better said he to leave them two of our attendants and two horses to convey them back to the next village it will diminish our strength but little and with your good sword noble athelstane and the aid of those who remain it will be light work for us to face twenty of those runagates  rowena somewhat alarmed by the mention of outlaws in force and so near them strongly seconded the proposal of her guardian but rebecca suddenly quitting her dejected posture and making her way through the attendants to the palfrey of the saxon lady knelt down and after the oriental fashion in addressing superiors kissed the hem of rowenas garment then rising and throwing back her veil she implored her in the great name of the god whom they both worshipped and by that revelation of the law upon mount sinai in which they both believed that she would have compassion upon them and suffer them to go forward under their safeguard it is not for myself that i pray this favour said rebecca nor is it even for that poor old man i know that to wrong and to spoil our nation is a light fault if not a merit with the christians and what is it to us whether it be done in the city in the desert or in the field but it is in the name of one dear to many and dear even to you that i beseech you to let this sick person be transported with care and tenderness under your protection for if evil chance him the last moment of your life would be embittered with regret for denying that which i ask of you  the noble and solemn air with which rebecca made this appeal gave it double weight with the fair saxon  the man is old and feeble she said to her guardian the maiden young and beautiful their friend sick and in peril of his lifejews though they be we cannot as christians leave them in this extremity let them unload two of the sumptermules and put the baggage behind two of the serfs the mules may transport the litter and we have led horses for the old man and his daughter  cedric readily assented to what she proposed and athelstane only added the condition that they should travel in the rear of the whole party where wamba he said might attend them with his shield of boars brawn  i have left my shield in the tiltyard answered the jester as has been the fate of many a better knight than myself  athelstane coloured deeply for such had been his own fate on the last day of the tournament while rowena who was pleased in the same proportion as if to make amends for the brutal jest of her unfeeling suitor requested rebecca to ride by her side  it were not fit i should do so answered rebecca with proud humility where my society might be held a disgrace to my protectress  by this time the change of baggage was hastily achieved for the single word outlaws rendered every one sufficiently alert and the approach of twilight made the sound yet more impressive amid the bustle gurth was taken from horseback in the course of which removal he prevailed upon the jester to slack the cord with which his arms were bound it was so negligently refastened perhaps intentionally on the part of wamba that gurth found no difficulty in freeing his arms altogether from bondage and then gliding into the thicket he made his escape from the party  the bustle had been considerable and it was some time before gurth was missed for as he was to be placed for the rest of the journey behind a servant every one supposed that some other of his companions had him under his custody and when it began to be whispered among them that gurth had actually disappeared they were under such immediate expectation of an attack from the outlaws that it was not held convenient to pay much attention to the circumstance  the path upon which the party travelled was now so narrow as not to admit with any sort of convenience above two riders abreast and began to descend into a dingle traversed by a brook whose banks were broken swampy and overgrown with dwarf willows cedric and athelstane who were at the head of their retinue saw the risk of being attacked at this pass but neither of them having had much practice in war no better mode of preventing the danger occurred to them than that they should hasten through the defile as fast as possible advancing therefore without much order they had just crossed the brook with a part of their followers when they were assailed in front flank and rear at once with an impetuosity to which in their confused and illprepared condition it was impossible to offer effectual resistance the shout of a white dragona white dragonsaint george for merry england warcries adopted by the assailants as belonging to their assumed character of saxon outlaws was heard on every side and on every side enemies appeared with a rapidity of advance and attack which seemed to multiply their numbers  both the saxon chiefs were made prisoners at the same moment and each under circumstances expressive of his character cedric the instant that an enemy appeared launched at him his remaining javelin which taking better effect than that which he had hurled at fangs nailed the man against an oaktree that happened to be close behind him thus far successful cedric spurred his horse against a second drawing his sword at the same time and striking with such inconsiderate fury that his weapon encountered a thick branch which hung over him and he was disarmed by the violence of his own blow he was instantly made prisoner and pulled from his horse by two or three of the banditti who crowded around him athelstane shared his captivity his bridle having been seized and he himself forcibly dismounted long before he could draw his weapon or assume any posture of effectual defence  the attendants embarrassed with baggage surprised and terrified at the fate of their masters fell an easy prey to the assailants while the lady rowena in the centre of the cavalcade and the jew and his daughter in the rear experienced the same misfortune  of all the train none escaped except wamba who showed upon the occasion much more courage than those who pretended to greater sense he possessed himself of a sword belonging to one of the domestics who was just drawing it with a tardy and irresolute hand laid it about him like a lion drove back several who approached him and made a brave though ineffectual attempt to succour his master finding himself overpowered the jester at length threw himself from his horse plunged into the thicket and favoured by the general confusion escaped from the scene of action yet the valiant jester as soon as he found himself safe hesitated more than once whether he should not turn back and share the captivity of a master to whom he was sincerely attached  i have heard men talk of the blessings of freedom he said to himself but i wish any wise man would teach me what use to make of it now that i have it  as he pronounced these words aloud a voice very near him called out in a low and cautious tone wamba and at the same time a dog which he recognised to be fangs jumped up and fawned upon him gurth answered wamba with the same caution and the swineherd immediately stood before him  what is the matter said he eagerly what mean these cries and that clashing of swords  only a trick of the times said wamba they are all prisoners  who are prisoners exclaimed gurth impatiently  my lord and my lady and athelstane and hundibert and oswald  in the name of god said gurth how came they prisonersand to whom  our master was too ready to fight said the jester and athelstane was not ready enough and no other person was ready at all and they are prisoners to green cassocks and black visors and they lie all tumbled about on the green like the crabapples that you shake down to your swine and i would laugh at it said the honest jester if i could for weeping and he shed tears of unfeigned sorrow  gurths countenance kindledwamba he said thou hast a weapon and thy heart was ever stronger than thy brainwe are only twobut a sudden attack from men of resolution will do muchfollow me  whitherand for what purpose said the jester  to rescue cedric  but you have renounced his service but now said wamba  that said gurth was but while he was fortunatefollow me  as the jester was about to obey a third person suddenly made his appearance and commanded them both to halt from his dress and arms wamba would have conjectured him to be one of those outlaws who had just assailed his master but besides that he wore no mask the glittering baldric across his shoulder with the rich buglehorn which it supported as well as the calm and commanding expression of his voice and manner made him notwithstanding the twilight recognise locksley the yeoman who had been victorious under such disadvantageous circumstances in the contest for the prize of archery  what is the meaning of all this said he or who is it that rifle and ransom and make prisoners in these forests  you may look at their cassocks close by said wamba and see whether they be thy childrens coats or nofor they are as like thine own as one green peacod is to another  i will learn that presently answered locksley and i charge ye on peril of your lives not to stir from the place where ye stand until i have returned obey me and it shall be the better for you and your mastersyet stay i must render myself as like these men as possible  so saying he unbuckled his baldric with the bugle took a feather from his cap and gave them to wamba then drew a vizard from his pouch and repeating his charges to them to stand fast went to execute his purposes of reconnoitring  shall we stand fast gurth said wamba or shall we een give him legbail in my foolish mind he had all the equipage of a thief too much in readiness to be himself a true man  let him be the devil said gurth an he will we can be no worse of waiting his return if he belong to that party he must already have given them the alarm and it will avail nothing either to fight or fly besides i have late experience that errant thieves are not the worst men in the world to have to deal with  the yeoman returned in the course of a few minutes  friend gurth he said i have mingled among yon men and have learnt to whom they belong and whither they are bound there is i think no chance that they will proceed to any actual violence against their prisoners for three men to attempt them at this moment were little else than madness for they are good men of war and have as such placed sentinels to give the alarm when any one approaches but i trust soon to gather such a force as may act in defiance of all their precautions you are both servants and as i think faithful servants of cedric the saxon the friend of the rights of englishmen he shall not want english hands to help him in this extremity come then with me until i gather more aid  so saying he walked through the wood at a great pace followed by the jester and the swineherd it was not consistent with wambas humour to travel long in silence  i think said he looking at the baldric and bugle which he still carried that i saw the arrow shot which won this gay prize and that not so long since as christmas  and i said gurth could take it on my halidome that i have heard the voice of the good yeoman who won it by night as well as by day and that the moon is not three days older since i did so  mine honest friends replied the yeoman who or what i am is little to the present purpose should i free your master you will have reason to think me the best friend you have ever had in your lives and whether i am known by one name or anotheror whether i can draw a bow as well or better than a cowkeeper or whether it is my pleasure to walk in sunshine or by moonlight are matters which as they do not concern you so neither need ye busy yourselves respecting them  our heads are in the lions mouth said wamba in a whisper to gurth get them out how we can  hushbe silent said gurth offend him not by thy folly and i trust sincerely that all will go well     chapter xx       when autumn nights were long and drear      and forest walks were dark and dim      how sweetly on the pilgrims ear      was wont to steal the hermits hymn       devotion borrows musics tone      and music took devotions wing      and like the bird that hails the sun      they soar to heaven and soaring sing      the hermit of st clements well  it was after three hours good walking that the servants of cedric with their mysterious guide arrived at a small opening in the forest in the centre of which grew an oaktree of enormous magnitude throwing its twisted branches in every direction beneath this tree four or five yeomen lay stretched on the ground while another as sentinel walked to and fro in the moonlight shade  upon hearing the sound of feet approaching the watch instantly gave the alarm and the sleepers as suddenly started up and bent their bows six arrows placed on the string were pointed towards the quarter from which the travellers approached when their guide being recognised was welcomed with every token of respect and attachment and all signs and fears of a rough reception at once subsided  where is the miller was his first question  on the road towards rotherham  with how many demanded the leader for such he seemed to be  with six men and good hope of booty if it please st nicholas  devoutly spoken said locksley and where is allanadale  walked up towards the watlingstreet to watch for the prior of jorvaulx  that is well thought on also replied the captainand where is the friar  in his cell  thither will i go said locksley disperse and seek your companions collect what force you can for theres game afoot that must be hunted hard and will turn to bay meet me here by daybreakand stay he added i have forgotten what is most necessary of the wholetwo of you take the road quickly towards torquilstone the castle of frontdeboeuf a set of gallants who have been masquerading in such guise as our own are carrying a band of prisoners thitherwatch them closely for even if they reach the castle before we collect our force our honour is concerned to punish them and we will find means to do so keep a close watch on them therefore and dispatch one of your comrades the lightest of foot to bring the news of the yeomen thereabout  they promised implicit obedience and departed with alacrity on their different errands in the meanwhile their leader and his two companions who now looked upon him with great respect as well as some fear pursued their way to the chapel of copmanhurst  when they had reached the little moonlight glade having in front the reverend though ruinous chapel and the rude hermitage so well suited to ascetic devotion wamba whispered to gurth if this be the habitation of a thief it makes good the old proverb the nearer the church the farther from godand by my coxcomb he added i think it be even sohearken but to the black sanctus which they are singing in the hermitage  in fact the anchorite and his guest were performing at the full extent of their very powerful lungs an old drinking song of which this was the burden       come trowl the brown bowl to me      bully boy bully boy      come trowl the brown bowl to me      ho jolly jenkin i spy a knave in drinking      come trowl the brown bowl to me  now that is not ill sung said wamba who had thrown in a few of his own flourishes to help out the chorus but who in the saints name ever expected to have heard such a jolly chant come from out a hermits cell at midnight  marry that should i said gurth for the jolly clerk of copmanhurst is a known man and kills half the deer that are stolen in this walk men say that the keeper has complained to his official and that he will be stripped of his cowl and cope altogether if he keeps not better order  while they were thus speaking locksleys loud and repeated knocks had at length disturbed the anchorite and his guest by my beads said the hermit stopping short in a grand flourish here come more benighted guests i would not for my cowl that they found us in this goodly exercise all men have their enemies good sir sluggard and there be those malignant enough to construe the hospitable refreshment which i have been offering to you a weary traveller for the matter of three short hours into sheer drunkenness and debauchery vices alike alien to my profession and my disposition  base calumniators replied the knight i would i had the chastising of them nevertheless holy clerk it is true that all have their enemies and there be those in this very land whom i would rather speak to through the bars of my helmet than barefaced  get thine iron pot on thy head then friend sluggard as quickly as thy nature will permit said the hermit while i remove these pewter flagons whose late contents run strangely in mine own pate and to drown the clatterfor in faith i feel somewhat unsteadystrike into the tune which thou hearest me sing it is no matter for the wordsi scarce know them myself  so saying he struck up a thundering de profundis clamavi under cover of which he removed the apparatus of their banquet while the knight laughing heartily and arming himself all the while assisted his host with his voice from time to time as his mirth permitted  what devils matins are you after at this hour said a voice from without  heaven forgive you sir traveller said the hermit whose own noise and perhaps his nocturnal potations prevented from recognising accents which were tolerably familiar to himwend on your way in the name of god and saint dunstan and disturb not the devotions of me and my holy brother  mad priest answered the voice from without open to locksley  alls safealls right said the hermit to his companion  but who is he said the black knight it imports me much to know  who is he answered the hermit i tell thee he is a friend  but what friend answered the knight for he may be friend to thee and none of mine  what friend replied the hermit that now is one of the questions that is more easily asked than answered what friendwhy he is now that i bethink me a little the very same honest keeper i told thee of a while since  ay as honest a keeper as thou art a pious hermit replied the knight i doubt it not but undo the door to him before he beat it from its hinges  the dogs in the meantime which had made a dreadful baying at the commencement of the disturbance seemed now to recognise the voice of him who stood without for totally changing their manner they scratched and whined at the door as if interceding for his admission the hermit speedily unbolted his portal and admitted locksley with his two companions  why hermit was the yeomans first question as soon as he beheld the knight what boon companion hast thou here  a brother of our order replied the friar shaking his head we have been at our orisons all night  he is a monk of the church militant i think answered locksley and there be more of them abroad i tell thee friar thou must lay down the rosary and take up the quarterstaff we shall need every one of our merry men whether clerk or laymanbut he added taking him a step aside art thou mad to give admittance to a knight thou dost not know hast thou forgot our articles  not know him replied the friar boldly i know him as well as the beggar knows his dish  and what is his name then demanded locksley  his name said the hermithis name is sir anthony of scrabelstoneas if i would drink with a man and did not know his name  thou hast been drinking more than enough friar said the woodsman and i fear prating more than enough too  good yeoman said the knight coming forward be not wroth with my merry host he did but afford me the hospitality which i would have compelled from him if he had refused it  thou compel said the friar wait but till have changed this grey gown for a green cassock and if i make not a quarterstaff ring twelve upon thy pate i am neither true clerk nor good woodsman  while he spoke thus he stript off his gown and appeared in a close black buckram doublet and drawers over which he speedily did on a cassock of green and hose of the same colour i pray thee truss my points said he to wamba and thou shalt have a cup of sack for thy labour  gramercy for thy sack said wamba but thinkst thou it is lawful for me to aid you to transmew thyself from a holy hermit into a sinful forester  never fear said the hermit i will but confess the sins of my green cloak to my greyfriars frock and all shall be well again  amen answered the jester a broadcloth penitent should have a sackcloth confessor and your frock may absolve my motley doublet into the bargain  so saying he accommodated the friar with his assistance in tying the endless number of points as the laces which attached the hose to the doublet were then termed  while they were thus employed locksley led the knight a little apart and addressed him thusdeny it not sir knightyou are he who decided the victory to the advantage of the english against the strangers on the second day of the tournament at ashby  and what follows if you guess truly good yeoman replied the knight  i should in that case hold you replied the yeoman a friend to the weaker party  such is the duty of a true knight at least replied the black champion and i would not willingly that there were reason to think otherwise of me  but for my purpose said the yeoman thou shouldst be as well a good englishman as a good knight for that which i have to speak of concerns indeed the duty of every honest man but is more especially that of a trueborn native of england  you can speak to no one replied the knight to whom england and the life of every englishman can be dearer than to me  i would willingly believe so said the woodsman for never had this country such need to be supported by those who love her hear me and i will tell thee of an enterprise in which if thou best really that which thou seemest thou mayst take an honourable part a band of villains in the disguise of better men than themselves have made themselves master of the person of a noble englishman called cedric the saxon together with his ward and his friend athelstane of coningsburgh and have transported them to a castle in this forest called torquilstone i ask of thee as a good knight and a good englishman wilt thou aid in their rescue  i am bound by my vow to do so replied the knight but i would willingly know who you are who request my assistance in their behalf  i am said the forester a nameless man but i am the friend of my country and of my countrys friendswith this account of me you must for the present remain satisfied the more especially since you yourself desire to continue unknown believe however that my word when pledged is as inviolate as if i wore golden spurs  i willingly believe it said the knight i have been accustomed to study mens countenances and i can read in thine honesty and resolution i will therefore ask thee no further questions but aid thee in setting at freedom these oppressed captives which done i trust we shall part better acquainted and well satisfied with each other  so said wamba to gurthfor the friar being now fully equipped the jester having approached to the other side of the hut had heard the conclusion of the conversationso we have got a new allyl trust the valour of the knight will be truer metal than the religion of the hermit or the honesty of the yeoman for this locksley looks like a born deerstealer and the priest like a lusty hypocrite  hold thy peace wamba said gurth it may all be as thou dost guess but were the horned devil to rise and proffer me his assistance to set at liberty cedric and the lady rowena i fear i should hardly have religion enough to refuse the foul fiends offer and bid him get behind me  the friar was now completely accoutred as a yeoman with sword and buckler bow and quiver and a strong partisan over his shoulder he left his cell at the head of the party and having carefully locked the door deposited the key under the threshold  art thou in condition to do good service friar said locksley or does the brown bowl still run in thy head  not more than a drought of st dunstans fountain will allay answered the priest something there is of a whizzing in my brain and of instability in my legs but you shall presently see both pass away  so saying he stepped to the stone basin in which the waters of the fountain as they fell formed bubbles which danced in the white moonlight and took so long a drought as if he had meant to exhaust the spring  when didst thou drink as deep a drought of water before holy clerk of copmanhurst said the black knight  never since my winebutt leaked and let out its liquor by an illegal vent replied the friar and so left me nothing to drink but my patrons bounty here  then plunging his hands and head into the fountain he washed from them all marks of the midnight revel  thus refreshed and sobered the jolly priest twirled his heavy partisan round his head with three fingers as if he had been balancing a reed exclaiming at the same time where be those false ravishers who carry off wenches against their will may the foul fiend fly off with me if i am not man enough for a dozen of them  swearest thou holy clerk said the black knight  clerk me no clerks replied the transformed priest by saint george and the dragon i am no longer a shaveling than while my frock is on my backwhen i am cased in my green cassock i will drink swear and woo a lass with any blithe forester in the west riding  come on jack priest said locksley and be silent thou art as noisy as a whole convent on a holy eve when the father abbot has gone to bedcome on you too my masters tarry not to talk of iti say come on we must collect all our forces and few enough we shall have if we are to storm the castle of reginald frontdeboeuf  what is it frontdeboeuf said the black knight who has stopt on the kings highway the kings liege subjectsis he turned thief and oppressor  oppressor he ever was said locksley  and for thief said the priest i doubt if ever he were even half so honest a man as many a thief of my acquaintance  move on priest and be silent said the yeoman it were better you led the way to the place of rendezvous than say what should be left unsaid both in decency and prudence     chapter xxi       alas how many hours and years have past      since human forms have round this table sate      or lamp or taper on its surface gleamd      methinks i hear the sound of time long passd      still murmuring oer us in the lofty void      of these dark arches like the lingring voices      of those who long within their graves have slept      orra a tragedy  while these measures were taking in behalf of cedric and his companions the armed men by whom the latter had been seized hurried their captives along towards the place of security where they intended to imprison them but darkness came on fast and the paths of the wood seemed but imperfectly known to the marauders they were compelled to make several long halts and once or twice to return on their road to resume the direction which they wished to pursue the summer morn had dawned upon them ere they could travel in full assurance that they held the right path but confidence returned with light and the cavalcade now moved rapidly forward meanwhile the following dialogue took place between the two leaders of the banditti  it is time thou shouldst leave us sir maurice said the templar to de bracy in order to prepare the second part of thy mystery thou art next thou knowest to act the knight deliverer  i have thought better of it said de bracy i will not leave thee till the prize is fairly deposited in frontdeboeufs castle there will i appear before the lady rowena in mine own shape and trust that she will set down to the vehemence of my passion the violence of which i have been guilty  and what has made thee change thy plan de bracy replied the knight templar  that concerns thee nothing answered his companion  i would hope however sir knight said the templar that this alteration of measures arises from no suspicion of my honourable meaning such as fitzurse endeavoured to instil into thee  my thoughts are my own answered de bracy the fiend laughs they say when one thief robs another and we know that were he to spit fire and brimstone instead it would never prevent a templar from following his bent  or the leader of a free company answered the templar from dreading at the hands of a comrade and friend the injustice he does to all mankind  this is unprofitable and perilous recrimination answered de bracy suffice it to say i know the morals of the templeorder and i will not give thee the power of cheating me out of the fair prey for which i have run such risks  psha replied the templar what hast thou to fearthou knowest the vows of our order  right well said de bracy and also how they are kept come sir templar the laws of gallantry have a liberal interpretation in palestine and this is a case in which i will trust nothing to your conscience  hear the truth then said the templar i care not for your blueeyed beauty there is in that train one who will make me a better mate  what wouldst thou stoop to the waiting damsel said de bracy  no sir knight said the templar haughtily to the waitingwoman will i not stoop i have a prize among the captives as lovely as thine own  by the mass thou meanest the fair jewess said de bracy  and if i do said boisguilbert who shall gainsay me  no one that i know said de bracy unless it be your vow of celibacy or a cheek of conscience for an intrigue with a jewess  for my vow said the templar our grand master hath granted me a dispensation and for my conscience a man that has slain three hundred saracens need not reckon up every little failing like a village girl at her first confession upon good friday eve  thou knowest best thine own privileges said de bracy yet i would have sworn thy thought had been more on the old usurers money bags than on the black eyes of the daughter  i can admire both answered the templar besides the old jew is but halfprize i must share his spoils with frontdeboeuf who will not lend us the use of his castle for nothing i must have something that i can term exclusively my own by this foray of ours and i have fixed on the lovely jewess as my peculiar prize but now thou knowest my drift thou wilt resume thine own original plan wilt thou notthou hast nothing thou seest to fear from my interference  no replied de bracy i will remain beside my prize what thou sayst is passing true but i like not the privileges acquired by the dispensation of the grand master and the merit acquired by the slaughter of three hundred saracens you have too good a right to a free pardon to render you very scrupulous about peccadilloes  while this dialogue was proceeding cedric was endeavouring to wring out of those who guarded him an avowal of their character and purpose you should be englishmen said he and yet sacred heaven you prey upon your countrymen as if you were very normans you should be my neighbours and if so my friends for which of my english neighbours have reason to be otherwise i tell ye yeomen that even those among ye who have been branded with outlawry have had from me protection for i have pitied their miseries and curst the oppression of their tyrannic nobles what then would you have of me or in what can this violence serve yeye are worse than brute beasts in your actions and will you imitate them in their very dumbness  it was in vain that cedric expostulated with his guards who had too many good reasons for their silence to be induced to break it either by his wrath or his expostulations they continued to hurry him along travelling at a very rapid rate until at the end of an avenue of huge trees arose torquilstone now the hoary and ancient castle of reginald frontdeboeuf it was a fortress of no great size consisting of a donjon or large and high square tower surrounded by buildings of inferior height which were encircled by an inner courtyard around the exterior wall was a deep moat supplied with water from a neighbouring rivulet frontdeboeuf whose character placed him often at feud with his enemies had made considerable additions to the strength of his castle by building towers upon the outward wall so as to flank it at every angle the access as usual in castles of the period lay through an arched barbican or outwork which was terminated and defended by a small turret at each corner  cedric no sooner saw the turrets of frontdeboeufs castle raise their grey and mossgrown battlements glimmering in the morning sun above the wood by which they were surrounded than he instantly augured more truly concerning the cause of his misfortune  i did injustice he said to the thieves and outlaws of these woods when i supposed such banditti to belong to their bands i might as justly have confounded the foxes of these brakes with the ravening wolves of france tell me dogsis it my life or my wealth that your master aims at is it too much that two saxons myself and the noble athelstane should hold land in the country which was once the patrimony of our raceput us then to death and complete your tyranny by taking our lives as you began with our liberties if the saxon cedric cannot rescue england he is willing to die for her tell your tyrannical master i do only beseech him to dismiss the lady rowena in honour and safety she is a woman and he need not dread her and with us will die all who dare fight in her cause  the attendants remained as mute to this address as to the former and they now stood before the gate of the castle de bracy winded his horn three times and the archers and crossbow men who had manned the wall upon seeing their approach hastened to lower the drawbridge and admit them the prisoners were compelled by their guards to alight and were conducted to an apartment where a hasty repast was offered them of which none but athelstane felt any inclination to partake neither had the descendant of the confessor much time to do justice to the good cheer placed before them for their guards gave him and cedric to understand that they were to be imprisoned in a chamber apart from rowena resistance was vain and they were compelled to follow to a large room which rising on clumsy saxon pillars resembled those refectories and chapterhouses which may be still seen in the most ancient parts of our most ancient monasteries  the lady rowena was next separated from her train and conducted with courtesy indeed but still without consulting her inclination to a distant apartment the same alarming distinction was conferred on rebecca in spite of her fathers entreaties who offered even money in this extremity of distress that she might be permitted to abide with him base unbeliever answered one of his guards when thou hast seen thy lair thou wilt not wish thy daughter to partake it and without farther discussion the old jew was forcibly dragged off in a different direction from the other prisoners the domestics after being carefully searched and disarmed were confined in another part of the castle and rowena was refused even the comfort she might have derived from the attendance of her handmaiden elgitha  the apartment in which the saxon chiefs were confined for to them we turn our first attention although at present used as a sort of guardroom had formerly been the great hall of the castle it was now abandoned to meaner purposes because the present lord among other additions to the convenience security and beauty of his baronial residence had erected a new and noble hall whose vaulted roof was supported by lighter and more elegant pillars and fitted up with that higher degree of ornament which the normans had already introduced into architecture  cedric paced the apartment filled with indignant reflections on the past and on the present while the apathy of his companion served instead of patience and philosophy to defend him against every thing save the inconvenience of the present moment and so little did he feel even this last that he was only from time to time roused to a reply by cedrics animated and impassioned appeal to him  yes said cedric half speaking to himself and half addressing himself to athelstane it was in this very hall that my father feasted with torquil wolfganger when he entertained the valiant and unfortunate harold then advancing against the norwegians who had united themselves to the rebel tosti it was in this hall that harold returned the magnanimous answer to the ambassador of his rebel brother oft have i heard my father kindle as he told the tale the envoy of tosti was admitted when this ample room could scarce contain the crowd of noble saxon leaders who were quaffing the bloodred wine around their monarch  i hope said athelstane somewhat moved by this part of his friends discourse they will not forget to send us some wine and refactions at noonwe had scarce a breathingspace allowed to break our fast and i never have the benefit of my food when i eat immediately after dismounting from horseback though the leeches recommend that practice  cedric went on with his story without noticing this interjectional observation of his friend  the envoy of tosti he said moved up the hall undismayed by the frowning countenances of all around him until he made his obeisance before the throne of king harold  what terms he said lord king hath thy brother tosti to hope if he should lay down his arms and crave peace at thy hands  a brothers love cried the generous harold and the fair earldom of northumberland  but should tosti accept these terms continued the envoy what lands shall be assigned to his faithful ally hardrada king of norway  seven feet of english ground answered harold fiercely or as hardrada is said to be a giant perhaps we may allow him twelve inches more  the hall rung with acclamations and cup and horn was filled to the norwegian who should be speedily in possession of his english territory  i could have pledged him with all my soul said athelstane for my tongue cleaves to my palate  the baffled envoy continued cedric pursuing with animation his tale though it interested not the listener retreated to carry to tosti and his ally the ominous answer of his injured brother it was then that the distant towers of york and the bloody streams of the derwent 26 beheld that direful conflict in which after displaying the most undaunted valour the king of norway and tosti both fell with ten thousand of their bravest followers who would have thought that upon the proud day when this battle was won the very gale which waved the saxon banners in triumph was filling the norman sails and impelling them to the fatal shores of sussexwho would have thought that harold within a few brief days would himself possess no more of his kingdom than the share which he allotted in his wrath to the norwegian invaderwho would have thought that you noble athelstanethat you descended of harolds blood and that i whose father was not the worst defender of the saxon crown should be prisoners to a vile norman in the very hall in which our ancestors held such high festival  it is sad enough replied athelstane but i trust they will hold us to a moderate ransomat any rate it cannot be their purpose to starve us outright and yet although it is high noon i see no preparations for serving dinner look up at the window noble cedric and judge by the sunbeams if it is not on the verge of noon  it may be so answered cedric but i cannot look on that stained lattice without its awakening other reflections than those which concern the passing moment or its privations when that window was wrought my noble friend our hardy fathers knew not the art of making glass or of staining itthe pride of wolfgangers father brought an artist from normandy to adorn his hall with this new species of emblazonment that breaks the golden light of gods blessed day into so many fantastic hues the foreigner came here poor beggarly cringing and subservient ready to doff his cap to the meanest native of the household he returned pampered and proud to tell his rapacious countrymen of the wealth and the simplicity of the saxon noblesa folly oh athelstane foreboded of old as well as foreseen by those descendants of hengist and his hardy tribes who retained the simplicity of their manners we made these strangers our bosom friends our confidential servants we borrowed their artists and their arts and despised the honest simplicity and hardihood with which our brave ancestors supported themselves and we became enervated by norman arts long ere we fell under norman arms far better was our homely diet eaten in peace and liberty than the luxurious dainties the love of which hath delivered us as bondsmen to the foreign conqueror  i should replied athelstane hold very humble diet a luxury at present and it astonishes me noble cedric that you can bear so truly in mind the memory of past deeds when it appeareth you forget the very hour of dinner  it is time lost muttered cedric apart and impatiently to speak to him of aught else but that which concerns his appetite the soul of hardicanute hath taken possession of him and he hath no pleasure save to fill to swill and to call for morealas said he looking at athelstane with compassion that so dull a spirit should be lodged in so goodly a form alas that such an enterprise as the regeneration of england should turn on a hinge so imperfect wedded to rowena indeed her nobler and more generous soul may yet awake the better nature which is torpid within him yet how should this be while rowena athelstane and i myself remain the prisoners of this brutal marauder and have been made so perhaps from a sense of the dangers which our liberty might bring to the usurped power of his nation  while the saxon was plunged in these painful reflections the door of their prison opened and gave entrance to a sewer holding his white rod of office this important person advanced into the chamber with a grave pace followed by four attendants bearing in a table covered with dishes the sight and smell of which seemed to be an instant compensation to athelstane for all the inconvenience he had undergone the persons who attended on the feast were masked and cloaked  what mummery is this said cedric think you that we are ignorant whose prisoners we are when we are in the castle of your master tell him he continued willing to use this opportunity to open a negotiation for his freedomtell your master reginald frontdeboeuf that we know no reason he can have for withholding our liberty excepting his unlawful desire to enrich himself at our expense tell him that we yield to his rapacity as in similar circumstances we should do to that of a literal robber let him name the ransom at which he rates our liberty and it shall be paid providing the exaction is suited to our means the sewer made no answer but bowed his head  and tell sir reginald frontdeboeuf said athelstane that i send him my mortal defiance and challenge him to combat with me on foot or horseback at any secure place within eight days after our liberation which if he be a true knight he will not under these circumstances venture to refuse or to delay  i shall deliver to the knight your defiance answered the sewer meanwhile i leave you to your food  the challenge of athelstane was delivered with no good grace for a large mouthful which required the exercise of both jaws at once added to a natural hesitation considerably damped the effect of the bold defiance it contained still however his speech was hailed by cedric as an incontestible token of reviving spirit in his companion whose previous indifference had begun notwithstanding his respect for athelstanes descent to wear out his patience but he now cordially shook hands with him in token of his approbation and was somewhat grieved when athelstane observed that he would fight a dozen such men as frontdeboeuf if by so doing he could hasten his departure from a dungeon where they put so much garlic into their pottage notwithstanding this intimation of a relapse into the apathy of sensuality cedric placed himself opposite to athelstane and soon showed that if the distresses of his country could banish the recollection of food while the table was uncovered yet no sooner were the victuals put there than he proved that the appetite of his saxon ancestors had descended to him along with their other qualities  the captives had not long enjoyed their refreshment however ere their attention was disturbed even from this most serious occupation by the blast of a horn winded before the gate it was repeated three times with as much violence as if it had been blown before an enchanted castle by the destined knight at whose summons halls and towers barbican and battlement were to roll off like a morning vapour the saxons started from the table and hastened to the window but their curiosity was disappointed for these outlets only looked upon the court of the castle and the sound came from beyond its precincts the summons however seemed of importance for a considerable degree of bustle instantly took place in the castle     chapter xxii       my daughtero my ducatso my daughter      o my christian ducats      justicethe lawmy ducats and my daughter      merchant of venice  leaving the saxon chiefs to return to their banquet as soon as their ungratified curiosity should permit them to attend to the calls of their halfsatiated appetite we have to look in upon the yet more severe imprisonment of isaac of york the poor jew had been hastily thrust into a dungeonvault of the castle the floor of which was deep beneath the level of the ground and very damp being lower than even the moat itself the only light was received through one or two loopholes far above the reach of the captives hand these apertures admitted even at midday only a dim and uncertain light which was changed for utter darkness long before the rest of the castle had lost the blessing of day chains and shackles which had been the portion of former captives from whom active exertions to escape had been apprehended hung rusted and empty on the walls of the prison and in the rings of one of those sets of fetters there remained two mouldering bones which seemed to have been once those of the human leg as if some prisoner had been left not only to perish there but to be consumed to a skeleton  at one end of this ghastly apartment was a large firegrate over the top of which were stretched some transverse iron bars half devoured with rust  the whole appearance of the dungeon might have appalled a stouter heart than that of isaac who nevertheless was more composed under the imminent pressure of danger than he had seemed to be while affected by terrors of which the cause was as yet remote and contingent the lovers of the chase say that the hare feels more agony during the pursuit of the greyhounds than when she is struggling in their fangs 27  and thus it is probable that the jews by the very frequency of their fear on all occasions had their minds in some degree prepared for every effort of tyranny which could be practised upon them so that no aggression when it had taken place could bring with it that surprise which is the most disabling quality of terror neither was it the first time that isaac had been placed in circumstances so dangerous he had therefore experience to guide him as well as hope that he might again as formerly be delivered as a prey from the fowler above all he had upon his side the unyielding obstinacy of his nation and that unbending resolution with which israelites have been frequently known to submit to the uttermost evils which power and violence can inflict upon them rather than gratify their oppressors by granting their demands  in this humour of passive resistance and with his garment collected beneath him to keep his limbs from the wet pavement isaac sat in a corner of his dungeon where his folded hands his dishevelled hair and beard his furred cloak and high cap seen by the wiry and broken light would have afforded a study for rembrandt had that celebrated painter existed at the period the jew remained without altering his position for nearly three hours at the expiry of which steps were heard on the dungeon stair the bolts screamed as they were withdrawnthe hinges creaked as the wicket opened and reginald frontdeboeuf followed by the two saracen slaves of the templar entered the prison  frontdeboeuf a tall and strong man whose life had been spent in public war or in private feuds and broils and who had hesitated at no means of extending his feudal power had features corresponding to his character and which strongly expressed the fiercer and more malignant passions of the mind the scars with which his visage was seamed would on features of a different cast have excited the sympathy and veneration due to the marks of honourable valour but in the peculiar case of frontdeboeuf they only added to the ferocity of his countenance and to the dread which his presence inspired this formidable baron was clad in a leathern doublet fitted close to his body which was frayed and soiled with the stains of his armour he had no weapon excepting a poniard at his belt which served to counterbalance the weight of the bunch of rusty keys that hung at his right side  the black slaves who attended frontdeboeuf were stripped of their gorgeous apparel and attired in jerkins and trowsers of coarse linen their sleeves being tucked up above the elbow like those of butchers when about to exercise their function in the slaughterhouse each had in his hand a small pannier and when they entered the dungeon they stopt at the door until frontdeboeuf himself carefully locked and doublelocked it having taken this precaution he advanced slowly up the apartment towards the jew upon whom he kept his eye fixed as if he wished to paralyze him with his glance as some animals are said to fascinate their prey it seemed indeed as if the sullen and malignant eye of frontdeboeuf possessed some portion of that supposed power over his unfortunate prisoner the jew sat with his mouth agape and his eyes fixed on the savage baron with such earnestness of terror that his frame seemed literally to shrink together and to diminish in size while encountering the fierce normans fixed and baleful gaze the unhappy isaac was deprived not only of the power of rising to make the obeisance which his terror dictated but he could not even doff his cap or utter any word of supplication so strongly was he agitated by the conviction that tortures and death were impending over him  on the other hand the stately form of the norman appeared to dilate in magnitude like that of the eagle which ruffles up its plumage when about to pounce on its defenceless prey he paused within three steps of the corner in which the unfortunate jew had now as it were coiled himself up into the smallest possible space and made a sign for one of the slaves to approach the black satellite came forward accordingly and producing from his basket a large pair of scales and several weights he laid them at the feet of frontdeboeuf and again retired to the respectful distance at which his companion had already taken his station  the motions of these men were slow and solemn as if there impended over their souls some preconception of horror and of cruelty frontdeboeuf himself opened the scene by thus addressing his illfated captive  most accursed dog of an accursed race he said awaking with his deep and sullen voice the sullen echoes of his dungeon vault seest thou these scales  the unhappy jew returned a feeble affirmative  in these very scales shalt thou weigh me out said the relentless baron a thousand silver pounds after the just measure and weight of the tower of london  holy abraham returned the jew finding voice through the very extremity of his danger heard man ever such a demandwho ever heard even in a minstrels tale of such a sum as a thousand pounds of silverwhat human sight was ever blessed with the vision of such a mass of treasurenot within the walls of york ransack my house and that of all my tribe wilt thou find the tithe of that huge sum of silver that thou speakest of  i am reasonable answered frontdeboeuf and if silver be scant i refuse not gold at the rate of a mark of gold for each six pounds of silver thou shalt free thy unbelieving carcass from such punishment as thy heart has never even conceived  have mercy on me noble knight exclaimed isaac i am old and poor and helpless it were unworthy to triumph over meit is a poor deed to crush a worm  old thou mayst be replied the knight more shame to their folly who have suffered thee to grow grey in usury and knaveryfeeble thou mayst be for when had a jew either heart or handbut rich it is well known thou art  i swear to you noble knight said the jew by all which i believe and by all which we believe in common  perjure not thyself said the norman interrupting him and let not thine obstinacy seal thy doom until thou hast seen and well considered the fate that awaits thee think not i speak to thee only to excite thy terror and practise on the base cowardice thou hast derived from thy tribe i swear to thee by that which thou dost not believe by the gospel which our church teaches and by the keys which are given her to bind and to loose that my purpose is deep and peremptory this dungeon is no place for trifling prisoners ten thousand times more distinguished than thou have died within these walls and their fate hath never been known but for thee is reserved a long and lingering death to which theirs were luxury  he again made a signal for the slaves to approach and spoke to them apart in their own language for he also had been in palestine where perhaps he had learnt his lesson of cruelty the saracens produced from their baskets a quantity of charcoal a pair of bellows and a flask of oil while the one struck a light with a flint and steel the other disposed the charcoal in the large rusty grate which we have already mentioned and exercised the bellows until the fuel came to a red glow  seest thou isaac said frontdeboeuf the range of iron bars above the glowing charcoal 28 on that warm couch thou shalt lie stripped of thy clothes as if thou wert to rest on a bed of down one of these slaves shall maintain the fire beneath thee while the other shall anoint thy wretched limbs with oil lest the roast should burnnow choose betwixt such a scorching bed and the payment of a thousand pounds of silver for by the head of my father thou hast no other option  it is impossible exclaimed the miserable jewit is impossible that your purpose can be real the good god of nature never made a heart capable of exercising such cruelty  trust not to that isaac said frontdeboeuf it were a fatal error dost thou think that i who have seen a town sacked in which thousands of my christian countrymen perished by sword by flood and by fire will blench from my purpose for the outcries or screams of one single wretched jewor thinkest thou that these swarthy slaves who have neither law country nor conscience but their masters willwho use the poison or the stake or the poniard or the cord at his slightest winkthinkest thou that they will have mercy who do not even understand the language in which it is askedbe wise old man discharge thyself of a portion of thy superfluous wealth repay to the hands of a christian a part of what thou hast acquired by the usury thou hast practised on those of his religion thy cunning may soon swell out once more thy shrivelled purse but neither leech nor medicine can restore thy scorched hide and flesh wert thou once stretched on these bars tell down thy ransom i say and rejoice that at such rate thou canst redeem thee from a dungeon the secrets of which few have returned to tell i waste no more words with theechoose between thy dross and thy flesh and blood and as thou choosest so shall it be  so may abraham jacob and all the fathers of our people assist me said isaac i cannot make the choice because i have not the means of satisfying your exorbitant demand  seize him and strip him slaves said the knight and let the fathers of his race assist him if they can  the assistants taking their directions more from the barons eye and his hand than his tongue once more stepped forward laid hands on the unfortunate isaac plucked him up from the ground and holding him between them waited the hardhearted barons farther signal the unhappy jew eyed their countenances and that of frontdeboeuf in hope of discovering some symptoms of relenting but that of the baron exhibited the same cold halfsullen halfsarcastic smile which had been the prelude to his cruelty and the savage eyes of the saracens rolling gloomily under their dark brows acquiring a yet more sinister expression by the whiteness of the circle which surrounds the pupil evinced rather the secret pleasure which they expected from the approaching scene than any reluctance to be its directors or agents the jew then looked at the glowing furnace over which he was presently to be stretched and seeing no chance of his tormentors relenting his resolution gave way  i will pay he said the thousand pounds of silverthat is he added after a moments pause i will pay it with the help of my brethren for i must beg as a mendicant at the door of our synagogue ere i make up so unheardof a sumwhen and where must it be delivered  here replied frontdeboeuf here it must be deliveredweighed it must beweighed and told down on this very dungeon floorthinkest thou i will part with thee until thy ransom is secure  and what is to be my surety said the jew that i shall be at liberty after this ransom is paid  the word of a norman noble thou pawnbroking slave answered frontdeboeuf the faith of a norman nobleman more pure than the gold and silver of thee and all thy tribe  i crave pardon noble lord said isaac timidly but wherefore should i rely wholly on the word of one who will trust nothing to mine  because thou canst not help it jew said the knight sternly wert thou now in thy treasurechamber at york and were i craving a loan of thy shekels it would be thine to dictate the time of payment and the pledge of security this is my treasurechamber here i have thee at advantage nor will i again deign to repeat the terms on which i grant thee liberty  the jew groaned deeplygrant me he said at least with my own liberty that of the companions with whom i travel they scorned me as a jew yet they pitied my desolation and because they tarried to aid me by the way a share of my evil hath come upon them moreover they may contribute in some sort to my ransom  if thou meanest yonder saxon churls said frontdeboeuf their ransom will depend upon other terms than thine mind thine own concerns jew i warn thee and meddle not with those of others  i am then said isaac only to be set at liberty together with mine wounded friend  shall i twice recommend it said frontdeboeuf to a son of israel to meddle with his own concerns and leave those of others alonesince thou hast made thy choice it remains but that thou payest down thy ransom and that at a short day  yet hear me said the jewfor the sake of that very wealth which thou wouldst obtain at the expense of thy here he stopt short afraid of irritating the savage norman but frontdeboeuf only laughed and himself filled up the blank at which the jew had hesitated  at the expense of my conscience thou wouldst say isaac speak it outi tell thee i am reasonable i can bear the reproaches of a loser even when that loser is a jew thou wert not so patient isaac when thou didst invoke justice against jacques fitzdotterel for calling thee a usurious bloodsucker when thy exactions had devoured his patrimony  i swear by the talmud said the jew that your valour has been misled in that matter fitzdotterel drew his poniard upon me in mine own chamber because i craved him for mine own silver the term of payment was due at the passover  i care not what he did said frontdeboeuf the question is when shall i have mine ownwhen shall i have the shekels isaac  let my daughter rebecca go forth to york answered isaac with your safe conduct noble knight and so soon as man and horse can return the treasure here he groaned deeply but added after the pause of a few secondsthe treasure shall be told down on this very floor  thy daughter said frontdeboeuf as if surprisedby heavens isaac i would i had known of this i deemed that yonder blackbrowed girl had been thy concubine and i gave her to be a handmaiden to sir brian de boisguilbert after the fashion of patriarchs and heroes of the days of old who set us in these matters a wholesome example  the yell which isaac raised at this unfeeling communication made the very vault to ring and astounded the two saracens so much that they let go their hold of the jew he availed himself of his enlargement to throw himself on the pavement and clasp the knees of frontdeboeuf  take all that you have asked said he sir knighttake ten times morereduce me to ruin and to beggary if thou wiltnay pierce me with thy poniard broil me on that furnace but spare my daughter deliver her in safety and honouras thou art born of woman spare the honour of a helpless maidenshe is the image of my deceased rachel she is the last of six pledges of her lovewill you deprive a widowed husband of his sole remaining comfortwill you reduce a father to wish that his only living child were laid beside her dead mother in the tomb of our fathers  i would said the norman somewhat relenting that i had known of this before i thought your race had loved nothing save their moneybags  think not so vilely of us jews though we be said isaac eager to improve the moment of apparent sympathy the hunted fox the tortured wildcat loves its youngthe despised and persecuted race of abraham love their children  be it so said frontdeboeuf i will believe it in future isaac for thy very sakebut it aids us not now i cannot help what has happened or what is to follow my word is passed to my comrade in arms nor would i break it for ten jews and jewesses to boot besides why shouldst thou think evil is to come to the girl even if she became boisguilberts booty  there will there must exclaimed isaac wringing his hands in agony when did templars breathe aught but cruelty to men and dishonour to women  dog of an infidel said frontdeboeuf with sparkling eyes and not sorry perhaps to seize a pretext for working himself into a passion blaspheme not the holy order of the temple of zion but take thought instead to pay me the ransom thou hast promised or woe betide thy jewish throat  robber and villain said the jew retorting the insults of his oppressor with passion which however impotent he now found it impossible to bridle i will pay thee nothingnot one silver penny will i pay thee unless my daughter is delivered to me in safety and honour  art thou in thy senses israelite said the norman sternlyhas thy flesh and blood a charm against heated iron and scalding oil  i care not said the jew rendered desperate by paternal affection do thy worst my daughter is my flesh and blood dearer to me a thousand times than those limbs which thy cruelty threatens no silver will i give thee unless i were to pour it molten down thy avaricious throatno not a silver penny will i give thee nazarene were it to save thee from the deep damnation thy whole life has merited take my life if thou wilt and say the jew amidst his tortures knew how to disappoint the christian  we shall see that said frontdeboeuf for by the blessed rood which is the abomination of thy accursed tribe thou shalt feel the extremities of fire and steelstrip him slaves and chain him down upon the bars  in spite of the feeble struggles of the old man the saracens had already torn from him his upper garment and were proceeding totally to disrobe him when the sound of a bugle twice winded without the castle penetrated even to the recesses of the dungeon and immediately after loud voices were heard calling for sir reginald frontdeboeuf unwilling to be found engaged in his hellish occupation the savage baron gave the slaves a signal to restore isaacs garment and quitting the dungeon with his attendants he left the jew to thank god for his own deliverance or to lament over his daughters captivity and probable fate as his personal or parental feelings might prove strongest     chapter xxiii       nay if the gentle spirit of moving words      can no way change you to a milder form      ill woo you like a soldier at arms end      and love you gainst the nature of love force you      two gentlemen of verona  the apartment to which the lady rowena had been introduced was fitted up with some rude attempts at ornament and magnificence and her being placed there might be considered as a peculiar mark of respect not offered to the other prisoners but the wife of frontdeboeuf for whom it had been originally furnished was long dead and decay and neglect had impaired the few ornaments with which her taste had adorned it the tapestry hung down from the walls in many places and in others was tarnished and faded under the effects of the sun or tattered and decayed by age desolate however as it was this was the apartment of the castle which had been judged most fitting for the accommodation of the saxon heiress and here she was left to meditate upon her fate until the actors in this nefarious drama had arranged the several parts which each of them was to perform this had been settled in a council held by frontdeboeuf de bracy and the templar in which after a long and warm debate concerning the several advantages which each insisted upon deriving from his peculiar share in this audacious enterprise they had at length determined the fate of their unhappy prisoners  it was about the hour of noon therefore when de bracy for whose advantage the expedition had been first planned appeared to prosecute his views upon the hand and possessions of the lady rowena  the interval had not entirely been bestowed in holding council with his confederates for de bracy had found leisure to decorate his person with all the foppery of the times his green cassock and vizard were now flung aside his long luxuriant hair was trained to flow in quaint tresses down his richly furred cloak his beard was closely shaved his doublet reached to the middle of his leg and the girdle which secured it and at the same time supported his ponderous sword was embroidered and embossed with gold work we have already noticed the extravagant fashion of the shoes at this period and the points of maurice de bracys might have challenged the prize of extravagance with the gayest being turned up and twisted like the horns of a ram such was the dress of a gallant of the period and in the present instance that effect was aided by the handsome person and good demeanour of the wearer whose manners partook alike of the grace of a courtier and the frankness of a soldier  he saluted rowena by doffing his velvet bonnet garnished with a golden broach representing st michael trampling down the prince of evil with this he gently motioned the lady to a seat and as she still retained her standing posture the knight ungloved his right hand and motioned to conduct her thither but rowena declined by her gesture the proffered compliment and replied if i be in the presence of my jailor sir knightnor will circumstances allow me to think otherwiseit best becomes his prisoner to remain standing till she learns her doom  alas fair rowena returned de bracy you are in presence of your captive not your jailor and it is from your fair eyes that de bracy must receive that doom which you fondly expect from him  i know you not sir said the lady drawing herself up with all the pride of offended rank and beauty i know you notand the insolent familiarity with which you apply to me the jargon of a troubadour forms no apology for the violence of a robber  to thyself fair maid answered de bracy in his former toneto thine own charms be ascribed whateer i have done which passed the respect due to her whom i have chosen queen of my heart and lodestar of my eyes  i repeat to you sir knight that i know you not and that no man wearing chain and spurs ought thus to intrude himself upon the presence of an unprotected lady  that i am unknown to you said de bracy is indeed my misfortune yet let me hope that de bracys name has not been always unspoken when minstrels or heralds have praised deeds of chivalry whether in the lists or in the battlefield  to heralds and to minstrels then leave thy praise sir knight replied rowena more suiting for their mouths than for thine own and tell me which of them shall record in song or in book of tourney the memorable conquest of this night a conquest obtained over an old man followed by a few timid hinds and its booty an unfortunate maiden transported against her will to the castle of a robber  you are unjust lady rowena said the knight biting his lips in some confusion and speaking in a tone more natural to him than that of affected gallantry which he had at first adopted yourself free from passion you can allow no excuse for the frenzy of another although caused by your own beauty  i pray you sir knight said rowena to cease a language so commonly used by strolling minstrels that it becomes not the mouth of knights or nobles certes you constrain me to sit down since you enter upon such commonplace terms of which each vile crowder hath a stock that might last from hence to christmas  proud damsel said de bracy incensed at finding his gallant style procured him nothing but contemptproud damsel thou shalt be as proudly encountered know then that i have supported my pretensions to your hand in the way that best suited thy character it is meeter for thy humour to be wooed with bow and bill than in set terms and in courtly language  courtesy of tongue said rowena when it is used to veil churlishness of deed is but a knights girdle around the breast of a base clown i wonder not that the restraint appears to gall youmore it were for your honour to have retained the dress and language of an outlaw than to veil the deeds of one under an affectation of gentle language and demeanour  you counsel well lady said the norman and in the bold language which best justifies bold action i tell thee thou shalt never leave this castle or thou shalt leave it as maurice de bracys wife i am not wont to be baffled in my enterprises nor needs a norman noble scrupulously to vindicate his conduct to the saxon maiden whom he distinguishes by the offer of his hand thou art proud rowena and thou art the fitter to be my wife by what other means couldst thou be raised to high honour and to princely place saving by my alliance how else wouldst thou escape from the mean precincts of a country grange where saxons herd with the swine which form their wealth to take thy seat honoured as thou shouldst be and shalt be amid all in england that is distinguished by beauty or dignified by power  sir knight replied rowena the grange which you contemn hath been my shelter from infancy and trust me when i leave itshould that day ever arriveit shall be with one who has not learnt to despise the dwelling and manners in which i have been brought up  i guess your meaning lady said de bracy though you may think it lies too obscure for my apprehension but dream not that richard coeur de lion will ever resume his throne far less that wilfred of ivanhoe his minion will ever lead thee to his footstool to be there welcomed as the bride of a favourite another suitor might feel jealousy while he touched this string but my firm purpose cannot be changed by a passion so childish and so hopeless know lady that this rival is in my power and that it rests but with me to betray the secret of his being within the castle to frontdeboeuf whose jealousy will be more fatal than mine  wilfred here said rowena in disdain that is as true as that frontdeboeuf is his rival  de bracy looked at her steadily for an instant  wert thou really ignorant of this said he didst thou not know that wilfred of ivanhoe travelled in the litter of the jewa meet conveyance for the crusader whose doughty arm was to reconquer the holy sepulchre and he laughed scornfully  and if he is here said rowena compelling herself to a tone of indifference though trembling with an agony of apprehension which she could not suppress in what is he the rival of frontdeboeuf or what has he to fear beyond a short imprisonment and an honourable ransom according to the use of chivalry  rowena said de bracy art thou too deceived by the common error of thy sex who think there can be no rivalry but that respecting their own charms knowest thou not there is a jealousy of ambition and of wealth as well as of love and that this our host frontdeboeuf will push from his road him who opposes his claim to the fair barony of ivanhoe as readily eagerly and unscrupulously as if he were preferred to him by some blueeyed damsel but smile on my suit lady and the wounded champion shall have nothing to fear from frontdeboeuf whom else thou mayst mourn for as in the hands of one who has never shown compassion  save him for the love of heaven said rowena her firmness giving way under terror for her lovers impending fate  i cani willit is my purpose said de bracy for when rowena consents to be the bride of de bracy who is it shall dare to put forth a violent hand upon her kinsmanthe son of her guardianthe companion of her youth but it is thy love must buy his protection i am not romantic fool enough to further the fortune or avert the fate of one who is likely to be a successful obstacle between me and my wishes use thine influence with me in his behalf and he is saferefuse to employ it wilfred dies and thou thyself art not the nearer to freedom  thy language answered rowena hath in its indifferent bluntness something which cannot be reconciled with the horrors it seems to express i believe not that thy purpose is so wicked or thy power so great  flatter thyself then with that belief said de bracy until time shall prove it false thy lover lies wounded in this castlethy preferred lover he is a bar betwixt frontdeboeuf and that which frontdeboeuf loves better than either ambition or beauty what will it cost beyond the blow of a poniard or the thrust of a javelin to silence his opposition for ever nay were frontdeboeuf afraid to justify a deed so open let the leech but give his patient a wrong draughtlet the chamberlain or the nurse who tends him but pluck the pillow from his head and wilfred in his present condition is sped without the effusion of blood cedric also  and cedric also said rowena repeating his words my noblemy generous guardian i deserved the evil i have encountered for forgetting his fate even in that of his son  cedrics fate also depends upon thy determination said de bracy and i leave thee to form it  hitherto rowena had sustained her part in this trying scene with undismayed courage but it was because she had not considered the danger as serious and imminent her disposition was naturally that which physiognomists consider as proper to fair complexions mild timid and gentle but it had been tempered and as it were hardened by the circumstances of her education accustomed to see the will of all even of cedric himself sufficiently arbitrary with others give way before her wishes she had acquired that sort of courage and selfconfidence which arises from the habitual and constant deference of the circle in which we move she could scarce conceive the possibility of her will being opposed far less that of its being treated with total disregard  her haughtiness and habit of domination was therefore a fictitious character induced over that which was natural to her and it deserted her when her eyes were opened to the extent of her own danger as well as that of her lover and her guardian and when she found her will the slightest expression of which was wont to command respect and attention now placed in opposition to that of a man of a strong fierce and determined mind who possessed the advantage over her and was resolved to use it she quailed before him  after casting her eyes around as if to look for the aid which was nowhere to be found and after a few broken interjections she raised her hands to heaven and burst into a passion of uncontrolled vexation and sorrow it was impossible to see so beautiful a creature in such extremity without feeling for her and de bracy was not unmoved though he was yet more embarrassed than touched he had in truth gone too far to recede and yet in rowenas present condition she could not be acted on either by argument or threats he paced the apartment to and fro now vainly exhorting the terrified maiden to compose herself now hesitating concerning his own line of conduct  if thought he i should be moved by the tears and sorrow of this disconsolate damsel what should i reap but the loss of these fair hopes for which i have encountered so much risk and the ridicule of prince john and his jovial comrades and yet he said to himself i feel myself ill framed for the part which i am playing i cannot look on so fair a face while it is disturbed with agony or on those eyes when they are drowned in tears i would she had retained her original haughtiness of disposition or that i had a larger share of frontdeboeufs thricetempered hardness of heart  agitated by these thoughts he could only bid the unfortunate rowena be comforted and assure her that as yet she had no reason for the excess of despair to which she was now giving way but in this task of consolation de bracy was interrupted by the horn hoarsewinded blowing far and keen which had at the same time alarmed the other inmates of the castle and interrupted their several plans of avarice and of license of them all perhaps de bracy least regretted the interruption for his conference with the lady rowena had arrived at a point where he found it equally difficult to prosecute or to resign his enterprise  and here we cannot but think it necessary to offer some better proof than the incidents of an idle tale to vindicate the melancholy representation of manners which has been just laid before the reader it is grievous to think that those valiant barons to whose stand against the crown the liberties of england were indebted for their existence should themselves have been such dreadful oppressors and capable of excesses contrary not only to the laws of england but to those of nature and humanity but alas we have only to extract from the industrious henry one of those numerous passages which he has collected from contemporary historians to prove that fiction itself can hardly reach the dark reality of the horrors of the period  the description given by the author of the saxon chronicle of the cruelties exercised in the reign of king stephen by the great barons and lords of castles who were all normans affords a strong proof of the excesses of which they were capable when their passions were inflamed they grievously oppressed the poor people by building castles and when they were built they filled them with wicked men or rather devils who seized both men and women who they imagined had any money threw them into prison and put them to more cruel tortures than the martyrs ever endured they suffocated some in mud and suspended others by the feet or the head or the thumbs kindling fires below them they squeezed the heads of some with knotted cords till they pierced their brains while they threw others into dungeons swarming with serpents snakes and toads but it would be cruel to put the reader to the pain of perusing the remainder of this description 29  as another instance of these bitter fruits of conquest and perhaps the strongest that can be quoted we may mention that the princess matilda though a daughter of the king of scotland and afterwards both queen of england niece to edgar atheling and mother to the empress of germany the daughter the wife and the mother of monarchs was obliged during her early residence for education in england to assume the veil of a nun as the only means of escaping the licentious pursuit of the norman nobles this excuse she stated before a great council of the clergy of england as the sole reason for her having taken the religious habit the assembled clergy admitted the validity of the plea and the notoriety of the circumstances upon which it was founded giving thus an indubitable and most remarkable testimony to the existence of that disgraceful license by which that age was stained it was a matter of public knowledge they said that after the conquest of king william his norman followers elated by so great a victory acknowledged no law but their own wicked pleasure and not only despoiled the conquered saxons of their lands and their goods but invaded the honour of their wives and of their daughters with the most unbridled license and hence it was then common for matrons and maidens of noble families to assume the veil and take shelter in convents not as called thither by the vocation of god but solely to preserve their honour from the unbridled wickedness of man  such and so licentious were the times as announced by the public declaration of the assembled clergy recorded by eadmer and we need add nothing more to vindicate the probability of the scenes which we have detailed and are about to detail upon the more apocryphal authority of the wardour ms     chapter xxiv       ill woo her as the lion woos his bride      douglas  while the scenes we have described were passing in other parts of the castle the jewess rebecca awaited her fate in a distant and sequestered turret hither she had been led by two of her disguised ravishers and on being thrust into the little cell she found herself in the presence of an old sibyl who kept murmuring to herself a saxon rhyme as if to beat time to the revolving dance which her spindle was performing upon the floor the hag raised her head as rebecca entered and scowled at the fair jewess with the malignant envy with which old age and ugliness when united with evil conditions are apt to look upon youth and beauty  thou must up and away old housecricket said one of the men our noble master commands itthou must een leave this chamber to a fairer guest  ay grumbled the hag even thus is service requited i have known when my bare word would have cast the best manatarms among ye out of saddle and out of service and now must i up and away at the command of every groom such as thou  good dame urfried said the other man stand not to reason on it but up and away lords hests must be listened to with a quick ear thou hast had thy day old dame but thy sun has long been set thou art now the very emblem of an old warhorse turned out on the barren heaththou hast had thy paces in thy time but now a broken amble is the best of themcome amble off with thee  ill omens dog ye both said the old woman and a kennel be your buryingplace may the evil demon zernebock tear me limb from limb if i leave my own cell ere i have spun out the hemp on my distaff  answer it to our lord then old housefiend said the man and retired leaving rebecca in company with the old woman upon whose presence she had been thus unwillingly forced  what devils deed have they now in the wind said the old hag murmuring to herself yet from time to time casting a sidelong and malignant glance at rebecca but it is easy to guessbright eyes black locks and a skin like paper ere the priest stains it with his black unguentay it is easy to guess why they send her to this lone turret whence a shriek could no more be heard than at the depth of five hundred fathoms beneath the earththou wilt have owls for thy neighbours fair one and their screams will be heard as far and as much regarded as thine own outlandish too she said marking the dress and turban of rebeccawhat country art thou ofa saracen or an egyptianwhy dost not answerthou canst weep canst thou not speak  be not angry good mother said rebecca  thou needst say no more replied urfried men know a fox by the train and a jewess by her tongue  for the sake of mercy said rebecca tell me what i am to expect as the conclusion of the violence which hath dragged me hither is it my life they seek to atone for my religion i will lay it down cheerfully  thy life minion answered the sibyl what would taking thy life pleasure themtrust me thy life is in no peril such usage shalt thou have as was once thought good enough for a noble saxon maiden and shall a jewess like thee repine because she hath no better look at mei was as young and twice as fair as thou when frontdeboeuf father of this reginald and his normans stormed this castle my father and his seven sons defended their inheritance from story to story from chamber to chamberthere was not a room not a step of the stair that was not slippery with their blood they diedthey died every man and ere their bodies were cold and ere their blood was dried i had become the prey and the scorn of the conqueror  is there no helpare there no means of escape said rebeccarichly richly would i requite thine aid  think not of it said the hag from hence there is no escape but through the gates of death and it is late late she added shaking her grey head ere these open to usyet it is comfort to think that we leave behind us on earth those who shall be wretched as ourselves fare thee well jewessjew or gentile thy fate would be the same for thou hast to do with them that have neither scruple nor pity fare thee well i say my thread is spun outthy task is yet to begin  stay stay for heavens sake said rebecca stay though it be to curse and to revile methy presence is yet some protection  the presence of the mother of god were no protection answered the old woman there she stands pointing to a rude image of the virgin mary see if she can avert the fate that awaits thee  she left the room as she spoke her features writhed into a sort of sneering laugh which made them seem even more hideous than their habitual frown she locked the door behind her and rebecca might hear her curse every step for its steepness as slowly and with difficulty she descended the turretstair  rebecca was now to expect a fate even more dreadful than that of rowena for what probability was there that either softness or ceremony would be used towards one of her oppressed race whatever shadow of these might be preserved towards a saxon heiress yet had the jewess this advantage that she was better prepared by habits of thought and by natural strength of mind to encounter the dangers to which she was exposed of a strong and observing character even from her earliest years the pomp and wealth which her father displayed within his walls or which she witnessed in the houses of other wealthy hebrews had not been able to blind her to the precarious circumstances under which they were enjoyed like damocles at his celebrated banquet rebecca perpetually beheld amid that gorgeous display the sword which was suspended over the heads of her people by a single hair these reflections had tamed and brought down to a pitch of sounder judgment a temper which under other circumstances might have waxed haughty supercilious and obstinate  from her fathers example and injunctions rebecca had learnt to bear herself courteously towards all who approached her she could not indeed imitate his excess of subservience because she was a stranger to the meanness of mind and to the constant state of timid apprehension by which it was dictated but she bore herself with a proud humility as if submitting to the evil circumstances in which she was placed as the daughter of a despised race while she felt in her mind the consciousness that she was entitled to hold a higher rank from her merit than the arbitrary despotism of religious prejudice permitted her to aspire to  thus prepared to expect adverse circumstances she had acquired the firmness necessary for acting under them her present situation required all her presence of mind and she summoned it up accordingly  her first care was to inspect the apartment but it afforded few hopes either of escape or protection it contained neither secret passage nor trapdoor and unless where the door by which she had entered joined the main building seemed to be circumscribed by the round exterior wall of the turret the door had no inside bolt or bar the single window opened upon an embattled space surmounting the turret which gave rebecca at first sight some hopes of escaping but she soon found it had no communication with any other part of the battlements being an isolated bartisan or balcony secured as usual by a parapet with embrasures at which a few archers might be stationed for defending the turret and flanking with their shot the wall of the castle on that side  there was therefore no hope but in passive fortitude and in that strong reliance on heaven natural to great and generous characters rebecca however erroneously taught to interpret the promises of scripture to the chosen people of heaven did not err in supposing the present to be their hour of trial or in trusting that the children of zion would be one day called in with the fulness of the gentiles in the meanwhile all around her showed that their present state was that of punishment and probation and that it was their especial duty to suffer without sinning thus prepared to consider herself as the victim of misfortune rebecca had early reflected upon her own state and schooled her mind to meet the dangers which she had probably to encounter  the prisoner trembled however and changed colour when a step was heard on the stair and the door of the turretchamber slowly opened and a tall man dressed as one of those banditti to whom they owed their misfortune slowly entered and shut the door behind him his cap pulled down upon his brows concealed the upper part of his face and he held his mantle in such a manner as to muffle the rest in this guise as if prepared for the execution of some deed at the thought of which he was himself ashamed he stood before the affrighted prisoner yet ruffian as his dress bespoke him he seemed at a loss to express what purpose had brought him thither so that rebecca making an effort upon herself had time to anticipate his explanation she had already unclasped two costly bracelets and a collar which she hastened to proffer to the supposed outlaw concluding naturally that to gratify his avarice was to bespeak his favour  take these she said good friend and for gods sake be merciful to me and my aged father these ornaments are of value yet are they trifling to what he would bestow to obtain our dismissal from this castle free and uninjured  fair flower of palestine replied the outlaw these pearls are orient but they yield in whiteness to your teeth the diamonds are brilliant but they cannot match your eyes and ever since i have taken up this wild trade i have made a vow to prefer beauty to wealth  do not do yourself such wrong said rebecca take ransom and have mercygold will purchase you pleasureto misuse us could only bring thee remorse my father will willingly satiate thy utmost wishes and if thou wilt act wisely thou mayst purchase with our spoils thy restoration to civil societymayst obtain pardon for past errors and be placed beyond the necessity of committing more  it is well spoken replied the outlaw in french finding it difficult probably to sustain in saxon a conversation which rebecca had opened in that language but know bright lily of the vale of baca that thy father is already in the hands of a powerful alchemist who knows how to convert into gold and silver even the rusty bars of a dungeon grate the venerable isaac is subjected to an alembic which will distil from him all he holds dear without any assistance from my requests or thy entreaty the ransom must be paid by love and beauty and in no other coin will i accept it  thou art no outlaw said rebecca in the same language in which he addressed her no outlaw had refused such offers no outlaw in this land uses the dialect in which thou hast spoken thou art no outlaw but a normana norman noble perhaps in birtho be so in thy actions and cast off this fearful mask of outrage and violence  and thou who canst guess so truly said brian de boisguilbert dropping the mantle from his face art no true daughter of israel but in all save youth and beauty a very witch of endor i am not an outlaw then fair rose of sharon and i am one who will be more prompt to hang thy neck and arms with pearls and diamonds which so well become them than to deprive thee of these ornaments  what wouldst thou have of me said rebecca if not my wealthwe can have nought in common between usyou are a christiani am a jewessour union were contrary to the laws alike of the church and the synagogue  it were so indeed replied the templar laughing wed with a jewess despardieuxnot if she were the queen of sheba and know besides sweet daughter of zion that were the most christian king to offer me his most christian daughter with languedoc for a dowery i could not wed her it is against my vow to love any maiden otherwise than par amours as i will love thee i am a templar behold the cross of my holy order  darest thou appeal to it said rebecca on an occasion like the present  and if i do so said the templar it concerns not thee who art no believer in the blessed sign of our salvation  i believe as my fathers taught said rebecca and may god forgive my belief if erroneous but you sir knight what is yours when you appeal without scruple to that which you deem most holy even while you are about to transgress the most solemn of your vows as a knight and as a man of religion  it is gravely and well preached o daughter of sirach answered the templar but gentle ecclesiastics thy narrow jewish prejudices make thee blind to our high privilege marriage were an enduring crime on the part of a templar but what lesser folly i may practise i shall speedily be absolved from at the next preceptory of our order not the wisest of monarchs not his father whose examples you must needs allow are weighty claimed wider privileges than we poor soldiers of the temple of zion have won by our zeal in its defence the protectors of solomons temple may claim license by the example of solomon  if thou readest the scripture said the jewess and the lives of the saints only to justify thine own license and profligacy thy crime is like that of him who extracts poison from the most healthful and necessary herbs  the eyes of the templar flashed fire at this reproofhearken he said rebecca i have hitherto spoken mildly to thee but now my language shall be that of a conqueror thou art the captive of my bow and spearsubject to my will by the laws of all nations nor will i abate an inch of my right or abstain from taking by violence what thou refusest to entreaty or necessity  stand back said rebeccastand back and hear me ere thou offerest to commit a sin so deadly my strength thou mayst indeed overpower for god made women weak and trusted their defence to mans generosity but i will proclaim thy villainy templar from one end of europe to the other i will owe to the superstition of thy brethren what their compassion might refuse me each preceptoryeach chapter of thy order shall learn that like a heretic thou hast sinned with a jewess those who tremble not at thy crime will hold thee accursed for having so far dishonoured the cross thou wearest as to follow a daughter of my people  thou art keenwitted jewess replied the templar well aware of the truth of what she spoke and that the rules of his order condemned in the most positive manner and under high penalties such intrigues as he now prosecuted and that in some instances even degradation had followed upon itthou art sharpwitted he said but loud must be thy voice of complaint if it is heard beyond the iron walls of this castle within these murmurs laments appeals to justice and screams for help die alike silent away one thing only can save thee rebecca submit to thy fateembrace our religion and thou shalt go forth in such state that many a norman lady shall yield as well in pomp as in beauty to the favourite of the best lance among the defenders of the temple  submit to my fate said rebeccaand sacred heaven to what fateembrace thy religion and what religion can it be that harbours such a villainthou the best lance of the templarscraven knightforsworn priest i spit at thee and i defy theethe god of abrahams promise hath opened an escape to his daughtereven from this abyss of infamy  as she spoke she threw open the latticed window which led to the bartisan and in an instant after stood on the very verge of the parapet with not the slightest screen between her and the tremendous depth below unprepared for such a desperate effort for she had hitherto stood perfectly motionless boisguilbert had neither time to intercept nor to stop her as he offered to advance she exclaimed remain where thou art proud templar or at thy choice advanceone foot nearer and i plunge myself from the precipice my body shall be crushed out of the very form of humanity upon the stones of that courtyard ere it become the victim of thy brutality  as she spoke this she clasped her hands and extended them towards heaven as if imploring mercy on her soul before she made the final plunge the templar hesitated and a resolution which had never yielded to pity or distress gave way to his admiration of her fortitude come down he said rash girli swear by earth and sea and sky i will offer thee no offence  i will not trust thee templar said rebecca thou hast taught me better how to estimate the virtues of thine order the next preceptory would grant thee absolution for an oath the keeping of which concerned nought but the honour or the dishonour of a miserable jewish maiden  you do me injustice exclaimed the templar fervently i swear to you by the name which i bearby the cross on my bosomby the sword on my sideby the ancient crest of my fathers do i swear i will do thee no injury whatsoever if not for thyself yet for thy fathers sake forbear i will be his friend and in this castle he will need a powerful one  alas said rebecca i know it but too welldare i trust thee  may my arms be reversed and my name dishonoured said brian de boisguilbert if thou shalt have reason to complain of me many a law many a commandment have i broken but my word never  i will then trust thee said rebecca thus far and she descended from the verge of the battlement but remained standing close by one of the embrasures or machicolles as they were then calledhere she said i take my stand remain where thou art and if thou shalt attempt to diminish by one step the distance now between us thou shalt see that the jewish maiden will rather trust her soul with god than her honour to the templar  while rebecca spoke thus her high and firm resolve which corresponded so well with the expressive beauty of her countenance gave to her looks air and manner a dignity that seemed more than mortal her glance quailed not her cheek blanched not for the fear of a fate so instant and so horrible on the contrary the thought that she had her fate at her command and could escape at will from infamy to death gave a yet deeper colour of carnation to her complexion and a yet more brilliant fire to her eye boisguilbert proud himself and highspirited thought he had never beheld beauty so animated and so commanding  let there be peace between us rebecca he said  peace if thou wilt answered rebeccapeacebut with this space between  thou needst no longer fear me said boisguilbert  i fear thee not replied she thanks to him that reared this dizzy tower so high that nought could fall from it and livethanks to him and to the god of israeli fear thee not  thou dost me injustice said the templar by earth sea and sky thou dost me injustice i am not naturally that which you have seen me hard selfish and relentless it was woman that taught me cruelty and on woman therefore i have exercised it but not upon such as thou hear me rebeccanever did knight take lance in his hand with a heart more devoted to the lady of his love than brian de boisguilbert she the daughter of a petty baron who boasted for all his domains but a ruinous tower and an unproductive vineyard and some few leagues of the barren landes of bourdeaux her name was known wherever deeds of arms were done known wider than that of many a ladys that had a county for a doweryyes he continued pacing up and down the little platform with an animation in which he seemed to lose all consciousness of rebeccas presenceyes my deeds my danger my blood made the name of adelaide de montemare known from the court of castile to that of byzantium and how was i requitedwhen i returned with my dearbought honours purchased by toil and blood i found her wedded to a gascon squire whose name was never heard beyond the limits of his own paltry domain truly did i love her and bitterly did i revenge me of her broken faith but my vengeance has recoiled on myself since that day i have separated myself from life and its tiesmy manhood must know no domestic homemust be soothed by no affectionate wifemy age must know no kindly hearthmy grave must be solitary and no offspring must outlive me to bear the ancient name of boisguilbert at the feet of my superior i have laid down the right of selfactionthe privilege of independence the templar a serf in all but the name can possess neither lands nor goods and lives moves and breathes but at the will and pleasure of another  alas said rebecca what advantages could compensate for such an absolute sacrifice  the power of vengeance rebecca replied the templar and the prospects of ambition  an evil recompense said rebecca for the surrender of the rights which are dearest to humanity  say not so maiden answered the templar revenge is a feast for the gods and if they have reserved it as priests tell us to themselves it is because they hold it an enjoyment too precious for the possession of mere mortalsand ambition it is a temptation which could disturb even the bliss of heaven itselfhe paused a moment and then added rebecca she who could prefer death to dishonour must have a proud and a powerful soul mine thou must benay start not he added it must be with thine own consent and on thine own terms thou must consent to share with me hopes more extended than can be viewed from the throne of a monarchhear me ere you answer and judge ere you refusethe templar loses as thou hast said his social rights his power of free agency but he becomes a member and a limb of a mighty body before which thrones already trembleeven as the single drop of rain which mixes with the sea becomes an individual part of that resistless ocean which undermines rocks and ingulfs royal armadas such a swelling flood is that powerful league of this mighty order i am no mean member but already one of the chief commanders and may well aspire one day to hold the batoon of grand master the poor soldiers of the temple will not alone place their foot upon the necks of kingsa hempsandalld monk can do that our mailed step shall ascend their throneour gauntlet shall wrench the sceptre from their gripe not the reign of your vainlyexpected messiah offers such power to your dispersed tribes as my ambition may aim at i have sought but a kindred spirit to share it and i have found such in thee  sayest thou this to one of my people answered rebecca bethink thee  answer me not said the templar by urging the difference of our creeds within our secret conclaves we hold these nursery tales in derision think not we long remained blind to the idiotical folly of our founders who forswore every delight of life for the pleasure of dying martyrs by hunger by thirst and by pestilence and by the swords of savages while they vainly strove to defend a barren desert valuable only in the eyes of superstition our order soon adopted bolder and wider views and found out a better indemnification for our sacrifices our immense possessions in every kingdom of europe our high military fame which brings within our circle the flower of chivalry from every christian climethese are dedicated to ends of which our pious founders little dreamed and which are equally concealed from such weak spirits as embrace our order on the ancient principles and whose superstition makes them our passive tools but i will not further withdraw the veil of our mysteries that buglesound announces something which may require my presence think on what i have saidfarewelli do not say forgive me the violence i have threatened for it was necessary to the display of thy character gold can be only known by the application of the touchstone i will soon return and hold further conference with thee  he reentered the turretchamber and descended the stair leaving rebecca scarcely more terrified at the prospect of the death to which she had been so lately exposed than at the furious ambition of the bold bad man in whose power she found herself so unhappily placed when she entered the turretchamber her first duty was to return thanks to the god of jacob for the protection which he had afforded her and to implore its continuance for her and for her father another name glided into her petitionit was that of the wounded christian whom fate had placed in the hands of bloodthirsty men his avowed enemies her heart indeed checked her as if even in communing with the deity in prayer she mingled in her devotions the recollection of one with whose fate hers could have no alliancea nazarene and an enemy to her faith but the petition was already breathed nor could all the narrow prejudices of her sect induce rebecca to wish it recalled     chapter xxv    a damnd cramp piece of penmanship as ever i saw in my life   she stoops to conquer  when the templar reached the hall of the castle he found de bracy already there your lovesuit said de bracy hath i suppose been disturbed like mine by this obstreperous summons but you have come later and more reluctantly and therefore i presume your interview has proved more agreeable than mine  has your suit then been unsuccessfully paid to the saxon heiress said the templar  by the bones of thomas a becket answered de bracy the lady rowena must have heard that i cannot endure the sight of womens tears  away said the templar thou a leader of a free company and regard a womans tears a few drops sprinkled on the torch of love make the flame blaze the brighter  gramercy for the few drops of thy sprinkling replied de bracy but this damsel hath wept enough to extinguish a beaconlight never was such wringing of hands and such overflowing of eyes since the days of st niobe of whom prior aymer told us 30 a waterfiend hath possessed the fair saxon  a legion of fiends have occupied the bosom of the jewess replied the templar for i think no single one not even apollyon himself could have inspired such indomitable pride and resolutionbut where is frontdeboeuf that horn is sounded more and more clamorously  he is negotiating with the jew i suppose replied de bracy coolly probably the howls of isaac have drowned the blast of the bugle thou mayst know by experience sir brian that a jew parting with his treasures on such terms as our friend frontdeboeuf is like to offer will raise a clamour loud enough to be heard over twenty horns and trumpets to boot but we will make the vassals call him  they were soon after joined by frontdeboeuf who had been disturbed in his tyrannic cruelty in the manner with which the reader is acquainted and had only tarried to give some necessary directions  let us see the cause of this cursed clamour said frontdeboeufhere is a letter and if i mistake not it is in saxon  he looked at it turning it round and round as if he had had really some hopes of coming at the meaning by inverting the position of the paper and then handed it to de bracy  it may be magic spells for aught i know said de bracy who possessed his full proportion of the ignorance which characterised the chivalry of the period our chaplain attempted to teach me to write he said but all my letters were formed like spearheads and swordblades and so the old shaveling gave up the task  give it me said the templar we have that of the priestly character that we have some knowledge to enlighten our valour  let us profit by your most reverend knowledge then said de bracy what says the scroll  it is a formal letter of defiance answered the templar but by our lady of bethlehem if it be not a foolish jest it is the most extraordinary cartel that ever was sent across the drawbridge of a baronial castle  jest said frontdeboeuf i would gladly know who dares jest with me in such a matterread it sir brian  the templar accordingly read it as followsi wamba the son of witless jester to a noble and freeborn man cedric of rotherwood called the saxonand i gurth the son of beowulph the swineherd  thou art mad said frontdeboeuf interrupting the reader  by st luke it is so set down answered the templar then resuming his task he went oni gurth the son of beowulph swineherd unto the said cedric with the assistance of our allies and confederates who make common cause with us in this our feud namely the good knight called for the present le noir faineant and the stout yeoman robert locksley called cleavethewand do you reginald front deboeuf and your allies and accomplices whomsoever to wit that whereas you have without cause given or feud declared wrongfully and by mastery seized upon the person of our lord and master the said cedric also upon the person of a noble and freeborn damsel the lady rowena of hargottstandstede also upon the person of a noble and freeborn man athelstane of coningsburgh also upon the persons of certain freeborn men their cnichts also upon certain serfs their born bondsmen also upon a certain jew named isaac of york together with his daughter a jewess and certain horses and mules which noble persons with their cnichts and slaves and also with the horses and mules jew and jewess beforesaid were all in peace with his majesty and travelling as liege subjects upon the kings highway therefore we require and demand that the said noble persons namely cedric of rotherwood rowena of hargottstandstede athelstane of coningsburgh with their servants cnichts and followers also the horses and mules jew and jewess aforesaid together with all goods and chattels to them pertaining be within an hour after the delivery hereof delivered to us or to those whom we shall appoint to receive the same and that untouched and unharmed in body and goods failing of which we do pronounce to you that we hold ye as robbers and traitors and will wager our bodies against ye in battle siege or otherwise and do our utmost to your annoyance and destruction wherefore may god have you in his keepingsigned by us upon the eve of st witholds day under the great trysting oak in the harthill walk the above being written by a holy man clerk to god our lady and st dunstan in the chapel of copmanhurst  at the bottom of this document was scrawled in the first place a rude sketch of a cocks head and comb with a legend expressing this hieroglyphic to be the signmanual of wamba son of witless under this respectable emblem stood a cross stated to be the mark of gurth the son of beowulph then was written in rough bold characters the words le noir faineant and to conclude the whole an arrow neatly enough drawn was described as the mark of the yeoman locksley  the knights heard this uncommon document read from end to end and then gazed upon each other in silent amazement as being utterly at a loss to know what it could portend de bracy was the first to break silence by an uncontrollable fit of laughter wherein he was joined though with more moderation by the templar frontdeboeuf on the contrary seemed impatient of their illtimed jocularity  i give you plain warning he said fair sirs that you had better consult how to bear yourselves under these circumstances than give way to such misplaced merriment  frontdeboeuf has not recovered his temper since his late overthrow said de bracy to the templar he is cowed at the very idea of a cartel though it come but from a fool and a swineherd  by st michael answered frontdeboeuf i would thou couldst stand the whole brunt of this adventure thyself de bracy these fellows dared not have acted with such inconceivable impudence had they not been supported by some strong bands there are enough of outlaws in this forest to resent my protecting the deer i did but tie one fellow who was taken redhanded and in the fact to the horns of a wild stag which gored him to death in five minutes and i had as many arrows shot at me as there were launched against yonder target at ashbyhere fellow he added to one of his attendants hast thou sent out to see by what force this precious challenge is to be supported  there are at least two hundred men assembled in the woods answered a squire who was in attendance  here is a proper matter said frontdeboeuf this comes of lending you the use of my castle that cannot manage your undertaking quietly but you must bring this nest of hornets about my ears  of hornets said de bracy of stingless drones rather a band of lazy knaves who take to the wood and destroy the venison rather than labour for their maintenance  stingless replied frontdeboeuf forkheaded shafts of a clothyard in length and these shot within the breadth of a french crown are sting enough  for shame sir knight said the templar let us summon our people and sally forth upon them one knightay one manatarms were enough for twenty such peasants  enough and too much said de bracy i should only be ashamed to couch lance against them  true answered frontdeboeuf were they black turks or moors sir templar or the craven peasants of france most valiant de bracy but these are english yeomen over whom we shall have no advantage save what we may derive from our arms and horses which will avail us little in the glades of the forest sally saidst thou we have scarce men enough to defend the castle the best of mine are at york so is all your band de bracy and we have scarcely twenty besides the handful that were engaged in this mad business  thou dost not fear said the templar that they can assemble in force sufficient to attempt the castle  not so sir brian answered frontdeboeuf these outlaws have indeed a daring captain but without machines scaling ladders and experienced leaders my castle may defy them  send to thy neighbours said the templar let them assemble their people and come to the rescue of three knights besieged by a jester and a swineherd in the baronial castle of reginald frontdeboeuf  you jest sir knight answered the baron but to whom should i sendmalvoisin is by this time at york with his retainers and so are my other allies and so should i have been but for this infernal enterprise  then send to york and recall our people said de bracy if they abide the shaking of my standard or the sight of my free companions i will give them credit for the boldest outlaws ever bent bow in greenwood  and who shall bear such a message said frontdeboeuf they will beset every path and rip the errand out of his bosomi have it he added after pausing for a momentsir templar thou canst write as well as read and if we can but find the writing materials of my chaplain who died a twelvemonth since in the midst of his christmas carousals  so please ye said the squire who was still in attendance i think old urfried has them somewhere in keeping for love of the confessor he was the last man i have heard her tell who ever said aught to her which man ought in courtesy to address to maid or matron  go search them out engelred said frontdeboeuf and then sir templar thou shalt return an answer to this bold challenge  i would rather do it at the swords point than at that of the pen said boisguilbert but be it as you will  he sat down accordingly and indited in the french language an epistle of the following tenorsir reginald frontdeboeuf with his noble and knightly allies and confederates receive no defiances at the hands of slaves bondsmen or fugitives if the person calling himself the black knight have indeed a claim to the honours of chivalry he ought to know that he stands degraded by his present association and has no right to ask reckoning at the hands of good men of noble blood touching the prisoners we have made we do in christian charity require you to send a man of religion to receive their confession and reconcile them with god since it is our fixed intention to execute them this morning before noon so that their heads being placed on the battlements shall show to all men how lightly we esteem those who have bestirred themselves in their rescue wherefore as above we require you to send a priest to reconcile them to god in doing which you shall render them the last earthly service  this letter being folded was delivered to the squire and by him to the messenger who waited without as the answer to that which he had brought  the yeoman having thus accomplished his mission returned to the headquarters of the allies which were for the present established under a venerable oaktree about three arrowflights distant from the castle here wamba and gurth with their allies the black knight and locksley and the jovial hermit awaited with impatience an answer to their summons around and at a distance from them were seen many a bold yeoman whose silvan dress and weatherbeaten countenances showed the ordinary nature of their occupation more than two hundred had already assembled and others were fast coming in those whom they obeyed as leaders were only distinguished from the others by a feather in the cap their dress arms and equipments being in all other respects the same  besides these bands a less orderly and a worse armed force consisting of the saxon inhabitants of the neighbouring township as well as many bondsmen and servants from cedrics extensive estate had already arrived for the purpose of assisting in his rescue few of these were armed otherwise than with such rustic weapons as necessity sometimes converts to military purposes boarspears scythes flails and the like were their chief arms for the normans with the usual policy of conquerors were jealous of permitting to the vanquished saxons the possession or the use of swords and spears these circumstances rendered the assistance of the saxons far from being so formidable to the besieged as the strength of the men themselves their superior numbers and the animation inspired by a just cause might otherwise well have made them it was to the leaders of this motley army that the letter of the templar was now delivered  reference was at first made to the chaplain for an exposition of its contents  by the crook of st dunstan said that worthy ecclesiastic which hath brought more sheep within the sheepfold than the crook of eer another saint in paradise i swear that i cannot expound unto you this jargon which whether it be french or arabic is beyond my guess  he then gave the letter to gurth who shook his head gruffly and passed it to wamba the jester looked at each of the four corners of the paper with such a grin of affected intelligence as a monkey is apt to assume upon similar occasions then cut a caper and gave the letter to locksley  if the long letters were bows and the short letters broad arrows i might know something of the matter said the brave yeoman but as the matter stands the meaning is as safe for me as the stag thats at twelve miles distance  i must be clerk then said the black knight and taking the letter from locksley he first read it over to himself and then explained the meaning in saxon to his confederates  execute the noble cedric exclaimed wamba by the rood thou must be mistaken sir knight  not i my worthy friend replied the knight i have explained the words as they are here set down  then by st thomas of canterbury replied gurth we will have the castle should we tear it down with our hands  we have nothing else to tear it with replied wamba but mine are scarce fit to make mammocks of freestone and mortar  tis but a contrivance to gain time said locksley they dare not do a deed for which i could exact a fearful penalty  i would said the black knight there were some one among us who could obtain admission into the castle and discover how the case stands with the besieged methinks as they require a confessor to be sent this holy hermit might at once exercise his pious vocation and procure us the information we desire  a plague on thee and thy advice said the pious hermit i tell thee sir slothful knight that when i doff my friars frock my priesthood my sanctity my very latin are put off along with it and when in my green jerkin i can better kill twenty deer than confess one christian  i fear said the black knight i fear greatly there is no one here that is qualified to take upon him for the nonce this same character of father confessor  all looked on each other and were silent  i see said wamba after a short pause that the fool must be still the fool and put his neck in the venture which wise men shrink from you must know my dear cousins and countrymen that i wore russet before i wore motley and was bred to be a friar until a brainfever came upon me and left me just wit enough to be a fool i trust with the assistance of the good hermits frock together with the priesthood sanctity and learning which are stitched into the cowl of it i shall be found qualified to administer both worldly and ghostly comfort to our worthy master cedric and his companions in adversity  hath he sense enough thinkst thou said the black knight addressing gurth  i know not said gurth but if he hath not it will be the first time he hath wanted wit to turn his folly to account  on with the frock then good fellow quoth the knight and let thy master send us an account of their situation within the castle their numbers must be few and it is five to one they may be accessible by a sudden and bold attack time wearsaway with thee  and in the meantime said locksley we will beset the place so closely that not so much as a fly shall carry news from thence so that my good friend he continued addressing wamba thou mayst assure these tyrants that whatever violence they exercise on the persons of their prisoners shall be most severely repaid upon their own  pax vobiscum said wamba who was now muffled in his religious disguise  and so saying he imitated the solemn and stately deportment of a friar and departed to execute his mission     chapter xxvi       the hottest horse will oft be cool      the dullest will show fire      the friar will often play the fool      the fool will play the friar      old song  when the jester arrayed in the cowl and frock of the hermit and having his knotted cord twisted round his middle stood before the portal of the castle of frontdeboeuf the warder demanded of him his name and errand  pax vobiscum answered the jester i am a poor brother of the order of st francis who come hither to do my office to certain unhappy prisoners now secured within this castle  thou art a bold friar said the warder to come hither where saving our own drunken confessor a cock of thy feather hath not crowed these twenty years  yet i pray thee do mine errand to the lord of the castle answered the pretended friar trust me it will find good acceptance with him and the cock shall crow that the whole castle shall hear him  gramercy said the warder but if i come to shame for leaving my post upon thine errand i will try whether a friars grey gown be proof against a greygoose shaft  with this threat he left his turret and carried to the hall of the castle his unwonted intelligence that a holy friar stood before the gate and demanded instant admission with no small wonder he received his masters commands to admit the holy man immediately and having previously manned the entrance to guard against surprise he obeyed without further scruple the commands which he had received the harebrained selfconceit which had emboldened wamba to undertake this dangerous office was scarce sufficient to support him when he found himself in the presence of a man so dreadful and so much dreaded as reginald frontdeboeuf and he brought out his pax vobiscum to which he in a good measure trusted for supporting his character with more anxiety and hesitation than had hitherto accompanied it but frontdeboeuf was accustomed to see men of all ranks tremble in his presence so that the timidity of the supposed father did not give him any cause of suspicion  who and whence art thou priest said he  pax vobiscum reiterated the jester i am a poor servant of st francis who travelling through this wilderness have fallen among thieves as scripture hath it quidam viator incidit in latrones which thieves have sent me unto this castle in order to do my ghostly office on two persons condemned by your honourable justice  ay right answered frontdeboeuf and canst thou tell me holy father the number of those banditti  gallant sir answered the jester nomen illis legio their name is legion  tell me in plain terms what numbers there are or priest thy cloak and cord will ill protect thee  alas said the supposed friar cor meum eructavit that is to say i was like to burst with fear but i conceive they may bewhat of yeomenwhat of commons at least five hundred men  what said the templar who came into the hall that moment muster the wasps so thick here it is time to stifle such a mischievous brood then taking frontdeboeuf aside knowest thou the priest  he is a stranger from a distant convent said frontdeboeuf i know him not  then trust him not with thy purpose in words answered the templar let him carry a written order to de bracys company of free companions to repair instantly to their masters aid in the meantime and that the shaveling may suspect nothing permit him to go freely about his task of preparing these saxon hogs for the slaughterhouse  it shall be so said frontdeboeuf and he forthwith appointed a domestic to conduct wamba to the apartment where cedric and athelstane were confined  the impatience of cedric had been rather enhanced than diminished by his confinement he walked from one end of the hall to the other with the attitude of one who advances to charge an enemy or to storm the breach of a beleaguered place sometimes ejaculating to himself sometimes addressing athelstane who stoutly and stoically awaited the issue of the adventure digesting in the meantime with great composure the liberal meal which he had made at noon and not greatly interesting himself about the duration of his captivity which he concluded would like all earthly evils find an end in heavens good time  pax vobiscum said the jester entering the apartment the blessing of st dunstan st dennis st duthoc and all other saints whatsoever be upon ye and about ye  enter freely answered cedric to the supposed friar with what intent art thou come hither  to bid you prepare yourselves for death answered the jester  it is impossible replied cedric starting fearless and wicked as they are they dare not attempt such open and gratuitous cruelty  alas said the jester to restrain them by their sense of humanity is the same as to stop a runaway horse with a bridle of silk thread bethink thee therefore noble cedric and you also gallant athelstane what crimes you have committed in the flesh for this very day will ye be called to answer at a higher tribunal  hearest thou this athelstane said cedric we must rouse up our hearts to this last action since better it is we should die like men than live like slaves  i am ready answered athelstane to stand the worst of their malice and shall walk to my death with as much composure as ever i did to my dinner  let us then unto our holy gear father said cedric  wait yet a moment good uncle said the jester in his natural tone better look long before you leap in the dark  by my faith said cedric i should know that voice  it is that of your trusty slave and jester answered wamba throwing back his cowl had you taken a fools advice formerly you would not have been here at all take a fools advice now and you will not be here long  how meanst thou knave answered the saxon  even thus replied wamba take thou this frock and cord which are all the orders i ever had and march quietly out of the castle leaving me your cloak and girdle to take the long leap in thy stead  leave thee in my stead said cedric astonished at the proposal why they would hang thee my poor knave  een let them do as they are permitted said wamba i trustno disparagement to your birththat the son of witless may hang in a chain with as much gravity as the chain hung upon his ancestor the alderman  well wamba answered cedric for one thing will i grant thy request and that is if thou wilt make the exchange of garments with lord athelstane instead of me  no by st dunstan answered wamba there were little reason in that good right there is that the son of witless should suffer to save the son of hereward but little wisdom there were in his dying for the benefit of one whose fathers were strangers to his  villain said cedric the fathers of athelstane were monarchs of england  they might be whomsoever they pleased replied wamba but my neck stands too straight upon my shoulders to have it twisted for their sake wherefore good my master either take my proffer yourself or suffer me to leave this dungeon as free as i entered  let the old tree wither continued cedric so the stately hope of the forest be preserved save the noble athelstane my trusty wamba it is the duty of each who has saxon blood in his veins thou and i will abide together the utmost rage of our injurious oppressors while he free and safe shall arouse the awakened spirits of our countrymen to avenge us  not so father cedric said athelstane grasping his handfor when roused to think or act his deeds and sentiments were not unbecoming his high racenot so he continued i would rather remain in this hall a week without food save the prisoners stinted loaf or drink save the prisoners measure of water than embrace the opportunity to escape which the slaves untaught kindness has purveyed for his master  you are called wise men sirs said the jester and i a crazed fool but uncle cedric and cousin athelstane the fool shall decide this controversy for ye and save ye the trouble of straining courtesies any farther i am like johnaducks mare that will let no man mount her but johnaduck i came to save my master and if he will not consentbastai can but go away home again kind service cannot be chucked from hand to hand like a shuttlecock or stoolball ill hang for no man but my own born master  go then noble cedric said athelstane neglect not this opportunity your presence without may encourage friends to our rescueyour remaining here would ruin us all  and is there any prospect then of rescue from without said cedric looking to the jester  prospect indeed echoed wamba let me tell you when you fill my cloak you are wrapped in a generals cassock five hundred men are there without and i was this morning one of the chief leaders my fools cap was a casque and my bauble a truncheon well we shall see what good they will make by exchanging a fool for a wise man truly i fear they will lose in valour what they may gain in discretion and so farewell master and be kind to poor gurth and his dog fangs and let my cockscomb hang in the hall at rotherwood in memory that i flung away my life for my master like a faithfulfool  the last word came out with a sort of double expression betwixt jest and earnest the tears stood in cedrics eyes  thy memory shall be preserved he said while fidelity and affection have honour upon earth but that i trust i shall find the means of saving rowena and thee athelstane and thee also my poor wamba thou shouldst not overbear me in this matter  the exchange of dress was now accomplished when a sudden doubt struck cedric  i know no language he said but my own and a few words of their mincing norman how shall i bear myself like a reverend brother  the spell lies in two words replied wambapax vobiscum will answer all queries if you go or come eat or drink bless or ban pax vobiscum carries you through it all it is as useful to a friar as a broomstick to a witch or a wand to a conjurer speak it but thus in a deep grave tonepax vobiscumit is irresistiblewatch and ward knight and squire foot and horse it acts as a charm upon them all i think if they bring me out to be hanged tomorrow as is much to be doubted they may i will try its weight upon the finisher of the sentence  if such prove the case said the master my religious orders are soon takenpax vobiscum i trust i shall remember the passwordnoble athelstane farewell and farewell my poor boy whose heart might make amends for a weaker headi will save you or return and die with you the royal blood of our saxon kings shall not be spilt while mine beats in my veins nor shall one hair fall from the head of the kind knave who risked himself for his master if cedrics peril can prevent itfarewell  farewell noble cedric said athelstane remember it is the true part of a friar to accept refreshment if you are offered any  farewell uncle added wamba and remember pax vobiscum  thus exhorted cedric sallied forth upon his expedition and it was not long ere he had occasion to try the force of that spell which his jester had recommended as omnipotent in a lowarched and dusky passage by which he endeavoured to work his way to the hall of the castle he was interrupted by a female form  pax vobiscum said the pseudo friar and was endeavouring to hurry past when a soft voice replied et vobisquaso domine reverendissime pro misericordia vestra  i am somewhat deaf replied cedric in good saxon and at the same time muttered to himself a curse on the fool and his pax vobiscum i have lost my javelin at the first cast  it was however no unusual thing for a priest of those days to be deaf of his latin ear and this the person who now addressed cedric knew full well  i pray you of dear love reverend father she replied in his own language that you will deign to visit with your ghostly comfort a wounded prisoner of this castle and have such compassion upon him and us as thy holy office teachesnever shall good deed so highly advantage thy convent  daughter answered cedric much embarrassed my time in this castle will not permit me to exercise the duties of mine officei must presently forththere is life and death upon my speed  yet father let me entreat you by the vow you have taken on you replied the suppliant not to leave the oppressed and endangered without counsel or succour  may the fiend fly away with me and leave me in ifrin with the souls of odin and of thor answered cedric impatiently and would probably have proceeded in the same tone of total departure from his spiritual character when the colloquy was interrupted by the harsh voice of urfried the old crone of the turret  how minion said she to the female speaker is this the manner in which you requite the kindness which permitted thee to leave thy prisoncell yonderputtest thou the reverend man to use ungracious language to free himself from the importunities of a jewess  a jewess said cedric availing himself of the information to get clear of their interruptionlet me pass woman stop me not at your peril i am fresh from my holy office and would avoid pollution  come this way father said the old hag thou art a stranger in this castle and canst not leave it without a guide come hither for i would speak with theeand you daughter of an accursed race go to the sick mans chamber and tend him until my return and woe betide you if you again quit it without my permission  rebecca retreated her importunities had prevailed upon urfried to suffer her to quit the turret and urfried had employed her services where she herself would most gladly have paid them by the bedside of the wounded ivanhoe with an understanding awake to their dangerous situation and prompt to avail herself of each means of safety which occurred rebecca had hoped something from the presence of a man of religion who she learned from urfried had penetrated into this godless castle she watched the return of the supposed ecclesiastic with the purpose of addressing him and interesting him in favour of the prisoners with what imperfect success the reader has been just acquainted     chapter xxvii       fond wretch and what canst thou relate      but deeds of sorrow shame and sin      thy deeds are provedthou knowst thy fate      but come thy talebeginbegin                but i have griefs of other kind      troubles and sorrows more severe      give me to ease my tortured mind      lend to my woes a patient ear      and let me if i may not find      a friend to helpfind one to hear      crabbes hall of justice  when urfried had with clamours and menaces driven rebecca back to the apartment from which she had sallied she proceeded to conduct the unwilling cedric into a small apartment the door of which she heedfully secured then fetching from a cupboard a stoup of wine and two flagons she placed them on the table and said in a tone rather asserting a fact than asking a question thou art saxon fatherdeny it not she continued observing that cedric hastened not to reply the sounds of my native language are sweet to mine ears though seldom heard save from the tongues of the wretched and degraded serfs on whom the proud normans impose the meanest drudgery of this dwelling thou art a saxon fathera saxon and save as thou art a servant of god a freemanthine accents are sweet in mine ear  do not saxon priests visit this castle then replied cedric it were methinks their duty to comfort the outcast and oppressed children of the soil  they come notor if they come they better love to revel at the boards of their conquerors answered urfried than to hear the groans of their countrymenso at least report speaks of themof myself i can say little this castle for ten years has opened to no priest save the debauched norman chaplain who partook the nightly revels of frontdeboeuf and he has been long gone to render an account of his stewardshipbut thou art a saxona saxon priest and i have one question to ask of thee  i am a saxon answered cedric but unworthy surely of the name of priest let me begone on my wayi swear i will return or send one of our fathers more worthy to hear your confession  stay yet a while said urfried the accents of the voice which thou hearest now will soon be choked with the cold earth and i would not descend to it like the beast i have lived but wine must give me strength to tell the horrors of my tale she poured out a cup and drank it with a frightful avidity which seemed desirous of draining the last drop in the goblet it stupifies she said looking upwards as she finished her drought but it cannot cheerpartake it father if you would hear my tale without sinking down upon the pavement cedric would have avoided pledging her in this ominous conviviality but the sign which she made to him expressed impatience and despair he complied with her request and answered her challenge in a large winecup she then proceeded with her story as if appeased by his complaisance  i was not born she said father the wretch that thou now seest me i was free was happy was honoured loved and was beloved i am now a slave miserable and degradedthe sport of my masters passions while i had yet beautythe object of their contempt scorn and hatred since it has passed away dost thou wonder father that i should hate mankind and above all the race that has wrought this change in me can the wrinkled decrepit hag before thee whose wrath must vent itself in impotent curses forget she was once the daughter of the noble thane of torquilstone before whose frown a thousand vassals trembled  thou the daughter of torquil wolfganger said cedric receding as he spoke thouthouthe daughter of that noble saxon my fathers friend and companion in arms  thy fathers friend echoed urfried then cedric called the saxon stands before me for the noble hereward of rotherwood had but one son whose name is well known among his countrymen but if thou art cedric of rotherwood why this religious dresshast thou too despaired of saving thy country and sought refuge from oppression in the shade of the convent  it matters not who i am said cedric proceed unhappy woman with thy tale of horror and guiltguilt there must bethere is guilt even in thy living to tell it  there isthere is answered the wretched woman deep black damning guiltguilt that lies like a load at my breastguilt that all the penitential fires of hereafter cannot cleanseyes in these halls stained with the noble and pure blood of my father and my brethrenin these very halls to have lived the paramour of their murderer the slave at once and the partaker of his pleasures was to render every breath which i drew of vital air a crime and a curse  wretched woman exclaimed cedric and while the friends of thy fatherwhile each true saxon heart as it breathed a requiem for his soul and those of his valiant sons forgot not in their prayers the murdered ulricawhile all mourned and honoured the dead thou hast lived to merit our hate and execrationlived to unite thyself with the vile tyrant who murdered thy nearest and dearestwho shed the blood of infancy rather than a male of the noble house of torquil wolfganger should survivewith him hast thou lived to unite thyself and in the hands of lawless love  in lawless hands indeed but not in those of love answered the hag love will sooner visit the regions of eternal doom than those unhallowed vaultsno with that at least i cannot reproach myselfhatred to frontdeboeuf and his race governed my soul most deeply even in the hour of his guilty endearments  you hated him and yet you lived replied cedric wretch was there no poniardno knifeno bodkinwell was it for thee since thou didst prize such an existence that the secrets of a norman castle are like those of the grave for had i but dreamed of the daughter of torquil living in foul communion with the murderer of her father the sword of a true saxon had found thee out even in the arms of thy paramour  wouldst thou indeed have done this justice to the name of torquil said ulrica for we may now lay aside her assumed name of urfried thou art then the true saxon report speaks thee for even within these accursed walls where as thou well sayest guilt shrouds itself in inscrutable mystery even there has the name of cedric been soundedand i wretched and degraded have rejoiced to think that there yet breathed an avenger of our unhappy nationi also have had my hours of vengeancei have fomented the quarrels of our foes and heated drunken revelry into murderous broili have seen their blood flowi have heard their dying groanslook on me cedricare there not still left on this foul and faded face some traces of the features of torquil  ask me not of them ulrica replied cedric in a tone of grief mixed with abhorrence these traces form such a resemblance as arises from the graves of the dead when a fiend has animated the lifeless corpse  be it so answered ulrica yet wore these fiendish features the mask of a spirit of light when they were able to set at variance the elder frontdeboeuf and his son reginald the darkness of hell should hide what followed but revenge must lift the veil and darkly intimate what it would raise the dead to speak aloud long had the smouldering fire of discord glowed between the tyrant father and his savage sonlong had i nursed in secret the unnatural hatredit blazed forth in an hour of drunken wassail and at his own board fell my oppressor by the hand of his own sonsuch are the secrets these vaults concealrend asunder ye accursed arches she added looking up towards the roof and bury in your fall all who are conscious of the hideous mystery  and thou creature of guilt and misery said cedric what became thy lot on the death of thy ravisher  guess it but ask it notherehere i dwelt till age premature age has stamped its ghastly features on my countenancescorned and insulted where i was once obeyed and compelled to bound the revenge which had once such ample scope to the efforts of petty malice of a discontented menial or the vain or unheeded curses of an impotent hagcondemned to hear from my lonely turret the sounds of revelry in which i once partook or the shrieks and groans of new victims of oppression  ulrica said cedric with a heart which still i fear regrets the lost reward of thy crimes as much as the deeds by which thou didst acquire that meed how didst thou dare to address thee to one who wears this robe consider unhappy woman what could the sainted edward himself do for thee were he here in bodily presence the royal confessor was endowed by heaven with power to cleanse the ulcers of the body but only god himself can cure the leprosy of the soul  yet turn not from me stern prophet of wrath she exclaimed but tell me if thou canst in what shall terminate these new and awful feelings that burst on my solitudewhy do deeds long since done rise before me in new and irresistible horrors what fate is prepared beyond the grave for her to whom god has assigned on earth a lot of such unspeakable wretchedness better had i turn to woden hertha and zernebockto mista and to skogula the gods of our yet unbaptized ancestors than endure the dreadful anticipations which have of late haunted my waking and my sleeping hours  i am no priest said cedric turning with disgust from this miserable picture of guilt wretchedness and despair i am no priest though i wear a priests garment  priest or layman answered ulrica thou art the first i have seen for twenty years by whom god was feared or man regarded and dost thou bid me despair  i bid thee repent said cedric seek to prayer and penance and mayest thou find acceptance but i cannot i will not longer abide with thee  stay yet a moment said ulrica leave me not now son of my fathers friend lest the demon who has governed my life should tempt me to avenge myself of thy hardhearted scornthinkest thou if frontdeboeuf found cedric the saxon in his castle in such a disguise that thy life would be a long onealready his eye has been upon thee like a falcon on his prey  and be it so said cedric and let him tear me with beak and talons ere my tongue say one word which my heart doth not warrant i will die a saxontrue in word open in deedi bid thee avaunttouch me not stay me notthe sight of frontdeboeuf himself is less odious to me than thou degraded and degenerate as thou art  be it so said ulrica no longer interrupting him go thy way and forget in the insolence of thy superority that the wretch before thee is the daughter of thy fathers friendgo thy wayif i am separated from mankind by my sufferingsseparated from those whose aid i might most justly expectnot less will i be separated from them in my revengeno man shall aid me but the ears of all men shall tingle to hear of the deed which i shall dare to dofarewellthy scorn has burst the last tie which seemed yet to unite me to my kinda thought that my woes might claim the compassion of my people  ulrica said cedric softened by this appeal hast thou borne up and endured to live through so much guilt and so much misery and wilt thou now yield to despair when thine eyes are opened to thy crimes and when repentance were thy fitter occupation  cedric answered ulrica thou little knowest the human heart to act as i have acted to think as i have thought requires the maddening love of pleasure mingled with the keen appetite of revenge the proud consciousness of power droughts too intoxicating for the human heart to bear and yet retain the power to prevent their force has long passed awayage has no pleasures wrinkles have no influence revenge itself dies away in impotent curses then comes remorse with all its vipers mixed with vain regrets for the past and despair for the futurethen when all other strong impulses have ceased we become like the fiends in hell who may feel remorse but never repentancebut thy words have awakened a new soul within mewell hast thou said all is possible for those who dare to diethou hast shown me the means of revenge and be assured i will embrace them it has hitherto shared this wasted bosom with other and with rival passionshenceforward it shall possess me wholly and thou thyself shalt say that whatever was the life of ulrica her death well became the daughter of the noble torquil there is a force without beleaguering this accursed castlehasten to lead them to the attack and when thou shalt see a red flag wave from the turret on the eastern angle of the donjon press the normans hardthey will then have enough to do within and you may win the wall in spite both of bow and mangonelbegone i pray theefollow thine own fate and leave me to mine  cedric would have enquired farther into the purpose which she thus darkly announced but the stern voice of frontdeboeuf was heard exclaiming where tarries this loitering priest by the scallopshell of compostella i will make a martyr of him if he loiters here to hatch treason among my domestics  what a true prophet said ulrica is an evil conscience but heed him notout and to thy peoplecry your saxon onslaught and let them sing their warsong of rollo if they will vengeance shall bear a burden to it  as she thus spoke she vanished through a private door and reginald frontdeboeuf entered the apartment cedric with some difficulty compelled himself to make obeisance to the haughty baron who returned his courtesy with a slight inclination of the head  thy penitents father have made a long shriftit is the better for them since it is the last they shall ever make hast thou prepared them for death  i found them said cedric in such french as he could command expecting the worst from the moment they knew into whose power they had fallen  how now sir friar replied frontdeboeuf thy speech methinks smacks of a saxon tongue  i was bred in the convent of st withold of burton answered cedric  ay said the baron it had been better for thee to have been a norman and better for my purpose too but need has no choice of messengers that st witholds of burton is an owlets nest worth the harrying the day will soon come that the frock shall protect the saxon as little as the mailcoat  gods will be done said cedric in a voice tremulous with passion which frontdeboeuf imputed to fear  i see said he thou dreamest already that our menatarms are in thy refectory and thy alevaults but do me one cast of thy holy office and come what list of others thou shalt sleep as safe in thy cell as a snail within his shell of proof  speak your commands said cedric with suppressed emotion  follow me through this passage then that i may dismiss thee by the postern  and as he strode on his way before the supposed friar frontdeboeuf thus schooled him in the part which he desired he should act  thou seest sir friar yon herd of saxon swine who have dared to environ this castle of torquilstonetell them whatever thou hast a mind of the weakness of this fortalice or aught else that can detain them before it for twentyfour hours meantime bear thou this scrollbut softcanst read sir priest  not a jot i answered cedric save on my breviary and then i know the characters because i have the holy service by heart praised be our lady and st withold  the fitter messenger for my purposecarry thou this scroll to the castle of philip de malvoisin say it cometh from me and is written by the templar brian de boisguilbert and that i pray him to send it to york with all the speed man and horse can make meanwhile tell him to doubt nothing he shall find us whole and sound behind our battlementshame on it that we should be compelled to hide thus by a pack of runagates who are wont to fly even at the flash of our pennons and the tramp of our horses i say to thee priest contrive some cast of thine art to keep the knaves where they are until our friends bring up their lances my vengeance is awake and she is a falcon that slumbers not till she has been gorged  by my patron saint said cedric with deeper energy than became his character and by every saint who has lived and died in england your commands shall be obeyed not a saxon shall stir from before these walls if i have art and influence to detain them there  ha said frontdeboeuf thou changest thy tone sir priest and speakest brief and bold as if thy heart were in the slaughter of the saxon herd and yet thou art thyself of kindred to the swine  cedric was no ready practiser of the art of dissimulation and would at this moment have been much the better of a hint from wambas more fertile brain but necessity according to the ancient proverb sharpens invention and he muttered something under his cowl concerning the men in question being excommunicated outlaws both to church and to kingdom  despardieux answered frontdeboeuf thou hast spoken the very truthi forgot that the knaves can strip a fat abbot as well as if they had been born south of yonder salt channel was it not he of st ives whom they tied to an oaktree and compelled to sing a mass while they were rifling his mails and his walletsno by our ladythat jest was played by gualtier of middleton one of our own companionsatarms but they were saxons who robbed the chapel at st bees of cup candlestick and chalice were they not  they were godless men answered cedric  ay and they drank out all the good wine and ale that lay in store for many a secret carousal when ye pretend ye are but busied with vigils and primespriest thou art bound to revenge such sacrilege  i am indeed bound to vengeance murmured cedric saint withold knows my heart  frontdeboeuf in the meanwhile led the way to a postern where passing the moat on a single plank they reached a small barbican or exterior defence which communicated with the open field by a wellfortified sallyport  begone then and if thou wilt do mine errand and if thou return hither when it is done thou shalt see saxon flesh cheap as ever was hogs in the shambles of sheffield and hark thee thou seemest to be a jolly confessorcome hither after the onslaught and thou shalt have as much malvoisie as would drench thy whole convent  assuredly we shall meet again answered cedric  something in hand the whilst continued the norman and as they parted at the postern door he thrust into cedrics reluctant hand a gold byzant adding remember i will fly off both cowl and skin if thou failest in thy purpose  and full leave will i give thee to do both answered cedric leaving the postern and striding forth over the free field with a joyful step if when we meet next i deserve not better at thine handturning then back towards the castle he threw the piece of gold towards the donor exclaiming at the same time false norman thy money perish with thee  frontdeboeuf heard the words imperfectly but the action was suspiciousarchers he called to the warders on the outward battlements send me an arrow through yon monks frockyet stay he said as his retainers were bending their bows it avails notwe must thus far trust him since we have no better shift i think he dares not betray meat the worst i can but treat with these saxon dogs whom i have safe in kennelho giles jailor let them bring cedric of rotherwood before me and the other churl his companionhim i mean of coningsburghathelstane there or what call they him their very names are an encumbrance to a norman knights mouth and have as it were a flavour of bacongive me a stoup of wine as jolly prince john said that i may wash away the relishplace it in the armoury and thither lead the prisoners  his commands were obeyed and upon entering that gothic apartment hung with many spoils won by his own valour and that of his father he found a flagon of wine on the massive oaken table and the two saxon captives under the guard of four of his dependants frontdeboeuf took a long drought of wine and then addressed his prisonersfor the manner in which wamba drew the cap over his face the change of dress the gloomy and broken light and the barons imperfect acquaintance with the features of cedric who avoided his norman neighbours and seldom stirred beyond his own domains prevented him from discovering that the most important of his captives had made his escape  gallants of england said frontdeboeuf how relish ye your entertainment at torquilstoneare ye yet aware what your surquedy and outrecuidance 31 merit for scoffing at the entertainment of a prince of the house of anjouhave ye forgotten how ye requited the unmerited hospitality of the royal john by god and st dennis an ye pay not the richer ransom i will hang ye up by the feet from the iron bars of these windows till the kites and hooded crows have made skeletons of youspeak out ye saxon dogswhat bid ye for your worthless liveshow say you you of rotherwood  not a doit i answered poor wambaand for hanging up by the feet my brain has been topsyturvy they say ever since the biggin was bound first round my head so turning me upside down may peradventure restore it again  saint genevieve said frontdeboeuf what have we got here  and with the back of his hand he struck cedrics cap from the head of the jester and throwing open his collar discovered the fatal badge of servitude the silver collar round his neck  gilesclementdogs and varlets exclaimed the furious norman what have you brought me here  i think i can tell you said de bracy who just entered the apartment this is cedrics clown who fought so manful a skirmish with isaac of york about a question of precedence  i shall settle it for them both replied frontdeboeuf they shall hang on the same gallows unless his master and this boar of coningsburgh will pay well for their lives their wealth is the least they can surrender they must also carry off with them the swarms that are besetting the castle subscribe a surrender of their pretended immunities and live under us as serfs and vassals too happy if in the new world that is about to begin we leave them the breath of their nostrilsgo said he to two of his attendants fetch me the right cedric hither and i pardon your error for once the rather that you but mistook a fool for a saxon franklin  ay but said wamba your chivalrous excellency will find there are more fools than franklins among us  what means the knave said frontdeboeuf looking towards his followers who lingering and loath faltered forth their belief that if this were not cedric who was there in presence they knew not what was become of him  saints of heaven exclaimed de bracy he must have escaped in the monks garments  fiends of hell echoed frontdeboeuf it was then the boar of rotherwood whom i ushered to the postern and dismissed with my own handsand thou he said to wamba whose folly could overreach the wisdom of idiots yet more gross than thyselfi will give thee holy ordersi will shave thy crown for theehere let them tear the scalp from his head and then pitch him headlong from the battlementsthy trade is to jest canst thou jest now  you deal with me better than your word noble knight whimpered forth poor wamba whose habits of buffoonery were not to be overcome even by the immediate prospect of death if you give me the red cap you propose out of a simple monk you will make a cardinal  the poor wretch said de bracy is resolved to die in his vocationfrontdeboeuf you shall not slay him give him to me to make sport for my free companionshow sayst thou knave wilt thou take heart of grace and go to the wars with me  ay with my masters leave said wamba for look you i must not slip collar and he touched that which he wore without his permission  oh a norman saw will soon cut a saxon collar said de bracy  ay noble sir said wamba and thence goes the proverb       norman saw on english oak      on english neck a norman yoke      norman spoon in english dish      and england ruled as normans wish      blithe world to england never will be more      till englands rid of all the four  thou dost well de bracy said frontdeboeuf to stand there listening to a fools jargon when destruction is gaping for us seest thou not we are overreached and that our proposed mode of communicating with our friends without has been disconcerted by this same motley gentleman thou art so fond to brother what views have we to expect but instant storm  to the battlements then said de bracy when didst thou ever see me the graver for the thoughts of battle call the templar yonder and let him fight but half so well for his life as he has done for his ordermake thou to the walls thyself with thy huge bodylet me do my poor endeavour in my own way and i tell thee the saxon outlaws may as well attempt to scale the clouds as the castle of torquilstone or if you will treat with the banditti why not employ the mediation of this worthy franklin who seems in such deep contemplation of the wineflagonhere saxon he continued addressing athelstane and handing the cup to him rinse thy throat with that noble liquor and rouse up thy soul to say what thou wilt do for thy liberty  what a man of mould may answered athelstane providing it be what a man of manhood oughtdismiss me free with my companions and i will pay a ransom of a thousand marks  and wilt moreover assure us the retreat of that scum of mankind who are swarming around the castle contrary to gods peace and the kings said frontdeboeuf  in so far as i can answered athelstane i will withdraw them and i fear not but that my father cedric will do his best to assist me  we are agreed then said frontdeboeufthou and they are to be set at freedom and peace is to be on both sides for payment of a thousand marks it is a trifling ransom saxon and thou wilt owe gratitude to the moderation which accepts of it in exchange of your persons but mark this extends not to the jew isaac  nor to the jew isaacs daughter said the templar who had now joined them  neither said frontdeboeuf belong to this saxons company  i were unworthy to be called christian if they did replied athelstane deal with the unbelievers as ye list  neither does the ransom include the lady rowena said de bracy it shall never be said i was scared out of a fair prize without striking a blow for it  neither said frontdeboeuf does our treaty refer to this wretched jester whom i retain that i may make him an example to every knave who turns jest into earnest  the lady rowena answered athelstane with the most steady countenance is my affianced bride i will be drawn by wild horses before i consent to part with her the slave wamba has this day saved the life of my father cedrici will lose mine ere a hair of his head be injured  thy affianced bridethe lady rowena the affianced bride of a vassal like thee said de bracy saxon thou dreamest that the days of thy seven kingdoms are returned again i tell thee the princes of the house of anjou confer not their wards on men of such lineage as thine  my lineage proud norman replied athelstane is drawn from a source more pure and ancient than that of a beggarly frenchman whose living is won by selling the blood of the thieves whom he assembles under his paltry standard kings were my ancestors strong in war and wise in council who every day feasted in their hall more hundreds than thou canst number individual followers whose names have been sung by minstrels and their laws recorded by wittenagemotes whose bones were interred amid the prayers of saints and over whose tombs minsters have been builded  thou hast it de bracy said frontdeboeuf well pleased with the rebuff which his companion had received the saxon hath hit thee fairly  as fairly as a captive can strike said de bracy with apparent carelessness for he whose hands are tied should have his tongue at freedombut thy glibness of reply comrade rejoined he speaking to athelstane will not win the freedom of the lady rowena  to this athelstane who had already made a longer speech than was his custom to do on any topic however interesting returned no answer the conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a menial who announced that a monk demanded admittance at the postern gate  in the name of saint bennet the prince of these bullbeggars said frontdeboeuf have we a real monk this time or another impostor search him slavesfor an ye suffer a second impostor to be palmed upon you i will have your eyes torn out and hot coals put into the sockets  let me endure the extremity of your anger my lord said giles if this be not a real shaveling your squire jocelyn knows him well and will vouch him to be brother ambrose a monk in attendance upon the prior of jorvaulx  admit him said frontdeboeuf most likely he brings us news from his jovial master surely the devil keeps holiday and the priests are relieved from duty that they are strolling thus wildly through the country remove these prisoners and saxon think on what thou hast heard  i claim said athelstane an honourable imprisonment with due care of my board and of my couch as becomes my rank and as is due to one who is in treaty for ransom moreover i hold him that deems himself the best of you bound to answer to me with his body for this aggression on my freedom this defiance hath already been sent to thee by thy sewer thou underliest it and art bound to answer methere lies my glove  i answer not the challenge of my prisoner said frontdeboeuf nor shalt thou maurice de bracygiles he continued hang the franklins glove upon the tine of yonder branched antlers there shall it remain until he is a free man should he then presume to demand it or to affirm he was unlawfully made my prisoner by the belt of saint christopher he will speak to one who hath never refused to meet a foe on foot or on horseback alone or with his vassals at his back  the saxon prisoners were accordingly removed just as they introduced the monk ambrose who appeared to be in great perturbation  this is the real deus vobiscum said wamba as he passed the reverend brother the others were but counterfeits  holy mother said the monk as he addressed the assembled knights i am at last safe and in christian keeping  safe thou art replied de bracy and for christianity here is the stout baron reginald frontdeboeuf whose utter abomination is a jew and the good knight templar brian de boisguilbert whose trade is to slay saracensif these are not good marks of christianity i know no other which they bear about them  ye are friends and allies of our reverend father in god aymer prior of jorvaulx said the monk without noticing the tone of de bracys reply ye owe him aid both by knightly faith and holy charity for what saith the blessed saint augustin in his treatise de civitate dei  what saith the devil interrupted frontdeboeuf or rather what dost thou say sir priest we have little time to hear texts from the holy fathers  sancta maria ejaculated father ambrose how prompt to ire are these unhallowed laymenbut be it known to you brave knights that certain murderous caitiffs casting behind them fear of god and reverence of his church and not regarding the bull of the holy see si quis suadende diabolo  brother priest said the templar all this we know or guess attell us plainly is thy master the prior made prisoner and to whom  surely said ambrose he is in the hands of the men of belial infesters of these woods and contemners of the holy text touch not mine anointed and do my prophets naught of evil  here is a new argument for our swords sirs said frontdeboeuf turning to his companions and so instead of reaching us any assistance the prior of jorvaulx requests aid at our hands a man is well helped of these lazy churchmen when he hath most to dobut speak out priest and say at once what doth thy master expect from us  so please you said ambrose violent hands having been imposed on my reverend superior contrary to the holy ordinance which i did already quote and the men of belial having rifled his mails and budgets and stripped him of two hundred marks of pure refined gold they do yet demand of him a large sum beside ere they will suffer him to depart from their uncircumcised hands wherefore the reverend father in god prays you as his dear friends to rescue him either by paying down the ransom at which they hold him or by force of arms at your best discretion  the foul fiend quell the prior said frontdeboeuf his mornings drought has been a deep one when did thy master hear of a norman baron unbuckling his purse to relieve a churchman whose bags are ten times as weighty as oursand how can we do aught by valour to free him that are cooped up here by ten times our number and expect an assault every moment  and that was what i was about to tell you said the monk had your hastiness allowed me time but god help me i am old and these foul onslaughts distract an aged mans brain nevertheless it is of verity that they assemble a camp and raise a bank against the walls of this castle  to the battlements cried de bracy and let us mark what these knaves do without and so saying he opened a latticed window which led to a sort of bartisan or projecting balcony and immediately called from thence to those in the apartmentsaint dennis but the old monk hath brought true tidingsthey bring forward mantelets and pavisses 32 and the archers muster on the skirts of the wood like a dark cloud before a hailstorm  reginald frontdeboeuf also looked out upon the field and immediately snatched his bugle and after winding a long and loud blast commanded his men to their posts on the walls  de bracy look to the eastern side where the walls are lowestnoble boisguilbert thy trade hath well taught thee how to attack and defend look thou to the western sidei myself will take post at the barbican yet do not confine your exertions to any one spot noble friendswe must this day be everywhere and multiply ourselves were it possible so as to carry by our presence succour and relief wherever the attack is hottest our numbers are few but activity and courage may supply that defect since we have only to do with rascal clowns  but noble knights exclaimed father ambrose amidst the bustle and confusion occasioned by the preparations for defence will none of ye hear the message of the reverend father in god aymer prior of jorvaulxi beseech thee to hear me noble sir reginald  go patter thy petitions to heaven said the fierce norman for we on earth have no time to listen to themho there anselm i see that seething pitch and oil are ready to pour on the heads of these audacious traitorslook that the crossbowmen lack not bolts 33fling abroad my banner with the old bulls headthe knaves shall soon find with whom they have to do this day  but noble sir continued the monk persevering in his endeavours to draw attention consider my vow of obedience and let me discharge myself of my superiors errand  away with this prating dotard said frontde boeuf lock him up in the chapel to tell his beads till the broil be over it will be a new thing to the saints in torquilstone to hear aves and paters they have not been so honoured i trow since they were cut out of stone  blaspheme not the holy saints sir reginald said de bracy we shall have need of their aid today before yon rascal rout disband  i expect little aid from their hand said frontdeboeuf unless we were to hurl them from the battlements on the heads of the villains there is a huge lumbering saint christopher yonder sufficient to bear a whole company to the earth  the templar had in the meantime been looking out on the proceedings of the besiegers with rather more attention than the brutal frontdeboeuf or his giddy companion  by the faith of mine order he said these men approach with more touch of discipline than could have been judged however they come by it see ye how dexterously they avail themselves of every cover which a tree or bush affords and shun exposing themselves to the shot of our crossbows i spy neither banner nor pennon among them and yet will i gage my golden chain that they are led on by some noble knight or gentleman skilful in the practice of wars  i espy him said de bracy i see the waving of a knights crest and the gleam of his armour see yon tall man in the black mail who is busied marshalling the farther troop of the rascaille yeomenby saint dennis i hold him to be the same whom we called le noir faineant who overthrew thee frontdeboeuf in the lists at ashby  so much the better said frontdeboeuf that he comes here to give me my revenge some hilding fellow he must be who dared not stay to assert his claim to the tourney prize which chance had assigned him i should in vain have sought for him where knights and nobles seek their foes and right glad am i he hath here shown himself among yon villain yeomanry  the demonstrations of the enemys immediate approach cut off all farther discourse each knight repaired to his post and at the head of the few followers whom they were able to muster and who were in numbers inadequate to defend the whole extent of the walls they awaited with calm determination the threatened assault     chapter xxviii       this wandering race severd from other men      boast yet their intercourse with human arts      the seas the woods the deserts which they haunt      find them acquainted with their secret treasures      and unregarded herbs and flowers and blossoms      display undreamtof powers when gatherd by them      the jew  our history must needs retrograde for the space of a few pages to inform the reader of certain passages material to his understanding the rest of this important narrative his own intelligence may indeed have easily anticipated that when ivanhoe sunk down and seemed abandoned by all the world it was the importunity of rebecca which prevailed on her father to have the gallant young warrior transported from the lists to the house which for the time the jews inhabited in the suburbs of ashby  it would not have been difficult to have persuaded isaac to this step in any other circumstances for his disposition was kind and grateful but he had also the prejudices and scrupulous timidity of his persecuted people and those were to be conquered  holy abraham he exclaimed he is a good youth and my heart bleeds to see the gore trickle down his rich embroidered hacqueton and his corslet of goodly pricebut to carry him to our housedamsel hast thou well consideredhe is a christian and by our law we may not deal with the stranger and gentile save for the advantage of our commerce  speak not so my dear father replied rebecca we may not indeed mix with them in banquet and in jollity but in wounds and in misery the gentile becometh the jews brother  i would i knew what the rabbi jacob ben tudela would opine on it replied isaacnevertheless the good youth must not bleed to death let seth and reuben bear him to ashby  nay let them place him in my litter said rebecca i will mount one of the palfreys  that were to expose thee to the gaze of those dogs of ishmael and of edom whispered isaac with a suspicious glance towards the crowd of knights and squires but rebecca was already busied in carrying her charitable purpose into effect and listed not what he said until isaac seizing the sleeve of her mantle again exclaimed in a hurried voicebeard of aaronwhat if the youth perishif he die in our custody shall we not be held guilty of his blood and be torn to pieces by the multitude  he will not die my father said rebecca gently extricating herself from the grasp of isaac he will not die unless we abandon him and if so we are indeed answerable for his blood to god and to man  nay said isaac releasing his hold it grieveth me as much to see the drops of his blood as if they were so many golden byzants from mine own purse and i well know that the lessons of miriam daughter of the rabbi manasses of byzantium whose soul is in paradise have made thee skilful in the art of healing and that thou knowest the craft of herbs and the force of elixirs therefore do as thy mind giveth theethou art a good damsel a blessing and a crown and a song of rejoicing unto me and unto my house and unto the people of my fathers  the apprehensions of isaac however were not ill founded and the generous and grateful benevolence of his daughter exposed her on her return to ashby to the unhallowed gaze of brian de boisguilbert the templar twice passed and repassed them on the road fixing his bold and ardent look on the beautiful jewess and we have already seen the consequences of the admiration which her charms excited when accident threw her into the power of that unprincipled voluptuary  rebecca lost no time in causing the patient to be transported to their temporary dwelling and proceeded with her own hands to examine and to bind up his wounds the youngest reader of romances and romantic ballads must recollect how often the females during the dark ages as they are called were initiated into the mysteries of surgery and how frequently the gallant knight submitted the wounds of his person to her cure whose eyes had yet more deeply penetrated his heart  but the jews both male and female possessed and practised the medical science in all its branches and the monarchs and powerful barons of the time frequently committed themselves to the charge of some experienced sage among this despised people when wounded or in sickness the aid of the jewish physicians was not the less eagerly sought after though a general belief prevailed among the christians that the jewish rabbins were deeply acquainted with the occult sciences and particularly with the cabalistical art which had its name and origin in the studies of the sages of israel neither did the rabbins disown such acquaintance with supernatural arts which added nothing for what could add aught to the hatred with which their nation was regarded while it diminished the contempt with which that malevolence was mingled a jewish magician might be the subject of equal abhorrence with a jewish usurer but he could not be equally despised it is besides probable considering the wonderful cures they are said to have performed that the jews possessed some secrets of the healing art peculiar to themselves and which with the exclusive spirit arising out of their condition they took great care to conceal from the christians amongst whom they dwelt  the beautiful rebecca had been heedfully brought up in all the knowledge proper to her nation which her apt and powerful mind had retained arranged and enlarged in the course of a progress beyond her years her sex and even the age in which she lived her knowledge of medicine and of the healing art had been acquired under an aged jewess the daughter of one of their most celebrated doctors who loved rebecca as her own child and was believed to have communicated to her secrets which had been left to herself by her sage father at the same time and under the same circumstances the fate of miriam had indeed been to fall a sacrifice to the fanaticism of the times but her secrets had survived in her apt pupil  rebecca thus endowed with knowledge as with beauty was universally revered and admired by her own tribe who almost regarded her as one of those gifted women mentioned in the sacred history her father himself out of reverence for her talents which involuntarily mingled itself with his unbounded affection permitted the maiden a greater liberty than was usually indulged to those of her sex by the habits of her people and was as we have just seen frequently guided by her opinion even in preference to his own  when ivanhoe reached the habitation of isaac he was still in a state of unconsciousness owing to the profuse loss of blood which had taken place during his exertions in the lists rebecca examined the wound and having applied to it such vulnerary remedies as her art prescribed informed her father that if fever could be averted of which the great bleeding rendered her little apprehensive and if the healing balsam of miriam retained its virtue there was nothing to fear for his guests life and that he might with safety travel to york with them on the ensuing day isaac looked a little blank at this annunciation his charity would willingly have stopped short at ashby or at most would have left the wounded christian to be tended in the house where he was residing at present with an assurance to the hebrew to whom it belonged that all expenses should be duly discharged to this however rebecca opposed many reasons of which we shall only mention two that had peculiar weight with isaac the one was that she would on no account put the phial of precious balsam into the hands of another physician even of her own tribe lest that valuable mystery should be discovered the other that this wounded knight wilfred of ivanhoe was an intimate favourite of richard coeurdelion and that in case the monarch should return isaac who had supplied his brother john with treasure to prosecute his rebellious purposes would stand in no small need of a powerful protector who enjoyed richards favour  thou art speaking but sooth rebecca said isaac giving way to these weighty argumentsit were an offending of heaven to betray the secrets of the blessed miriam for the good which heaven giveth is not rashly to be squandered upon others whether it be talents of gold and shekels of silver or whether it be the secret mysteries of a wise physicianassuredly they should be preserved to those to whom providence hath vouchsafed them and him whom the nazarenes of england call the lions heart assuredly it were better for me to fall into the hands of a strong lion of idumea than into his if he shall have got assurance of my dealing with his brother wherefore i will lend ear to thy counsel and this youth shall journey with us unto york and our house shall be as a home to him until his wounds shall be healed and if he of the lion heart shall return to the land as is now noised abroad then shall this wilfred of ivanhoe be unto me as a wall of defence when the kings displeasure shall burn high against thy father and if he doth not return this wilfred may natheless repay us our charges when he shall gain treasure by the strength of his spear and of his sword even as he did yesterday and this day also for the youth is a good youth and keepeth the day which he appointeth and restoreth that which he borroweth and succoureth the israelite even the child of my fathers house when he is encompassed by strong thieves and sons of belial  it was not until evening was nearly closed that ivanhoe was restored to consciousness of his situation he awoke from a broken slumber under the confused impressions which are naturally attendant on the recovery from a state of insensibility he was unable for some time to recall exactly to memory the circumstances which had preceded his fall in the lists or to make out any connected chain of the events in which he had been engaged upon the yesterday a sense of wounds and injury joined to great weakness and exhaustion was mingled with the recollection of blows dealt and received of steeds rushing upon each other overthrowing and overthrownof shouts and clashing of arms and all the heady tumult of a confused fight an effort to draw aside the curtain of his couch was in some degree successful although rendered difficult by the pain of his wound  to his great surprise he found himself in a room magnificently furnished but having cushions instead of chairs to rest upon and in other respects partaking so much of oriental costume that he began to doubt whether he had not during his sleep been transported back again to the land of palestine the impression was increased when the tapestry being drawn aside a female form dressed in a rich habit which partook more of the eastern taste than that of europe glided through the door which it concealed and was followed by a swarthy domestic  as the wounded knight was about to address this fair apparition she imposed silence by placing her slender finger upon her ruby lips while the attendant approaching him proceeded to uncover ivanhoes side and the lovely jewess satisfied herself that the bandage was in its place and the wound doing well she performed her task with a graceful and dignified simplicity and modesty which might even in more civilized days have served to redeem it from whatever might seem repugnant to female delicacy the idea of so young and beautiful a person engaged in attendance on a sickbed or in dressing the wound of one of a different sex was melted away and lost in that of a beneficent being contributing her effectual aid to relieve pain and to avert the stroke of death rebeccas few and brief directions were given in the hebrew language to the old domestic and he who had been frequently her assistant in similar cases obeyed them without reply  the accents of an unknown tongue however harsh they might have sounded when uttered by another had coming from the beautiful rebecca the romantic and pleasing effect which fancy ascribes to the charms pronounced by some beneficent fairy unintelligible indeed to the ear but from the sweetness of utterance and benignity of aspect which accompanied them touching and affecting to the heart without making an attempt at further question ivanhoe suffered them in silence to take the measures they thought most proper for his recovery and it was not until those were completed and this kind physician about to retire that his curiosity could no longer be suppressedgentle maiden he began in the arabian tongue with which his eastern travels had rendered him familiar and which he thought most likely to be understood by the turband and caftand damsel who stood before himi pray you gentle maiden of your courtesy  but here he was interrupted by his fair physician a smile which she could scarce suppress dimpling for an instant a face whose general expression was that of contemplative melancholy i am of england sir knight and speak the english tongue although my dress and my lineage belong to another climate  noble damselagain the knight of ivanhoe began and again rebecca hastened to interrupt him  bestow not on me sir knight she said the epithet of noble it is well you should speedily know that your handmaiden is a poor jewess the daughter of that isaac of york to whom you were so lately a good and kind lord it well becomes him and those of his household to render to you such careful tendance as your present state necessarily demands  i know not whether the fair rowena would have been altogether satisfied with the species of emotion with which her devoted knight had hitherto gazed on the beautiful features and fair form and lustrous eyes of the lovely rebecca eyes whose brilliancy was shaded and as it were mellowed by the fringe of her long silken eyelashes and which a minstrel would have compared to the evening star darting its rays through a bower of jessamine but ivanhoe was too good a catholic to retain the same class of feelings towards a jewess this rebecca had foreseen and for this very purpose she had hastened to mention her fathers name and lineage yetfor the fair and wise daughter of isaac was not without a touch of female weaknessshe could not but sigh internally when the glance of respectful admiration not altogether unmixed with tenderness with which ivanhoe had hitherto regarded his unknown benefactress was exchanged at once for a manner cold composed and collected and fraught with no deeper feeling than that which expressed a grateful sense of courtesy received from an unexpected quarter and from one of an inferior race it was not that ivanhoes former carriage expressed more than that general devotional homage which youth always pays to beauty yet it was mortifying that one word should operate as a spell to remove poor rebecca who could not be supposed altogether ignorant of her title to such homage into a degraded class to whom it could not be honourably rendered  but the gentleness and candour of rebeccas nature imputed no fault to ivanhoe for sharing in the universal prejudices of his age and religion on the contrary the fair jewess though sensible her patient now regarded her as one of a race of reprobation with whom it was disgraceful to hold any beyond the most necessary intercourse ceased not to pay the same patient and devoted attention to his safety and convalescence she informed him of the necessity they were under of removing to york and of her fathers resolution to transport him thither and tend him in his own house until his health should be restored ivanhoe expressed great repugnance to this plan which he grounded on unwillingness to give farther trouble to his benefactors  was there not he said in ashby or near it some saxon franklin or even some wealthy peasant who would endure the burden of a wounded countrymans residence with him until he should be again able to bear his armourwas there no convent of saxon endowment where he could be receivedor could he not be transported as far as burton where he was sure to find hospitality with waltheoff the abbot of st witholds to whom he was related  any the worst of these harbourages said rebecca with a melancholy smile would unquestionably be more fitting for your residence than the abode of a despised jew yet sir knight unless you would dismiss your physician you cannot change your lodging our nation as you well know can cure wounds though we deal not in inflicting them and in our own family in particular are secrets which have been handed down since the days of solomon and of which you have already experienced the advantages no nazarenei crave your forgiveness sir knightno christian leech within the four seas of britain could enable you to bear your corslet within a month  and how soon wilt thou enable me to brook it said ivanhoe impatiently  within eight days if thou wilt be patient and conformable to my directions replied rebecca  by our blessed lady said wilfred if it be not a sin to name her here it is no time for me or any true knight to be bedridden and if thou accomplish thy promise maiden i will pay thee with my casque full of crowns come by them as i may  i will accomplish my promise said rebecca and thou shalt bear thine armour on the eighth day from hence if thou will grant me but one boon in the stead of the silver thou dost promise me  if it be within my power and such as a true christian knight may yield to one of thy people replied ivanhoe i will grant thy boon blithely and thankfully  nay answered rebecca i will but pray of thee to believe henceforward that a jew may do good service to a christian without desiring other guerdon than the blessing of the great father who made both jew and gentile  it were sin to doubt it maiden replied ivanhoe and i repose myself on thy skill without further scruple or question well trusting you will enable me to bear my corslet on the eighth day and now my kind leech let me enquire of the news abroad what of the noble saxon cedric and his householdwhat of the lovely lady he stopt as if unwilling to speak rowenas name in the house of a jewof her i mean who was named queen of the tournament  and who was selected by you sir knight to hold that dignity with judgment which was admired as much as your valour replied rebecca  the blood which ivanhoe had lost did not prevent a flush from crossing his cheek feeling that he had incautiously betrayed a deep interest in rowena by the awkward attempt he had made to conceal it  it was less of her i would speak said he than of prince john and i would fain know somewhat of a faithful squire and why he now attends me not  let me use my authority as a leech answered rebecca and enjoin you to keep silence and avoid agitating reflections whilst i apprize you of what you desire to know prince john hath broken off the tournament and set forward in all haste towards york with the nobles knights and churchmen of his party after collecting such sums as they could wring by fair means or foul from those who are esteemed the wealthy of the land it is said he designs to assume his brothers crown  not without a blow struck in its defence said ivanhoe raising himself upon the couch if there were but one true subject in england i will fight for richards title with the best of themay one or two in his just quarrel  but that you may be able to do so said rebecca touching his shoulder with her hand you must now observe my directions and remain quiet  true maiden said ivanhoe as quiet as these disquieted times will permitand of cedric and his household  his steward came but brief while since said the jewess panting with haste to ask my father for certain monies the price of wool the growth of cedrics flocks and from him i learned that cedric and athelstane of coningsburgh had left prince johns lodging in high displeasure and were about to set forth on their return homeward  went any lady with them to the banquet said wilfred  the lady rowena said rebecca answering the question with more precision than it had been askedthe lady rowena went not to the princes feast and as the steward reported to us she is now on her journey back to rotherwood with her guardian cedric and touching your faithful squire gurth  ha exclaimed the knight knowest thou his namebut thou dost he immediately added and well thou mayst for it was from thy hand and as i am now convinced from thine own generosity of spirit that he received but yesterday a hundred zecchins  speak not of that said rebecca blushing deeply i see how easy it is for the tongue to betray what the heart would gladly conceal  but this sum of gold said ivanhoe gravely my honour is concerned in repaying it to your father  let it be as thou wilt said rebecca when eight days have passed away but think not and speak not now of aught that may retard thy recovery  be it so kind maiden said ivanhoe i were most ungrateful to dispute thy commands but one word of the fate of poor gurth and i have done with questioning thee  i grieve to tell thee sir knight answered the jewess that he is in custody by the order of cedricand then observing the distress which her communication gave to wilfred she instantly added but the steward oswald said that if nothing occurred to renew his masters displeasure against him he was sure that cedric would pardon gurth a faithful serf and one who stood high in favour and who had but committed this error out of the love which he bore to cedrics son and he said moreover that he and his comrades and especially wamba the jester were resolved to warn gurth to make his escape by the way in case cedrics ire against him could not be mitigated  would to god they may keep their purpose said ivanhoe but it seems as if i were destined to bring ruin on whomsoever hath shown kindness to me my king by whom i was honoured and distinguished thou seest that the brother most indebted to him is raising his arms to grasp his crownmy regard hath brought restraint and trouble on the fairest of her sexand now my father in his mood may slay this poor bondsman but for his love and loyal service to methou seest maiden what an illfated wretch thou dost labour to assist be wise and let me go ere the misfortunes which track my footsteps like slothounds shall involve thee also in their pursuit  nay said rebecca thy weakness and thy grief sir knight make thee miscalculate the purposes of heaven thou hast been restored to thy country when it most needed the assistance of a strong hand and a true heart and thou hast humbled the pride of thine enemies and those of thy king when their horn was most highly exalted and for the evil which thou hast sustained seest thou not that heaven has raised thee a helper and a physician even among the most despised of the landtherefore be of good courage and trust that thou art preserved for some marvel which thine arm shall work before this people adieuand having taken the medicine which i shall send thee by the hand of reuben compose thyself again to rest that thou mayest be the more able to endure the journey on the succeeding day  ivanhoe was convinced by the reasoning and obeyed the directions of rebecca the drought which reuben administered was of a sedative and narcotic quality and secured the patient sound and undisturbed slumbers in the morning his kind physician found him entirely free from feverish symptoms and fit to undergo the fatigue of a journey  he was deposited in the horselitter which had brought him from the lists and every precaution taken for his travelling with ease in one circumstance only even the entreaties of rebecca were unable to secure sufficient attention to the accommodation of the wounded knight isaac like the enriched traveller of juvenals tenth satire had ever the fear of robbery before his eyes conscious that he would be alike accounted fair game by the marauding norman noble and by the saxon outlaw he therefore journeyed at a great rate and made short halts and shorter repasts so that he passed by cedric and athelstane who had several hours the start of him but who had been delayed by their protracted feasting at the convent of saint witholds yet such was the virtue of miriams balsam or such the strength of ivanhoes constitution that he did not sustain from the hurried journey that inconvenience which his kind physician had apprehended  in another point of view however the jews haste proved somewhat more than good speed the rapidity with which he insisted on travelling bred several disputes between him and the party whom he had hired to attend him as a guard these men were saxons and not free by any means from the national love of ease and good living which the normans stigmatized as laziness and gluttony reversing shylocks position they had accepted the employment in hopes of feeding upon the wealthy jew and were very much displeased when they found themselves disappointed by the rapidity with which he insisted on their proceeding they remonstrated also upon the risk of damage to their horses by these forced marches finally there arose betwixt isaac and his satellites a deadly feud concerning the quantity of wine and ale to be allowed for consumption at each meal and thus it happened that when the alarm of danger approached and that which isaac feared was likely to come upon him he was deserted by the discontented mercenaries on whose protection he had relied without using the means necessary to secure their attachment  in this deplorable condition the jew with his daughter and her wounded patient were found by cedric as has already been noticed and soon afterwards fell into the power of de bracy and his confederates little notice was at first taken of the horselitter and it might have remained behind but for the curiosity of de bracy who looked into it under the impression that it might contain the object of his enterprise for rowena had not unveiled herself but de bracys astonishment was considerable when he discovered that the litter contained a wounded man who conceiving himself to have fallen into the power of saxon outlaws with whom his name might be a protection for himself and his friends frankly avowed himself to be wilfred of ivanhoe  the ideas of chivalrous honour which amidst his wildness and levity never utterly abandoned de bracy prohibited him from doing the knight any injury in his defenceless condition and equally interdicted his betraying him to frontdeboeuf who would have had no scruples to put to death under any circumstances the rival claimant of the fief of ivanhoe on the other hand to liberate a suitor preferred by the lady rowena as the events of the tournament and indeed wilfreds previous banishment from his fathers house had made matter of notoriety was a pitch far above the flight of de bracys generosity a middle course betwixt good and evil was all which he found himself capable of adopting and he commanded two of his own squires to keep close by the litter and to suffer no one to approach it if questioned they were directed by their master to say that the empty litter of the lady rowena was employed to transport one of their comrades who had been wounded in the scuffle on arriving at torquilstone while the knight templar and the lord of that castle were each intent upon their own schemes the one on the jews treasure and the other on his daughter de bracys squires conveyed ivanhoe still under the name of a wounded comrade to a distant apartment this explanation was accordingly returned by these men to frontdeboeuf when he questioned them why they did not make for the battlements upon the alarm  a wounded companion he replied in great wrath and astonishment no wonder that churls and yeomen wax so presumptuous as even to lay leaguer before castles and that clowns and swineherds send defiances to nobles since menatarms have turned sick mens nurses and free companions are grown keepers of dying folks curtains when the castle is about to be assailedto the battlements ye loitering villains he exclaimed raising his stentorian voice till the arches around rung again to the battlements or i will splinter your bones with this truncheon  the men sulkily replied that they desired nothing better than to go to the battlements providing frontdeboeuf would bear them out with their master who had commanded them to tend the dying man  the dying man knaves rejoined the baron i promise thee we shall all be dying men an we stand not to it the more stoutly but i will relieve the guard upon this caitiff companion of yourshere urfriedhagfiend of a saxon witchhearest me nottend me this bedridden fellow since he must needs be tended whilst these knaves use their weaponshere be two arblasts comrades with windlaces and quarrells 34to the barbican with you and see you drive each bolt through a saxon brain  the men who like most of their description were fond of enterprise and detested inaction went joyfully to the scene of danger as they were commanded and thus the charge of ivanhoe was transferred to urfried or ulrica but she whose brain was burning with remembrance of injuries and with hopes of vengeance was readily induced to devolve upon rebecca the care of her patient     chapter xxix       ascend the watchtower yonder valiant soldier      look on the field and say how goes the battle      schillers maid of orleans  a moment of peril is often also a moment of openhearted kindness and affection we are thrown off our guard by the general agitation of our feelings and betray the intensity of those which at more tranquil periods our prudence at least conceals if it cannot altogether suppress them in finding herself once more by the side of ivanhoe rebecca was astonished at the keen sensation of pleasure which she experienced even at a time when all around them both was danger if not despair as she felt his pulse and enquired after his health there was a softness in her touch and in her accents implying a kinder interest than she would herself have been pleased to have voluntarily expressed her voice faltered and her hand trembled and it was only the cold question of ivanhoe is it you gentle maiden which recalled her to herself and reminded her the sensations which she felt were not and could not be mutual a sigh escaped but it was scarce audible and the questions which she asked the knight concerning his state of health were put in the tone of calm friendship ivanhoe answered her hastily that he was in point of health as well and better than he could have expectedthanks he said dear rebecca to thy helpful skill  he calls me dear rebecca said the maiden to herself but it is in the cold and careless tone which ill suits the word his warhorsehis hunting hound are dearer to him than the despised jewess  my mind gentle maiden continued ivanhoe is more disturbed by anxiety than my body with pain from the speeches of those men who were my warders just now i learn that i am a prisoner and if i judge aright of the loud hoarse voice which even now dispatched them hence on some military duty i am in the castle of frontdeboeufif so how will this end or how can i protect rowena and my father  he names not the jew or jewess said rebecca internally yet what is our portion in him and how justly am i punished by heaven for letting my thoughts dwell upon him she hastened after this brief selfaccusation to give ivanhoe what information she could but it amounted only to this that the templar boisguilbert and the baron frontdeboeuf were commanders within the castle that it was beleaguered from without but by whom she knew not she added that there was a christian priest within the castle who might be possessed of more information  a christian priest said the knight joyfully fetch him hither rebecca if thou canstsay a sick man desires his ghostly counselsay what thou wilt but bring himsomething i must do or attempt but how can i determine until i know how matters stand without  rebecca in compliance with the wishes of ivanhoe made that attempt to bring cedric into the wounded knights chamber which was defeated as we have already seen by the interference of urfried who had also been on the watch to intercept the supposed monk rebecca retired to communicate to ivanhoe the result of her errand  they had not much leisure to regret the failure of this source of intelligence or to contrive by what means it might be supplied for the noise within the castle occasioned by the defensive preparations which had been considerable for some time now increased into tenfold bustle and clamour the heavy yet hasty step of the menatarms traversed the battlements or resounded on the narrow and winding passages and stairs which led to the various bartisans and points of defence the voices of the knights were heard animating their followers or directing means of defence while their commands were often drowned in the clashing of armour or the clamorous shouts of those whom they addressed tremendous as these sounds were and yet more terrible from the awful event which they presaged there was a sublimity mixed with them which rebeccas hightoned mind could feel even in that moment of terror her eye kindled although the blood fled from her cheeks and there was a strong mixture of fear and of a thrilling sense of the sublime as she repeated half whispering to herself half speaking to her companion the sacred textthe quiver rattleththe glittering spear and the shieldthe noise of the captains and the shouting  but ivanhoe was like the warhorse of that sublime passage glowing with impatience at his inactivity and with his ardent desire to mingle in the affray of which these sounds were the introduction if i could but drag myself he said to yonder window that i might see how this brave game is like to goif i had but bow to shoot a shaft or battleaxe to strike were it but a single blow for our deliveranceit is in vainit is in vaini am alike nerveless and weaponless  fret not thyself noble knight answered rebecca the sounds have ceased of a suddenit may be they join not battle  thou knowest nought of it said wilfred impatiently this dead pause only shows that the men are at their posts on the walls and expecting an instant attack what we have heard was but the instant muttering of the stormit will burst anon in all its furycould i but reach yonder window  thou wilt but injure thyself by the attempt noble knight replied his attendant observing his extreme solicitude she firmly added i myself will stand at the lattice and describe to you as i can what passes without  you must notyou shall not exclaimed ivanhoe each lattice each aperture will be soon a mark for the archers some random shaft  it shall be welcome murmured rebecca as with firm pace she ascended two or three steps which led to the window of which they spoke  rebecca dear rebecca exclaimed ivanhoe this is no maidens pastimedo not expose thyself to wounds and death and render me for ever miserable for having given the occasion at least cover thyself with yonder ancient buckler and show as little of your person at the lattice as may be  following with wonderful promptitude the directions of ivanhoe and availing herself of the protection of the large ancient shield which she placed against the lower part of the window rebecca with tolerable security to herself could witness part of what was passing without the castle and report to ivanhoe the preparations which the assailants were making for the storm indeed the situation which she thus obtained was peculiarly favourable for this purpose because being placed on an angle of the main building rebecca could not only see what passed beyond the precincts of the castle but also commanded a view of the outwork likely to be the first object of the meditated assault it was an exterior fortification of no great height or strength intended to protect the posterngate through which cedric had been recently dismissed by frontdeboeuf the castle moat divided this species of barbican from the rest of the fortress so that in case of its being taken it was easy to cut off the communication with the main building by withdrawing the temporary bridge in the outwork was a sallyport corresponding to the postern of the castle and the whole was surrounded by a strong palisade rebecca could observe from the number of men placed for the defence of this post that the besieged entertained apprehensions for its safety and from the mustering of the assailants in a direction nearly opposite to the outwork it seemed no less plain that it had been selected as a vulnerable point of attack  these appearances she hastily communicated to ivanhoe and added the skirts of the wood seem lined with archers although only a few are advanced from its dark shadow  under what banner asked ivanhoe  under no ensign of war which i can observe answered rebecca  a singular novelty muttered the knight to advance to storm such a castle without pennon or banner displayedseest thou who they be that act as leaders  a knight clad in sable armour is the most conspicuous said the jewess he alone is armed from head to heel and seems to assume the direction of all around him  what device does he bear on his shield replied ivanhoe  something resembling a bar of iron and a padlock painted blue on the black shield 35  a fetterlock and shacklebolt azure said ivanhoe i know not who may bear the device but well i ween it might now be mine own canst thou not see the motto  scarce the device itself at this distance replied rebecca but when the sun glances fair upon his shield it shows as i tell you  seem there no other leaders exclaimed the anxious enquirer  none of mark and distinction that i can behold from this station said rebecca but doubtless the other side of the castle is also assailed they appear even now preparing to advancegod of zion protect uswhat a dreadful sightthose who advance first bear huge shields and defences made of plank the others follow bending their bows as they come onthey raise their bowsgod of moses forgive the creatures thou hast made  her description was here suddenly interrupted by the signal for assault which was given by the blast of a shrill bugle and at once answered by a flourish of the norman trumpets from the battlements which mingled with the deep and hollow clang of the nakers a species of kettledrum retorted in notes of defiance the challenge of the enemy the shouts of both parties augmented the fearful din the assailants crying saint george for merry england and the normans answering them with loud cries of en avant de bracybeauseant beauseantfrontdeboeuf a la rescousse according to the warcries of their different commanders  it was not however by clamour that the contest was to be decided and the desperate efforts of the assailants were met by an equally vigorous defence on the part of the besieged the archers trained by their woodland pastimes to the most effective use of the longbow shot to use the appropriate phrase of the time so wholly together that no point at which a defender could show the least part of his person escaped their clothyard shafts by this heavy discharge which continued as thick and sharp as hail while notwithstanding every arrow had its individual aim and flew by scores together against each embrasure and opening in the parapets as well as at every window where a defender either occasionally had post or might be suspected to be stationedby this sustained discharge two or three of the garrison were slain and several others wounded but confident in their armour of proof and in the cover which their situation afforded the followers of frontdeboeuf and his allies showed an obstinacy in defence proportioned to the fury of the attack and replied with the discharge of their large crossbows as well as with their longbows slings and other missile weapons to the close and continued shower of arrows and as the assailants were necessarily but indifferently protected did considerably more damage than they received at their hand the whizzing of shafts and of missiles on both sides was only interrupted by the shouts which arose when either side inflicted or sustained some notable loss  and i must lie here like a bedridden monk exclaimed ivanhoe while the game that gives me freedom or death is played out by the hand of otherslook from the window once again kind maiden but beware that you are not marked by the archers beneathlook out once more and tell me if they yet advance to the storm  with patient courage strengthened by the interval which she had employed in mental devotion rebecca again took post at the lattice sheltering herself however so as not to be visible from beneath  what dost thou see rebecca again demanded the wounded knight  nothing but the cloud of arrows flying so thick as to dazzle mine eyes and to hide the bowmen who shoot them  that cannot endure said ivanhoe if they press not right on to carry the castle by pure force of arms the archery may avail but little against stone walls and bulwarks look for the knight of the fetterlock fair rebecca and see how he bears himself for as the leader is so will his followers be  i see him not said rebecca  foul craven exclaimed ivanhoe does he blench from the helm when the wind blows highest  he blenches not he blenches not said rebecca i see him now he leads a body of men close under the outer barrier of the barbican 36 they pull down the piles and palisades they hew down the barriers with axeshis high black plume floats abroad over the throng like a raven over the field of the slainthey have made a breach in the barriersthey rush inthey are thrust backfrontdeboeuf heads the defenders i see his gigantic form above the press they throng again to the breach and the pass is disputed hand to hand and man to man god of jacob it is the meeting of two fierce tidesthe conflict of two oceans moved by adverse winds  she turned her head from the lattice as if unable longer to endure a sight so terrible  look forth again rebecca said ivanhoe mistaking the cause of her retiring the archery must in some degree have ceased since they are now fighting hand to handlook again there is now less danger  rebecca again looked forth and almost immediately exclaimed holy prophets of the law frontdeboeuf and the black knight fight hand to hand on the breach amid the roar of their followers who watch the progress of the strifeheaven strike with the cause of the oppressed and of the captive she then uttered a loud shriek and exclaimed he is downhe is down  who is down cried ivanhoe for our dear ladys sake tell me which has fallen  the black knight answered rebecca faintly then instantly again shouted with joyful eagernessbut nobut nothe name of the lord of hosts be blessedhe is on foot again and fights as if there were twenty mens strength in his single armhis sword is brokenhe snatches an axe from a yeomanhe presses frontdeboeuf with blow on blowthe giant stoops and totters like an oak under the steel of the woodmanhe fallshe falls  frontdeboeuf exclaimed ivanhoe  frontdeboeuf answered the jewess his men rush to the rescue headed by the haughty templartheir united force compels the champion to pausethey drag frontdeboeuf within the walls  the assailants have won the barriers have they not said ivanhoe  they havethey have exclaimed rebeccaand they press the besieged hard upon the outer wall some plant ladders some swarm like bees and endeavour to ascend upon the shoulders of each otherdown go stones beams and trunks of trees upon their heads and as fast as they bear the wounded to the rear fresh men supply their places in the assaultgreat god hast thou given men thine own image that it should be thus cruelly defaced by the hands of their brethren  think not of that said ivanhoe this is no time for such thoughtswho yieldwho push their way  the ladders are thrown down replied rebecca shuddering the soldiers lie grovelling under them like crushed reptilesthe besieged have the better  saint george strike for us exclaimed the knight do the false yeomen give way  no exclaimed rebecca they bear themselves right yeomanlythe black knight approaches the postern with his huge axethe thundering blows which he deals you may hear them above all the din and shouts of the battlestones and beams are hailed down on the bold championhe regards them no more than if they were thistledown or feathers  by saint john of acre said ivanhoe raising himself joyfully on his couch methought there was but one man in england that might do such a deed  the postern gate shakes continued rebecca it crashesit is splintered by his blowsthey rush inthe outwork is wonoh godthey hurl the defenders from the battlementsthey throw them into the moato men if ye be indeed men spare them that can resist no longer  the bridgethe bridge which communicates with the castlehave they won that pass exclaimed ivanhoe  no replied rebecca the templar has destroyed the plank on which they crossedfew of the defenders escaped with him into the castlethe shrieks and cries which you hear tell the fate of the othersalasi see it is still more difficult to look upon victory than upon battle  what do they now maiden said ivanhoe look forth yet againthis is no time to faint at bloodshed  it is over for the time answered rebecca our friends strengthen themselves within the outwork which they have mastered and it affords them so good a shelter from the foemens shot that the garrison only bestow a few bolts on it from interval to interval as if rather to disquiet than effectually to injure them  our friends said wilfred will surely not abandon an enterprise so gloriously begun and so happily attainedo no i will put my faith in the good knight whose axe hath rent heartofoak and bars of ironsingular he again muttered to himself if there be two who can do a deed of such derringdo 37a fetterlock and a shacklebolt on a field sablewhat may that meanseest thou nought else rebecca by which the black knight may be distinguished  nothing said the jewess all about him is black as the wing of the night raven nothing can i spy that can mark him furtherbut having once seen him put forth his strength in battle methinks i could know him again among a thousand warriors he rushes to the fray as if he were summoned to a banquet there is more than mere strength there seems as if the whole soul and spirit of the champion were given to every blow which he deals upon his enemies god assoilize him of the sin of bloodshedit is fearful yet magnificent to behold how the arm and heart of one man can triumph over hundreds  rebecca said ivanhoe thou hast painted a hero surely they rest but to refresh their force or to provide the means of crossing the moatunder such a leader as thou hast spoken this knight to be there are no craven fears no coldblooded delays no yielding up a gallant emprize since the difficulties which render it arduous render it also glorious i swear by the honour of my housei vow by the name of my bright ladylove i would endure ten years captivity to fight one day by that good knights side in such a quarrel as this  alas said rebecca leaving her station at the window and approaching the couch of the wounded knight this impatient yearning after actionthis struggling with and repining at your present weakness will not fail to injure your returning healthhow couldst thou hope to inflict wounds on others ere that be healed which thou thyself hast received  rebecca he replied thou knowest not how impossible it is for one trained to actions of chivalry to remain passive as a priest or a woman when they are acting deeds of honour around him the love of battle is the food upon which we livethe dust of the melee is the breath of our nostrils we live notwe wish not to livelonger than while we are victorious and renownedsuch maiden are the laws of chivalry to which we are sworn and to which we offer all that we hold dear  alas said the fair jewess and what is it valiant knight save an offering of sacrifice to a demon of vain glory and a passing through the fire to molochwhat remains to you as the prize of all the blood you have spilledof all the travail and pain you have enduredof all the tears which your deeds have caused when death hath broken the strong mans spear and overtaken the speed of his warhorse  what remains cried ivanhoe glory maiden glory which gilds our sepulchre and embalms our name  glory continued rebecca alas is the rusted mail which hangs as a hatchment over the champions dim and mouldering tombis the defaced sculpture of the inscription which the ignorant monk can hardly read to the enquiring pilgrimare these sufficient rewards for the sacrifice of every kindly affection for a life spent miserably that ye may make others miserable or is there such virtue in the rude rhymes of a wandering bard that domestic love kindly affection peace and happiness are so wildly bartered to become the hero of those ballads which vagabond minstrels sing to drunken churls over their evening ale  by the soul of hereward replied the knight impatiently thou speakest maiden of thou knowest not what thou wouldst quench the pure light of chivalry which alone distinguishes the noble from the base the gentle knight from the churl and the savage which rates our life far far beneath the pitch of our honour raises us victorious over pain toil and suffering and teaches us to fear no evil but disgrace thou art no christian rebecca and to thee are unknown those high feelings which swell the bosom of a noble maiden when her lover hath done some deed of emprize which sanctions his flame chivalrywhy maiden she is the nurse of pure and high affectionthe stay of the oppressed the redresser of grievances the curb of the power of the tyrantnobility were but an empty name without her and liberty finds the best protection in her lance and her sword  i am indeed said rebecca sprung from a race whose courage was distinguished in the defence of their own land but who warred not even while yet a nation save at the command of the deity or in defending their country from oppression the sound of the trumpet wakes judah no longer and her despised children are now but the unresisting victims of hostile and military oppression well hast thou spoken sir knightuntil the god of jacob shall raise up for his chosen people a second gideon or a new maccabeus it ill beseemeth the jewish damsel to speak of battle or of war  the highminded maiden concluded the argument in a tone of sorrow which deeply expressed her sense of the degradation of her people embittered perhaps by the idea that ivanhoe considered her as one not entitled to interfere in a case of honour and incapable of entertaining or expressing sentiments of honour and generosity  how little he knows this bosom she said to imagine that cowardice or meanness of soul must needs be its guests because i have censured the fantastic chivalry of the nazarenes would to heaven that the shedding of mine own blood drop by drop could redeem the captivity of judah nay would to god it could avail to set free my father and this his benefactor from the chains of the oppressor the proud christian should then see whether the daughter of gods chosen people dared not to die as bravely as the vainest nazarene maiden that boasts her descent from some petty chieftain of the rude and frozen north  she then looked towards the couch of the wounded knight  he sleeps she said nature exhausted by sufferance and the waste of spirits his wearied frame embraces the first moment of temporary relaxation to sink into slumber alas is it a crime that i should look upon him when it may be for the last timewhen yet but a short space and those fair features will be no longer animated by the bold and buoyant spirit which forsakes them not even in sleepwhen the nostril shall be distended the mouth agape the eyes fixed and bloodshot and when the proud and noble knight may be trodden on by the lowest caitiff of this accursed castle yet stir not when the heel is lifted up against himand my fatheroh my father evil is it with his daughter when his grey hairs are not remembered because of the golden locks of youthwhat know i but that these evils are the messengers of jehovahs wrath to the unnatural child who thinks of a strangers captivity before a parents who forgets the desolation of judah and looks upon the comeliness of a gentile and a strangerbut i will tear this folly from my heart though every fibre bleed as i rend it away  she wrapped herself closely in her veil and sat down at a distance from the couch of the wounded knight with her back turned towards it fortifying or endeavouring to fortify her mind not only against the impending evils from without but also against those treacherous feelings which assailed her from within     chapter xxx       approach the chamber look upon his bed      his is the passing of no peaceful ghost      which as the lark arises to the sky      mid mornings sweetest breeze and softest dew      is wingd to heaven by good mens sighs and tears      anselm parts otherwise      old play  during the interval of quiet which followed the first success of the besiegers while the one party was preparing to pursue their advantage and the other to strengthen their means of defence the templar and de bracy held brief council together in the hall of the castle  where is frontdeboeuf said the latter who had superintended the defence of the fortress on the other side men say he hath been slain  he lives said the templar coolly lives as yet but had he worn the bulls head of which he bears the name and ten plates of iron to fence it withal he must have gone down before yonder fatal axe yet a few hours and frontdeboeuf is with his fathersa powerful limb lopped off prince johns enterprise  and a brave addition to the kingdom of satan said de bracy this comes of reviling saints and angels and ordering images of holy things and holy men to be flung down on the heads of these rascaille yeomen  go tothou art a fool said the templar thy superstition is upon a level with frontdeboeufs want of faith neither of you can render a reason for your belief or unbelief  benedicite sir templar replied de bracy pray you to keep better rule with your tongue when i am the theme of it by the mother of heaven i am a better christian man than thou and thy fellowship for the bruit goeth shrewdly out that the most holy order of the temple of zion nurseth not a few heretics within its bosom and that sir brian de boisguilbert is of the number  care not thou for such reports said the templar but let us think of making good the castlehow fought these villain yeomen on thy side  like fiends incarnate said de bracy they swarmed close up to the walls headed as i think by the knave who won the prize at the archery for i knew his horn and baldric and this is old fitzurses boasted policy encouraging these malapert knaves to rebel against us had i not been armed in proof the villain had marked me down seven times with as little remorse as if i had been a buck in season he told every rivet on my armour with a clothyard shaft that rapped against my ribs with as little compunction as if my bones had been of ironbut that i wore a shirt of spanish mail under my platecoat i had been fairly sped  but you maintained your post said the templar we lost the outwork on our part  that is a shrewd loss said de bracy the knaves will find cover there to assault the castle more closely and may if not well watched gain some unguarded corner of a tower or some forgotten window and so break in upon us our numbers are too few for the defence of every point and the men complain that they can nowhere show themselves but they are the mark for as many arrows as a parishbutt on a holyday even frontdeboeuf is dying too so we shall receive no more aid from his bulls head and brutal strength how think you sir brian were we not better make a virtue of necessity and compound with the rogues by delivering up our prisoners  how exclaimed the templar deliver up our prisoners and stand an object alike of ridicule and execration as the doughty warriors who dared by a nightattack to possess themselves of the persons of a party of defenceless travellers yet could not make good a strong castle against a vagabond troop of outlaws led by swineherds jesters and the very refuse of mankindshame on thy counsel maurice de bracythe ruins of this castle shall bury both my body and my shame ere i consent to such base and dishonourable composition  let us to the walls then said de bracy carelessly that man never breathed be he turk or templar who held life at lighter rate than i do but i trust there is no dishonour in wishing i had here some two scores of my gallant troop of free companionsoh my brave lances if ye knew but how hard your captain were this day bested how soon should i see my banner at the head of your clump of spears and how short while would these rabble villains stand to endure your encounter  wish for whom thou wilt said the templar but let us make what defence we can with the soldiers who remainthey are chiefly frontdeboeufs followers hated by the english for a thousand acts of insolence and oppression  the better said de bracy the rugged slaves will defend themselves to the last drop of their blood ere they encounter the revenge of the peasants without let us up and be doing then brian de boisguilbert and live or die thou shalt see maurice de bracy bear himself this day as a gentleman of blood and lineage  to the walls answered the templar and they both ascended the battlements to do all that skill could dictate and manhood accomplish in defence of the place they readily agreed that the point of greatest danger was that opposite to the outwork of which the assailants had possessed themselves the castle indeed was divided from that barbican by the moat and it was impossible that the besiegers could assail the posterndoor with which the outwork corresponded without surmounting that obstacle but it was the opinion both of the templar and de bracy that the besiegers if governed by the same policy their leader had already displayed would endeavour by a formidable assault to draw the chief part of the defenders observation to this point and take measures to avail themselves of every negligence which might take place in the defence elsewhere to guard against such an evil their numbers only permitted the knights to place sentinels from space to space along the walls in communication with each other who might give the alarm whenever danger was threatened meanwhile they agreed that de bracy should command the defence at the postern and the templar should keep with him a score of men or thereabouts as a body of reserve ready to hasten to any other point which might be suddenly threatened the loss of the barbican had also this unfortunate effect that notwithstanding the superior height of the castle walls the besieged could not see from them with the same precision as before the operations of the enemy for some straggling underwood approached so near the sallyport of the outwork that the assailants might introduce into it whatever force they thought proper not only under cover but even without the knowledge of the defenders utterly uncertain therefore upon what point the storm was to burst de bracy and his companion were under the necessity of providing against every possible contingency and their followers however brave experienced the anxious dejection of mind incident to men enclosed by enemies who possessed the power of choosing their time and mode of attack  meanwhile the lord of the beleaguered and endangered castle lay upon a bed of bodily pain and mental agony he had not the usual resource of bigots in that superstitious period most of whom were wont to atone for the crimes they were guilty of by liberality to the church stupefying by this means their terrors by the idea of atonement and forgiveness and although the refuge which success thus purchased was no more like to the peace of mind which follows on sincere repentance than the turbid stupefaction procured by opium resembles healthy and natural slumbers it was still a state of mind preferable to the agonies of awakened remorse but among the vices of frontdeboeuf a hard and griping man avarice was predominant and he preferred setting church and churchmen at defiance to purchasing from them pardon and absolution at the price of treasure and of manors nor did the templar an infidel of another stamp justly characterise his associate when he said frontdeboeuf could assign no cause for his unbelief and contempt for the established faith for the baron would have alleged that the church sold her wares too dear that the spiritual freedom which she put up to sale was only to be bought like that of the chief captain of jerusalem with a great sum and frontdeboeuf preferred denying the virtue of the medicine to paying the expense of the physician  but the moment had now arrived when earth and all his treasures were gliding from before his eyes and when the savage barons heart though hard as a nether millstone became appalled as he gazed forward into the waste darkness of futurity the fever of his body aided the impatience and agony of his mind and his deathbed exhibited a mixture of the newly awakened feelings of horror combating with the fixed and inveterate obstinacy of his dispositiona fearful state of mind only to be equalled in those tremendous regions where there are complaints without hope remorse without repentance a dreadful sense of present agony and a presentiment that it cannot cease or be diminished  where be these dogpriests now growled the baron who set such price on their ghostly mummerywhere be all those unshod carmelites for whom old

of heaven nor of helli have heard old men talk of prayerprayer by their own voicesuch need not to court or to bribe the false priestbut ii dare not  lives reginald frontdeboeuf said a broken and shrill voice close by his bedside to say there is that which he dares not  the evil conscience and the shaken nerves of frontdeboeuf heard in this strange interruption to his soliloquy the voice of one of those demons who as the superstition of the times believed beset the beds of dying men to distract their thoughts and turn them from the meditations which concerned their eternal welfare he shuddered and drew himself together but instantly summoning up his wonted resolution he exclaimed who is therewhat art thou that darest to echo my words in a tone like that of the nightravencome before my couch that i may see thee  i am thine evil angel reginald frontdeboeuf replied the voice  let me behold thee then in thy bodily shape if thou best indeed a fiend replied the dying knight think not that i will blench from theeby the eternal dungeon could i but grapple with these horrors that hover round me as i have done with mortal dangers heaven or hell should never say that i shrunk from the conflict  think on thy sins reginald frontdeboeuf said the almost unearthly voice on rebellion on rapine on murderwho stirred up the licentious john to war against his greyheaded fatheragainst his generous brother  be thou fiend priest or devil replied frontdeboeuf thou liest in thy throatnot i stirred john to rebellionnot i alonethere were fifty knights and barons the flower

thou be a demon thy time is not yet come  in peace thou shalt not die repeated the voice even in death shalt thou think on thy murderson the groans which this castle has echoedon the blood that is engrained in its floors  thou canst not shake me by thy petty malice answered frontdeboeuf with a ghastly and constrained laugh the infidel jewit was merit with heaven to deal with him as i did else

companion of thy punishment as the companion of thy guiltand now parricide farewell for evermay each stone of this vaulted roof find a tongue to echo that title into thine ear  so saying she left the apartment and frontdeboeuf could hear the crash of the ponderous key as she locked and doublelocked the door behind her thus cutting off the most slender chance of escape in the extremity of agony he shouted upon his servants and alliesstephen and saint maurclement and gilesi burn here unaidedto the rescueto the rescue brave boisguilbert valiant de bracyit is frontdeboeuf who callsit is your

altered mood for the noise of the conflict did not prevent the echoes of his own mad laughter from returning upon his earwho laughed thereulrica was it thouspeak witch and i forgive theefor only thou or the fiend of hell himself could have laughed at such a moment avauntavaunt  but it were impious to trace any farther the picture of the blasphemer and parricides deathbed     chapter xxxi       once more unto the breach dear friends once more      or close the wall up with our english dead      and you good yeomen      whose limbs were made in england show us here      the mettle of your pasturelet us swear      that you are worth your breeding      king henry v  cedric although not greatly confident in ulricas message omitted not to communicate her promise to the black knight and locksley they were well pleased to find they had a friend within the place who might in the moment of need be able to facilitate their entrance and readily agreed with the saxon that a storm under whatever disadvantages ought to be attempted as the only means of liberating the prisoners now in the hands of the cruel frontdeboeuf  the royal blood of alfred is endangered said cedric  the honour of a noble lady is in peril said the black knight  and by the saint christopher at my baldric said the good yeoman were there no other cause than the safety of that poor faithful knave wamba i would jeopard a joint ere a hair of his head were hurt  and so would i said the friar what sirs i trust well that a fooli mean dye see me sirs a fool that is free of his guild and master of his craft and can give as much relish and flavour to a cup of wine as ever a flitch of bacon cani say brethren such a fool shall never want a wise clerk to pray for or fight for him at a strait while i can say a mass or flourish a partisan and with that he made his heavy halberd to play around his head as a shepherd boy flourishes his light crook  true holy clerk said the black knight true as if saint dunstan himself had said itand now good locksley were it not well that noble cedric should assume the direction of this assault  not a jot i returned cedric i have never been wont to study either how to take or how to hold out those abodes of tyrannic power which the normans have erected in this groaning land i will fight among the foremost but my honest neighbours well know i am not a trained soldier in the discipline of wars or the attack of strongholds  since it stands thus with noble cedric said locksley i am most willing to take on me the direction of the archery and ye shall hang me up on my own trystingtree an the defenders be permitted to show themselves over the walls without being stuck with as many shafts as there are cloves in a gammon of bacon at christmas  well said stout yeoman answered the black knight and if i be thought worthy to have a charge in these matters and can find among these brave men as many as are willing to follow a true english knight for so i may surely call myself i am ready with such skill as my experience has taught me to lead them to the attack of these walls  the parts being thus distributed to the leaders they commenced the first assault of which the reader has already heard the issue  when the barbican was carried the sable knight sent notice of the happy event to locksley requesting him at the same time to keep such a strict observation on the castle as might prevent the defenders from combining their force for a sudden sally and recovering the outwork which they had lost this the knight was chiefly desirous of avoiding conscious that the men whom he led being hasty and untrained volunteers imperfectly armed and unaccustomed to discipline must upon any sudden attack fight at great disadvantage with the veteran soldiers of the norman knights who were well provided with arms both defensive and offensive and who to match the zeal and high spirit of the besiegers had all the confidence which arises from perfect discipline and the habitual use of weapons  the knight employed the interval in causing to be constructed a sort of floating bridge or long raft by means of which he hoped to cross the moat in despite of the resistance of the enemy this was a work of some time which the leaders the less regretted as it gave ulrica leisure to execute her plan of diversion in their favour whatever that might be  when the raft was completed the black knight addressed the besiegersit avails not waiting here longer my friends the sun is descending to the westand i have that upon my hands which will not permit me to tarry with you another day besides it will be a marvel if the horsemen come not upon us from york unless we speedily accomplish our purpose wherefore one of ye go to locksley and bid him commence a discharge of arrows on the opposite side of the castle and move forward as if about to assault it and you true english hearts stand by me and be ready to thrust the raft endlong over the moat whenever the postern on our side is thrown open follow me boldly across and aid me to burst yon sallyport in the main wall of the castle as many of you as like not this service or are but ill armed to meet it do you man the top of the outwork draw your bowstrings to your ears and mind you quell with your shot whatever shall appear to man the rampartnoble cedric wilt thou take the direction of those which remain  not so by the soul of hereward said the saxon lead i cannot but may posterity curse me in my grave if i follow not with the foremost wherever thou shalt point the waythe quarrel is mine and well it becomes me to be in the van of the battle  yet bethink thee noble saxon said the knight thou hast neither hauberk nor corslet nor aught but that light helmet target and sword  the better answered cedric i shall be the lighter to climb these walls andforgive the boast sir knightthou shalt this day see the naked breast of a saxon as boldly presented to the battle as ever ye beheld the steel corslet of a norman  in the name of god then said the knight fling open the door and launch the floating bridge  the portal which led from the innerwall of the barbican to the moat and which corresponded with a sallyport in the main wall of the castle was now suddenly opened the temporary bridge was then thrust forward and soon flashed in the waters extending its length between the castle and outwork and forming a slippery and precarious passage for two men abreast to cross the moat well aware of the importance of taking the foe by surprise the black knight closely followed by cedric threw himself upon the bridge and reached the opposite side here he began to thunder with his axe upon the gate of the castle protected in part from the shot and stones cast by the defenders by the ruins of the former drawbridge which the templar had demolished in his retreat from the barbican leaving the counterpoise still attached to the upper part of the portal the followers of the knight had no such shelter two were instantly shot with crossbow bolts and two more fell into the moat the others retreated back into the barbican  the situation of cedric and of the black knight was now truly dangerous and would have been still more so but for the constancy of the archers in the barbican who ceased not to shower their arrows upon the battlements distracting the attention of those by whom they were manned and thus affording a respite to their two chiefs from the storm of missiles which must otherwise have overwhelmed them but their situation was eminently perilous and was becoming more so with every moment  shame on ye all cried de bracy to the soldiers around him do ye call yourselves crossbowmen and let these two dogs keep their station under the walls of the castleheave over the coping stones from the battlements an better may not beget pickaxe and levers and down with that huge pinnacle pointing to a heavy piece of stone carvedwork that projected from the parapet  at this moment the besiegers caught sight of the red flag upon the angle of the tower which ulrica had described to cedric the stout yeoman locksley was the first who was aware of it as he was hasting to the outwork impatient to see the progress of the assault  saint george he cried merry saint george for englandto the charge bold yeomenwhy leave ye the good knight and noble cedric to storm the pass alonemake in mad priest show thou canst fight for thy rosarymake in brave yeomenthe castle is ours we have friends withinsee yonder flag it is the appointed signaltorquilstone is oursthink of honour think of spoilone effort and the place is ours  with that he bent his good bow and sent a shaft right through the breast of one of the menatarms who under de bracys direction was loosening a fragment from one of the battlements to precipitate on the heads of cedric and the black knight a second soldier caught from the hands of the dying man the iron crow with which he heaved at and had loosened the stone pinnacle when receiving an arrow through his headpiece he dropped from the battlements into the moat a dead man the menatarms were daunted for no armour seemed proof against the shot of this tremendous archer  do you give ground base knaves said de bracy mount joye saint dennisgive me the lever  and snatching it up he again assailed the loosened pinnacle which was of weight enough if thrown down not only to have destroyed the remnant of the drawbridge which sheltered the two foremost assailants but also to have sunk the rude float of planks over which they had crossed all saw the danger and the boldest even the stout friar himself avoided setting foot on the raft thrice did locksley bend his shaft against de bracy and thrice did his arrow bound back from the knights armour of proof  curse on thy spanish steelcoat said locksley had english smith forged it these arrows had gone through an as if it had been silk or sendal he then began to call out comrades friends noble cedric bear back and let the ruin fall  his warning voice was unheard for the din which the knight himself occasioned by his strokes upon the postern would have drowned twenty wartrumpets the faithful gurth indeed sprung forward on the planked bridge to warn cedric of his impending fate or to share it with him but his warning would have come too late the massive pinnacle already tottered and de bracy who still heaved at his task would have accomplished it had not the voice of the templar sounded close in his ears  all is lost de bracy the castle burns  thou art mad to say so replied the knight  it is all in a light flame on the western side i have striven in vain to extinguish it  with the stern coolness which formed the basis of his character brian de boisguilbert communicated this hideous intelligence which was not so calmly received by his astonished comrade  saints of paradise said de bracy what is to be done i vow to saint nicholas of limoges a candlestick of pure gold  spare thy vow said the templar and mark me lead thy men down as if to a sally throw the posterngate openthere are but two men who occupy the float fling them into the moat and push across for the barbican i will charge from the main gate and attack the barbican on the outside and if we can regain that post be assured we shall defend ourselves until we are relieved or at least till they grant us fair quarter  it is well thought upon said de bracy i will play my parttemplar thou wilt not fail me  hand and glove i will not said boisguilbert but haste thee in the name of god  de bracy hastily drew his men together and rushed down to the posterngate which he caused instantly to be thrown open but scarce was this done ere the portentous strength of the black knight forced his way inward in despite of de bracy and his followers two of the foremost instantly fell and the rest gave way notwithstanding all their leaders efforts to stop them  dogs said de bracy will ye let two men win our only pass for safety  he is the devil said a veteran manatarms bearing back from the blows of their sable antagonist  and if he be the devil replied de bracy would you fly from him into the mouth of hellthe castle burns behind us villainslet despair give you courage or let me forward i will cope with this champion myself  and well and chivalrous did de bracy that day maintain the fame he had acquired in the civil wars of that dreadful period the vaulted passage to which the postern gave entrance and in which these two redoubted champions were now fighting hand to hand rung with the furious blows which they dealt each other de bracy with his sword the black knight with his ponderous axe at length the norman received a blow which though its force was partly parried by his shield for otherwise never more would de bracy have again moved limb descended yet with such violence on his crest that he measured his length on the paved floor  yield thee de bracy said the black champion stooping over him and holding against the bars of his helmet the fatal poniard with which the knights dispatched their enemies and which was called the dagger of mercyyield thee maurice de bracy rescue or no rescue or thou art but a dead man  i will not yield replied de bracy faintly to an unknown conqueror tell me thy name or work thy pleasure on meit shall never be said that maurice de bracy was prisoner to a nameless churl  the black knight whispered something into the ear of the vanquished  i yield me to be true prisoner rescue or no rescue answered the norman exchanging his tone of stern and determined obstinacy for one of deep though sullen submission  go to the barbican said the victor in a tone of authority and there wait my further orders  yet first let me say said de bracy what it imports thee to know wilfred of ivanhoe is wounded and a prisoner and will perish in the burning castle without present help  wilfred of ivanhoe exclaimed the black knightprisoner and perishthe life of every man in the castle shall answer it if a hair of his head be singedshow me his chamber  ascend yonder winding stair said de bracy it leads to his apartmentwilt thou not accept my guidance he added in a submissive voice  no to the barbican and there wait my orders i trust thee not de bracy  during this combat and the brief conversation which ensued cedric at the head of a body of men among whom the friar was conspicuous had pushed across the bridge as soon as they saw the postern open and drove back the dispirited and despairing followers of de bracy of whom some asked quarter some offered vain resistance and the greater part fled towards the courtyard de bracy himself arose from the ground and cast a sorrowful glance after his conqueror he trusts me not he repeated but have i deserved his trust he then lifted his sword from the floor took off his helmet in token of submission and going to the barbican gave up his sword to locksley whom he met by the way  as the fire augmented symptoms of it became soon apparent in the chamber where ivanhoe was watched and tended by the jewess rebecca he had been awakened from his brief slumber by the noise of the battle and his attendant who had at his anxious desire again placed herself at the window to watch and report to him the fate of the attack was for some time prevented from observing either by the increase of the smouldering and stifling vapour at length the volumes of smoke which rolled into the apartmentthe cries for water which were heard even above the din of the battle made them sensible of the progress of this new danger  the castle burns said rebecca it burnswhat can we do to save ourselves  fly rebecca and save thine own life said ivanhoe for no human aid can avail me  i will not fly answered rebecca we will be saved or perish togetherand yet great godmy father my fatherwhat will be his fate  at this moment the door of the apartment flew open and the templar presented himselfa ghastly figure for his gilded armour was broken and bloody and the plume was partly shorn away partly burnt from his casque i have found thee said he to rebecca thou shalt prove i will keep my word to share weal and woe with theethere is but one path to safety i have cut my way through fifty dangers to point it to theeup and instantly follow me 38  alone answered rebecca i will not follow thee if thou wert born of womanif thou hast but a touch of human charity in theeif thy heart be not hard as thy breastplatesave my aged fathersave this wounded knight  a knight answered the templar with his characteristic calmness a knight rebecca must encounter his fate whether it meet him in the shape of sword or flameand who recks how or where a jew meets with his  savage warrior said rebecca rather will i perish in the flames than accept safety from thee  thou shalt not choose rebeccaonce didst thou foil me but never mortal did so twice  so saying he seized on the terrified maiden who filled the air with her shrieks and bore her out of the room in his arms in spite of her cries and without regarding the menaces and defiance which ivanhoe thundered against him hound of the templestain to thine orderset free the damsel traitor of boisguilbert it is ivanhoe commands theevillain i will have thy hearts blood  i had not found thee wilfred said the black knight who at that instant entered the apartment but for thy shouts  if thou best true knight said wilfred think not of mepursue yon ravishersave the lady rowenalook to the noble cedric  in their turn answered he of the fetterlock but thine is first  and seizing upon ivanhoe he bore him off with as much ease as the templar had carried off rebecca rushed with him to the postern and having there delivered his burden to the care of two yeomen he again entered the castle to assist in the rescue of the other prisoners  one turret was now in bright flames which flashed out furiously from window and shothole but in other parts the great thickness of the walls and the vaulted roofs of the apartments resisted the progress of the flames and there the rage of man still triumphed as the scarce more dreadful element held mastery elsewhere for the besiegers pursued the defenders of the castle from chamber to chamber and satiated in their blood the vengeance which had long animated them against the soldiers of the tyrant frontdeboeuf most of the garrison resisted to the uttermostfew of them asked quarternone received it the air was filled with groans and clashing of armsthe floors were slippery with the blood of despairing and expiring wretches  through this scene of confusion cedric rushed in quest of rowena while the faithful gurth following him closely through the melee neglected his own safety while he strove to avert the blows that were aimed at his master the noble saxon was so fortunate as to reach his wards apartment just as she had abandoned all hope of safety and with a crucifix clasped in agony to her bosom sat in expectation of instant death he committed her to the charge of gurth to be conducted in safety to the barbican the road to which was now cleared of the enemy and not yet interrupted by the flames this accomplished the loyal cedric hastened in quest of his friend athelstane determined at every risk to himself to save that last scion of saxon royalty but ere cedric penetrated as far as the old hall in which he had himself been a prisoner the inventive genius of wamba had procured liberation for himself and his companion in adversity  when the noise of the conflict announced that it was at the hottest the jester began to shout with the utmost power of his lungs saint george and the dragonbonny saint george for merry englandthe castle is won and these sounds he rendered yet more fearful by banging against each other two or three pieces of rusty armour which lay scattered around the hall  a guard which had been stationed in the outer or anteroom and whose spirits were already in a state of alarm took fright at wambas clamour and leaving the door open behind them ran to tell the templar that foemen had entered the old hall meantime the prisoners found no difficulty in making their escape into the anteroom and from thence into the court of the castle which was now the last scene of contest here sat the fierce templar mounted on horseback surrounded by several of the garrison both on horse and foot who had united their strength to that of this renowned leader in order to secure the last chance of safety and retreat which remained to them the drawbridge had been lowered by his orders but the passage was beset for the archers who had hitherto only annoyed the castle on that side by their missiles no sooner saw the flames breaking out and the bridge lowered than they thronged to the entrance as well to prevent the escape of the garrison as to secure their own share of booty ere the castle should be burnt down on the other hand a party of the besiegers who had entered by the postern were now issuing out into the courtyard and attacking with fury the remnant of the defenders who were thus assaulted on both sides at once  animated however by despair and supported by the example of their indomitable leader the remaining soldiers of the castle fought with the utmost valour and being wellarmed succeeded more than once in driving back the assailants though much inferior in numbers rebecca placed on horseback before one of the templars saracen slaves was in the midst of the little party and boisguilbert notwithstanding the confusion of the bloody fray showed every attention to her safety repeatedly he was by her side and neglecting his own defence held before her the fence of his triangular steelplated shield and anon starting from his position by her he cried his warcry dashed forward struck to earth the most forward of the assailants and was on the same instant once more at her bridle rein  athelstane who as the reader knows was slothful but not cowardly beheld the female form whom the templar protected thus sedulously and doubted not that it was rowena whom the knight was carrying off in despite of all resistance which could be offered  by the soul of saint edward he said i will rescue her from yonder overproud knight and he shall die by my hand  think what you do cried wamba hasty hand catches frog for fishby my bauble yonder is none of my lady rowenasee but her long dark locksnay an ye will not know black from white ye may be leader but i will be no followerno bones of mine shall be broken unless i know for whomand you without armour toobethink you silk bonnet never kept out steel bladenay then if wilful will to water wilful must drenchdeus vobiscum most doughty athelstanehe concluded loosening the hold which he had hitherto kept upon the saxons tunic  to snatch a mace from the pavement on which it lay beside one whose dying grasp had just relinquished itto rush on the templars band and to strike in quick succession to the right and left levelling a warrior at each blow was for athelstanes great strength now animated with unusual fury but the work of a single moment he was soon within two yards of boisguilbert whom he defied in his loudest tone  turn falsehearted templar let go her whom thou art unworthy to touchturn limb of a hand of murdering and hypocritical robbers  dog said the templar grinding his teeth i will teach thee to blaspheme the holy order of the temple of zion and with these words halfwheeling his steed he made a demicourbette towards the saxon and rising in the stirrups so as to take full advantage of the descent of the horse he discharged a fearful blow upon the head of athelstane  well said wamba that silken bonnet keeps out no steel blade so trenchant was the templars weapon that it shore asunder as it had been a willow twig the tough and plaited handle of the mace which the illfated saxon reared to parry the blow and descending on his head levelled him with the earth  ha beauseant exclaimed boisguilbert thus be it to the maligners of the templeknights taking advantage of the dismay which was spread by the fall of athelstane and calling aloud those who would save themselves follow me he pushed across the drawbridge dispersing the archers who would have intercepted them he was followed by his saracens and some five or six menatarms who had mounted their horses the templars retreat was rendered perilous by the numbers of arrows shot off at him and his party but this did not prevent him from galloping round to the barbican of which according to his previous plan he supposed it possible de bracy might have been in possession  de bracy de bracy he shouted art thou there  i am here replied de bracy but i am a

englandi dare not say more  well answered the templar an thou wilt tarry there remember i have redeemed word and glove be the hawks where they will methinks the walls of the preceptory of templestowe will be cover sufficient and thither will i like heron to her haunt  having thus spoken he galloped off with his followers  those of the castle who had not gotten to horse still continued to fight desperately with the besiegers after the departure of the templar but rather in despair of quarter than that they entertained any hope of escape the fire was spreading rapidly through all parts of the castle when ulrica who had first kindled it appeared on a turret in the guise of one of the ancient furies yelling forth a warsong such as was of yore raised on the field of battle by the scalds of the yet heathen saxons her long dishevelled grey hair flew back from her uncovered head the inebriating delight of gratified vengeance contended in her eyes with the fire of insanity and she brandished the distaff which she held in her hand as if she had been one of the fatal sisters who spin and abridge the thread of human life tradition has preserved some wild strophes of the barbarous hymn which she chanted wildly amid that scene of fire and of slaughter       1      whet the bright steel      sons of the white dragon      kindle the torch      daughter of hengist      the steel

rose to the evening skies one huge and burning beacon seen far and wide through the adjacent country tower after tower crashed down with blazing roof and rafter and the combatants were driven from the courtyard the vanquished of whom very few remained scattered and escaped into the neighbouring wood the victors assembling in large bands gazed with wonder not unmixed with fear upon the flames in which their own ranks and arms glanced dusky red the maniac figure of the saxon ulrica was for a long time visible on the lofty stand she had chosen tossing her arms abroad with wild exultation as if she reined empress of the conflagration which she had raised at length with a terrific crash the whole turret gave way and she perished in the flames which had consumed her tyrant an awful pause of horror silenced each murmur of the armed spectators who for the space of several minutes stirred not a finger save to sign the cross the voice of locksley was then heard shout yeomenthe den of tyrants is no more let each bring his spoil to our chosen place of rendezvous at the trystingtree in the harthillwalk for there at break of day will we make just partition among our own bands together with our worthy allies in this great deed of vengeance     chapter xxxii       trust me each state must have its policies      kingdoms have edicts cities have their charters      even the wild outlaw in his forestwalk      keeps yet some touch of civil discipline      for not since adam wore his verdant apron      hath man with man in social union dwelt      but laws were made to draw that union closer      old play  the daylight had dawned upon the glades of the oak forest the green boughs glittered with all their pearls of dew the hind led her fawn from the covert of high fern to the more open walks of the greenwood and no huntsman was there to watch or intercept the stately hart as he paced at the head of the antlerd herd  the outlaws were all assembled around the trystingtree in the harthillwalk where they had spent the night in refreshing themselves after the fatigues of the siege some with wine some with slumber many with hearing and recounting the events of the day and computing the heaps of plunder which their success had placed at the disposal of their chief  the spoils were indeed very large for notwithstanding that much was consumed a great deal of plate rich armour and splendid clothing had been secured by the exertions of the dauntless outlaws who could be appalled by no danger when such rewards were in view yet so strict were the laws of their society that no one ventured to appropriate any part of the booty which was brought into one common mass to be at the disposal of their leader  the place of rendezvous was an aged oak not however the same to which locksley had conducted gurth and wamba in the earlier part of the story but one which was the centre of a silvan amphitheatre within half a mile of the demolished castle of torquilstone here locksley assumed his seata throne of turf erected under the twisted branches of the huge oak and the silvan followers were gathered around him he assigned to the black knight a seat at his right hand and to cedric a place upon his left  pardon my freedom noble sirs he said but in these glades i am monarchthey are my kingdom and these my wild subjects would reck but little of my power were i within my own dominions to yield place to mortal mannow sirs who hath seen our chaplain where is our curtal friar a mass amongst christian men best begins a busy morningno one had seen the clerk of copmanhurst over gods forbode said the outlaw chief i trust the jolly priest hath but abidden by the winepot a thought too late who saw him since the castle was taen  i quoth the miller marked him busy about the door of a cellar swearing by each saint in the calendar he would taste the smack of frontdeboeufs gascoigne wine  now the saints as many as there be of them said the captain forefend lest he has drunk too deep of the winebutts and perished by the fall of the castleaway millertake with you enow of men seek the place where you last saw himthrow water from the moat on the scorching ruinsi will have them removed stone by stone ere i lose my curtal friar  the numbers who hastened to execute this duty considering that an interesting division of spoil was about to take place showed how much the troop had at heart the safety of their spiritual father  meanwhile let us proceed said locksley for when this bold deed shall be sounded abroad the bands of de bracy of malvoisin and other allies of frontdeboeuf will be in motion against us and it were well for our safety that we retreat from the vicinitynoble cedric he said turning to the saxon that spoil is divided into two portions do thou make choice of that which best suits thee to recompense thy people who were partakers with us in this adventure  good yeoman said cedric my heart is oppressed with sadness the noble athelstane of coningsburgh is no morethe last sprout of the sainted confessor hopes have perished with him which can never returna sparkle hath been quenched by his blood which no human breath can again rekindle my people save the few who are now with me do but tarry my presence to transport his honoured remains to their last mansion the lady rowena is desirous to return to rotherwood and must be escorted by a sufficient force i should therefore ere now have left this place and i waitednot to share the booty for so help me god and saint withold as neither i nor any of mine will touch the value of a liardi waited but to render my thanks to thee and to thy bold yeomen for the life and honour ye have saved  nay but said the chief outlaw we did but half the work at mosttake of the spoil what may reward your own neighbours and followers  i am rich enough to reward them from mine own wealth answered cedric  and some said wamba have been wise enough to reward themselves they do not march off emptyhanded altogether we do not all wear motley  they are welcome said locksley our laws bind none but ourselves  but thou my poor knave said cedric turning about and embracing his jester how shall i reward thee who feared not to give thy body to chains and death instead of mineall forsook me when the poor fool was faithful  a tear stood in the eye of the rough thane as he spokea mark of feeling which even the death of athelstane had not extracted but there was something in the halfinstinctive attachment of his clown that waked his nature more keenly than even grief itself  nay said the jester extricating himself from masters caress if you pay my service with the water of your eye the jester must weep for company and then what becomes of his vocationbut uncle if you would indeed pleasure me i pray you to pardon my playfellow gurth who stole a week from your service to bestow it on your son  pardon him exclaimed cedric i will both pardon and reward himkneel down gurththe swineherd was in an instant at his masters feettheow and esne 40 art thou no longer said cedric touching him with a wand folkfree and sacless 41 art thou in town and from town in the forest as in the field a hide of land i give to thee in my steads of walbrugham from me and mine to thee and thine aye and for ever and gods malison on his head who this gainsays  no longer a serf but a freeman and a landholder gurth sprung upon his feet and twice bounded aloft to almost his own height from the ground a smith and a file he cried to do away the collar from the neck of a freemannoble master doubled is my strength by your gift and doubly will i fight for youthere is a free spirit in my breasti am a man changed to myself and all aroundha fangs he continuedfor that faithful cur seeing his master thus transported began to jump upon him to express his sympathyknowest thou thy master still  ay said wamba fangs and i still know thee gurth though we must needs abide by the collar it is only thou art likely to forget both us and thyself  i shall forget myself indeed ere i forget thee true comrade said gurth and were freedom fit for thee wamba the master would not let thee want it  nay said wamba never think i envy thee brother gurth the serf sits by the hallfire when the freeman must forth to the field of battleand what saith oldhelm of malmsburybetter a fool at a feast than a wise man at a fray  the tramp of horses was now heard and the lady rowena appeared surrounded by several riders and a much stronger party of footmen who joyfully shook their pikes and clashed their brownbills for joy of her freedom she herself richly attired and mounted on a dark chestnut palfrey had recovered all the dignity of her manner and only an unwonted degree of paleness showed the sufferings she had undergone her lovely brow though sorrowful bore on it a cast of reviving hope for the future as well as of grateful thankfulness for the past deliveranceshe knew that ivanhoe was safe and she knew that athelstane was dead the former assurance filled her with the most sincere delight and if she did not absolutely rejoice at the latter she might be pardoned for feeling the full advantage of being freed from further persecution on the only subject in which she had ever been contradicted by her guardian cedric  as rowena bent her steed towards locksleys seat that bold yeoman with all his followers rose to receive her as if by a general instinct of courtesy the blood rose to her cheeks as courteously waving her hand and bending so low that her beautiful and loose tresses were for an instant mixed with the flowing mane of her palfrey she expressed in few but apt words her obligations and her gratitude to locksley and her other deliverersgod bless you brave men she concluded god and our lady bless you and requite you for gallantly perilling yourselves in the cause of the oppressedif any of you should hunger remember rowena has foodif you should thirst she has many a butt of wine and brown aleand if the normans drive ye from these walks rowena has forests of her own where her gallant deliverers may range at full freedom and never ranger ask whose arrow hath struck down the deer  thanks gentle lady said locksley thanks from my company and myself but to have saved you requites itself we who walk the greenwood do many a wild deed and the lady rowenas deliverance may be received as an atonement  again bowing from her palfrey rowena turned to depart but pausing a moment while cedric who was to attend her was also taking his leave she found herself unexpectedly close by the prisoner de bracy he stood under a tree in deep meditation his arms crossed upon his breast and rowena was in hopes she might pass him unobserved he looked up however and when aware of her presence a deep flush of shame suffused his handsome countenance he stood a moment most irresolute then stepping forward took her palfrey by the rein and bent his knee before her  will the lady rowena deign to cast an eyeon a captive knighton a dishonoured soldier  sir knight answered rowena in enterprises such as yours the real dishonour lies not in failure but in success  conquest lady should soften the heart answered de bracy let me but know that the lady rowena forgives the violence occasioned by an illfated passion and she shall soon learn that de bracy knows how to serve her in nobler ways  i forgive you sir knight said rowena as a christian  that means said wamba that she does not forgive him at all  but i can never forgive the misery and desolation your madness has occasioned continued rowena  unloose your hold on the ladys rein said cedric coming up by the bright sun above us but it were shame i would pin thee to the earth with my javelinbut be well assured thou shalt smart maurice de bracy for thy share in this foul deed  he threatens safely who threatens a prisoner said de bracy but when had a saxon any touch of courtesy  then retiring two steps backward he permitted the lady to move on  cedric ere they departed expressed his peculiar gratitude to the black champion and earnestly entreated him to accompany him to rotherwood  i know he said that ye errant knights desire to carry your fortunes on the point of your lance and reck not of land or goods but war is a changeful mistress and a home is sometimes desirable even to the champion whose trade is wandering thou hast earned one in the halls of rotherwood noble knight cedric has wealth enough to repair the injuries of fortune and all he has is his delivererscome therefore to rotherwood not as a guest but as a son or brother  cedric has already made me rich said the knighthe has taught me the value of saxon virtue to rotherwood will i come brave saxon and that speedily but as now pressing matters of moment detain me from your halls peradventure when i come hither i will ask such a boon as will put even thy generosity to the test  it is granted ere spoken out said cedric striking his ready hand into the gauntleted palm of the black knightit is granted already were it to affect half my fortune  gage not thy promise so lightly said the knight of the fetterlock yet well i hope to gain the boon i shall ask meanwhile adieu  i have but to say added the saxon that during the funeral rites of the noble athelstane i shall be an inhabitant of the halls of his castle of coningsburghthey will be open to all who choose to partake of the funeral banqueting and i speak in name of the noble edith mother of the fallen prince they will never be shut against him who laboured so bravely though unsuccessfully to save athelstane from norman chains and norman steel  ay ay said wamba who had resumed his attendance on his master rare feeding there will bepity that the noble athelstane cannot banquet at his own funeralbut he continued the jester lifting up his eyes gravely is supping in paradise and doubtless does honour to the cheer  peace and move on said cedric his anger at this untimely jest being checked by the recollection of wambas recent services rowena waved a graceful adieu to him of the fetterlockthe saxon bade god speed him and on they moved through a wide glade of the forest  they had scarce departed ere a sudden procession moved from under the greenwood branches swept slowly round the silvan amphitheatre and took the same direction with rowena and her followers the priests of a neighbouring convent in expectation of the ample donation or soulscat which cedric had propined attended upon the car in which the body of athelstane was laid and sang hymns as it was sadly and slowly borne on the shoulders of his vassals to his castle of coningsburgh to be there deposited in the grave of hengist from whom the deceased derived his long descent many of his vassals had assembled at the news of his death and followed the bier with all the external marks at least of dejection and sorrow again the outlaws arose and paid the same rude and spontaneous homage to death which they had so lately rendered to beautythe slow chant and mournful step of the priests brought back to their remembrance such of their comrades as had fallen in the yesterdays array but such recollections dwell not long with those who lead a life of danger and enterprise and ere the sound of the deathhymn had died on the wind the outlaws were again busied in the distribution of their spoil  valiant knight said locksley to the black champion without whose good heart and mighty arm our enterprise must altogether have failed will it please you to take from that mass of spoil whatever may best serve to pleasure you and to remind you of this my trystingtree  i accept the offer said the knight as frankly as it is given and i ask permission to dispose of sir maurice de bracy at my own pleasure  he is thine already said locksley and well for him else the tyrant had graced the highest bough of this oak with as many of his freecompanions as we could gather hanging thick as acorns around himbut he is thy prisoner and he is safe though he had slain my father  de bracy said the knight thou art freedepart he whose prisoner thou art scorns to take mean revenge for what is past but beware of the future lest a worse thing befall theemaurice de bracy i say beware  de bracy bowed low and in silence and was about to withdraw when the yeomen burst at once into a shout of execration and derision the proud knight instantly stopped turned back folded his arms drew up his form to its full height and exclaimed peace ye yelping curs who open upon a cry which ye followed not when the stag was at bayde bracy scorns your censure as he would disdain your applause to your brakes and caves ye outlawed thieves and be silent when aught knightly or noble is but spoken within a league of your foxearths  this illtimed defiance might have procured for de bracy a volley of arrows but for the hasty and imperative interference of the outlaw chief meanwhile the knight caught a horse by the rein for several which had been taken in the stables of frontdeboeuf stood accoutred around and were a valuable part of the booty he threw himself upon the saddle and galloped off through the wood  when the bustle occasioned by this incident was somewhat composed the chief outlaw took from his neck the rich horn and baldric which he had recently gained at the strife of archery near ashby  noble knight he said to him of the fetterlock if you disdain not to grace by your acceptance a bugle which an english yeoman has once worn this i will pray you to keep as a memorial of your gallant bearingand if ye have aught to do and as happeneth oft to a gallant knight ye chance to be hard bested in any forest between trent and tees wind three mots 42 upon the horn thus wasahoa and it may well chance ye shall find helpers and rescue  he then gave breath to the bugle and winded once and again the call which he described until the knight had caught the notes  gramercy for the gift bold yeoman said the knight and better help than thine and thy rangers would i never seek were it at my utmost need and then in his turn he winded the call till all the greenwood rang  well blown and clearly said the yeoman beshrew me an thou knowest not as much of woodcraft as of warthou hast been a striker of deer in thy day i warrantcomrades mark these three motsit is the call of the knight of the fetterlock and he who hears it and hastens not to serve him at his need i will have him scourged out of our band with his own bowstring  long live our leader shouted the yeomen and long live the black knight of the fetterlockmay he soon use our service to prove how readily it will be paid  locksley now proceeded to the distribution of the spoil which he performed with the most laudable impartiality a tenth part of the whole was set apart for the church and for pious uses a portion was next allotted to a sort of public treasury a part was assigned to the widows and children of those who had fallen or to be expended in masses for the souls of such as had left no surviving family the rest was divided amongst the outlaws according to their rank and merit and the judgment of the chief on all such doubtful questions as occurred was delivered with great shrewdness and received with absolute submission the black knight was not a little surprised to find that men in a state so lawless were nevertheless among themselves so regularly and equitably governed and all that he observed added to his opinion of the justice and judgment of their leader  when each had taken his own proportion of the booty and while the treasurer accompanied by four tall yeomen was transporting that belonging to the state to some place of concealment or of security the portion devoted to the church still remained unappropriated  i would said the leader we could hear tidings of our joyous chaplainhe was never wont to be absent when meat was to be blessed or spoil to be parted and it is his duty to take care of these the tithes of our successful enterprise it may be the office has helped to cover some of his canonical irregularities also i have a holy brother of his a prisoner at no great distance and i would fain have the friar to help me to deal with him in due sorti greatly misdoubt the safety of the bluff priest  i were right sorry for that said the knight of the fetterlock for i stand indebted to him for the joyous hospitality of a merry night in his cell let us to the ruins of the castle it may be we shall there learn some tidings of him  while they thus spoke a loud shout among the yeomen announced the arrival of him for whom they feared as they learned from the stentorian voice of the friar himself long before they saw his burly person  make room my merrymen he exclaimed room for your godly father and his prisonercry welcome once morei come noble leader like an eagle with my prey in my clutchand making his way through the ring amidst the laughter of all around he appeared in majestic triumph his huge partisan in one hand and in the other a halter one end of which was fastened to the neck of the unfortunate isaac of york who bent down by sorrow and terror was dragged on by the victorious priest who shouted aloud where is allanadale to chronicle me in a ballad or if it were but a layby saint hermangild the jingling crowder is ever out of the way where there is an apt theme for exalting valour  curtal priest said the captain thou hast been at a wet mass this morning as early as it is in the name of saint nicholas whom hast thou got here  a captive to my sword and to my lance noble captain replied the clerk of copmanhurst to my bow and to my halberd i should rather say and yet i have redeemed him by my divinity from a worse captivity speak jewhave i not ransomed thee from sathanashave i not taught thee thy credo thy pater and thine ave mariadid i not spend the whole night in drinking to thee and in expounding of mysteries  for the love of god ejaculated the poor jew will no one take me out of the keeping of this madi mean this holy man  hows this jew said the friar with a menacing aspect dost thou recant jewbethink thee if thou dost relapse into thine infidelity though thou are not so tender as a suckling pigi would i had one to break my fast uponthou art not too tough to be roasted be conformable isaac and repeat the words after me ave maria  nay we will have no profanation mad priest said locksley let us rather hear where you found this prisoner of thine  by saint dunstan said the friar i found him where i sought for better ware i did step into the cellarage to see what might be rescued there for though a cup of burnt wine with spice be an evenings drought for an emperor it were waste methought to let so much good liquor be mulled at once and i had caught up one runlet of sack and was coming to call more aid among these lazy knaves who are ever to seek when a good deed is to be done when i was avised of a strong dooraha thought i here is the choicest juice of all in this secret crypt and the knave butler being disturbed in his vocation hath left the key in the doorin therefore i went and found just nought besides a commodity of rusted chains and this dog of a jew who presently rendered himself my prisoner rescue or no rescue i did but refresh myself after the fatigue of the action with the unbeliever with one humming cup of sack and was proceeding to lead forth my captive when crash after crash as with wild thunderdint and levinfire down toppled the masonry of an outer tower marry beshrew their hands that built it not the firmer and blocked up the passage the roar of one falling tower followed anotheri gave up thought of life and deeming it a dishonour to one of my profession to pass out of this world in company with a jew i heaved up my halberd to beat his brains out but i took pity on his grey hairs and judged it better to lay down the partisan and take up my spiritual weapon for his conversion and truly by the blessing of saint dunstan the seed has been sown in good soil only that with speaking to him of mysteries through the whole night and being in a manner fasting for the few droughts of sack which i sharpened my wits with were not worth marking my head is wellnigh dizzied i trowbut i was clean exhaustedgilbert and wibbald know in what state they found mequite and clean exhausted  we can bear witness said gilbert for when we had cleared away the ruin and by saint dunstans help lighted upon the dungeon stair we found the runlet of sack half empty the jew half dead and the friar more than halfexhausted as he calls it  ye be knaves ye lie retorted the offended friar it was you and your gormandizing companions that drank up the sack and called it your morning draughti am a pagan an i kept it not for the captains own throat but what recks it the jew is converted and understands all i have told him very nearly if not altogether as well as myself  jew said the captain is this true hast thou renounced thine unbelief  may i so find mercy in your eyes said the jew as i know not one word which the reverend prelate spake to me all this fearful night alas i was so distraught with agony and fear and grief that had our holy father abraham come to preach to me he had found but a deaf listener  thou liest jew and thou knowest thou dost said the friar i will remind thee of but one word of our conferencethou didst promise to give all thy substance to our holy order  so help me the promise fair sirs said isaac even more alarmed than before as no such sounds ever crossed my lips alas i am an aged beggard mani fear me a childlesshave ruth on me and let me go  nay said the friar if thou dost retract vows made in favour of holy church thou must do penance  accordingly he raised his halberd and would have laid the staff of it lustily on the jews shoulders had not the black knight stopped the blow and thereby transferred the holy clerks resentment to himself  by saint thomas of kent said he an i buckle to my gear i will teach thee sir lazy lover to mell with thine own matters maugre thine iron case there  nay be not wroth with me said the knight thou knowest i am thy sworn friend and comrade  i know no such thing answered the friar and defy thee for a meddling coxcomb  nay but said the knight who seemed to take a pleasure in provoking his quondam host hast thou forgotten how that for my sake for i say nothing of the temptation of the flagon and the pasty thou didst break thy vow of fast and vigil  truly friend said the friar clenching his huge fist i will bestow a buffet on thee  i accept of no such presents said the knight i am content to take thy cuff 421 as a loan but i will repay thee with usury as deep as ever thy prisoner there exacted in his traffic  i will prove that presently said the friar  hola cried the captain what art thou after mad friar brawling beneath our trystingtree  no brawling said the knight it is but a friendly interchange of courtesyfriar strike an thou daresti will stand thy blow if thou wilt stand mine  thou hast the advantage with that iron pot on thy head said the churchman but have at theedown thou goest an thou wert goliath of gath in his brazen helmet  the friar bared his brawny arm up to the elbow and putting his full strength to the blow gave the knight a buffet that might have felled an ox but his adversary stood firm as a rock a loud shout was uttered by all the yeomen around for the clerks cuff was proverbial amongst them and there were few who in jest or earnest had not had the occasion to know its vigour  now priest said the knight pulling off his gauntlet if i had vantage on my head i will have none on my handstand fast as a true man  genam meam dedi vapulatorii have given my cheek to the smiter said the priest an thou canst stir me from the spot fellow i will freely bestow on thee the jews ransom  so spoke the burly priest assuming on his part high defiance but who may resist his fate the buffet of the knight was given with such strength and goodwill that the friar rolled head over heels upon the plain to the great amazement of all the spectators but he arose neither angry nor crestfallen  brother said he to the knight thou shouldst have used thy strength with more discretion i had mumbled but a lame mass an thou hadst broken my jaw for the piper plays ill that wants the nether chops nevertheless there is my hand in friendly witness that i will exchange no more cuffs with thee having been a loser by the barter end now all unkindness let us put the jew to ransom since the leopard will not change his spots and a jew he will continue to be  the priest said clement is not half so confident of the jews conversion since he received that buffet on the ear  go to knave what pratest thou of conversionswhat is there no respectall masters and no meni tell thee fellow i was somewhat totty when i received the good knights blow or i had kept my ground under it but an thou gibest more of it thou shalt learn i can give as well as take  peace all said the captain and thou jew think of thy ransom thou needest not to be told that thy race are held to be accursed in all christian communities and trust me that we cannot endure thy presence among us think therefore of an offer while i examine a prisoner of another cast  were many of frontdeboeufs men taken demanded the black knight  none of note enough to be put to ransom answered the captain a set of hilding fellows there were whom we dismissed to find them a new masterenough had been done for revenge and profit the bunch of them were not worth a cardecu the prisoner i speak of is better bootya jolly monk riding to visit his leman an i may judge by his horsegear and wearing apparelhere cometh the worthy prelate as pert as a pyet and between two yeomen was brought before the silvan throne of the outlaw chief our old friend prior aymer of jorvaulx     chapter xxxiii       flower of warriors      how ist with titus lartius      marciusas with a man busied about decrees      condemning some to death and some to exile      ransoming him or pitying threatening the other      coriolanus   the captive abbots features and manners exhibited a whimsical mixture of offended pride and deranged foppery and bodily terror  why how now my masters said he with a voice in which all three emotions were blended what order is this among ye be ye turks or christians that handle a churchmanknow ye what it is manus imponere in servos domini ye have plundered my mailstorn my cope of curious cut lace which might have served a cardinalanother in my place would have been at his excommunicabo vos but i am placible and if ye order forth my palfreys release my brethren and restore my mails tell down with all speed an hundred crowns to be expended in masses at the high altar of jorvaulx abbey and make your vow to eat no venison until next pentecost it may be you shall hear little more of this mad frolic  holy father said the chief outlaw it grieves me to think that you have met with such usage from any of my followers as calls for your fatherly reprehension  usage echoed the priest encouraged by the mild tone of the silvan leader it were usage fit for no hound of good racemuch less for a christianfar less for a priestand least of all for the prior of the holy community of jorvaulx here is a profane and drunken minstrel called allanadalenebulo quidamwho has menaced me with corporal punishmentnay with death itself an i pay not down four hundred crowns of ransom to the boot of all the treasure he hath already robbed me ofgold chains and gymmal rings to an unknown value besides what is broken and spoiled among their rude hands such as my pouncerbox and silver crispingtongs  it is impossible that allanadale can have thus treated a man of your reverend bearing replied the captain  it is true as the gospel of saint nicodemus said the prior he swore with many a cruel northcountry oath that he would hang me up on the highest tree in the greenwood  did he so in very deed nay then reverend father i think you had better comply with his demandsfor allanadale is the very man to abide by his word when he has so pledged it 43  you do but jest with me said the astounded prior with a forced laugh and i love a good jest with all my heart but ha ha ha when the mirth has lasted the livelong night it is time to be grave in the morning  and i am as grave as a father confessor replied the outlaw you must pay a round ransom sir prior or your convent is likely to be called to a new election for your place will know you no more  are ye christians said the prior and hold this language to a churchman  christians ay marry are we and have divinity among us to boot answered the outlaw let our buxom chaplain stand forth and expound to this reverend father the texts which concern this matter  the friar halfdrunk halfsober had huddled a friars frock over his green cassock and now summoning together whatever scraps of learning he had acquired by rote in former days holy father said he deus faciat salvam benignitatem vestramyou are welcome to the greenwood  what profane mummery is this said the prior friend if thou best indeed of the church it were a better deed to show me how i may escape from these mens hands than to stand ducking and grinning here like a morrisdancer  truly reverend father said the friar i know but one mode in which thou mayst escape this is saint andrews day with us we are taking our tithes  but not of the church then i trust my good brother said the prior  of church and lay said the friar and therefore sir prior facite vobis amicos de mammone iniquitatismake yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness for no other friendship is like to serve your turn  i love a jolly woodsman at heart said the prior softening his tone come ye must not deal too hard with mei can well of woodcraft and can wind a horn clear and lustily and hollo till every oak rings againcome ye must not deal too hard with me  give him a horn said the outlaw we will prove the skill he boasts of  the prior aymer winded a blast accordingly the captain shook his head  sir prior he said thou blowest a merry note but it may not ransom theewe cannot afford as the legend on a good knights shield hath it to set thee free for a blast moreover i have found theethou art one of those who with new french graces and traliras disturb the ancient english bugle notesprior that last flourish on the recheat hath added fifty crowns to thy ransom for corrupting the true old manly blasts of venerie  well friend said the abbot peevishly thou art ill to please with thy woodcraft i pray thee be more conformable in this matter of my ransom at a wordsince i must needs for once hold a candle to the devilwhat ransom am i to pay for walking on watlingstreet without having fifty men at my back  were it not well said the lieutenant of the gang apart to the captain that the prior should name the jews ransom and the jew name the priors  thou art a mad knave said the captain but thy plan transcendshere jew step forthlook at that holy father aymer prior of the rich abbey of jorvaulx and tell us at what ransom we should hold himthou knowest the income of his convent i warrant thee  o assuredly said isaac i have trafficked with the good fathers and bought wheat and barley and fruits of the earth and also much wool o it is a rich abbeystede and they do live upon the fat and drink the sweet wines upon the lees these good fathers of jorvaulx ah if an outcast like me had such a home to go to and such incomings by the year and by the month i would pay much gold and silver to redeem my captivity  hound of a jew exclaimed the prior no one knows better than thy own cursed self that our holy house of god is indebted for the finishing of our chancel  and for the storing of your cellars in the last season with the due allowance of gascon wine interrupted the jew but thatthat is small matters  hear the infidel dog said the churchman he jangles as if our holy community did come under debts for the wines we have a license to drink propter necessitatem et ad frigus depellendum the circumcised villain blasphemeth the holy church and christian men listen and rebuke him not  all this helps nothing said the leaderisaac pronounce what he may pay without flaying both hide and hair  an six hundred crowns said isaac the good prior might well pay to your honoured valours and never sit less soft in his stall  six hundred crowns said the leader gravely i am contentedthou hast well spoken isaacsix hundred crownsit is a sentence sir prior  a sentencea sentence exclaimed the band solomon had not done it better  thou hearest thy doom prior said the leader  ye are mad my masters said the prior where am i to find such a sum if i sell the very pyx and candlesticks on the altar at jorvaulx i shall scarce raise the half and it will be necessary for that purpose that i go to jorvaulx myself ye may retain as borrows 44 my two priests  that will be but blind trust said the outlaw we will retain thee prior and send them to fetch thy ransom thou shalt not want a cup of wine and a collop of venison the while and if thou lovest woodcraft thou shalt see such as your north country never witnessed  or if so please you said isaac willing to curry favour with the outlaws i can send to york for the six hundred crowns out of certain monies in my hands if so be that the most reverend prior present will grant me a quittance  he shall grant thee whatever thou dost list isaac said the captain and thou shalt lay down the redemption money for prior aymer as well as for thyself  for myself ah courageous sirs said the jew i am a broken and impoverished man a beggars staff must be my portion through life supposing i were to pay you fifty crowns  the prior shall judge of that matter replied the captainhow say you father aymer can the jew afford a good ransom  can he afford a ransom answered the prior is he not isaac of york rich enough to redeem the captivity of the ten tribes of israel who were led into assyrian bondagei have seen but little of him myself but our cellarer and treasurer have dealt largely with him and report says that his house at york is so full of gold and silver as is a shame in any christian land marvel it is to all living christian hearts that such gnawing adders should be suffered to eat into the bowels of the state and even of the holy church herself with foul usuries and extortions  hold father said the jew mitigate and assuage your choler i pray of your reverence to remember that i force my monies upon no one but when churchman and layman prince and prior knight and priest come knocking to isaacs door they borrow not his shekels with these uncivil terms it is then friend isaac will you pleasure us in this matter and our day shall be truly kept so god sa meand kind isaac if ever you served man show yourself a friend in this need and when the day comes and i ask my own then what hear i but damned jew and the curse of egypt on your tribe and all that may stir up the rude and uncivil populace against poor strangers  prior said the captain jew though he be he hath in this spoken well do thou therefore name his ransom as he named thine without farther rude terms  none but latro famosusthe interpretation whereof said the prior will i give at some other time and tidewould place a christian prelate and an unbaptized jew upon the same bench but since ye require me to put a price upon this caitiff i tell you openly that ye will wrong yourselves if you take from him a penny under a thousand crowns  a sentencea sentence exclaimed the chief outlaw  a sentencea sentence shouted his assessors the christian has shown his good nurture and dealt with us more generously than the jew  the god of my fathers help me said the jew will ye bear to the ground an impoverished creaturei am this day childless and will ye deprive me of the means of livelihood  thou wilt have the less to provide for jew if thou art childless said aymer  alas my lord said isaac your law permits you not to know how the child of our bosom is entwined with the strings of our hearto rebecca laughter of my beloved rachel were each leaf on that tree a zecchin and each zecchin mine own all that mass of wealth would i give to know whether thou art alive and escaped the hands of the nazarene  was not thy daughter darkhaired said one of the outlaws and wore she not a veil of twisted sendal broidered with silver  she didshe did said the old man trembling with eagerness as formerly with fear the blessing of jacob be upon thee canst thou tell me aught of her safety  it was she then said the yeoman who was carried off by the proud templar when he broke through our ranks on yestereven i had drawn my bow to send a shaft after him but spared him even for the sake of the damsel who i feared might take harm from the arrow  oh answered the jew i would to god thou hadst shot though the arrow had pierced her bosombetter the tomb of her fathers than the dishonourable couch of the licentious and savage templar ichabod ichabod the glory hath departed from my house  friends said the chief looking round the old man is but a jew natheless his grief touches medeal uprightly with us isaacwill paying this ransom of a thousand crowns leave thee altogether penniless  isaac recalled to think of his worldly goods the love of which by dint of inveterate habit contended even with his parental affection grew pale stammered and could not deny there might be some small surplus  wellgo towhat though there be said the outlaw we will not reckon with thee too closely without treasure thou mayst as well hope to redeem thy child from the clutches of sir brian de boisguilbert as to shoot a stagroyal with a headless shaftwe will take thee at the same ransom with prior aymer or rather at one hundred crowns lower which hundred crowns shall be mine own peculiar loss and not light upon this worshipful community and so we shall avoid the heinous offence of rating a jew merchant as high as a christian prelate and thou wilt have six hundred crowns remaining to treat for thy daughters ransom templars love the glitter of silver shekels as well as the sparkle of black eyeshasten to make thy crowns chink in the ear of de boisguilbert ere worse comes of it thou wilt find him as our scouts have brought notice at the next preceptory house of his ordersaid i well my merry mates  the yeomen expressed their wonted acquiescence in their leaders opinion and isaac relieved of one half of his apprehensions by learning that his daughter lived and might possibly be ransomed threw himself at the feet of the generous outlaw and rubbing his beard against his buskins sought to kiss the hem of his green cassock the captain drew himself back and extricated himself from the jews grasp not without some marks of contempt  nay beshrew thee man up with thee i am english born and love no such eastern prostrationskneel to god and not to a poor sinner like me  ay jew said prior aymer kneel to god as represented in the servant of his altar and who knows with thy sincere repentance and due gifts to the shrine of saint robert what grace thou mayst acquire for thyself and thy daughter rebecca i grieve for the maiden for she is of fair and comely countenancei beheld her in the lists of ashby also brian de boisguilbert is one with whom i may do muchbethink thee how thou mayst deserve my good word with him  alas alas said the jew on every hand the spoilers arise against mei am given as a prey unto the assyrian and a prey unto him of egypt  and what else should be the lot of thy accursed race answered the prior for what saith holy writ verbum domini projecerunt et sapientia est nulla in eisthey have cast forth the word of the lord and there is no wisdom in them propterea dabo mulieres eorum exterisi will give their women to strangers that is to the templar as in the present matter et thesauros eorum haeredibus alienis and their treasures to othersas in the present case to these honest gentlemen  isaac groaned deeply and began to wring his hands and to relapse into his state of desolation and despair but the leader of the yeomen led him aside  advise thee well isaac said locksley what thou wilt do in this matter my counsel to thee is to make a friend of this churchman he is vain isaac and he is covetous at least he needs money to supply his profusion thou canst easily gratify his greed for think not that i am blinded by thy pretexts of poverty i am intimately acquainted isaac with the very iron chest in which thou dost keep thy moneybagswhat know i not the great stone beneath the appletree that leads into the vaulted chamber under thy garden at york the jew grew as pale as deathbut fear nothing from me continued the yeoman for we are of old acquainted dost thou not remember the sick yeoman whom thy fair daughter rebecca redeemed from the gyves at york and kept him in thy house till his health was restored when thou didst dismiss him recovered and with a piece of moneyusurer as thou art thou didst never place coin at better interest than that poor silver mark for it has this day saved thee five hundred crowns  and thou art he whom we called diccon bendthebow said isaac i thought ever i knew the accent of thy voice  i am bendthebow said the captain and locksley and have a good name besides all these  but thou art mistaken good bendthebow concerning that same vaulted apartment so help me heaven as there is nought in it but some merchandises which i will gladly part with to youone hundred yards of lincoln green to make doublets to thy men and a hundred staves of spanish yew to make bows and a hundred silken bowstrings tough round and soundthese will i send thee for thy goodwill honest diccon an thou wilt keep silence about the vault my good diccon  silent as a dormouse said the outlaw and never trust me but i am grieved for thy daughter but i may not help itthe templars lances are too strong for my archery in the open fieldthey would scatter us like dust had i but known it was rebecca when she was borne off something might have been done but now thou must needs proceed by policy come shall i treat for thee with the prior  in gods name diccon an thou canst aid me to recover the child of my bosom  do not thou interrupt me with thine illtimed avarice said the outlaw and i will deal with him in thy behalf  he then turned from the jew who followed him however as closely as his shadow  prior aymer said the captain come apart with me under this tree men say thou dost love wine and a ladys smile better than beseems thy order sir priest but with that i have nought to do i have heard too thou dost love a brace of good dogs and a fleet horse and it may well be that loving things which are costly to come by thou hatest not a purse of gold but i have never heard that thou didst love oppression or crueltynow here is isaac willing to give thee the means of pleasure and pastime in a bag containing one hundred marks of silver if thy intercession with thine ally the templar shall avail to procure the freedom of his daughter  in safety and honour as when taken from me said the jew otherwise it is no bargain  peace isaac said the outlaw or i give up thine interestwhat say you to this my purpose prior aymer  the matter quoth the prior is of a mixed condition for if i do a good deal on the one hand yet on the other it goeth to the vantage of a jew and in so much is against my conscience yet if the israelite will advantage the church by giving me somewhat over to the building of our dortour 45 i will take it on my conscience to aid him in the matter of his daughter  for a score of marks to the dortour said the outlawbe still i say isaacor for a brace of silver candlesticks to the altar we will not stand with you  nay but good diccon bendthebowsaid isaac endeavouring to interpose  good jewgood beastgood earthworm said the yeoman losing patience an thou dost go on to put thy filthy lucre in the balance with thy daughters life and honour by heaven i will strip thee of every maravedi thou hast in the world before three days are out  isaac shrunk together and was silent  and what pledge am i to have for all this said the prior  when isaac returns successful through your mediation said the outlaw i swear by saint hubert i will see that he pays thee the money in good silver or i will reckon with him for it in such sort he had better have paid twenty such sums  well then jew said aymer since i must needs meddle in this matter let me have the use of thy writingtabletsthough holdrather than use thy pen i would fast for twentyfour hours and where shall i find one  if your holy scruples can dispense with using the jews tablets for the pen i can find a remedy said the yeoman and bending his bow he aimed his shaft at a wildgoose which was soaring over their heads the advancedguard of a phalanx of his tribe which were winging their way to the distant and solitary fens of holderness the bird came fluttering down transfixed with the arrow  there prior said the captain are quills enow to supply all the monks of jorvaulx for the next hundred years an they take not to writing chronicles  the prior sat down and at great leisure indited an epistle to brian de boisguilbert and having carefully sealed up the tablets delivered them to the jew saying this will be thy safeconduct to the preceptory of templestowe and as i think is most likely to accomplish the delivery of thy daughter if it be well backed with proffers of advantage and commodity at thine own hand for trust me well the good knight boisguilbert is of their confraternity that do nought for nought  well prior said the outlaw i will detain thee no longer here than to give the jew a quittance for the six hundred crowns at which thy ransom is fixedi accept of him for my paymaster and if i hear that ye boggle at allowing him in his accompts the sum so paid by him saint mary refuse me an i burn not the abbey over thine head though i hang ten years the sooner  with a much worse grace than that wherewith he had penned the letter to boisguilbert the prior wrote an acquittance discharging isaac of york of six hundred crowns advanced to him in his need for acquittal of his ransom and faithfully promising to hold true compt with him for that sum  and now said prior aymer i will pray you of restitution of my mules and palfreys and the freedom of the reverend brethren attending upon me and also of the gymmal rings jewels and fair vestures of which i have been despoiled having now satisfied you for my ransom as a true prisoner  touching your brethren sir prior said locksley they shall have present freedom it were unjust to detain them touching your horses and mules they shall also be restored with such spendingmoney as may enable you to reach york for it were cruel to deprive you of the means of journeyingbut as concerning rings jewels chains and what else you must understand that we are men of tender consciences and will not yield to a venerable man like yourself who should be dead to the vanities of this life the strong temptation to break the rule of his foundation by wearing rings chains or other vain gauds  think what you do my masters said the prior ere you put your hand on the churchs patrimonythese things are inter res sacras and i wot not what judgment might ensue were they to be handled by laical hands  i will take care of that reverend prior said the hermit of copmanhurst for i will wear them myself  friend or brother said the prior in answer to this solution of his doubts if thou hast really taken religious orders i pray thee to look how thou wilt answer to thine official for the share thou hast taken in this days work  friend prior returned the hermit you are to know that i belong to a little diocese where i am my own diocesan and care as little for the bishop of york as i do for the abbot of jorvaulx the prior and all the convent  thou art utterly irregular said the prior one of those disorderly men who taking on them the sacred character without due cause profane the holy rites and endanger the souls of those who take counsel at their hands lapides pro pane condonantes iis giving them stones instead of bread as the vulgate hath it  nay said the friar an my brainpan could have been broken by latin it had not held so long togetheri say that easing a world of such misproud priests as thou art of their jewels and their gimcracks is a lawful spoiling of the egyptians  thou best a hedgepriest 46 said the prior in great wrath excommunicabo vos  thou best thyself more like a thief and a heretic said the friar equally indignant i will pouch up no such affront before my parishioners as thou thinkest it not shame to put upon me although i be a reverend brother to thee ossa ejus perfringam i will break your bones as the vulgate hath it  hola cried the captain come the reverend brethren to such termskeep thine assurance of peace friarprior an thou hast not made thy peace perfect with god provoke the friar no furtherhermit let the reverend father depart in peace as a ransomed man  the yeomen separated the incensed priests who continued to raise their voices vituperating each other in bad latin which the prior delivered the more fluently and the hermit with the greater vehemence the prior at length recollected himself sufficiently to be aware that he was compromising his dignity by squabbling with such a hedgepriest as the outlaws chaplain and being joined by his attendants rode off with considerably less pomp and in a much more apostolical condition so far as worldly matters were concerned than he had exhibited before this rencounter  it remained that the jew should produce some security for the ransom which he was to pay on the priors account as well as upon his own he gave accordingly an order sealed with his signet to a brother of his tribe at york requiring him to pay to the bearer the sum of a thousand crowns and to deliver certain merchandises specified in the note  my brother sheva he said groaning deeply hath the key of my warehouses  and of the vaulted chamber whispered locksley  no nomay heaven forefend said isaac evil is the hour that let any one whomsoever into that secret  it is safe with me said the outlaw so be that this thy scroll produce the sum therein nominated and set downbut what now isaac art dead art stupefied hath the payment of a thousand crowns put thy daughters peril out of thy mind  the jew started to his feetno diccon noi will presently set forthfarewell thou whom i may not call good and dare not and will not call evil  yet ere isaac departed the outlaw chief bestowed on him this parting advicebe liberal of thine offers isaac and spare not thy purse for thy daughters safety credit me that the gold thou shalt spare in her cause will hereafter give thee as much agony as if it were poured molten down thy throat  isaac acquiesced with a deep groan and set forth on his journey accompanied by two tall foresters who were to be his guides and at the same time his guards through the wood  the black knight who had seen with no small interest these various proceedings now took his leave of the outlaw in turn nor could he avoid expressing his surprise at having witnessed so much of civil policy amongst persons cast out from all the ordinary protection and influence of the laws  good fruit sir knight said the yeoman will sometimes grow on a sorry tree and evil times are not always productive of evil alone and unmixed amongst those who are drawn into this lawless state there are doubtless numbers who wish to exercise its license with some moderation and some who regret it may be that they are obliged to follow such a trade at all  and to one of those said the knight i am now i presume speaking  sir knight said the outlaw we have each our secret you are welcome to form your judgment of me and i may use my conjectures touching you though neither of our shafts may hit the mark they are shot at but as i do not pray to be admitted into your mystery be not offended that i preserve my own  i crave pardon brave outlaw said the knight your reproof is just but it may be we shall meet hereafter with less of concealment on either sidemeanwhile we part friends do we not  there is my hand upon it said locksley and i will call it the hand of a true englishman though an outlaw for the present  and there is mine in return said the knight and i hold it honoured by being clasped with yours for he that does good having the unlimited power to do evil deserves praise not only for the good which he performs but for the evil which he forbears fare thee well gallant outlaw thus parted that fair fellowship and he of the fetterlock mounting upon his strong warhorse rode off through the forest     chapter xxxiv        king johnill tell thee what my friend      he is a very serpent in my way      and wheresoeer this foot of mine doth tread      he lies before medost thou understand me      king john  there was brave feasting in the castle of york to which prince john had invited those nobles prelates and leaders by whose assistance he hoped to carry through his ambitious projects upon his brothers throne waldemar fitzurse his able and politic agent was at secret work among them tempering all to that pitch of courage which was necessary in making an open declaration of their purpose but their enterprise was delayed by the absence of more than one main limb of the confederacy the stubborn and daring though brutal courage of frontdeboeuf the buoyant spirits and bold bearing of de bracy the sagacity martial experience and renowned valour of brian de boisguilbert were important to the success of their conspiracy and while cursing in secret their unnecessary and unmeaning absence neither john nor his adviser dared to proceed without them isaac the jew also seemed to have vanished and with him the hope of certain sums of money making up the subsidy for which prince john had contracted with that israelite and his brethren this deficiency was likely to prove perilous in an emergency so critical  it was on the morning after the fall of torquilstone that a confused report began to spread abroad in the city of york that de bracy and boisguilbert with their confederate frontdeboeuf had been taken or slain waldemar brought the rumour to prince john announcing that he feared its truth the more that they had set out with a small attendance for the purpose of committing an assault on the saxon cedric and his attendants at another time the prince would have treated this deed of violence as a good jest but now that it interfered with and impeded his own plans he exclaimed against the perpetrators and spoke of the broken laws and the infringement of public order and of private property in a tone which might have become king alfred  the unprincipled marauders he saidwere i ever to become monarch of england i would hang such transgressors over the drawbridges of their own castles  but to become monarch of england said his ahithophel coolly it is necessary not only that your grace should endure the transgressions of these unprincipled marauders but that you should afford them your protection notwithstanding your laudable zeal for the laws they are in the habit of infringing we shall be finely helped if the churl saxons should have realized your graces vision of converting feudal drawbridges into gibbets and yonder boldspirited cedric seemeth one to whom such an imagination might occur your grace is well aware it will be dangerous to stir without frontdeboeuf de bracy and the templar and yet we have gone too far to recede with safety  prince john struck his forehead with impatience and then began to stride up and down the apartment  the villains he said the base treacherous villains to desert me at this pinch  nay say rather the featherpated giddy madmen said waldemar who must be toying with follies when such business was in hand  what is to be done said the prince stopping short before waldemar  i know nothing which can be done answered his counsellor save that which i have already taken order fori came not to bewail this evil chance with your grace until i had done my best to remedy it  thou art ever my better angel waldemar said the prince and when i have such a chancellor to advise withal the reign of john will be renowned in our annalswhat hast thou commanded  i have ordered louis winkelbrand de bracys lieutenant to cause his trumpet sound to horse and to display his banner and to set presently forth towards the castle of frontdeboeuf to do what yet may be done for the succour of our friends  prince johns face flushed with the pride of a spoilt child who has undergone what it conceives to be an insult by the face of god he said waldemar fitzurse much hast thou taken upon thee and over malapert thou wert to cause trumpet to blow or banner to be raised in a town where ourselves were in presence without our express command  i crave your graces pardon said fitzurse internally cursing the idle vanity of his patron but when time pressed and even the loss of minutes might be fatal i judged it best to take this much burden upon me in a matter of such importance to your graces interest  thou art pardoned fitzurse said the prince gravely thy purpose hath atoned for thy hasty rashnessbut whom have we herede bracy himself by the roodand in strange guise doth he come before us  it was indeed de bracybloody with spurring fiery red with speed his armour bore all the marks of the late obstinate fray being broken defaced and stained with blood in many places and covered with clay and dust from the crest to the spur undoing his helmet he placed it on the table and stood a moment as if to collect himself before he told his news  de bracy said prince john what means thisspeak i charge theeare the saxons in rebellion  speak de bracy said fitzurse almost in the same moment with his master thou wert wont to be a manwhere is the templarwhere frontdeboeuf  the templar is fled said de bracy frontdeboeuf you will never see more he has found a red grave among the blazing rafters of his own castle and i alone am escaped to tell you  cold news said waldemar to us though you speak of fire and conflagration  the worst news is not yet said answered de bracy and coming up to prince john he uttered in a low and emphatic tonerichard is in englandi have seen and spoken with him  prince john turned pale tottered and caught at the back of an oaken bench to support himselfmuch like to a man who receives an arrow in his bosom  thou ravest de bracy said fitzurse it cannot be  it is as true as truth itself said de bracy i was his prisoner and spoke with him  with richard plantagenet sayest thou continued fitzurse  with richard plantagenet replied de bracy with richard coeurdelionwith richard of england  and thou wert his prisoner said waldemar he is then at the head of a power  noonly a few outlawed yeomen were around him and to these his person is unknown i heard him say he was about to depart from them he joined them only to assist at the storming of torquilstone  ay said fitzurse such is indeed the fashion of richarda true knighterrant he and will wander in wild adventure trusting the prowess of his single arm like any sir guy or sir bevis while the weighty affairs of his kingdom slumber and his own safety is endangeredwhat dost thou propose to do de bracy  ii offered richard the service of my free lances and he refused themi will lead them to hull seize on shipping and embark for flanders thanks to the bustling times a man of action will always find employment and thou waldemar wilt thou take lance and shield and lay down thy policies and wend along with me and share the fate which god sends us  i am too old maurice and i have a daughter answered waldemar  give her to me fitzurse and i will maintain her as fits her rank with the help of lance and stirrup said de bracy  not so answered fitzurse i will take sanctuary in this church of saint peterthe archbishop is my sworn brother  during this discourse prince john had gradually awakened from the stupor into which he had been thrown by the unexpected intelligence and had been attentive to the conversation which passed betwixt his followers they fall off from me he said to himself they hold no more by me than a withered leaf by the bough when a breeze blows on ithell and fiends can i shape no means for myself when i am deserted by these cravenshe paused and there was an expression of diabolical passion in the constrained laugh with which he at length broke in on their conversation  ha ha ha my good lords by the light of our ladys brow i held ye sage men bold men readywitted men yet ye throw down wealth honour pleasure all that our noble game promised you at the moment it might be won by one bold cast  i understand you not said de bracy as soon as richards return is blown abroad he will be at the head of an army and all is then over with us i would counsel you my lord either to fly to france or take the protection of the queen mother  i seek no safety for myself said prince john haughtily that i could secure by a word spoken to my brother but although you de bracy and you waldemar fitzurse are so ready to abandon me i should not greatly delight to see your heads blackening on cliffords gate yonder thinkest thou waldemar that the wily archbishop will not suffer thee to be taken from the very horns of the altar would it make his peace with king richard and forgettest thou de bracy that robert estoteville lies betwixt thee and hull with all his forces and that the earl of essex is gathering his followers if we had reason to fear these levies even before richards return trowest thou there is any doubt now which party their leaders will take trust me estoteville alone has strength enough to drive all thy free lances into the humberwaldemar fitzurse and de bracy looked in each others faces with blank dismaythere is but one road to safety continued the prince and his brow grew black as midnight this object of our terror journeys alonehe must be met withal  not by me said de bracy hastily i was his prisoner and he took me to mercy i will not harm a feather in his crest  who spoke of harming him said prince john with a hardened laugh the knave will say next that i meant he should slay himnoa prison were better and whether in britain or austria what matters itthings will be but as they were when we commenced our enterpriseit was founded on the hope that richard would remain a captive in germanyour uncle robert lived and died in the castle of cardiffe  ay but said waldemar your sire henry sate more firm in his seat than your grace can i say the best prison is that which is made by the sextonno dungeon like a churchvault i have said my say  prison or tomb said de bracy i wash my hands of the whole matter  villain said prince john thou wouldst not bewray our counsel  counsel was never bewrayed by me said de bracy haughtily nor must the name of villain be coupled with mine  peace sir knight said waldemar and you good my lord forgive the scruples of valiant de bracy i trust i shall soon remove them  that passes your eloquence fitzurse replied the knight  why good sir maurice rejoined the wily politician start not aside like a scared steed without at least considering the object of your terrorthis richardbut a day since and it would have been thy dearest wish to have met him hand to hand in the ranks of battlea hundred times i have heard thee wish it  ay said de bracy but that was as thou sayest hand to hand and in the ranks of battle thou never heardest me breathe a thought of assaulting him alone and in a forest  thou art no good knight if thou dost scruple at it said waldemar was it in battle that lancelot de lac and sir tristram won renown or was it not by encountering gigantic knights under the shade of deep and unknown forests  ay but i promise you said de bracy that neither tristram nor lancelot would have been match hand to hand for richard plantagenet and i think it was not their wont to take odds against a single man  thou art mad de bracywhat is it we propose to thee a hired and retained captain of free companions whose swords are purchased for prince johns service thou art apprized of our enemy and then thou scruplest though thy patrons fortunes those of thy comrades thine own and the life and honour of every one amongst us be at stake  i tell you said de bracy sullenly that he gave me my life true he sent me from his presence and refused my homageso far i owe him neither favour nor allegiancebut i will not lift hand against him  it needs notsend louis winkelbrand and a score of thy lances  ye have sufficient ruffians of your own said de bracy not one of mine shall budge on such an errand  art thou so obstinate de bracy said prince john and wilt thou forsake me after so many protestations of zeal for my service  i mean it not said de bracy i will abide by you in aught that becomes a knight whether in the lists or in the camp but this highway practice comes not within my vow  come hither waldemar said prince john an unhappy prince am i my father king henry had faithful servantshe had but to say that he was plagued with a factious priest and the blood of thomasabecket saint though he was stained the steps of his own altartracy morville brito 47 loyal and daring subjects your names your spirit are extinct and although reginald fitzurse hath left a son he hath fallen off from his fathers fidelity and courage  he has fallen off from neither said waldemar fitzurse and since it may not better be i will take on me the conduct of this perilous enterprise dearly however did my father purchase the praise of a zealous friend and yet did his proof of loyalty to henry fall far short of what i am about to afford for rather would i assail a whole calendar of saints than put spear in rest against coeurdelionde bracy to thee i must trust to keep up the spirits of the doubtful and to guard prince johns person if you receive such news as i trust to send you our enterprise will no longer wear a doubtful aspectpage he said hie to my lodgings and tell my armourer to be there in readiness and bid stephen wetheral broad thoresby and the three spears of spyinghow come to me instantly and let the scoutmaster hugh bardon attend me alsoadieu my prince till better times thus speaking he left the apartment he goes to make my brother prisoner said prince john to de bracy with as little touch of compunction as if it but concerned the liberty of a saxon franklin i trust he will observe our orders and use our dear richards person with all due respect  de bracy only answered by a smile  by the light of our ladys brow said prince john our orders to him were most precisethough it may be you heard them not as we stood together in the oriel windowmost clear and positive was our charge that richards safety should be cared for and woe to waldemars head if he transgress it  i had better pass to his lodgings said de bracy and make him fully aware of your graces pleasure for as it quite escaped my ear it may not perchance have reached that of waldemar  nay nay said prince john impatiently i promise thee he heard me and besides i have farther occupation for thee maurice come hither let me lean on thy shoulder  they walked a turn through the hall in this familiar posture and prince john with an air of the most confidential intimacy proceeded to say what thinkest thou of this waldemar fitzurse my de bracyhe trusts to be our chancellor surely we will pause ere we give an office so high to one who shows evidently how little he reverences our blood by his so readily undertaking this enterprise against richard thou dost think i warrant that thou hast lost somewhat of our regard by thy boldly declining this unpleasing taskbut no maurice i rather honour thee for thy virtuous constancy there are things most necessary to be done the perpetrator of which we neither love nor honour and there may be refusals to serve us which shall rather exalt in our estimation those who deny our request the arrest of my unfortunate brother forms no such good title to the high office of chancellor as thy chivalrous and courageous denial establishes in thee to the truncheon of high marshal think of this de bracy and begone to thy charge  fickle tyrant muttered de bracy as he left the presence of the prince evil luck have they who trust thee thy chancellor indeedhe who hath the keeping of thy conscience shall have an easy charge i trow but high marshal of england that he said extending his arm as if to grasp the baton of office and assuming a loftier stride along the antechamber that is indeed a prize worth playing for  de bracy had no sooner left the apartment than prince john summoned an attendant  bid hugh bardon our scoutmaster come hither as soon as he shall have spoken with waldemar fitzurse  the scoutmaster arrived after a brief delay during which john traversed the apartment with unequal and disordered steps  bardon said he what did waldemar desire of thee  two resolute men well acquainted with these northern wilds and skilful in tracking the tread of man and horse  and thou hast fitted him  let your grace never trust me else answered the master of the spies one is from hexamshire he is wont to trace the tynedale and teviotdale thieves as a bloodhound follows the slot of a hurt deer the other is yorkshire bred and has twanged his bowstring right oft in merry sherwood he knows each glade and dingle copse and highwood betwixt this and richmond  tis well said the princegoes waldemar forth with them  instantly said bardon  with what attendance asked john carelessly  broad thoresby goes with him and wetheral whom they call for his cruelty stephen steelheart and three northern menatarms that belonged to ralph middletons gangthey are called the spears of spyinghow  tis well said prince john then added after a moments pause bardon it imports our service that thou keep a strict watch on maurice de bracyso that he shall not observe it howeverand let us know of his motions from time to timewith whom he converses what he proposeth fail not in this as thou wilt be answerable  hugh bardon bowed and retired  if maurice betrays me said prince johnif he betrays me as his bearing leads me to fear i will have his head were richard thundering at the gates of york     chapter xxxv       arouse the tiger of hyrcanian deserts      strive with the halfstarved lion for his prey      lesser the risk than rouse the slumbering fire      of wild fanaticism      anonymus  our tale now returns to isaac of yorkmounted upon a mule the gift of the outlaw with two tall yeomen to act as his guard and guides the jew had set out for the preceptory of templestowe for the purpose of negotiating his daughters redemption the preceptory was but a days journey from the demolished castle of torquilstone and the jew had hoped to reach it before nightfall accordingly having dismissed his guides at the verge of the forest and rewarded them with a piece of silver he began to press on with such speed as his weariness permitted him to exert but his strength failed him totally ere he had reached within four miles of the templecourt racking pains shot along his back and through his limbs and the excessive anguish which he felt at heart being now augmented by bodily suffering he was rendered altogether incapable of proceeding farther than a small markettown were dwelt a jewish rabbi of his tribe eminent in the medical profession and to whom isaac was well known nathan ben israel received his suffering countryman with that kindness which the law prescribed and which the jews practised to each other he insisted on his betaking himself to repose and used such remedies as were then in most repute to check the progress of the fever which terror fatigue ill usage and sorrow had brought upon the poor old jew  on the morrow when isaac proposed to arise and pursue his journey nathan remonstrated against his purpose both as his host and as his physician it might cost him he said his life but isaac replied that more than life and death depended upon his going that morning to templestowe  to templestowe said his host with surprise again felt his pulse and then muttered to himself his fever is abated yet seems his mind somewhat alienated and disturbed  and why not to templestowe answered his patient i grant thee nathan that it is a dwelling of those to whom the despised children of the promise are a stumblingblock and an abomination yet thou knowest that pressing affairs of traffic sometimes carry us among these bloodthirsty nazarene soldiers and that we visit the preceptories of the templars as well as the commanderies of the knights hospitallers as they are called 48  i know it well said nathan but wottest thou that lucas de beaumanoir the chief of their order and whom they term grand master is now himself at templestowe  i know it not said isaac our last letters from our brethren at paris advised us that he was at that city beseeching philip for aid against the sultan saladine  he hath since come to england unexpected by his brethren said ben israel and he cometh among them with a strong and outstretched arm to correct and to punish his countenance is kindled in anger against those who have departed from the vow which they have made and great is the fear of those sons of belial thou must have heard of his name  it is well known unto me said isaac the gentiles deliver this lucas beaumanoir as a man zealous to slaying for every point of the nazarene law and our brethren have termed him a fierce destroyer of the saracens and a cruel tyrant to the children of the promise  and truly have they termed him said nathan the physician other templars may be moved from the purpose of their heart by pleasure or bribed by promise of gold and silver but beaumanoir is of a different stamphating sensuality despising treasure and pressing forward to that which they call the crown of martyrdomthe god of jacob speedily send it unto him and unto them all specially hath this proud man extended his glove over the children of judah as holy david over edom holding the murder of a jew to be an offering of as sweet savour as the death of a saracen impious and false things has he said even of the virtues of our medicines as if they were the devices of satanthe lord rebuke him  nevertheless said isaac i must present myself at templestowe though he hath made his face like unto a fiery furnace seven times heated  he then explained to nathan the pressing cause of his journey the rabbi listened with interest and testified his sympathy after the fashion of his people rending his clothes and saying ah my daughterah my daughteralas for the beauty of zionalas for the captivity of israel  thou seest said isaac how it stands with me and that i may not tarry peradventure the presence of this lucas beaumanoir being the chief man over them may turn brian de boisguilbert from the ill which he doth meditate and that he may deliver to me my beloved daughter rebecca  go thou said nathan ben israel and be wise for wisdom availed daniel in the den of lions into which he was cast and may it go well with thee even as thine heart wisheth yet if thou canst keep thee from the presence of the grand master for to do foul scorn to our people is his morning and evening delight it may be if thou couldst speak with boisguilbert in private thou shalt the better prevail with him for men say that these accursed nazarenes are not of one mind in the preceptorymay their counsels be confounded and brought to shame but do thou brother return to me as if it were to the house of thy father and bring me word how it has sped with thee and well do i hope thou wilt bring with thee rebecca even the scholar of the wise miriam whose cures the gentiles slandered as if they had been wrought by necromancy  isaac accordingly bade his friend farewell and about an hours riding brought him before the preceptory of templestowe  this establishment of the templars was seated amidst fair meadows and pastures which the devotion of the former preceptor had bestowed upon their order it was strong and well fortified a point never neglected by these knights and which the disordered state of england rendered peculiarly necessary two halberdiers clad in black guarded the drawbridge and others in the same sad livery glided to and fro upon the walls with a funereal pace resembling spectres more than soldiers the inferior officers of the order were thus dressed ever since their use of white garments similar to those of the knights and esquires had given rise to a combination of certain false brethren in the mountains of palestine terming themselves templars and bringing great dishonour on the order a knight was now and then seen to cross the court in his long white cloak his head depressed on his breast and his arms folded they passed each other if they chanced to meet with a slow solemn and mute greeting for such was the rule of their order quoting thereupon the holy texts in many words thou shalt not avoid sin and life and death are in the power of the tongue in a word the stern ascetic rigour of the temple discipline which had been so long exchanged for prodigal and licentious indulgence seemed at once to have revived at templestowe under the severe eye of lucas beaumanoir  isaac paused at the gate to consider how he might seek entrance in the manner most likely to bespeak favour for he was well aware that to his unhappy race the reviving fanaticism of the order was not less dangerous than their unprincipled licentiousness and that his religion would be the object of hate and persecution in the one case as his wealth would have exposed him in the other to the extortions of unrelenting oppression  meantime lucas beaumanoir walked in a small garden belonging to the preceptory included within the precincts of its exterior fortification and held sad and confidential communication with a brother of his order who had come in his company from palestine  the grand master was a man advanced in age as was testified by his long grey beard and the shaggy grey eyebrows overhanging eyes of which however years had been unable to quench the fire a formidable warrior his thin and severe features retained the soldiers fierceness of expression an ascetic bigot they were no less marked by the emaciation of abstinence and the spiritual pride of the selfsatisfied devotee yet with these severer traits of physiognomy there was mixed somewhat striking and noble arising doubtless from the great part which his high office called upon him to act among monarchs and princes and from the habitual exercise of supreme authority over the valiant and highborn knights who were united by the rules of the order his stature was tall and his gait undepressed by age and toil was erect and stately his white mantle was shaped with severe regularity according to the rule of saint bernard himself being composed of what was then called burrel cloth exactly fitted to the size of the wearer and bearing on the left shoulder the octangular cross peculiar to the order formed of red cloth no vair or ermine decked this garment but in respect of his age the grand master as permitted by the rules wore his doublet lined and trimmed with the softest lambskin dressed with the wool outwards which was the nearest approach he could regularly make to the use of fur then the greatest luxury of dress in his hand he bore that singular abacus or staff of office with which templars are usually represented having at the upper end a round plate on which was engraved the cross of the order inscribed within a circle or orle as heralds term it his companion who attended on this great personage had nearly the same dress in all respects but his extreme deference towards his superior showed that no other equality subsisted between them the preceptor for such he was in rank walked not in a line with the grand master but just so far behind that beaumanoir could speak to him without turning round his head  conrade said the grand master dear companion of my battles and my toils to thy faithful bosom alone i can confide my sorrows to thee alone can i tell how oft since i came to this kingdom i have desired to be dissolved and to be with the just not one object in england hath met mine eye which it could rest upon with pleasure save the tombs of our brethren beneath the massive roof of our temple church in yonder proud capital o valiant robert de ros did i exclaim internally as i gazed upon these good soldiers of the cross where they lie sculptured on their sepulchreso worthy william de mareschal open your marble cells and take to your repose a weary brother who would rather strive with a hundred thousand pagans than witness the decay of our holy order  it is but true answered conrade montfitchet it is but too true and the irregularities of our brethren in england are even more gross than those in france  because they are more wealthy answered the grand master bear with me brother although i should something vaunt myself thou knowest the life i have led keeping each point of my order striving with devils embodied and disembodied striking down the roaring lion who goeth about seeking whom he may devour like a good knight and devout priest wheresoever i met with himeven as blessed saint bernard hath prescribed to us in the fortyfifth capital of our rule ut leo semper feriatur 49  but by the holy temple the zeal which hath devoured my substance and my life yea the very nerves and marrow of my bones by that very holy temple i swear to thee that save thyself and some few that still retain the ancient severity of our order i look upon no brethren whom i can bring my soul to embrace under that holy name what say our statutes and how do our brethren observe them they should wear no vain or worldly ornament no crest upon their helmet no gold upon stirrup or bridlebit yet who now go pranked out so proudly and so gaily as the poor soldiers of the temple they are forbidden by our statutes to take one bird by means of another to shoot beasts with bow or arblast to halloo to a huntinghorn or to spur the horse after game but now at hunting and hawking and each idle sport of wood and river who so prompt as the templars in all these fond vanities they are forbidden to read save what their superior permitted or listen to what is read save such holy things as may be recited aloud during the hours of refaction but lo their ears are at the command of idle minstrels and their eyes study empty romaunts they were commanded to extirpate magic and heresy lo they are charged with studying the accursed cabalistical secrets of the jews and the magic of the paynim saracens simpleness of diet was prescribed to them roots pottage gruels eating flesh but thrice aweek because the accustomed feeding on flesh is a dishonourable corruption of the body and behold their tables groan under delicate fare their drink was to be water and now to drink like a templar is the boast of each jolly boon companion this very garden filled as it is with curious herbs and trees sent from the eastern climes better becomes the harem of an unbelieving emir than the plot which christian monks should devote to raise their homely potherbsand o conrade well it were that the relaxation of discipline stopped even herewell thou knowest that we were forbidden to receive those devout women who at the beginning were associated as sisters of our order because saith the fortysixth chapter the ancient enemy hath by female society withdrawn many from the right path to paradise nay in the last capital being as it were the copestone which our blessed founder placed on the pure and undefiled doctrine which he had enjoined we are prohibited from offering even to our sisters and our mothers the kiss of affectionut omnium mulierum fugiantur osculai shame to speaki shame to thinkof the corruptions which have rushed in upon us even like a flood the souls of our pure founders the spirits of hugh de payen and godfrey de saint omer and of the blessed seven who first joined in dedicating their lives to the service of the temple are disturbed even in the enjoyment of paradise itself i have seen them conrade in the visions of the nighttheir sainted eyes shed tears for the sins and follies of their brethren and for the foul and shameful luxury in which they wallow beaumanoir they say thou slumberestawake there is a stain in the fabric of the temple deep and foul as that left by the streaks of leprosy on the walls of the infected houses of old 50  the soldiers of the cross who should shun the glance of a woman as the eye of a basilisk live in open sin not with the females of their own race only but with the daughters of the accursed heathen and more accursed jew beaumanoir thou sleepest up and avenge our causeslay the sinners male and femaletake to thee the brand of phineasthe vision fled conrade but as i awaked i could still hear the clank of their mail and see the waving of their white mantlesand i will do according to their word i will purify the fabric of the temple and the unclean stones in which the plague is i will remove and cast out of the building  yet bethink thee reverend father said montfitchet the stain hath become engrained by time and consuetude let thy reformation be cautious as it is just and wise  no montfitchet answered the stern old manit must be sharp and suddenthe order is on the crisis of its fate the sobriety selfdevotion and piety of our predecessors made us powerful friendsour presumption our wealth our luxury have raised up against us mighty enemieswe must cast away these riches which are a temptation to princeswe must lay down that presumption which is an offence to themwe must reform that license of manners which is a scandal to the whole christian world ormark my wordsthe order of the temple will be utterly demolishedand the place thereof shall no more be known among the nations  now may god avert such a calamity said the preceptor  amen said the grand master with solemnity but we must deserve his aid i tell thee conrade that neither the powers in heaven nor the powers on earth will longer endure the wickedness of this generationmy intelligence is surethe ground on which our fabric is reared is already undermined and each addition we make to the structure of our greatness will only sink it the sooner in the abyss we must retrace our steps and show ourselves the faithful champions of the cross sacrificing to our calling not alone our blood and our livesnot alone our lusts and our vicesbut our ease our comforts and our natural affections and act as men convinced that many a pleasure which may be lawful to others is forbidden to the vowed soldier of the temple  at this moment a squire clothed in a threadbare vestment for the aspirants after this holy order wore during their noviciate the castoff garments of the knights entered the garden and bowing profoundly before the grand master stood silent awaiting his permission ere he presumed to tell his errand  is it not more seemly said the grand master to see this damian clothed in the garments of christian humility thus appear with reverend silence before his superior than but two days since when the fond fool was decked in a painted coat and jangling as pert and as proud as any popinjayspeak damian we permit theewhat is thine errand  a jew stands without the gate noble and reverend father said the squire who prays to speak with brother brian de boisguilbert  thou wert right to give me knowledge of it said the grand master in our presence a preceptor is but as a common compeer of our order who may not walk according to his own will but to that of his mastereven according to the text in the hearing of the ear he hath obeyed meit imports us especially to know of this boisguilberts proceedings said he turning to his companion  report speaks him brave and valiant said conrade  and truly is he so spoken of said the grand master in our valour only we are not degenerated from our predecessors the heroes of the cross but brother brian came into our order a moody and disappointed man stirred i doubt me to take our vows and to renounce the world not in sincerity of soul but as one whom some touch of light discontent had driven into penitence since then he hath become an active and earnest agitator a murmurer and a machinator and a leader amongst those who impugn our authority not considering that the rule is given to the master even by the symbol of the staff and the rodthe staff to support the infirmities of the weakthe rod to correct the faults of delinquentsdamian he continued lead the jew to our presence  the squire departed with a profound reverence and in a few minutes returned marshalling in isaac of york no naked slave ushered into the presence of some mighty prince could approach his judgmentseat with more profound reverence and terror than that with which the jew drew near to the presence of the grand master when he had approached within the distance of three yards beaumanoir made a sign with his staff that he should come no farther the jew kneeled down on the earth which he kissed in token of reverence then rising stood before the templars his hands folded on his bosom his head bowed on his breast in all the submission of oriental slavery  damian said the grand master retire and have a guard ready to await our sudden call and suffer no one to enter the garden until we shall leave itthe squire bowed and retreatedjew continued the haughty old man mark me it suits not our condition to hold with thee long communication nor do we waste words or time upon any one wherefore be brief in thy answers to what questions i shall ask thee and let thy words be of truth for if thy tongue doubles with me i will have it torn from thy misbelieving jaws  the jew was about to reply but the grand master went on  peace unbelievernot a word in our presence save in answer to our questionswhat is thy business with our brother brian de boisguilbert  isaac gasped with terror and uncertainty to tell his tale might be interpreted into scandalizing the order yet unless he told it what hope could he have of achieving his daughters deliverance beaumanoir saw his mortal apprehension and condescended to give him some assurance  fear nothing he said for thy wretched person jew so thou dealest uprightly in this matter i demand again to know from thee thy business with brian de boisguilbert  i am bearer of a letter stammered out the jew so please your reverend valour to that good knight from prior aymer of the abbey of jorvaulx  said i not these were evil times conrade said the master a cistertian prior sends a letter to a soldier of the temple and can find no more fitting messenger than an unbelieving jewgive me the letter  the jew with trembling hands undid the folds of his armenian cap in which he had deposited the priors tablets for the greater security and was about to approach with hand extended and body crouched to place it within the reach of his grim interrogator  back dog said the grand master i touch not misbelievers save with the swordconrade take thou the letter from the jew and give it to me  beaumanoir being thus possessed of the tablets inspected the outside carefully and then proceeded to undo the packthread which secured its folds reverend father said conrade interposing though with much deference wilt thou break the seal  and will i not said beaumanoir with a frown is it not written in the fortysecond capital de lectione literarum that a templar shall not receive a letter no not from his father without communicating the same to the grand master and reading it in his presence  he then perused the letter in haste with an expression of surprise and horror read it over again more slowly then holding it out to conrade with one hand and slightly striking it with the other exclaimedhere is goodly stuff for one christian man to write to another and both members and no inconsiderable members of religious professions when said he solemnly and looking upward wilt thou come with thy fanners to purge the thrashingfloor  montfitchet took the letter from his superior and was about to peruse it  read it aloud conrade said the grand masterand do thou to isaac attend to the purport of it for we will question thee concerning it  conrade read the letter which was in these words aymer by divine grace prior of the cistertian house of saint marys of jorvaulx to sir brian de boisguilbert a knight of the holy order of the temple wisheth health with the bounties of king bacchus and of my lady venus touching our present condition dear brother we are a captive in the hands of certain lawless and godless men who have not feared to detain our person and put us to ransom whereby we have also learned of frontdeboeufs misfortune and that thou hast escaped with that fair jewish sorceress whose black eyes have bewitched thee we are heartily rejoiced of thy safety nevertheless we pray thee to be on thy guard in the matter of this second witch of endor for we are privately assured that your great master who careth not a bean for cherry cheeks and black eyes comes from normandy to diminish your mirth and amend your misdoings wherefore we pray you heartily to beware and to be found watching even as the holy text hath it invenientur vigilantes and the wealthy jew her father isaac of york having prayed of me letters in his behalf i gave him these earnestly advising and in a sort entreating that you do hold the damsel to ransom seeing he will pay you from his bags as much as may find fifty damsels upon safer terms whereof i trust to have my part when we make merry together as true brothers not forgetting the winecup for what saith the text vinum laetificat cor hominis and again rex delectabitur pulchritudine tua  till which merry meeting we wish you farewell given from this den of thieves about the hour of matins  aymer pr s m jorvolciencis  postscriptum truly your golden chain hath not long abidden with me and will now sustain around the neck of an outlaw deerstealer the whistle wherewith he calleth on his hounds  what sayest thou to this conrade said the grand masterden of thieves and a fit residence is a den of thieves for such a prior no wonder that the hand of god is upon us and that in the holy land we lose place by place foot by foot before the infidels when we have such churchmen as this aymerand what meaneth he i trow by this second witch of endor said he to his confident something apart conrade was better acquainted perhaps by practice with the jargon of gallantry than was his superior and he expounded the passage which embarrassed the grand master to be a sort of language used by worldly men towards those whom they loved par amours but the explanation did not satisfy the bigoted beaumanoir  there is more in it than thou dost guess conrade thy simplicity is no match for this deep abyss of wickedness this rebecca of york was a pupil of that miriam of whom thou hast heard thou shalt hear the jew own it even now then turning to isaac he said aloud thy daughter then is prisoner with brian de boisguilbert  ay reverend valorous sir stammered poor isaac and whatsoever ransom a poor man may pay for her deliverance  peace said the grand master this thy daughter hath practised the art of healing hath she not  ay gracious sir answered the jew with more confidence and knight and yeoman squire and vassal may bless the goodly gift which heaven hath assigned to her many a one can testify that she hath recovered them by her art when every other human aid hath proved vain but the blessing of the god of jacob was upon her  beaumanoir turned to montfitchet with a grim smile see brother he said the deceptions of the devouring enemy behold the baits with which he fishes for souls giving a poor space of earthly life in exchange for eternal happiness hereafter well said our blessed rule semper percutiatur leo voransup on the lion down with the destroyer said he shaking aloft his mystic abacus as if in defiance of the powers of darknessthy daughter worketh the cures i doubt not thus he went on to address the jew by words and sighs and periapts and other cabalistical mysteries  nay reverend and brave knight answered isaac but in chief measure by a balsam of marvellous virtue  where had she that secret said beaumanoir  it was delivered to her answered isaac reluctantly by miriam a sage matron of our tribe  ah false jew said the grand master was it not from that same witch miriam the abomination of whose enchantments have been heard of throughout every christian land exclaimed the grand master crossing himself her body was burnt at a stake and her ashes were scattered to the four winds and so be it with me and mine order if i do not as much to her pupil and more also i will teach her to throw spell and incantation over the soldiers of the blessed templethere damian spurn this jew from the gateshoot him dead if he oppose or turn again with his daughter we will deal as the christian law and our own high office warrant  poor isaac was hurried off accordingly and expelled from the preceptory all his entreaties and even his offers unheard and disregarded he could do not better than return to the house of the rabbi and endeavour through his means to learn how his daughter was to be disposed of he had hitherto feared for her honour he was now to tremble for her life meanwhile the grand master ordered to his presence the preceptor of templestowe     chapter xxxvi       say not my art is fraudall live by seeming      the beggar begs with it and the gay courtier      gains land and title rank and rule by seeming      the clergy scorn it not and the bold soldier      will eke with it his serviceall admit it      all practise it and he who is content      with showing what he is shall have small credit      in church or camp or stateso wags the world      old play  albert malvoisin president or in the language of the order preceptor of the establishment of templestowe was brother to that philip malvoisin who has been already occasionally mentioned in this history and was like that baron in close league with brian de boisguilbert  amongst dissolute and unprincipled men of whom the temple order included but too many albert of templestowe might be distinguished but with this difference from the audacious boisguilbert that he knew how to throw over his vices and his ambition the veil of hypocrisy and to assume in his exterior the fanaticism which he internally despised had not the arrival of the grand master been so unexpectedly sudden he would have seen nothing at templestowe which might have appeared to argue any relaxation of discipline and even although surprised and to a certain extent detected albert malvoisin listened with such respect and apparent contrition to the rebuke of his superior and made such haste to reform the particulars he censuredsucceeded in fine so well in giving an air of ascetic devotion to a family which had been lately devoted to license and pleasure that lucas beaumanoir began to entertain a higher opinion of the preceptors morals than the first appearance of the establishment had inclined him to adopt  but these favourable sentiments on the part of the grand master were greatly shaken by the intelligence that albert had received within a house of religion the jewish captive and as was to be feared the paramour of a brother of the order and when albert appeared before him he was regarded with unwonted sternness  there is in this mansion dedicated to the purposes of the holy order of the temple said the grand master in a severe tone a jewish woman brought hither by a brother of religion by your connivance sir preceptor  albert malvoisin was overwhelmed with confusion for the unfortunate rebecca had been confined in a remote and secret part of the building and every precaution used to prevent her residence there from being known he read in the looks of beaumanoir ruin to boisguilbert and to himself unless he should be able to avert the impending storm  why are you mute continued the grand master  is it permitted to me to reply answered the preceptor in a tone of the deepest humility although by the question he only meant to gain an instants space for arranging his ideas  speak you are permitted said the grand masterspeak and say knowest thou the capital of our holy rulede commilitonibus templi in sancta civitate qui cum miserrimis mulieribus versantur propter oblectationem carnis 51  surely most reverend father answered the preceptor i have not risen to this office in the order being ignorant of one of its most important prohibitions  how comes it then i demand of thee once more that thou hast suffered a brother to bring a paramour and that paramour a jewish sorceress into this holy place to the stain and pollution thereof  a jewish sorceress echoed albert malvoisin good angels guard us  ay brother a jewish sorceress said the grand master sternly i have said it darest thou deny that this rebecca the daughter of that wretched usurer isaac of york and the pupil of the foul witch miriam is nowshame to be thought or spokenlodged within this thy preceptory  your wisdom reverend father answered the preceptor hath rolled away the darkness from my understanding much did i wonder that so good a knight as brian de boisguilbert seemed so fondly besotted on the charms of this female whom i received into this house merely to place a bar betwixt their growing intimacy which else might have been cemented at the expense of the fall of our valiant and religious brother  hath nothing then as yet passed betwixt them in breach of his vow demanded the grand master  what under this roof said the preceptor crossing himself saint magdalene and the ten thousand virgins forbidno if i have sinned in receiving her here it was in the erring thought that i might thus break off our brothers besotted devotion to this jewess which seemed to me so wild and unnatural that i could not but ascribe it to some touch of insanity more to be cured by pity than reproof but since your reverend wisdom hath discovered this jewish queen to be a sorceress perchance it may account fully for his enamoured folly  it dothit doth said beaumanoir see brother conrade the peril of yielding to the first devices and blandishments of satan we look upon woman only to gratify the lust of the eye and to take pleasure in what men call her beauty and the ancient enemy the devouring lion obtains power over us to complete by talisman and spell a work which was begun by idleness and folly it may be that our brother boisguilbert does in this matter deserve rather pity than severe chastisement rather the support of the staff than the strokes of the rod and that our admonitions and prayers may turn him from his folly and restore him to his brethren  it were deep pity said conrade montfitchet to lose to the order one of its best lances when the holy community most requires the aid of its sons three hundred saracens hath this brian de boisguilbert slain with his own hand  the blood of these accursed dogs said the grand master shall be a sweet and acceptable offering to the saints and angels whom they despise and blaspheme and with their aid will we counteract the spells and charms with which our brother is entwined as in a net he shall burst the bands of this delilah as sampson burst the two new cords with which the philistines had bound him and shall slaughter the infidels even heaps upon heaps but concerning this foul witch who hath flung her enchantments over a brother of the holy temple assuredly she shall die the death  but the laws of englandsaid the preceptor who though delighted that the grand masters resentment thus fortunately averted from himself and boisguilbert had taken another direction began now to fear he was carrying it too far  the laws of england interrupted beaumanoir permit and enjoin each judge to execute justice within his own jurisdiction the most petty baron may arrest try and condemn a witch found within his own domain and shall that power be denied to the grand master of the temple within a preceptory of his ordernowe will judge and condemn the witch shall be taken out of the land and the wickedness thereof shall be forgiven prepare the castlehall for the trial of the sorceress  albert malvoisin bowed and retirednot to give directions for preparing the hall but to seek out brian de boisguilbert and communicate to him how matters were likely to terminate it was not long ere he found him foaming with indignation at a repulse he had anew sustained from the fair jewess the unthinking he said the ungrateful to scorn him who amidst blood and flames would have saved her life at the risk of his own by heaven malvoisin i abode until roof and rafters crackled and crashed around me i was the butt of a hundred arrows they rattled on mine armour like hailstones against a latticed casement and the only use i made of my shield was for her protection this did i endure for her and now the selfwilled girl upbraids me that i did not leave her to perish and refuses me not only the slightest proof of gratitude but even the most distant hope that ever she will be brought to grant any the devil that possessed her race with obstinacy has concentrated its full force in her single person  the devil said the preceptor i think possessed you both how oft have i preached to you caution if not continence did i not tell you that there were enough willing christian damsels to be met with who would think it sin to refuse so brave a knight le don damoureux merci and you must needs anchor your affection on a wilful obstinate jewess by the mass i think old lucas beaumanoir guesses right when he maintains she hath cast a spell over you  lucas beaumanoirsaid boisguilbert reproachfullyare these your precautions malvoisin hast thou suffered the dotard to learn that rebecca is in the preceptory  how could i help it said the preceptor i neglected nothing that could keep secret your mystery but it is betrayed and whether by the devil or no the devil only can tell but i have turned the matter as i could you are safe if you renounce rebecca you are pitiedthe victim of magical delusion she is a sorceress and must suffer as such  she shall not by heaven said boisguilbert  by heaven she must and will said malvoisin neither you nor any one else can save her lucas beaumanoir hath settled that the death of a jewess will be a sinoffering sufficient to atone for all the amorous indulgences of the knights templars and thou knowest he hath both the power and will to execute so reasonable and pious a purpose  will future ages believe that such stupid bigotry ever existed said boisguilbert striding up and down the apartment  what they may believe i know not said malvoisin calmly but i know well that in this our day clergy and laymen take ninetynine to the hundred will cry amen to the grand masters sentence  i have it said boisguilbert albert thou art my friend thou must connive at her escape malvoisin and i will transport her to some place of greater security and secrecy  i cannot if i would replied the preceptor the mansion is filled with the attendants of the grand master and others who are devoted to him and to be frank with you brother i would not embark with you in this matter even if i could hope to bring my bark to haven i have risked enough already for your sake i have no mind to encounter a sentence of degradation or even to lose my preceptory for the sake of a painted piece of jewish flesh and blood and you if you will be guided by my counsel will give up this wildgoose chase and fly your hawk at some other game think boisguilbertthy present rank thy future honours all depend on thy place in the order shouldst thou adhere perversely to thy passion for this rebecca thou wilt give beaumanoir the power of expelling thee and he will not neglect it he is jealous of the truncheon which he holds in his trembling gripe and he knows thou stretchest thy bold hand towards it doubt not he will ruin thee if thou affordest him a pretext so fair as thy protection of a jewish sorceress give him his scope in this matter for thou canst not control him when the staff is in thine own firm grasp thou mayest caress the daughters of judah or burn them as may best suit thine own humour  malvoisin said boisguilbert thou art a coldblooded  friend said the preceptor hastening to fill up the blank in which boisguilbert would probably have placed a worse worda coldblooded friend i am and therefore more fit to give thee advice i tell thee once more that thou canst not save rebecca i tell thee once more thou canst but perish with her go hie thee to the grand masterthrow thyself at his feet and tell him  not at his feet by heaven but to the dotards very beard will i say  say to him then to his beard continued malvoisin coolly that you love this captive jewess to distraction and the more thou dost enlarge on thy passion the greater will be his haste to end it by the death of the fair enchantress while thou taken in flagrant delict by the avowal of a crime contrary to thine oath canst hope no aid of thy brethren and must exchange all thy brilliant visions of ambition and power to lift perhaps a mercenary spear in some of the petty quarrels between flanders and burgundy  thou speakest the truth malvoisin said brian de boisguilbert after a moments reflection i will give the hoary bigot no advantage over me and for rebecca she hath not merited at my hand that i should expose rank and honour for her sake i will cast her offyes i will leave her to her fate unless  qualify not thy wise and necessary resolution said malvoisin women are but the toys which amuse our lighter hoursambition is the serious business of life perish a thousand such frail baubles as this jewess before thy manly step pause in the brilliant career that lies stretched before thee for the present we part nor must we be seen to hold close conversationi must order the hall for his judgmentseat  what said boisguilbert so soon  ay replied the preceptor trial moves rapidly on when the judge has determined the sentence beforehand  rebecca said boisguilbert when he was left alone thou art like to cost me dearwhy cannot i abandon thee to thy fate as this calm hypocrite recommendsone effort will i make to save theebut beware of ingratitude for if i am again repulsed my vengeance shall equal my love the life and honour of boisguilbert must not be hazarded where contempt and reproaches are his only reward  the preceptor had hardly given the necessary orders when he was joined by conrade montfitchet who acquainted him with the grand masters resolution to bring the jewess to instant trial for sorcery  it is surely a dream said the preceptor we have many jewish physicians and we call them not wizards though they work wonderful cures  the grand master thinks otherwise said montfitchet and albert i will be upright with theewizard or not it were better that this miserable damsel die than that brian de boisguilbert should be lost to the order or the order divided by internal dissension thou knowest his high rank his fame in armsthou knowest the zeal with which many of our brethren regard himbut all this will not avail him with our grand master should he consider brian as the accomplice not the victim of this jewess were the souls of the twelve tribes in her single body it were better she suffered alone than that boisguilbert were partner in her destruction  i have been working him even now to abandon her said malvoisin but still are there grounds enough to condemn this rebecca for sorcerywill not the grand master change his mind when he sees that the proofs are so weak  they must be strengthened albert replied montfitchet they must be strengthened dost thou understand me  i do said the preceptor nor do i scruple to do aught for advancement of the orderbut there is little time to find engines fitting  malvoisin they must be found said conrade well will it advantage both the order and thee this templestowe is a poor preceptorythat of maisondieu is worth double its valuethou knowest my interest with our old chieffind those who can carry this matter through and thou art preceptor of maisondieu in the fertile kenthow sayst thou  there is replied malvoisin among those who came hither with boisguilbert two fellows whom i well know servants they were to my brother philip de malvoisin and passed from his service to that of frontdeboeufit may be they know something of the witcheries of this woman  away seek them out instantlyand hark thee if a byzant or two will sharpen their memory let them not be wanting  they would swear the mother that bore them a sorceress for a zecchin said the preceptor  away then said montfitchet at noon the affair will proceed i have not seen our senior in such earnest preparation since he condemned to the stake hamet alfagi a convert who relapsed to the moslem faith  the ponderous castlebell had tolled the point of noon when rebecca heard a trampling of feet upon the private stair which led to her place of confinement the noise announced the arrival of several persons and the circumstance rather gave her joy for she was more afraid of the solitary visits of the fierce and passionate boisguilbert than of any evil that could befall her besides the door of the chamber was unlocked and conrade and the preceptor malvoisin entered attended by four warders clothed in black and bearing halberds  daughter of an accursed race said the preceptor arise and follow us  whither said rebecca and for what purpose  damsel answered conrade it is not for thee to question but to obey nevertheless be it known to thee that thou art to be brought before the tribunal of the grand master of our holy order there to answer for thine offences  may the god of abraham be praised said rebecca folding her hands devoutly the name of a judge though an enemy to my people is to me as the name of a protector most willingly do i follow theepermit me only to wrap my veil around my head  they descended the stair with slow and solemn step traversed a long gallery and by a pair of folding doors placed at the end entered the great hall in which the grand master had for the time established his court of justice  the lower part of this ample apartment was filled with squires and yeomen who made way not without some difficulty for rebecca attended by the preceptor and montfitchet and followed by the guard of halberdiers to move forward to the seat appointed for her as she passed through the crowd her arms folded and her head depressed a scrap of paper was thrust into her hand which she received almost unconsciously and continued to hold without examining its contents the assurance that she possessed some friend in this awful assembly gave her courage to look around and to mark into whose presence she had been conducted she gazed accordingly upon the scene which we shall endeavour to describe in the next chapter     chapter xxxvii       stern was the law which bade its votries leave      at human woes with human hearts to grieve      stern was the law which at the winning wile      of frank and harmless mirth forbade to smile      but sterner still when high the ironrod      of tyrant power she shook and calld that power of god      the middle ages  the tribunal erected for the trial of the innocent and unhappy rebecca occupied the dais or elevated part of the upper end of the great halla platform which we have already described as the place of honour destined to be occupied by the most distinguished inhabitants or guests of an ancient mansion  on an elevated seat directly before the accused sat the grand master of the temple in full and ample robes of flowing white holding in his hand the mystic staff which bore the symbol of the order at his feet was placed a table occupied by two scribes chaplains of the order whose duty it was to reduce to formal record the proceedings of the day the black dresses bare scalps and demure looks of these churchmen formed a strong contrast to the warlike appearance of the knights who attended either as residing in the preceptory or as come thither to attend upon their grand master the preceptors of whom there were four present occupied seats lower in height and somewhat drawn back behind that of their superior and the knights who enjoyed no such rank in the order were placed on benches still lower and preserving the same distance from the preceptors as these from the grand master behind them but still upon the dais or elevated portion of the hall stood the esquires of the order in white dresses of an inferior quality  the whole assembly wore an aspect of the most profound gravity and in the faces of the knights might be perceived traces of military daring united with the solemn carriage becoming men of a religious profession and which in the presence of their grand master failed not to sit upon every brow  the remaining and lower part of the hall was filled with guards holding partisans and with other attendants whom curiosity had drawn thither to see at once a grand master and a jewish sorceress by far the greater part of those inferior persons were in one rank or other connected with the order and were accordingly distinguished by their black dresses but peasants from the neighbouring country were not refused admittance for it was the pride of beaumanoir to render the edifying spectacle of the justice which he administered as public as possible his large blue eyes seemed to expand as he gazed around the assembly and his countenance appeared elated by the conscious dignity and imaginary merit of the part which he was about to perform a psalm which he himself accompanied with a deep mellow voice which age had not deprived of its powers commenced the proceedings of the day and the solemn sounds venite exultemus domino so often sung by the templars before engaging with earthly adversaries was judged by lucas most appropriate to introduce the approaching triumph for such he deemed it over the powers of darkness the deep prolonged notes raised by a hundred masculine voices accustomed to combine in the choral chant arose to the vaulted roof of the hall and rolled on amongst its arches with the pleasing yet solemn sound of the rushing of mighty waters  when the sounds ceased the grand master glanced his eye slowly around the circle and observed that the seat of one of the preceptors was vacant brian de boisguilbert by whom it had been occupied had left his place and was now standing near the extreme corner of one of the benches occupied by the knights companions of the temple one hand extending his long mantle so as in some degree to hide his face while the other held his crosshandled sword with the point of which sheathed as it was he was slowly drawing lines upon the oaken floor  unhappy man said the grand master after favouring him with a glance of compassion thou seest conrade how this holy work distresses him to this can the light look of woman aided by the prince of the powers of this world bring a valiant and worthy knightseest thou he cannot look upon us he cannot look upon her and who knows by what impulse from his tormentor his hand forms these cabalistic lines upon the floorit may be our life and safety are thus aimed at but we spit at and defy the foul enemy semper leo percutiatur  this was communicated apart to his confidential follower conrade montfitchet the grand master then raised his voice and addressed the assembly  reverend and valiant men knights preceptors and companions of this holy order my brethren and my childrenyou also wellborn and pious esquires who aspire to wear this holy crossand you also christian brethren of every degreebe it known to you that it is not defect of power in us which hath occasioned the assembling of this congregation for however unworthy in our person yet to us is committed with this batoon full power to judge and to try all that regards the weal of this our holy order holy saint bernard in the rule of our knightly and religious profession hath said in the fiftyninth capital 53 that he would not that brethren be called together in council save at the will and command of the master leaving it free to us as to those more worthy fathers who have preceded us in this our office to judge as well of the occasion as of the time and place in which a chapter of the whole order or of any part thereof may be convoked also in all such chapters it is our duty to hear the advice of our brethren and to proceed according to our own pleasure but when the raging wolf hath made an inroad upon the flock and carried off one member thereof it is the duty of the kind shepherd to call his comrades together that with bows and slings they may quell the invader according to our wellknown rule that the lion is ever to be beaten down we have therefore summoned to our presence a jewish woman by name rebecca daughter of isaac of yorka woman infamous for sortileges and for witcheries whereby she hath maddened the blood and besotted the brain not of a churl but of a knightnot of a secular knight but of one devoted to the service of the holy templenot of a knight companion but of a preceptor of our order first in honour as in place our brother brian de boisguilbert is well known to ourselves and to all degrees who now hear me as a true and zealous champion of the cross by whose arm many deeds of valour have been wrought in the holy land and the holy places purified from pollution by the blood of those infidels who defiled them neither have our brothers sagacity and prudence been less in repute among his brethren than his valour and discipline in so much that knights both in eastern and western lands have named de boisguilbert as one who may well be put in nomination as successor to this batoon when it shall please heaven to release us from the toil of bearing it if we were told that such a man so honoured and so honourable suddenly casting away regard for his character his vows his brethren and his prospects had associated to himself a jewish damsel wandered in this lewd company through solitary places defended her person in preference to his own and finally was so utterly blinded and besotted by his folly as to bring her even to one of our own preceptories what should we say but that the noble knight was possessed by some evil demon or influenced by some wicked spellif we could suppose it otherwise think not rank valour high repute or any earthly consideration should prevent us from visiting him with punishment that the evil thing might be removed even according to the text auferte malum ex vobis for various and heinous are the acts of transgression against the rule of our blessed order in this lamentable history1st he hath walked according to his proper will contrary to capital 33 quod nullus juxta propriam voluntatem incedat2d he hath held communication with an excommunicated person capital 57 ut fratres non participent cum excommunicatis and therefore hath a portion in anathema maranatha3d he hath conversed with strange women contrary to the capital ut fratres non conversantur cum extraneis mulieribus4th he hath not avoided nay he hath it is to be feared solicited the kiss of woman by which saith the last rule of our renowned order ut fugiantur oscula the soldiers of the cross are brought into a snare for which heinous and multiplied guilt brian de boisguilbert should be cut off and cast out from our congregation were he the right hand and right eye thereof  he paused a low murmur went through the assembly some of the younger part who had been inclined to smile at the statute de osculis fugiendis became now grave enough and anxiously waited what the grand master was next to propose  such he said and so great should indeed be the punishment of a knight templar who wilfully offended against the rules of his order in such weighty points but if by means of charms and of spells satan had obtained dominion over the knight perchance because he cast his eyes too lightly upon a damsels beauty we are then rather to lament than chastise his backsliding and imposing on him only such penance as may purify him from his iniquity we are to turn the full edge of our indignation upon the accursed instrument which had so wellnigh occasioned his utter falling awaystand forth therefore and bear witness ye who have witnessed these unhappy doings that we may judge of the sum and bearing thereof and judge whether our justice may be satisfied with the punishment of this infidel woman or if we must go on with a bleeding heart to the further proceeding against our brother  several witnesses were called upon to prove the risks to which boisguilbert exposed himself in endeavouring to save rebecca from the blazing castle and his neglect of his personal defence in attending to her safety the men gave these details with the exaggerations common to vulgar minds which have been strongly excited by any remarkable event and their natural disposition to the marvellous was greatly increased by the satisfaction which their evidence seemed to afford to the eminent person for whose information it had been delivered thus the dangers which boisguilbert surmounted in themselves sufficiently great became portentous in their narrative the devotion of the knight to rebeccas defence was exaggerated beyond the bounds not only of discretion but even of the most frantic excess of chivalrous zeal and his deference to what she said even although her language was often severe and upbraiding was painted as carried to an excess which in a man of his haughty temper seemed almost preternatural  the preceptor of templestowe was then called on to describe the manner in which boisguilbert and the jewess arrived at the preceptory the evidence of malvoisin was skilfully guarded but while he apparently studied to spare the feelings of boisguilbert he threw in from time to time such hints as seemed to infer that he laboured under some temporary alienation of mind so deeply did he appear to be enamoured of the damsel whom he brought along with him with sighs of penitence the preceptor avowed his own contrition for having admitted rebecca and her lover within the walls of the preceptorybut my defence he concluded has been made in my confession to our most reverend father the grand master he knows my motives were not evil though my conduct may have been irregular joyfully will i submit to any penance he shall assign me  thou hast spoken well brother albert said beaumanoir thy motives were good since thou didst judge it right to arrest thine erring brother in his career of precipitate folly but thy conduct was wrong as he that would stop a runaway steed and seizing by the stirrup instead of the bridle receiveth injury himself instead of accomplishing his purpose thirteen paternosters are assigned by our pious founder for matins and nine for vespers be those services doubled by thee thrice aweek are templars permitted the use of flesh but do thou keep fast for all the seven days this do for six weeks to come and thy penance is accomplished  with a hypocritical look of the deepest submission the preceptor of templestowe bowed to the ground before his superior and resumed his seat  were it not well brethren said the grand master that we examine something into the former life and conversation of this woman specially that we may discover whether she be one likely to use magical charms and spells since the truths which we have heard may well incline us to suppose that in this unhappy course our erring brother has been acted upon by some infernal enticement and delusion  herman of goodalricke was the fourth preceptor present the other three were conrade malvoisin and boisguilbert himself herman was an ancient warrior whose face was marked with scars inflicted by the sabre of the moslemah and had great rank and consideration among his brethren he arose and bowed to the grand master who instantly granted him license of speech i would crave to know most reverend father of our valiant brother brian de boisguilbert what he says to these wondrous accusations and with what eye he himself now regards his unhappy intercourse with this jewish maiden  brian de boisguilbert said the grand master thou hearest the question which our brother of goodalricke desirest thou shouldst answer i command thee to reply to him  boisguilbert turned his head towards the grand master when thus addressed and remained silent  he is possessed by a dumb devil said the grand master avoid thee sathanusspeak brian de boisguilbert i conjure thee by this symbol of our holy order  boisguilbert made an effort to suppress his rising scorn and indignation the expression of which he was well aware would have little availed him brian de boisguilbert he answered replies not most reverend father to such wild and vague charges if his honour be impeached he will defend it with his body and with that sword which has often fought for christendom  we forgive thee brother brian said the grand master though that thou hast boasted thy warlike achievements before us is a glorifying of thine own deeds and cometh of the enemy who tempteth us to exalt our own worship but thou hast our pardon judging thou speakest less of thine own suggestion than from the impulse of him whom by heavens leave we will quell and drive forth from our assembly a glance of disdain flashed from the dark fierce eyes of boisguilbert but he made no replyand now pursued the grand master since our brother of goodalrickes question has been thus imperfectly answered pursue we our quest brethren and with our patrons assistance we will search to the bottom this mystery of iniquitylet those who have aught to witness of the life and conversation of this jewish woman stand forth before us there was a bustle in the lower part of the hall and when the grand master enquired the reason it was replied there was in the crowd a bedridden man whom the prisoner had restored to the perfect use of his limbs by a miraculous balsam  the poor peasant a saxon by birth was dragged forward to the bar terrified at the penal consequences which he might have incurred by the guilt of having been cured of the palsy by a jewish damsel perfectly cured he certainly was not for he supported himself forward on crutches to give evidence most unwilling was his testimony and given with many tears but he admitted that two years since when residing at york he was suddenly afflicted with a sore disease while labouring for isaac the rich jew in his vocation of a joiner that he had been unable to stir from his bed until the remedies applied by rebeccas directions and especially a warming and spicysmelling balsam had in some degree restored him to the use of his limbs moreover he said she had given him a pot of that precious ointment and furnished him with a piece of money withal to return to the house of his father near to templestowe and may it please your gracious reverence said the man i cannot think the damsel meant harm by me though she hath the ill hap to be a jewess for even when i used her remedy i said the pater and the creed and it never operated a whit less kindly  peace slave said the grand master and begone it well suits brutes like thee to be tampering and trinketing with hellish cures and to be giving your labour to the sons of mischief i tell thee the fiend can impose diseases for the very purpose of removing them in order to bring into credit some diabolical fashion of cure hast thou that unguent of which thou speakest  the peasant fumbling in his bosom with a trembling hand produced a small box bearing some hebrew characters on the lid which was with most of the audience a sure proof that the devil had stood apothecary beaumanoir after crossing himself took the box into his hand and learned in most of the eastern tongues read with ease the motto on the lidthe lion of the tribe of judah hath conquered  strange powers of sathanas said he which can convert scripture into blasphemy mingling poison with our necessary foodis there no leech here who can tell us the ingredients of this mystic unguent  two mediciners as they called themselves the one a monk the other a barber appeared and avouched they knew nothing of the materials excepting that they savoured of myrrh and camphire which they took to be oriental herbs but with the true professional hatred to a successful practitioner of their art they insinuated that since the medicine was beyond their own knowledge it must necessarily have been compounded from an unlawful and magical pharmacopeia since they themselves though no conjurors fully understood every branch of their art so far as it might be exercised with the good faith of a christian when this medical research was ended the saxon peasant desired humbly to have back the medicine which he had found so salutary but the grand master frowned severely at the request what is thy name fellow said he to the cripple  higg the son of snell answered the peasant  then higg son of snell said the grand master i tell thee it is better to be bedridden than to accept the benefit of unbelievers medicine that thou mayest arise and walk better to despoil infidels of their treasure by the strong hand than to accept of them benevolent gifts or do them service for wages go thou and do as i have said  alack said the peasant an it shall not displease your reverence the lesson comes too late for me for i am but a maimed man but i will tell my two brethren who serve the rich rabbi nathan ben samuel that your mastership says it is more lawful to rob him than to render him faithful service  out with the prating villain said beaumanoir who was not prepared to refute this practical application of his general maxim  higg the son of snell withdrew into the crowd but interested in the fate of his benefactress lingered until he should learn her doom even at the risk of again encountering the frown of that severe judge the terror of which withered his very heart within him  at this period of the trial the grand master commanded rebecca to unveil herself opening her lips for the first time she replied patiently but with dignitythat it was not the wont of the daughters of her people to uncover their faces when alone in an assembly of strangers the sweet tones of her voice and the softness of her reply impressed on the audience a sentiment of pity and sympathy but beaumanoir in whose mind the suppression of each feeling of humanity which could interfere with his imagined duty was a virtue of itself repeated his commands that his victim should be unveiled the guards were about to remove her veil accordingly when she stood up before the grand master and said nay but for the love of your own daughtersalas she said recollecting herself ye have no daughtersyet for the remembrance of your mothersfor the love of your sisters and of female decency let me not be thus handled in your presence it suits not a maiden to be disrobed by such rude grooms i will obey you she added with an expression of patient sorrow in her voice which had almost melted the heart of beaumanoir himself ye are elders among your people and at your command i will show the features of an illfated maiden  she withdrew her veil and looked on them with a countenance in which bashfulness contended with dignity her exceeding beauty excited a murmur of surprise and the younger knights told each other with their eyes in silent correspondence that brians best apology was in the power of her real charms rather than of her imaginary witchcraft but higg the son of snell felt most deeply the effect produced by the sight of the countenance of his benefactress  let me go forth he said to the warders at the door of the halllet me go forthto look at her again will kill me for i have had a share in murdering her  peace poor man said rebecca when she heard his exclamation thou hast done me no harm by speaking the truththou canst not aid me by thy complaints or lamentations peace i pray theego home and save thyself  higg was about to be thrust out by the compassion of the warders who were apprehensive lest his clamorous grief should draw upon them reprehension and upon himself punishment but he promised to be silent and was permitted to remain the two menatarms with whom albert malvoisin had not failed to communicate upon the import of their testimony were now called forward though both were hardened and inflexible villains the sight of the captive maiden as well as her excelling beauty at first appeared to stagger them but an expressive glance from the preceptor of templestowe restored them to their dogged composure and they delivered with a precision which would have seemed suspicious to more impartial judges circumstances either altogether fictitious or trivial and natural in themselves but rendered pregnant with suspicion by the exaggerated manner in which they were told and the sinister commentary which the witnesses added to the facts the circumstances of their evidence would have been in modern days divided into two classesthose which were immaterial and those which were actually and physically impossible but both were in those ignorant and superstitions times easily credited as proofs of guiltthe first class set forth that rebecca was heard to mutter to herself in an unknown tonguethat the songs she sung by fits were of a strangely sweet sound which made the ears of the hearer tingle and his heart throbthat she spoke at times to herself and seemed to look upward for a replythat her garments were of a strange and mystic form unlike those of women of good reputethat she had rings impressed with cabalistical devices and that strange characters were broidered on her veil  all these circumstances so natural and so trivial were gravely listened to as proofs or at least as affording strong suspicions that rebecca had unlawful correspondence with mystical powers  but there was less equivocal testimony which the credulity of the assembly or of the greater part greedily swallowed however incredible one of the soldiers had seen her work a cure upon a wounded man brought with them to the castle of torquilstone she did he said make certain signs upon the wound and repeated certain mysterious words which he blessed god he understood not when the iron head of a square crossbow bolt disengaged itself from the wound the bleeding was stanched the wound was closed and the dying man was within a quarter of an hour walking upon the ramparts and assisting the witness in managing a mangonel or machine for hurling stones this legend was probably founded upon the fact that rebecca had attended on the wounded ivanhoe when in the castle of torquilstone but it was the more difficult to dispute the accuracy of the witness as in order to produce real evidence in support of his verbal testimony he drew from his pouch the very bolthead which according to his story had been miraculously extracted from the wound and as the iron weighed a full ounce it completely confirmed the tale however marvellous  his comrade had been a witness from a neighbouring battlement of the scene betwixt rebecca and boisguilbert when she was upon the point of precipitating herself from the top of the tower not to be behind his companion this fellow stated that he had seen rebecca perch herself upon the parapet of the turret and there take the form of a milkwhite swan under which appearance she flitted three times round the castle of torquilstone then again settle on the turret and once more assume the female form  less than one half of this weighty evidence would have been sufficient to convict any old woman poor and ugly even though she had not been a jewess united with that fatal circumstance the body of proof was too weighty for rebeccas youth though combined with the most exquisite beauty  the grand master had collected the suffrages and now in a solemn tone demanded of rebecca what she had to say against the sentence of condemnation which he was about to pronounce  to invoke your pity said the lovely jewess with a voice somewhat tremulous with emotion would i am aware be as useless as i should hold it mean to state that to relieve the sick and wounded of another religion cannot be displeasing to the acknowledged founder of both our faiths were also unavailing to plead that many things which these men whom may heaven pardon have spoken against me are impossible would avail me but little since you believe in their possibility and still less would it advantage me to explain that the peculiarities of my dress language and manners are those of my peoplei had wellnigh said of my country but alas we have no country nor will i even vindicate myself at the expense of my oppressor who stands there listening to the fictions and surmises which seem to convert the tyrant into the victimgod be judge between him and me but rather would i submit to ten such deaths as your pleasure may denounce against me than listen to the suit which that man of belial has urged upon mefriendless defenceless and his prisoner but he is of your own faith and his lightest affirmance would weigh down the most solemn protestations of the distressed jewess i will not therefore return to himself the charge brought against mebut to himselfyes brian de boisguilbert to thyself i appeal whether these accusations are not false as monstrous and calumnious as they are deadly  there was a pause all eyes turned to brain de boisguilbert he was silent  speak she said if thou art a manif thou art a christian speaki conjure thee by the habit which thou dost wear by the name thou dost inheritby the knighthood thou dost vauntby the honour of thy motherby the tomb and the bones of thy fatheri conjure thee to say are these things true  answer her brother said the grand master if the enemy with whom thou dost wrestle will give thee power  in fact boisguilbert seemed agitated by contending passions which almost convulsed his features and it was with a constrained voice that at last he replied looking to rebeccathe scrollthe scroll  ay said beaumanoir this is indeed testimony the victim of her witcheries can only name the fatal scroll the spell inscribed on which is doubtless the cause of his silence  but rebecca put another interpretation on the words extorted as it were from boisguilbert and glancing her eye upon the slip of parchment which she continued to hold in her hand she read written thereupon in the arabian character demand a champion the murmuring commentary which ran through the assembly at the strange reply of boisguilbert gave rebecca leisure to examine and instantly to destroy the scroll unobserved when the whisper had ceased the grand master spoke  rebecca thou canst derive no benefit from the evidence of this unhappy knight for whom as we well perceive the enemy is yet too powerful hast thou aught else to say  there is yet one chance of life left to me said rebecca even by your own fierce laws life has been miserablemiserable at least of latebut i will not cast away the gift of god while he affords me the means of defending it i deny this chargei maintain my innocence and i declare the falsehood of this accusationi challenge the privilege of trial by combat and will appear by my champion  and who rebecca replied the grand master will lay lance in rest for a sorceress who will be the champion of a jewess  god will raise me up a champion said rebeccait cannot be that in merry englandthe hospitable the generous the free where so many are ready to peril their lives for honour there will not be found one to fight for justice but it is enough that i challenge the trial by combatthere lies my gage  she took her embroidered glove from her hand and flung it down before the grand master with an air of mingled simplicity and dignity which excited universal surprise and admiration     chapter xxxviii       there i throw my gage      to prove it on thee to the extremest point      of martial daring      richard ii  even lucas beaumanoir himself was affected by the mien and appearance of rebecca he was not originally a cruel or even a severe man but with passions by nature cold and with a high though mistaken sense of duty his heart had been gradually hardened by the ascetic life which he pursued the supreme power which he enjoyed and the supposed necessity of subduing infidelity and eradicating heresy which he conceived peculiarly incumbent on him his features relaxed in their usual severity as he gazed upon the beautiful creature before him alone unfriended and defending herself with so much spirit and courage he crossed himself twice as doubting whence arose the unwonted softening of a heart which on such occasions used to resemble in hardness the steel of his sword at length he spoke  damsel he said if the pity i feel for thee arise from any practice thine evil arts have made on me great is thy guilt but i rather judge it the kinder feelings of nature which grieves that so goodly a form should be a vessel of perdition repent my daughterconfess thy witchcraftsturn thee from thine evil faithembrace this holy emblem and all shall yet be well with thee here and hereafter in some sisterhood of the strictest order shalt thou have time for prayer and fitting penance and that repentance not to be repented of this do and livewhat has the law of moses done for thee that thou shouldest die for it  it was the law of my fathers said rebecca it was delivered in thunders and in storms upon the mountain of sinai in cloud and in fire this if ye are christians ye believeit is you say recalled but so my teachers have not taught me  let our chaplain said beaumanoir stand forth and tell this obstinate infidel  forgive the interruption said rebecca meekly i am a maiden unskilled to dispute for my religion but i can die for it if it be gods willlet me pray your answer to my demand of a champion  give me her glove said beaumanoir this is indeed he continued as he looked at the flimsy texture and slender fingers a slight and frail gage for a purpose so deadlyseest thou rebecca as this thin and light glove of thine is to one of our heavy steel gauntlets so is thy cause to that of the temple for it is our order which thou hast defied  cast my innocence into the scale answered rebecca and the glove of silk shall outweigh the glove of iron  then thou dost persist in thy refusal to confess thy guilt and in that bold challenge which thou hast made  i do persist noble sir answered rebecca  so be it then in the name of heaven said the grand master and may god show the right  amen replied the preceptors around him and the word was deeply echoed by the whole assembly  brethren said beaumanoir you are aware that we might well have refused to this woman the benefit of the trial by combatbut though a jewess and an unbeliever she is also a stranger and defenceless and god forbid that she should ask the benefit of our mild laws and that it should be refused to her moreover we are knights and soldiers as well as men of religion and shame it were to us upon any pretence to refuse proffered combat thus therefore stands the case rebecca the daughter of isaac of york is by many frequent and suspicious circumstances defamed of sorcery practised on the person of a noble knight of our holy order and hath challenged the combat in proof of her innocence to whom reverend brethren is it your opinion that we should deliver the gage of battle naming him at the same time to be our champion on the field  to brian de boisguilbert whom it chiefly concerns said the preceptor of goodalricke and who moreover best knows how the truth stands in this matter  but if said the grand master our brother brian be under the influence of a charm or a spellwe speak but for the sake of precaution for to the arm of none of our holy order would we more willingly confide this or a more weighty cause  reverend father answered the preceptor of goodalricke no spell can effect the champion who comes forward to fight for the judgment of god  thou sayest right brother said the grand master albert malvoisin give this gage of battle to brian de boisguilbertit is our charge to thee brother he continued addressing himself to boisguilbert that thou do thy battle manfully nothing doubting that the good cause shall triumphand do thou rebecca attend that we assign thee the third day from the present to find a champion  that is but brief space answered rebecca for a stranger who is also of another faith to find one who will do battle wagering life and honour for her cause against a knight who is called an approved soldier  we may not extend it answered the grand master the field must be foughten in our own presence and divers weighty causes call us on the fourth day from hence  gods will be done said rebecca i put my trust in him to whom an instant is as effectual to save as a whole age  thou hast spoken well damsel said the grand master but well know we who can array himself like an angel of light it remains but to name a fitting place of combat and if it so hap also of executionwhere is the preceptor of this house  albert malvoisin still holding rebeccas glove in his hand was speaking to boisguilbert very earnestly but in a low voice  how said the grand master will he not receive the gage  he willhe doth most reverend father said malvoisin slipping the glove under his own mantle and for the place of combat i hold the fittest to be the lists of saint george belonging to this preceptory and used by us for military exercise  it is well said the grand masterrebecca in those lists shalt thou produce thy champion and if thou failest to do so or if thy champion shall be discomfited by the judgment of god thou shalt then die the death of a sorceress according to doomlet this our judgment be recorded and the record read aloud that no one may pretend ignorance  one of the chaplains who acted as clerks to the chapter immediately engrossed the order in a huge volume which contained the proceedings of the templar knights when solemnly assembled on such occasions and when he had finished writing the other read aloud the sentence of the grand master which when translated from the normanfrench in which it was couched was expressed as follows  rebecca a jewess daughter of isaac of york being attainted of sorcery seduction and other damnable practices practised on a knight of the most holy order of the temple of zion doth deny the same and saith that the testimony delivered against her this day is false wicked and disloyal and that by lawful essoine 54 of her body as being unable to combat in her own behalf she doth offer by a champion instead thereof to avouch her case he performing his loyal devoir in all knightly sort with such arms as to gage of battle do fully appertain and that at her peril and cost and therewith she proffered her gage and the gage having been delivered to the noble lord and knight brian de boisguilbert of the holy order of the temple of zion he was appointed to do this battle in behalf of his order and himself as injured and impaired by the practices of the appellant wherefore the most reverend father and puissant lord lucas marquis of beaumanoir did allow of the said challenge and of the said essoine of the appellants body and assigned the third day for the said combat the place being the enclosure called the lists of saint george near to the preceptory of templestowe and the grand master appoints the appellant to appear there by her champion on pain of doom as a person convicted of sorcery or seduction and also the defendant so to appear under the penalty of being held and adjudged recreant in case of default and the noble lord and most reverend father aforesaid appointed the battle to be done in his own presence and according to all that is commendable and profitable in such a case and may god aid the just cause  amen said the grand master and the word was echoed by all around rebecca spoke not but she looked up to heaven and folding her hands remained for a minute without change of attitude she then modestly reminded the grand master that she ought to be permitted some opportunity of free communication with her friends for the purpose of making her condition known to them and procuring if possible some champion to fight in her behalf  it is just and lawful said the grand master choose what messenger thou shalt trust and he shall have free communication with thee in thy prisonchamber  is there said rebecca any one here who either for love of a good cause or for ample hire will do the errand of a distressed being  all were silent for none thought it safe in the presence of the grand master to avow any interest in the calumniated prisoner lest he should be suspected of leaning towards judaism not even the prospect of reward far less any feelings of compassion alone could surmount this apprehension  rebecca stood for a few moments in indescribable anxiety and then exclaimed is it really thusand in english land am i to be deprived of the poor chance of safety which remains to me for want of an act of charity which would not be refused to the worst criminal  higg the son of snell at length replied i am but a maimed man but that i can at all stir or move was owing to her charitable assistancei will do thine errand he added addressing rebecca as well as a crippled object can and happy were my limbs fleet enough to repair the mischief done by my tongue alas when i boasted of thy charity i little thought i was leading thee into danger  god said rebecca is the disposer of all he can turn back the captivity of judah even by the weakest instrument to execute his message the snail is as sure a messenger as the falcon seek out isaac of yorkhere is that will pay for horse and manlet him have this scrolli know not if it be of heaven the spirit which inspires me but most truly do i judge that i am not to die this death and that a champion will be raised up for me farewelllife and death are in thy haste  the peasant took the scroll which contained only a few lines in hebrew many of the crowd would have dissuaded him from touching a document so suspicious but higg was resolute in the service of his benefactress she had saved his body he said and he was confident she did not mean to peril his soul  i will get me he said my neighbour buthans good capul 55 and i will be at york within as brief space as man and beast may  but as it fortuned he had no occasion to go so far for within a quarter of a mile from the gate of the preceptory he met with two riders whom by their dress and their huge yellow caps he knew to be jews and on approaching more nearly discovered that one of them was his ancient employer isaac of york the other was the rabbi ben samuel and both had approached as near to the preceptory as they dared on hearing that the grand master had summoned a chapter for the trial of a sorceress  brother ben samuel said isaac my soul is disquieted and i wot not why this charge of necromancy is right often used for cloaking evil practices on our people  be of good comfort brother said the physician thou canst deal with the nazarenes as one possessing the mammon of unrighteousness and canst therefore purchase immunity at their handsit rules the savage minds of those ungodly men even as the signet of the mighty solomon was said to command the evil geniibut what poor wretch comes hither upon his crutches desiring as i think some speech of mefriend continued the physician addressing higg the son of snell i refuse thee not the aid of mine art but i relieve not with one asper those who beg for alms upon the highway out upon theehast thou the palsy in thy legs then let thy hands work for thy livelihood for albeit thou best unfit for a speedy post or for a careful shepherd or for the warfare or for the service of a hasty master yet there be occupationshow now brother said he interrupting his harangue to look towards isaac who had but glanced at the scroll which higg offered when uttering a deep groan he fell from his mule like a dying man and lay for a minute insensible  the rabbi now dismounted in great alarm and hastily applied the remedies which his art suggested for the recovery of his companion he had even taken from his pocket a cupping apparatus and was about to proceed to phlebotomy when the object of his anxious solicitude suddenly revived but it was to dash his cap from his head and to throw dust on his grey hairs the physician was at first inclined to ascribe this sudden and violent emotion to the effects of insanity and adhering to his original purpose began once again to handle his implements but isaac soon convinced him of his error  child of my sorrow he said well shouldst thou be called benoni instead of rebecca why should thy death bring down my grey hairs to the grave till in the bitterness of my heart i curse god and die  brother said the rabbi in great surprise art thou a father in israel and dost thou utter words like unto thesei trust that the child of thy house yet liveth  she liveth answered isaac but it is as daniel who was called beltheshazzar even when within the den of the lions she is captive unto those men of belial and they will wreak their cruelty upon her sparing neither for her youth nor her comely favour o she was as a crown of green palms to my grey locks and she must wither in a night like the gourd of jonahchild of my lovechild of my old ageoh rebecca daughter of rachel the darkness of the shadow of death hath encompassed thee  yet read the scroll said the rabbi peradventure it may be that we may yet find out a way of deliverance  do thou read brother answered isaac for mine eyes are as a fountain of water  the physician read but in their native language the following words  to isaac the son of adonikam whom the gentiles call isaac of york peace and the blessing of the promise be multiplied unto theemy father i am as one doomed to die for that which my soul knoweth noteven for the crime of witchcraft my father if a strong man can be found to do battle for my cause with sword and spear according to the custom of the nazarenes and that within the lists of templestowe on the third day from this time peradventure our fathers god will give him strength to defend the innocent and her who hath none to help her but if this may not be let the virgins of our people mourn for me as for one cast off and for the hart that is stricken by the hunter and for the flower which is cut down by the scythe of the mower wherefore look now what thou doest and whether there be any rescue one nazarene warrior might indeed bear arms in my behalf even wilfred son of cedric whom the gentiles call ivanhoe but he may not yet endure the weight of his armour nevertheless send the tidings unto him my father for he hath favour among the strong men of his people and as he was our companion in the house of bondage he may find some one to do battle for my sake and say unto him even unto him even unto wilfred the son of cedric that if rebecca live or if rebecca die she liveth or dieth wholly free of the guilt she is charged withal and if it be the will of god that thou shalt be deprived of thy daughter do not thou tarry old man in this land of bloodshed and cruelty but betake thyself to cordova where thy brother liveth in safety under the shadow of the throne even of the throne of boabdil the saracen for less cruel are the cruelties of the moors unto the race of jacob than the cruelties of the nazarenes of england  isaac listened with tolerable composure while ben samuel read the letter and then again resumed the gestures and exclamations of oriental sorrow tearing his garments besprinkling his head with dust and ejaculating my daughter my daughter flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone  yet said the rabbi take courage for this grief availeth nothing gird up thy loins and seek out this wilfred the son of cedric it may be he will help thee with counsel or with strength for the youth hath favour in the eyes of richard called of the nazarenes coeurdelion and the tidings that he hath returned are constant in the land it may be that he may obtain his letter and his signet commanding these men of blood who take their name from the temple to the dishonour thereof that they proceed not in their purposed wickedness  i will seek him out said isaac for he is a good youth and hath compassion for the exile of jacob but he cannot bear his armour and what other christian shall do battle for the oppressed of zion  nay but said the rabbi thou speakest as one that knoweth not the gentiles with gold shalt thou buy their valour even as with gold thou buyest thine own safety be of good courage and do thou set forward to find out this wilfred of ivanhoe i will also up and be doing for great sin it were to leave thee in thy calamity i will hie me to the city of york where many warriors and strong men are assembled and doubt not i will find among them some one who will do battle for thy daughter for gold is their god and for riches will they pawn their lives as well as their landsthou wilt fulfil my brother such promise as i may make unto them in thy name  assuredly brother said isaac and heaven be praised that raised me up a comforter in my misery howbeit grant them not their full demand at once for thou shalt find it the quality of this accursed people that they will ask pounds and peradventure accept of ouncesnevertheless be it as thou willest for i am distracted in this thing and what would my gold avail me if the child of my love should perish  farewell said the physician and may it be to thee as thy heart desireth  they embraced accordingly and departed on their several roads the crippled peasant remained for some time looking after them  these dogjews said he to take no more notice of a free guildbrother than if i were a bond slave or a turk or a circumcised hebrew like themselves they might have flung me a mancus or two however i was not obliged to bring their unhallowed scrawls and run the risk of being bewitched as more folks than one told me and what care i for the bit of gold that the wench gave me if i am to come to harm from the priest next easter at confession and be obliged to give him twice as much to make it up with him and be called the jews flying post all my life as it may hap into the bargain i think i was bewitched in earnest when i was beside that girlbut it was always so with jew or gentile whosoever came near hernone could stay when she had an errand to goand still whenever i think of her i would give shop and tools to save her life     chapter xxxix       o maid unrelenting and cold as thou art      my bosom is proud as thine own      seward  it was in the twilight of the day when her trial if it could be called such had taken place that a low knock was heard at the door of rebeccas prisonchamber it disturbed not the inmate who was then engaged in the evening prayer recommended by her religion and which concluded with a hymn we have ventured thus to translate into english       when israel of the lord beloved      out of the land of bondage came      her fathers god before her moved      an awful guide in smoke and flame      by day along the astonishd lands      the cloudy pillar glided slow      by night arabias crimsond sands      returnd the fiery columns glow       there rose the choral hymn of praise      and trump and timbrel answerd keen      and zions daughters pourd their lays      with priests and warriors voice between      no portents now our foes amaze      forsaken israel wanders lone      our fathers would not know thy ways      and thou hast left them to their own       but present still though now unseen      when brightly shines the prosperous day      be thoughts of thee a cloudy screen      to temper the deceitful ray      and oh when stoops on judahs path      in shade and storm the frequent night      be thou longsuffering slow to wrath      a burning and a shining light       our harps we left by babels streams      the tyrants jest the gentiles scorn      no censer round our altar beams      and mute our timbrel trump and horn      but thou hast said the blood of goat      the flesh of rams i will not prize      a contrite heart and humble thought      are mine accepted sacrifice  when the sounds of rebeccas devotional hymn had died away in silence the low knock at the door was again renewed enter she said if thou art a friend and if a foe i have not the means of refusing thy entrance  i am said brian de boisguilbert entering the apartment friend or foe rebecca as the event of this interview shall make me  alarmed at the sight of this man whose licentious passion she considered as the root of her misfortunes rebecca drew backward with a cautious and alarmed yet not a timorous demeanour into the farthest corner of the apartment as if determined to retreat as far as she could but to stand her ground when retreat became no longer possible she drew herself into an attitude not of defiance but of resolution as one that would avoid provoking assault yet was resolute to repel it being offered to the utmost of her power  you have no reason to fear me rebecca said the templar or if i must so qualify my speech you have at least now no reason to fear me  i fear you not sir knight replied rebecca although her shortdrawn breath seemed to belie the heroism of her accents my trust is strong and i fear thee not  you have no cause answered boisguilbert gravely my former frantic attempts you have not now to dread within your call are guards over whom i have no authority they are designed to conduct you to death rebecca yet would not suffer you to be insulted by any one even by me were my frenzyfor frenzy it isto urge me so far  may heaven be praised said the jewess death is the least of my apprehensions in this den of evil  ay replied the templar the idea of death is easily received by the courageous mind when the road to it is sudden and open a thrust with a lance a stroke with a sword were to me littleto you a spring from a dizzy battlement a stroke with a sharp poniard has no terrors compared with what either thinks disgrace mark mei say thisperhaps mine own sentiments of honour are not less fantastic rebecca than thine are but we know alike how to die for them  unhappy man said the jewess and art thou condemned to expose thy life for principles of which thy sober judgment does not acknowledge the solidity surely this is a parting with your treasure for that which is not breadbut deem not so of me thy resolution may fluctuate on the wild and changeful billows of human opinion but mine is anchored on the rock of ages  silence maiden answered the templar such discourse now avails but little thou art condemned to die not a sudden and easy death such as misery chooses and despair welcomes but a slow wretched protracted course of torture suited to what the diabolical bigotry of these men calls thy crime  and to whomif such my fateto whom do i owe this said rebecca surely only to him who for a most selfish and brutal cause dragged me hither and who now for some unknown purpose of his own strives to exaggerate the wretched fate to which he exposed me  think not said the templar that i have so exposed thee i would have bucklered thee against such danger with my own bosom as freely as ever i exposed it to the shafts which had otherwise reached thy life  had thy purpose been the honourable protection of the innocent said rebecca i had thanked thee for thy careas it is thou hast claimed merit for it so often that i tell thee life is worth nothing to me preserved at the price which thou wouldst exact for it  truce with thine upbraidings rebecca said the templar i have my own cause of grief and brook not that thy reproaches should add to it  what is thy purpose then sir knight said the jewess speak it brieflyif thou hast aught to do save to witness the misery thou hast caused let me know it and then if so it please you leave me to myselfthe step between time and eternity is short but terrible and i have few moments to prepare for it  i perceive rebecca said boisguilbert that thou dost continue to burden me with the charge of distresses which most fain would i have prevented  sir knight said rebecca i would avoid reproachesbut what is more certain than that i owe my death to thine unbridled passion  you erryou errsaid the templar hastily if you impute what i could neither foresee nor prevent to my purpose or agencycould i guess the unexpected arrival of yon dotard whom some flashes of frantic valour and the praises yielded by fools to the stupid selftorments of an ascetic have raised for the present above his own merits above common sense above me and above the hundreds of our order who think and feel as men free from such silly and fantastic prejudices as are the grounds of his opinions and actions  yet said rebecca you sate a judge upon me innocentmost innocentas you knew me to beyou concurred in my condemnation and if i aright understood are yourself to appear in arms to assert my guilt and assure my punishment  thy patience maiden replied the templar no race knows so well as thine own tribes how to submit to the time and so to trim their bark as to make advantage even of an adverse wind  lamented be the hour said rebecca that has taught such art to the house of israel but adversity bends the heart as fire bends the stubborn steel and those who are no longer their own governors and the denizens of their own free independent state must crouch before strangers it is our curse sir knight deserved doubtless by our own misdeeds and those of our fathers but youyou who boast your freedom as your birthright how much deeper is your disgrace when you stoop to soothe the prejudices of others and that against your own conviction  your words are bitter rebecca said boisguilbert pacing the apartment with impatience but i came not hither to bandy reproaches with youknow that boisguilbert yields not to created man although circumstances may for a time induce him to alter his plan his will is the mountain stream which may indeed be turned for a little space aside by the rock but fails not to find its course to the ocean that scroll which warned thee to demand a champion from whom couldst thou think it came if not from boisguilbert in whom else couldst thou have excited such interest  a brief respite from instant death said rebecca which will little avail mewas this all thou couldst do for one on whose head thou hast heaped sorrow and whom thou hast brought near even to the verge of the tomb  no maiden said boisguilbert this was not all that i purposed had it not been for the accursed interference of yon fanatical dotard and the fool of goodalricke who being a templar affects to think and judge according to the ordinary rules of humanity the office of the champion defender had devolved not on a preceptor but on a companion of the order then i myselfsuch was my purposehad on the sounding of the trumpet appeared in the lists as thy champion disguised indeed in the fashion of a roving knight who seeks adventures to prove his shield and spear and then let beaumanoir have chosen not one but two or three of the brethren here assembled i had not doubted to cast them out of the saddle with my single lance thus rebecca should thine innocence have been avouched and to thine own gratitude would i have trusted for the reward of my victory  this sir knight said rebecca is but idle boastinga brag of what you would have done had you not found it convenient to do otherwise you received my glove and my champion if a creature so desolate can find one must encounter your lance in the listsyet you would assume the air of my friend and protector  thy friend and protector said the templar gravely i will yet bebut mark at what risk or rather at what certainty of dishonour and then blame me not if i make my stipulations before i offer up all that i have hitherto held dear to save the life of a jewish maiden  speak said rebecca i understand thee not  well then said boisguilbert i will speak as freely as ever did doting penitent to his ghostly father when placed in the tricky confessionalrebecca if i appear not in these lists i lose fame and ranklose that which is the breath of my nostrils the esteem i mean in which i am held by my brethren and the hopes i have of succeeding to that mighty authority which is now wielded by the bigoted dotard lucas de beaumanoir but of which i should make a different use such is my certain doom except i appear in arms against thy cause accursed be he of goodalricke who baited this trap for me and doubly accursed albert de malvoisin who withheld me from the resolution i had formed of hurling back the glove at the face of the superstitious and superannuated fool who listened to a charge so absurd and against a creature so high in mind and so lovely in form as thou art  and what now avails rant or flattery answered rebecca thou hast made thy choice between causing to be shed the blood of an innocent woman or of endangering thine own earthly state and earthly hopeswhat avails it to reckon togetherthy choice is made  no rebecca said the knight in a softer tone and drawing nearer towards her my choice is not madenay mark it is thine to make the election if i appear in the lists i must maintain my name in arms and if i do so championed or unchampioned thou diest by the stake and faggot for there lives not the knight who hath coped with me in arms on equal issue or on terms of vantage save richard coeurdelion and his minion of ivanhoe ivanhoe as thou well knowest is unable to bear his corslet and richard is in a foreign prison if i appear then thou diest even although thy charms should instigate some hotheaded youth to enter the lists in thy defence  and what avails repeating this so often said rebecca  much replied the templar for thou must learn to look at thy fate on every side  well then turn the tapestry said the jewess and let me see the other side  if i appear said boisguilbert in the fatal lists thou diest by a slow and cruel death in pain such as they say is destined to the guilty hereafter but if i appear not then am i a degraded and dishonoured knight accused of witchcraft and of communion with infidelsthe illustrious name which has grown yet more so under my wearing becomes a hissing and a reproach i lose fame i lose honour i lose the prospect of such greatness as scarce emperors attain toi sacrifice mighty ambition i destroy schemes built as high as the mountains with which heathens say their heaven was once nearly scaledand yet rebecca he added throwing himself at her feet this greatness will i sacrifice this fame will i renounce this power will i forego even now when it is half within my grasp if thou wilt say boisguilbert i receive thee for my lover  think not of such foolishness sir knight answered rebecca but hasten to the regent the queen mother and to prince johnthey cannot in honour to the english crown allow of the proceedings of your grand master so shall you give me protection without sacrifice on your part or the pretext of requiring any requital from me  with these i deal not he continued holding the train of her robeit is thee only i address and what can counterbalance thy choice bethink thee were i a fiend yet death is a worse and it is death who is my rival  i weigh not these evils said rebecca afraid to provoke the wild knight yet equally determined neither to endure his passion nor even feign to endure it be a man be a christian if indeed thy faith recommends that mercy which rather your tongues than your actions pretend save me from this dreadful death without seeking a requital which would change thy magnanimity into base barter  no damsel said the proud templar springing up thou shalt not thus impose on meif i renounce present fame and future ambition i renounce it for thy sake and we will escape in company listen to me rebecca he said again softening his tone englandeuropeis not the world there are spheres in which we may act ample enough even for my ambition we will go to palestine where conrade marquis of montserrat is my frienda friend free as myself from the doting scruples which fetter our freeborn reasonrather with saladin will we league ourselves than endure the scorn of the bigots whom we contemni will form new paths to greatness he continued again traversing the room with hasty strideseurope shall hear the loud step of him she has driven from her sonsnot the millions whom her crusaders send to slaughter can do so much to defend palestinenot the sabres of the thousands and ten thousands of saracens can hew their way so deep into that land for which nations are striving as the strength and policy of me and those brethren who in despite of yonder old bigot will adhere to me in good and evil thou shalt be a queen rebeccaon mount carmel shall we pitch the throne which my valour will gain for you and i will exchange my longdesired batoon for a sceptre  a dream said rebecca an empty vision of the night which were it a waking reality affects me not enough that the power which thou mightest acquire i will never share nor hold i so light

daughter of another peopleput not a price on my deliverance sir knightsell not a deed of generosityprotect the oppressed for the sake of charity and not for a selfish advantagego to the throne of england richard will listen to my appeal from these cruel men  never rebecca said the templar fiercely if i renounce my order for thee alone will i renounce itambition shall remain mine if thou refuse my love i will not be fooled on all handsstoop my crest to richardask a boon of that heart of pridenever rebecca will i place the order of the temple at his feet in my person i may forsake the order i never will degrade or betray it  now god be gracious to me said rebecca for the succour of man is wellnigh hopeless  it is indeed said the templar for proud as thou art thou hast in me found thy match if i enter the lists with my spear in rest think not any human consideration shall prevent my putting forth my strength and think then upon thine own fateto die the dreadful death of the worst of criminalsto be consumed upon a blazing piledispersed to the elements of which our strange forms are so mystically composednot a relic left of that graceful frame from which we could say this lived and movedrebecca it is not in woman to sustain this prospectthou wilt yield to my suit  boisguilbert answered the jewess thou knowest not the heart of woman or hast only conversed with those who are lost to her best feelings i tell thee proud templar that not in thy fiercest battles hast thou displayed more of thy vaunted courage than has been shown by woman when called upon to suffer by affection or duty i am myself a woman tenderly nurtured naturally fearful of danger and impatient of painyet when we enter those fatal lists thou to fight and i to suffer i feel the strong assurance within me that my courage shall mount higher than thine farewelli waste no more words on thee the time that remains on earth to the daughter of jacob must be otherwise spentshe must seek the comforter who may hide his face from his people but who ever opens his ear to the cry of those who seek him in sincerity and in truth  we part then thus said the templar after a short pause would to heaven that we had never met or that thou hadst been noble in birth and christian in faithnay by heaven when i gaze on thee and think when and how we are next to meet i could even wish myself one of thine own degraded nation my hand conversant with ingots and shekels instead of spear and shield my head bent down before each petty noble and my look only terrible to the shivering and bankrupt debtorthis could i wish rebecca to be near to thee in life and to escape the fearful share i must have in thy death  thou hast spoken the jew said rebecca as the persecution of such as thou art has made him heaven in ire has driven him from his country but industry has opened to him the only road to power and to influence which oppression has left unbarred read the ancient history of the people of god and tell me if those by whom jehovah wrought such marvels among the nations were then a people of misers and of usurersand know proud knight we number names amongst us to which your boasted northern nobility is as the gourd compared with the cedarnames that ascend far back to those high times when the divine presence shook the mercyseat between the cherubim and which derive their splendour from no earthly prince but from the awful voice which bade their fathers be nearest of the congregation to the visionsuch were the princes of the house of jacob  rebeccas colour rose as she boasted the ancient glories of her race but faded as she added with at sigh such were the princes of judah now such no morethey are trampled down like the shorn grass and mixed with the mire of the ways yet are there those among them who shame not such high descent and of such shall be the daughter of isaac the son of adonikam farewelli envy not thy bloodwon honoursi envy not thy barbarous descent from northern heathensi envy thee not thy faith which is ever in thy mouth but never in thy heart nor in thy practice  there is a spell on me by heaven said boisguilbert i almost think yon besotted skeleton spoke truth and that the reluctance with which i part from thee hath something in it more than is naturalfair creature he said approaching near her but with great respectso young so beautiful so fearless of death and yet doomed to die and with infamy and agony who would not weep for theethe tear that has been a stranger to these eyelids for twenty years moistens them as i gaze on thee but it must benothing may now save thy life thou and i are but the blind instruments of some irresistible fatality that hurries us along like goodly vessels driving before the storm which are dashed against each other and so perish forgive me then and let us part at least as friends part i have assailed thy resolution in vain and mine own is fixed as the adamantine decrees of fate  thus said rebecca do men throw on fate the issue of their own wild passions but i do forgive thee boisguilbert though the author of my early death there are noble things which cross over thy powerful mind but it is the garden of the sluggard and the weeds have rushed up and conspired to choke the fair and wholesome blossom  yes said the templar i am rebecca as thou hast spoken me untaught untamedand proud that amidst a shoal of empty fools and crafty bigots i have retained the preeminent fortitude that places me above them i have been a child of battle from my youth upward high in my views steady and inflexible in pursuing them such must i remainproud inflexible and unchanging and of this the world shall have proofbut thou forgivest me rebecca  as freely as ever victim forgave her executioner  farewell then said the templar and left the apartment  the preceptor albert waited impatiently in an adjacent chamber the return of boisguilbert  thou hast tarried long he said i have been as if stretched on redhot iron with very impatience what if the grand master or his spy conrade had come hither i had paid dear for my complaisancebut what ails thee brotherthy step totters thy brow is as black as night art thou well boisguilbert  ay answered the templar as well as the wretch who is doomed to die within an hournay by the rood not half so wellfor there be those in such state who can lay down life like a castoff garment by heaven malvoisin yonder girl hath wellnigh unmanned me i am half resolved to go to the grand master abjure the order to his very teeth and refuse to act the brutality which his tyranny has imposed on me  thou art mad answered malvoisin thou mayst thus indeed utterly ruin thyself but canst not even find a chance thereby to save the life of this jewess which seems so precious in thine eyes beaumanoir will name another of the order to defend his judgment in thy place and the accused will as assuredly perish as if thou hadst taken the duty imposed on thee  tis falsei will myself take arms in her behalf answered the templar haughtily and should i do so i think malvoisin that thou knowest not one of the order who will keep his saddle before the point of my lance  ay but thou forgettest said the wily adviser thou wilt have neither leisure nor opportunity to execute this mad project go to lucas beaumanoir and say thou hast renounced thy vow of obedience and see how long the despotic old man will leave thee in personal freedom the words shall scarce have left thy lips ere thou wilt either be an hundred feet under ground in the dungeon of the preceptory to abide trial as a recreant knight or if his opinion holds concerning thy possession thou wilt be enjoying straw darkness and chains in some distant convent cell stunned with exorcisms and drenched with holy water to expel the foul fiend which hath obtained dominion over thee thou must to the lists brian or thou art a lost and dishonoured man  i will break forth and fly said boisguilbertfly to some distant land to which folly and fanaticism have not yet found their way no drop of the blood of this most excellent creature shall be spilled by my sanction  thou canst not fly said the preceptor thy ravings have excited suspicion and thou wilt not be permitted to leave the preceptory go and make the essaypresent thyself before the gate and command the bridge to be lowered and mark what answer thou shalt receivethou are surprised and offended but is it not the better for thee wert thou to fly what would ensue but the reversal of thy arms the dishonour of thine ancestry the degradation of thy rankthink on it where shall thine old companions in arms hide their heads when brian de boisguilbert the best lance of the templars is proclaimed recreant amid the hisses of the assembled people what grief will be at the court of france with what joy will the haughty richard hear the news that the knight that set him hard in palestine and wellnigh darkened his renown has lost fame and honour for a jewish girl whom he could not even save by so costly a sacrifice  malvoisin said the knight i thank theethou hast touched the string at which my heart most readily thrillscome of it what may recreant shall never be added to the name of boisguilbert would to god richard or any of his vaunting minions of england would appear in these lists but they will be emptyno one will risk to break a lance for the innocent the forlorn  the better for thee if it prove so said the preceptor if no champion appears it is not by thy means that this unlucky damsel shall die but by the doom of the grand master with whom rests all the blame and who will count that blame for praise and commendation  true said boisguilbert if no champion appears i am but a part of the pageant sitting indeed on horseback in the lists but having no part in what is to follow  none whatever said malvoisin no more than the armed image of saint george when it makes part of a procession  well i will resume my resolution replied the haughty templar she has despised merepulsed mereviled meand wherefore should i offer up for her whatever of estimation i have in the opinion of others malvoisin i will appear in the lists  he left the apartment hastily as he uttered these words and the preceptor followed to watch and confirm him in his resolution for in boisguilberts fame he had himself a strong interest expecting much advantage from his being one day at the head of the order not to mention the preferment of which montfitchet had given him hopes on condition he would forward the condemnation of the unfortunate rebecca yet although in combating his friends better feelings he possessed all the advantage which a wily composed selfish disposition has over a man agitated by strong and contending passions it required all malvoisins art to keep boisguilbert steady to the purpose he had prevailed on him to adopt he was obliged to watch him closely to prevent his resuming his purpose of flight to intercept his communication with the grand master lest he should come to an open rupture with his superior and to renew from time to time the various arguments by which he endeavoured to show that in appearing as champion on this occasion boisguilbert without either accelerating or ensuring the fate of rebecca would follow the only course by which he could save himself from degradation and disgrace     chapter xl       shadows avauntrichards himself again      richard iii  when the black knightfor it becomes necessary to resume the train of his adventuresleft the trystingtree of the generous outlaw he held his way straight to a neighbouring religious house of small extent and revenue called the priory of saint botolph to which the wounded ivanhoe had been removed when the castle was taken under the guidance of the faithful gurth and the magnanimous wamba it is unnecessary at present to mention what took place in the interim betwixt wilfred and his deliverer suffice it to say that after long and grave communication messengers were dispatched by the prior in several directions and that on the succeeding morning the black knight was about to set forth on his journey accompanied by the jester wamba who attended as his guide  we will meet he said to ivanhoe at coningsburgh the castle of the deceased athelstane since there thy father cedric holds the funeral feast for his noble relation i would see your saxon kindred together sir wilfred and become better acquainted with them than heretofore thou also wilt meet me and it shall be my task to reconcile thee to thy father  so saying he took an affectionate farewell of ivanhoe who expressed an anxious desire to attend upon his deliverer but the black knight would not listen to the proposal  rest this day thou wilt have scarce strength enough to travel on the next i will have no guide with me but honest wamba who can play priest or fool as i shall be most in the humour  and i said wamba will attend you with all my heart i would fain see the feasting at the funeral of athelstane for if it be not full and frequent he will rise from the dead to rebuke cook sewer and cupbearer and that were a sight worth seeing always sir knight i will trust your valour with making my excuse to my master cedric in case mine own wit should fail  and how should my poor valour succeed sir jester when thy light wit haltsresolve me that  wit sir knight replied the jester may do much he is a quick apprehensive knave who sees his neighbours blind side and knows how to keep the leegage when his passions are blowing high but valour is a sturdy fellow that makes all split he rows against both wind and tide and makes way notwithstanding and therefore good sir knight while i take advantage of the fair weather in our noble masters temper i will expect you to bestir yourself when it grows rough  sir knight of the fetterlock since it is your pleasure so to be distinguished said ivanhoe i fear me you have chosen a talkative and a troublesome fool to be your guide but he knows every path and alley in the woods as well as eer a hunter who frequents them and the poor knave as thou hast partly seen is as faithful as steel  nay said the knight an he have the gift of showing my road i shall not grumble with him that he desires to make it pleasantfare thee well kind wilfredi charge thee not to attempt to travel till tomorrow at earliest  so saying he extended his hand to ivanhoe who pressed it to his lips took leave of the prior mounted his horse and departed with wamba for his companion ivanhoe followed them with his eyes until they were lost in the shades of the surrounding forest and then returned into the convent  but shortly after matinsong he requested to see the prior the old man came in haste and enquired anxiously after the state of his health  it is better he said than my fondest hope could have anticipated either my wound has been slighter than the effusion of blood led me to suppose or this balsam hath wrought a wonderful cure upon it i feel already as if i could bear my corslet and so much the better for thoughts pass in my mind which render me unwilling to remain here longer in inactivity  now the saints forbid said the prior that the son of the saxon cedric should leave our convent ere his wounds were healed it were shame to our profession were we to suffer it  nor would i desire to leave your hospitable roof venerable father said ivanhoe did i not feel myself able to endure the journey and compelled to undertake it  and what can have urged you to so sudden a departure said the prior  have you never holy father answered the knight felt an apprehension of approaching evil for which you in vain attempted to assign a causehave you never found your mind darkened like the sunny landscape by the sudden cloud which augurs a coming tempestand thinkest thou not that such impulses are deserving of attention as being the hints of our guardian spirits that danger is impending  i may not deny said the prior crossing himself that such things have been and have been of heaven but then such communications have had a visibly useful scope and tendency but thou wounded as thou art what avails it thou shouldst follow the steps of him whom thou couldst not aid were he to be assaulted  prior said ivanhoe thou dost mistakei am stout enough to exchange buffets with any who will challenge me to such a trafficbut were it otherwise may i not aid him were he in danger by other means than by force of arms it is but too well known that the saxons love not the norman race and who knows what may be the issue if he break in upon them when their hearts are irritated by the death of athelstane and their heads heated by the carousal in which they will indulge themselves i hold his entrance among them at such a moment most perilous and i am resolved to share or avert the danger which that i may the better do i would crave of thee the use of some palfrey whose pace may be softer than that of my destrier 56  surely said the worthy churchman you shall have mine own ambling jennet and i would it ambled as easy for your sake as that of the abbot of saint albans yet this will i say for malkin for so i call her that unless you were to borrow a ride on the jugglers steed that paces a hornpipe amongst the eggs you could not go a journey on a creature so gentle and smoothpaced i have composed many a homily on her back to the edification of my brethren of the convent and many poor christian souls  i pray you reverend father said ivanhoe let malkin be got ready instantly and bid gurth attend me with mine arms  nay but fair sir said the prior i pray you to remember that malkin hath as little skill in arms as her master and that i warrant not her enduring the sight or weight of your full panoply o malkin i promise you is a beast of judgment and will contend against any undue weighti did but borrow the fructus temporum from the priest of saint bees and i promise you she would not stir from the gate until i had exchanged the huge volume for my little breviary  trust me holy father said ivanhoe i will not distress her with too much weight and if she calls a combat with me it is odds but she has the worst  this reply was made while gurth was buckling on the knights heels a pair of large gilded spurs capable of convincing any restive horse that his best safety lay in being conformable to the will of his rider  the deep and sharp rowels with which ivanhoes heels were now armed began to make the worthy prior repent of his courtesy and ejaculatenay but fair sir now i bethink me my malkin abideth not the spurbetter it were that you tarry for the mare of our manciple down at the grange which may be had in little more than an hour and cannot but be tractable in respect that she draweth much of our winter firewood and eateth no corn  i thank you reverend father but will abide by your first offer as i see malkin is already led forth to the gate gurth shall carry mine armour and for the rest rely on it that as i will not overload malkins back she shall not overcome my patience and now farewell  ivanhoe now descended the stairs more hastily and easily than his wound promised and threw himself upon the jennet eager to escape the importunity of the prior who stuck as closely to his side as his age and fatness would permit now singing the praises of malkin now recommending caution to the knight in managing her  she is at the most dangerous period for maidens as well as mares said the old man laughing at his own jest being barely in her fifteenth year  ivanhoe who had other web to weave than to stand canvassing a palfreys paces with its owner lent but a deaf ear to the priors grave advices and facetious jests and having leapt on his mare and commanded his squire for such gurth now called himself to keep close by his side he followed the track of the black knight into the forest while the prior stood at the gate of the convent looking after him and ejaculatingsaint mary how prompt and fiery be these men of war i would i had not trusted malkin to his keeping for crippled as i am with the cold rheum i am undone if aught but good befalls her and yet said he recollecting himself as i would not spare my own old and disabled limbs in the good cause of old england so malkin must een run her hazard on the same venture and it may be they will think our poor house worthy of some munificent guerdonor it may be they will send the old prior a pacing nag and if they do none of these as great men will forget little mens service truly i shall hold me well repaid in having done that which is right and it is now wellnigh the fitting time to summon the brethren to breakfast in the refectoryah i doubt they obey that call more cheerily than the bells for primes and matins  so the prior of saint botolphs hobbled back again into the refectory to preside over the stockfish and ale which was just serving out for the friars breakfast busy and important he sat him down at the table and many a dark word he threw out of benefits to be expected to the convent and high deeds of service done by himself which at another season would have attracted observation but as the stockfish was highly salted and the ale reasonably powerful the jaws of the brethren were too anxiously employed to admit of their making much use of their ears nor do we read of any of the fraternity who was tempted to speculate upon the mysterious hints of their superior except father diggory who was severely afflicted by the toothache so that he could only eat on one side of his jaws  in the meantime the black champion and his guide were pacing at their leisure through the recesses of the forest the good knight whiles humming to himself the lay of some enamoured troubadour sometimes encouraging by questions the prating disposition of his attendant so that their dialogue formed a whimsical mixture of song and jest of which we would fain give our readers some idea you are then to imagine this knight such as we have already described him strong of person tall broadshouldered and large of bone mounted on his mighty black charger which seemed made on purpose to bear his weight so easily he paced forward under it having the visor of his helmet raised in order to admit freedom of breath yet keeping the beaver or under part closed so that his features could be but imperfectly distinguished but his ruddy embrowned cheekbones could be plainly seen and the large and bright blue eyes that flashed from under the dark shade of the raised visor and the whole gesture and look of the champion expressed careless gaiety and fearless confidencea mind which was unapt to apprehend danger and prompt to defy it when most imminentyet with whom danger was a familiar thought as with one whose trade was war and adventure  the jester wore his usual fantastic habit but late accidents had led him to adopt a good cutting falchion instead of his wooden sword with a targe to match it of both which weapons he had notwithstanding his profession shown himself a skilful master during the storming of torquilstone indeed the infirmity of wambas brain consisted chiefly in a kind of impatient irritability which suffered him not long to remain quiet in any posture or adhere to any certain train of ideas although he was for a few minutes alert enough in performing any immediate task or in apprehending any immediate topic on horseback therefore he was perpetually swinging himself backwards and forwards now on the horses ears then anon on the very rump of the animalnow hanging both his legs on one side and now sitting with his face to the tail moping mowing and making a thousand apish gestures until his palfrey took his freaks so much to heart as fairly to lay him at his length on the green grassan incident which greatly amused the knight but compelled his companion to ride more steadily thereafter  at the point of their journey at which we take them up this joyous pair were engaged in singing a virelai as it was called in which the clown bore a mellow burden to the better instructed knight of the fetterlock and thus run the ditty       annamarie love up is the sun      annamarie love morn is begun      mists are dispersing love birds singing free      up in the morning love annamarie      annamarie love up in the morn      the hunter is winding blithe sounds on his horn      the echo rings merry from rock and from tree      tis time to arouse thee love annamarie  wamba       o tybalt love tybalt awake me not yet      around my soft pillow while softer dreams flit      for what are the joys that in waking we prove      compared with these visions o tybalt my love      let the birds to the rise of the mist carol shrill      let the hunter blow out his loud horn on the hill      softer sounds softer pleasures in slumber i prove      but think not i dreamt of thee tybalt my love  a dainty song said wamba when they had finished their carol and i swear by my bauble a pretty morali used to sing it with gurth once my playfellow and now by the grace of god and his master no less than a freemen and we once came by the cudgel for being so entranced by the melody that we lay in bed two hours after sunrise singing the ditty betwixt sleeping and wakingmy bones ache at thinking of the tune ever since nevertheless i have played the part of annamarie to please you fair sir  the jester next struck into another carol a sort of comic ditty to which the knight catching up the tune replied in the like manner  knight and wamba       there came three merry men from south west and north      ever more sing the roundelay      to win the widow of wycombe forth      and where was the widow might say them nay       the first was a knight and from tynedale he came      ever more sing the roundelay      and his fathers god save us were men of great fame      and where was the widow might say him nay       of his father the laird of his uncle the squire      he boasted in rhyme and in roundelay      she bade him go bask by his seacoal fire      for she was the widow would say him nay  wamba       the next that came forth swore by blood and by nails      merrily sing the roundelay      hurs a gentleman god wot and hurs lineage was of wales      and where was the widow might say him nay       sir david ap morgan ap griffith ap hugh      ap tudor ap rhice quoth his roundelay      she said that one widow for so many was too few      and she bade the welshman wend his way       but then next came a yeoman a yeoman of kent      jollily singing his roundelay      he spoke to the widow of living and rent      and where was the widow could say him nay  both       so the knight and the squire were both left in the mire      there for to sing their roundelay      for a yeoman of kent with his yearly rent      there never was a widow could say him nay  i would wamba said the knight that our host of the trystingtree or the jolly friar his chaplain heard this thy ditty in praise of our bluff yeoman  so would not i said wambabut for the horn that hangs at your baldric  ay said the knightthis is a pledge of locksleys goodwill though i am not like to need it three mots on this bugle will i am assured bring round at our need a jolly band of yonder honest yeomen  i would say heaven forefend said the jester were it not that that fair gift is a pledge they would let us pass peaceably  why what meanest thou said the knight thinkest thou that but for this pledge of fellowship they would assault us  nay for me i say nothing said wamba for green trees have ears as well as stone walls but canst thou construe me this sir knightwhen is thy winepitcher and thy purse better empty than full  why never i think replied the knight  thou never deservest to have a full one in thy hand for so simple an answer thou hadst best empty thy pitcher ere thou pass it to a saxon and leave thy money at home ere thou walk in the greenwood  you hold our friends for robbers then said the knight of the fetterlock  you hear me not say so fair sir said wamba it may relieve a mans steed to take of his mail when he hath a long journey to make and certes it may do good to the riders soul to ease him of that which is the root of evil therefore will i give no hard names to those who do such services only i would wish my mail at home and my purse in my chamber when i meet with these good fellows because it might save them some trouble  we are bound to pray for them my friend notwithstanding the fair character thou dost afford them  pray for them with all my heart said wamba but in the town not in the greenwood like the abbot of saint bees whom they caused to say mass with an old hollow oaktree for his stall  say as thou list wamba replied the knight these yeomen did thy master cedric yeomanly service at torquilstone  ay truly answered wamba but that was in the fashion of their trade with heaven  their trade wamba how mean you by that replied his companion  marry thus said the jester they make up a balanced account with heaven as our old cellarer used to call his ciphering as fair as isaac the jew keeps with his debtors and like him give out a very little and take large credit for doing so reckoning doubtless on their own behalf the sevenfold usury which the blessed text hath promised to charitable loans  give me an example of your meaning wambai know nothing of ciphers or rates of usage answered the knight  why said wamba an your valour be so dull you will please to learn that those honest fellows balance a good deed with one not quite so laudable as a crown given to a begging friar with an hundred byzants taken from a fat abbot or a wench kissed in the greenwood with the relief of a poor widow  which of these was the good deed which was the felony interrupted the knight  a good gibe a good gibe said wamba keeping witty company sharpeneth the apprehension you said nothing so well sir knight i will be sworn when you held drunken vespers with the bluff hermitbut to go on the merrymen of the forest set off the building of a cottage with the burning of a castlethe thatching of a choir against the robbing of a churchthe setting free a poor prisoner against the murder of a proud sheriff or to come nearer to our point the deliverance of a saxon franklin against the burning alive of a norman baron gentle thieves they are in short and courteous robbers but it is ever the luckiest to meet with them when they are at the worst  how so wamba said the knight  why then they have some compunction and are for making up matters with heaven but when they have struck an even balance heaven help them with whom they next open the account the travellers who first met them after their good service at torquilstone would have a woeful flayingand yet said wamba coming close up to the knights side there be companions who are far more dangerous for travellers to meet than yonder outlaws  and who may they be for you have neither bears nor wolves i trow said the knight  marry sir but we have malvoisins menatarms said wamba and let me tell you that in time of civil war a halfscore of these is worth a band of wolves at any time they are now expecting their harvest and are reinforced with the soldiers that escaped from torquilstone so that should we meet with a band of them we are like to pay for our feats of armsnow i pray you sir knight what would you do if we met two of them  pin the villains to the earth with my lance wamba if they offered us any impediment  but what if there were four of them  they should drink of the same cup answered the knight  what if six continued wamba and we as we now are barely twowould you not remember locksleys horn  what sound for aid exclaimed the knight against a score of such rascaille as these whom one good knight could drive before him as the wind drives the withered leaves  nay then said wamba i will pray you for a close sight of that same horn that hath so powerful a breath  the knight undid the clasp of the baldric and indulged his fellowtraveller who immediately hung the bugle round his own neck  tralirala said he whistling the notes nay i know my gamut as well as another  how mean you knave said the knight restore me the bugle  content you sir knight it is in safe keeping when valour and folly travel folly should bear the horn because she can blow the best  nay but rogue said the black knight this exceedeth thy licensebeware ye tamper not with my patience  urge me not with violence sir knight said the jester keeping at a distance from the impatient champion or folly will show a clean pair of heels and leave valour to find out his way through the wood as best he may  nay thou hast hit me there said the knight and sooth to say i have little time to jangle with thee keep the horn an thou wilt but let us proceed on our journey  you will not harm me then said wamba  i tell thee no thou knave  ay but pledge me your knightly word for it continued wamba as he approached with great caution  my knightly word i pledge only come on with thy foolish self  nay then valour and folly are once more boon companions said the jester coming up frankly to the knights side but in truth i love not such buffets as that you bestowed on the burly friar when his holiness rolled on the green like a king of the ninepins and now that folly wears the horn let valour rouse himself and shake his mane for if i mistake not there are company in yonder brake that are on the lookout for us  what makes thee judge so said the knight  because i have twice or thrice noticed the glance of a motion from amongst the green leaves had they been honest men they had kept the path but yonder thicket is a choice chapel for the clerks of saint nicholas  by my faith said the knight closing his visor i think thou best in the right ont  and in good time did he close it for three arrows flew at the same instant from the suspected spot against his head and breast one of which would have penetrated to the brain had it not been turned aside by the steel visor the other two were averted by the gorget and by the shield which hung around his neck  thanks trusty armourers said the knightwamba let us close with themand he rode straight to the thicket he was met by six or seven menatarms who ran against him with their lances at full career three of the weapons struck against him and splintered with as little effect as if they had been driven against a tower of steel the black knights eyes seemed to flash fire even through the aperture of his visor he raised himself in his stirrups with an air of inexpressible dignity and exclaimed what means this my mastersthe men made no other reply than by drawing their swords and attacking him on every side crying die tyrant  ha saint edward ha saint george said the black knight striking down a man at every invocation have we traitors here  his opponents desperate as they were bore back from an arm which carried death in every blow and it seemed as if the terror of his single strength was about to gain the battle against such odds when a knight in blue armour who had hitherto kept himself behind the other assailants spurred forward with his lance and taking aim not at the rider but at the steed wounded the noble animal mortally  that was a felon stroke exclaimed the black knight as the steed fell to the earth bearing his rider along with him  and at this moment wamba winded the bugle for the whole had passed so speedily that he had not time to do so sooner the sudden sound made the murderers bear back once more and wamba though so imperfectly weaponed did not hesitate to rush in and assist the black knight to rise  shame on ye false cowards exclaimed he in the blue harness who seemed to lead the assailants do ye fly from the empty blast of a horn blown by a jester  animated by his words they attacked the black knight anew whose best refuge was now to place his back against an oak and defend himself with his sword the felon knight who had taken another spear watching the moment when his formidable antagonist was most closely pressed galloped against him in hopes to nail him with his lance against the tree when his purpose was again intercepted by wamba the jester making up by agility the want of strength and little noticed by the menatarms who were busied in their more important object hovered on the skirts of the fight and effectually checked the fatal career of the blue knight by hamstringing his horse with a stroke of his sword horse and man went to the ground yet the situation of the knight of the fetterlock continued very precarious as he was pressed close by several men completely armed and began to be fatigued by the violent exertions necessary to defend himself on so many points at nearly the same moment when a greygoose shaft suddenly stretched on the earth one of the most formidable of his assailants and a band of yeomen broke forth from the glade headed by locksley and the jovial friar who taking ready and effectual part in the fray soon disposed of the ruffians all of whom lay on the spot dead or mortally wounded the black knight thanked his deliverers with a dignity they had not observed in his former bearing which hitherto had seemed rather that of a blunt bold soldier than of a person of exalted rank  it concerns me much he said even before i express my full gratitude to my ready friends to discover if i may who have been my unprovoked enemiesopen the visor of that blue knight wamba who seems the chief of these villains  the jester instantly made up to the leader of the assassins who bruised by his fall and entangled under the wounded steed lay incapable either of flight or resistance  come valiant sir said wamba i must be your armourer as well as your equerryi have dismounted you and now i will unhelm you  so saying with no very gentle hand he undid the helmet of the blue knight which rolling to a distance on the grass displayed to the knight of the fetterlock grizzled locks and a countenance he did not expect to have seen under such circumstances  waldemar fitzurse he said in astonishment what could urge one of thy rank and seeming worth to so foul an undertaking  richard said the captive knight looking up to him thou knowest little of mankind if thou knowest not to what ambition and revenge can lead every child of adam  revenge answered the black knight i never wronged theeon me thou hast nought to revenge  my daughter richard whose alliance thou didst scornwas that no injury to a norman whose blood is noble as thine own  thy daughter replied the black knight a proper cause of enmity and followed up to a bloody issuestand back my masters i would speak to him aloneand now waldemar fitzurse say me the truthconfess who set thee on this traitorous deed  thy fathers son answered waldemar who in so doing did but avenge on thee thy disobedience to thy father  richards eyes sparkled with indignation but his better nature overcame it he pressed his hand against his brow and remained an instant gazing on the face of the humbled baron in whose features pride was contending with shame  thou dost not ask thy life waldemar said the king  he that is in the lions clutch answered fitzurse knows it were needless  take it then unasked said richard the lion preys not on prostrate carcassestake thy life but with this condition that in three days thou shalt leave england and go to hide thine infamy in thy norman castle and that thou wilt never mention the name of john of anjou as connected with thy felony if thou art found on english ground after the space i have allotted thee thou diestor if thou breathest aught that can attaint the honour of my house by saint george not the altar itself shall be a sanctuary i will hang thee out to feed the ravens from the very pinnacle of thine own castlelet this knight have a steed locksley for i see your yeomen have caught those which were running loose and let him depart unharmed  but that i judge i listen to a voice whose behests must not be disputed answered the yeoman i would send a shaft after the skulking villain that should spare him the labour of a long journey  thou bearest an english heart locksley said the black knight and well dost judge thou art the more bound to obey my behesti am richard of england  at these words pronounced in a tone of majesty suited to the high rank and no less distinguished character of coeurdelion the yeomen at once kneeled down before him and at the same time tendered their allegiance and implored pardon for their offences  rise my friends said richard in a gracious tone looking on them with a countenance in which his habitual goodhumour had already conquered the blaze of hasty resentment and whose features retained no mark of the late desperate conflict excepting the flush arising from exertionarise he said my friendsyour misdemeanours whether in forest or field have been atoned by the loyal services you rendered my distressed subjects before the walls of torquilstone and the rescue you have this day afforded to your sovereign arise my liegemen and be good subjects in futureand thou brave locksley  call me no longer locksley my liege but know me under the name which i fear fame hath blown too widely not to have reached even your royal earsi am robin hood of sherwood forest 561  king of outlaws and prince of good fellows said the king who hath not heard a name that has been borne as far as palestine but be assured brave outlaw that no deed done in our absence and in the turbulent times to which it hath given rise shall be remembered to thy disadvantage  true says the proverb said wamba interposing his word but with some abatement of his usual petulance  when the cat is away the mice will play  what wamba art thou there said richard i have been so long of hearing thy voice i thought thou hadst taken flight  i take flight said wamba when do you ever find folly separated from valour there lies the trophy of my sword that good grey gelding whom i heartily wish upon his legs again conditioning his master lay there houghed in his place it is true i gave a little ground at first for a motley jacket does not brook lanceheads as a steel doublet will but if i fought not at swords point you will grant me that i sounded the onset  and to good purpose honest wamba replied the king thy good service shall not be forgotten  confiteor confiteorexclaimed in a submissive tone a voice near the kings sidemy latin will carry me no fartherbut i confess my deadly treason and pray leave to have absolution before i am led to execution  richard looked around and beheld the jovial friar on his knees telling his rosary while his quarterstaff which had not been idle during the skirmish lay on the grass beside him his countenance was gathered so as he thought might best express the most profound contrition his eyes being turned up and the corners of his mouth drawn down as wamba expressed it like the tassels at the mouth of a purse yet this demure affectation of extreme penitence was whimsically belied by a ludicrous meaning which lurked in his huge features and seemed to pronounce his fear and repentance alike hypocritical  for what art thou cast down mad priest said richard art thou afraid thy diocesan should learn how truly thou dost serve our lady and saint dunstantush man fear it not richard of england betrays no secrets that pass over the flagon  nay most gracious sovereign answered the hermit well known to the curious in pennyhistories of robin hood by the name of friar tuck it is not the crosier i fear but the sceptrealas that my sacrilegious fist should ever have been applied to the ear of the lords anointed  ha ha said richard sits the wind therein truth i had forgotten the buffet though mine ear sung after it for a whole day but if the cuff was fairly given i will be judged by the good men around if it was not as well repaidor if thou thinkest i still owe thee aught and will stand forth for another counterbuff  by no means replied friar tuck i had mine own returned and with usurymay your majesty ever pay your debts as fully  if i could do so with cuffs said the king my creditors should have little reason to complain of an empty exchequer  and yet said the friar resuming his demure hypocritical countenance i know not what penance i ought to perform for that most sacrilegious blow  speak no more of it brother said the king after having stood so many cuffs from paynims and misbelievers i were void of reason to quarrel with the buffet of a clerk so holy as he of copmanhurst yet mine honest friar i think it would be best both for the church and thyself that i should procure a license to unfrock thee and retain thee as a yeoman of our guard serving in care of our person as formerly in attendance upon the altar of saint dunstan  my liege said the friar i humbly crave your pardon and you would readily grant my excuse did you but know how the sin of laziness has beset me saint dunstanmay he be gracious to usstands quiet in his niche though i should forget my orisons in killing a fat bucki stay out of my cell sometimes a night doing i wot not whatsaint dunstan never complainsa quiet master he is and a peaceful as ever was made of woodbut to be a yeoman in attendance on my sovereign the kingthe honour is great doubtlessyet if i were but to step aside to comfort a widow in one corner or to kill a deer in another it would be where is the dog priest says one who has seen the accursed tuck says another the unfrocked villain destroys more venison than half the country besides says one keeper and is hunting after every shy doe in the country quoth a secondin fine good my liege i pray you to leave me as you found me or if in aught you desire to extend your benevolence to me that i may be considered as the poor clerk of saint dunstans cell in copmanhurst to whom any small donation will be most thankfully acceptable  i understand thee said the king and the holy clerk shall have a grant of vert and venison in my woods of warncliffe mark however i will but assign thee three bucks every season but if that do not prove an apology for thy slaying thirty i am no christian knight nor true king  your grace may be well assured said the friar that with the grace of saint dunstan i shall find the way of multiplying your most bounteous gift  i nothing doubt it good brother said the king and as venison is but dry food our cellarer shall have orders to deliver to thee a butt of sack a runlet of malvoisie and three hogsheads of ale of the first strike yearlyif that will not quench thy thirst thou must come to court and become acquainted with my butler  but for saint dunstan said the friar  a cope a stole and an altarcloth shalt thou also have continued the king crossing himselfbut we may not turn our game into earnest lest god punish us for thinking more on our follies than on his honour and worship  i will answer for my patron said the priest joyously  answer for thyself friar said king richard something sternly but immediately stretching out his hand to the hermit the latter somewhat abashed bent his knee and saluted it thou dost less honour to my extended palm than to my clenched fist said the monarch thou didst only kneel to the one and to the other didst prostrate thyself  but the friar afraid perhaps of again giving offence by continuing the conversation in too jocose a stylea false step to be particularly guarded against by those who converse with monarchsbowed profoundly and fell into the rear  at the same time two additional personages appeared on the scene     chapter xli       all hail to the lordlings of high degree      who live not more happy though greater than we      our pastimes to see      under every green tree      in all the gay woodland right welcome ye be      macdonald  the new comers were wilfred of ivanhoe on the prior of botolphs palfrey and gurth who attended him on the knights own warhorse the astonishment of ivanhoe was beyond bounds when he saw his master besprinkled with blood and six or seven dead bodies lying around in the little glade in which the battle had taken place nor was he less surprised to see richard surrounded by so many silvan attendants the outlaws as they seemed to be of the forest and a perilous retinue therefore for a prince he hesitated whether to address the king as the black knighterrant or in what other manner to demean himself towards him richard saw his embarrassment  fear not wilfred he said to address richard plantagenet as himself since thou seest him in the company of true english hearts although it may be they have been urged a few steps aside by warm english blood  sir wilfred of ivanhoe said the gallant outlaw stepping forward my assurances can add nothing to those of our sovereign yet let me say somewhat proudly that of men who have suffered much he hath not truer subjects than those who now stand around him  i cannot doubt it brave man said wilfred since thou art of the numberbut what mean these marks of death and danger these slain men and the bloody armour of my prince  treason hath been with us ivanhoe said the king but thanks to these brave men treason hath met its meedbut now i bethink me thou too art a traitor said richard smiling a most disobedient traitor for were not our orders positive that thou shouldst repose thyself at saint botolphs until thy wound was healed  it is healed said ivanhoe it is not of more consequence than the scratch of a bodkin but why oh why noble prince will you thus vex the hearts of your faithful servants and expose your life by lonely journeys and rash adventures as if it were of no more value than that of a mere knighterrant who has no interest on earth but what lance and sword may procure him  and richard plantagenet said the king desires no more fame than his good lance and sword may acquire himand richard plantagenet is prouder of achieving an adventure with only his good sword and his good arm to speed than if he led to battle a host of an hundred thousand armed men  but your kingdom my liege said ivanhoe your kingdom is threatened with dissolution and civil waryour subjects menaced with every species of evil if deprived of their sovereign in some of those dangers which it is your daily pleasure to incur and from which you have but this moment narrowly escaped  ho ho my kingdom and my subjects answered richard impatiently i tell thee sir wilfred the best of them are most willing to repay my follies in kindfor example my very faithful servant wilfred of ivanhoe will not obey my positive commands and yet reads his king a homily because he does not walk exactly by his advice which of us has most reason to upbraid the otheryet forgive me my faithful wilfred the time i have spent and am yet to spend in concealment is as i explained to thee at saint botolphs necessary to give my friends and faithful nobles time to assemble their forces that when richards return is announced he should be at the head of such a force as enemies shall tremble to face and thus subdue the meditated treason without even unsheathing a sword estoteville and bohun will not be strong enough to move forward to york for twentyfour hours i must have news of salisbury from the south and of beauchamp in warwickshire and of multon and percy in the north the chancellor must make sure of london too sudden an appearance would subject me to dangers other than my lance and sword though backed by the bow of bold robin or the quarterstaff of friar tuck and the horn of the sage wamba may be able to rescue me from  wilfred bowed in submission well knowing how vain it was to contend with the wild spirit of chivalry which so often impelled his master upon dangers which he might easily have avoided or rather which it was unpardonable in him to have sought out the young knight sighed therefore and held his peace while richard rejoiced at having silenced his counsellor though his heart acknowledged the justice of the charge he had brought against him went on in conversation with robin hoodking of outlaws he said have you no refreshment to offer to your brother sovereign for these dead knaves have found me both in exercise and appetite  in troth replied the outlaw for i scorn to lie to your grace our larder is chiefly supplied with he stopped and was somewhat embarrassed  with venison i suppose said richard gaily better food at need there can be noneand truly if a king will not remain at home and slay his own game methinks he should not brawl too loud if he finds it killed to his hand  if your grace then said robin will again honour with your presence one of robin hoods places of rendezvous the venison shall not be lacking and a stoup of ale and it may be a cup of reasonably good wine to relish it withal  the outlaw accordingly led the way followed by the buxom monarch more happy probably in this chance meeting with robin hood and his foresters than he would have been in again assuming his royal state and presiding over a splendid circle of peers and nobles novelty in society and adventure were the zest of life to richard coeurdelion and it had its highest relish when enhanced by dangers encountered and surmounted in the lionhearted king the brilliant but useless character of a knight of romance was in a great measure realized and revived and the personal glory which he acquired by his own deeds of arms was far more dear to his excited imagination than that which a course of policy and wisdom would have spread around his government accordingly his reign was like the course of a brilliant and rapid meteor which shoots along the face of heaven shedding around an unnecessary and portentous light which is instantly swallowed up by universal darkness his feats of chivalry furnishing themes for bards and minstrels but affording none of those solid benefits to his country on which history loves to pause and hold up as an example to posterity but in his present company richard showed to the greatest imaginable advantage he was gay goodhumoured and fond of manhood in every rank of life  beneath a huge oaktree the silvan repast was hastily prepared for the king of england surrounded by men outlaws to his government but who now formed his court and his guard as the flagon went round the rough foresters soon lost their awe for the presence of majesty the song and the jest were exchangedthe stories of former deeds were told with advantage and at length and while boasting of their successful infraction of the laws no one recollected they were speaking in presence of their natural guardian the merry king nothing heeding his dignity any more than his company laughed quaffed and jested among the jolly band the natural and rough sense of robin hood led him to be desirous that the scene should be closed ere any thing should occur to disturb its harmony the more especially that he observed ivanhoes brow clouded with anxiety we are honoured he said to ivanhoe apart by the presence of our gallant sovereign yet i would not that he dallied with time which the circumstances of his kingdom may render precious  it is well and wisely spoken brave robin hood said wilfred apart and know moreover that they who jest with majesty even in its gayest mood are but toying with the lions whelp which on slight provocation uses both fangs and claws  you have touched the very cause of my fear said the outlaw my men are rough by practice and nature the king is hasty as well as goodhumoured nor know i how soon cause of offence may arise or how warmly it may be receivedit is time this revel were broken off  it must be by your management then gallant yeoman said ivanhoe for each hint i have essayed to give him serves only to induce him to prolong it  must i so soon risk the pardon and favour of my sovereign said robin hood pausing for all instant but by saint christopher it shall be so i were undeserving his grace did i not peril it for his goodhere scathlock get thee behind yonder thicket and wind me a norman blast on thy bugle and without an instants delay on peril of your life  scathlock obeyed his captain and in less than five minutes the revellers were startled by the sound of his horn  it is the bugle of malvoisin said the miller starting to his feet and seizing his bow the friar dropped the flagon and grasped his quarterstaff wamba stopt short in the midst of a jest and betook himself to sword and target all the others stood to their weapons  men of their precarious course of life change readily from the banquet to the battle and to richard the exchange seemed but a succession of pleasure he called for his helmet and the most cumbrous parts of his armour which he had laid aside and while gurth was putting them on he laid his strict injunctions on wilfred under pain of his highest displeasure not to engage in the skirmish which he supposed was approaching  thou hast fought for me an hundred times wilfredand i have seen it thou shalt this day look on and see how richard will fight for his friend and liegeman  in the meantime robin hood had sent off several of his followers in different directions as if to reconnoitre the enemy and when he saw the company effectually broken up he approached richard who was now completely armed and kneeling down on one knee craved pardon of his sovereign  for what good yeoman said richard somewhat impatiently have we not already granted thee a full pardon for all transgressions thinkest thou our word is a feather to be blown backward and forward between us thou canst not have had time to commit any new offence since that time  ay but i have though answered the yeoman if it be an offence to deceive my prince for his own advantage the bugle you have heard was none of malvoisins but blown by my direction to break off the banquet lest it trenched upon hours of dearer import than to be thus dallied with  he then rose from his knee folded his arm on his bosom and in a manner rather respectful than submissive awaited the answer of the kinglike one who is conscious he may have given offence yet is confident in the rectitude of his motive the blood rushed in anger to the countenance of richard but it was the first transient emotion and his sense of justice instantly subdued it  the king of sherwood he said grudges his venison and his wineflask to the king of england it is well bold robinbut when you come to see me in merry london i trust to be a less niggard host thou art right however good fellow let us therefore to horse and awaywilfred has been impatient this hour tell me bold robin hast thou never a friend in thy band who not content with advising will needs direct thy motions and look miserable when thou dost presume to act for thyself  such a one said robin is my lieutenant little john who is even now absent on an expedition as far as the borders of scotland and i will own to your majesty that i am sometimes displeased by the freedom of his councilsbut when i think twice i cannot be long angry with one who can have no motive for his anxiety save zeal for his masters service  thou art right good yeoman answered richard and if i had ivanhoe on the one hand to give grave advice and recommend it by the sad gravity of his brow and thee on the other to trick me into what thou thinkest my own good i should have as little the freedom of mine own will as any king in christendom or heathenessebut come sirs let us merrily on to coningsburgh and think no more ont  robin hood assured them that he had detached a party in the direction of the road they were to pass who would not fail to discover and apprize them of any secret ambuscade and that he had little doubt they would find the ways secure or if otherwise would receive such timely notice of the danger as would enable them to fall back on a strong troop of archers with which he himself proposed to follow on the same route  the wise and attentive precautions adopted for his safety touched richards feelings and removed any slight grudge which he might retain on account of the deception the outlaw captain had practised upon him he once more extended his hand to robin hood assured him of his full pardon and future favour as well as his firm resolution to restrain the tyrannical exercise of the forest rights and other oppressive laws by which so many english yeomen were driven into a state of rebellion but richards good intentions towards the bold outlaw were frustrated by the kings untimely death and the charter of the forest was extorted from the unwilling hands of king john when he succeeded to his heroic brother as for the rest of robin hoods career as well as the tale of his treacherous death they are to be found in those blackletter garlands once sold at the low and easy rate of one halfpenny  now cheaply purchased at their weight in gold  the outlaws opinion proved true and the king attended by ivanhoe gurth and wamba arrived without any interruption within view of the castle of coningsburgh while the sun was yet in the horizon  there are few more beautiful or striking scenes in england than are presented by the vicinity of this ancient saxon fortress the soft and gentle river don sweeps through an amphitheatre in which cultivation is richly blended with woodland and on a mount ascending from the river well defended by walls and ditches rises this ancient edifice which as its saxon name implies was previous to the conquest a royal residence of the kings of england the outer walls have probably been added by the normans but the inner keep bears token of very great antiquity it is situated on a mount at one angle of the inner court and forms a complete circle of perhaps twentyfive feet in diameter the wall is of immense thickness and is propped or defended by six huge external buttresses which project from the circle and rise up against the sides of the tower as if to strengthen or to support it these massive buttresses are solid when they arise from the foundation and a good way higher up but are hollowed out towards the top and terminate in a sort of turrets communicating with the interior of the keep itself the distant appearance of this huge building with these singular accompaniments is as interesting to the lovers of the picturesque as the interior of the castle is to the eager antiquary whose imagination it carries back to the days of the heptarchy a barrow in the vicinity of the castle is pointed out as the tomb of the memorable hengist and various monuments of great antiquity and curiosity are shown in the neighbouring churchyard 57  when coeurdelion and his retinue approached this rude yet stately building it was not as at present surrounded by external fortifications the saxon architect had exhausted his art in rendering the main keep defensible and there was no other circumvallation than a rude barrier of palisades  a huge black banner which floated from the top of the tower announced that the obsequies of the late owner were still in the act of being solemnized it bore no emblem of the deceaseds birth or quality for armorial bearings were then a novelty among the norman chivalry themselves and were totally unknown to the saxons but above the gate was another banner on which the figure of a white horse rudely painted indicated the nation and rank of the deceased by the wellknown symbol of hengist and his saxon warriors  all around the castle was a scene of busy commotion for such funeral banquets were times of general and profuse hospitality which not only every one who could claim the most distant connexion with the deceased but all passengers whatsoever were invited to partake the wealth and consequence of the deceased athelstane occasioned this custom to be observed in the fullest extent  numerous parties therefore were seen ascending and descending the hill on which the castle was situated and when the king and his attendants entered the open and unguarded gates of the external barrier the space within presented a scene not easily reconciled with the cause of the assemblage in one place cooks were toiling to roast huge oxen and fat sheep in another hogsheads of ale were set abroach to be drained at the freedom of all comers groups of every description were to be seen devouring the food and swallowing the liquor thus abandoned to their discretion the naked saxon serf was drowning the sense of his halfyears hunger and thirst in one day of gluttony and drunkennessthe more pampered burgess and guildbrother was eating his morsel with gust or curiously criticising the quantity of the malt and the skill of the brewer some few of the poorer norman gentry might also be seen distinguished by their shaven chins and short cloaks and not less so by their keeping together and looking with great scorn on the whole solemnity even while condescending to avail themselves of the good cheer which was so liberally supplied  mendicants were of course assembled by the score together with strolling soldiers returned from palestine according to their own account at least pedlars were displaying their wares travelling mechanics were enquiring after employment and wandering palmers hedgepriests saxon minstrels and welsh bards were muttering prayers and extracting mistuned dirges from their harps crowds and rotes 58  one sent forth the praises of athelstane in a doleful panegyric another in a saxon genealogical poem rehearsed the uncouth and harsh names of his noble ancestry jesters and jugglers were not awanting nor was the occasion of the assembly supposed to render the exercise of their profession indecorous or improper indeed the ideas of the saxons on these occasions were as natural as they were rude if sorrow was thirsty there was drinkif hungry there was foodif it sunk down upon and saddened the heart here were the means supplied of mirth or at least of amusement nor did the assistants scorn to avail themselves of those means of consolation although every now and then as if suddenly recollecting the cause which had brought them together the men groaned in unison while the females of whom many were present raised up their voices and shrieked for very woe  such was the scene in the castleyard at coningsburgh when it was entered by richard and his followers the seneschal or steward deigned not to take notice of the groups of inferior guests who were perpetually entering and withdrawing unless so far as was necessary to preserve order nevertheless he was struck by the good mien of the monarch and ivanhoe more especially as he imagined the features of the latter were familiar to him besides the approach of two knights for such their dress bespoke them was a rare event at a saxon solemnity and could not but be regarded as a sort of honour to the deceased and his family and in his sable dress and holding in his hand his white wand of office this important personage made way through the miscellaneous assemblage of guests thus conducting richard and ivanhoe to the entrance of the tower gurth and wamba speedily found acquaintances in the courtyard nor presumed to intrude themselves any farther until their presence should be required     chapter xlii       i found them winding of marcellos corpse      and there was such a solemn melody      twixt doleful songs tears and sad elegies      such as old grandames watching by the dead      are wont to outwear the night with      old play  the mode of entering the great tower of coningsburgh castle is very peculiar and partakes of the rude simplicity of the early times in which it was erected a flight of steps so deep and narrow as to be almost precipitous leads up to a low portal in the south side of the tower by which the adventurous antiquary may still or at least could a few years since gain access to a small stair within the thickness of the main wall of the tower which leads up to the third story of the buildingthe two lower being dungeons or vaults which neither receive air nor light save by a square hole in the third story with which they seem to have communicated by a ladder the access to the upper apartments in the tower which consist in all of four stories is given by stairs which are carried up through the external buttresses  by this difficult and complicated entrance the good king richard followed by his faithful ivanhoe was ushered into the round apartment which occupies the whole of the third story from the ground wilfred by the difficulties of the ascent gained time to muffle his face in his mantle as it had been held expedient that he should not present himself to his father until the king should give him the signal  there were assembled in this apartment around a large oaken table about a dozen of the most distinguished representatives of the saxon families in the adjacent counties they were all old or at least elderly men for the younger race to the great displeasure of the seniors had like ivanhoe broken down many of the barriers which separated for half a century the norman victors from the vanquished saxons the downcast and sorrowful looks of these venerable men their silence and their mournful posture formed a strong contrast to the levity of the revellers on the outside of the castle their grey locks and long full beards together with their antique tunics and loose black mantles suited well with the singular and rude apartment in which they were seated and gave the appearance of a band of ancient worshippers of woden recalled to life to mourn over the decay of their national glory  cedric seated in equal rank among his countrymen seemed yet by common consent to act as chief of the assembly upon the entrance of richard only known to him as the valorous knight of the fetterlock he arose gravely and gave him welcome by the ordinary salutation waes hael raising at the same time a goblet to his head the king no stranger to the customs of his english subjects returned the greeting with the appropriate words drinc hael and partook of a cup which was handed to him by the sewer the same courtesy was offered to ivanhoe who pledged his father in silence supplying the usual speech by an inclination of his head lest his voice should have been recognised  when this introductory ceremony was performed cedric arose and extending his hand to richard conducted him into a small and very rude chapel which was excavated as it were out of one of the external buttresses as there was no opening saving a little narrow loophole the place would have been nearly quite dark but for two flambeaux or torches which showed by a red and smoky light the arched roof and naked walls the rude altar of stone and the crucifix of the same material  before this altar was placed a bier and on each side of this bier kneeled three priests who told their beads and muttered their prayers with the greatest signs of external devotion for this service a splendid soulscat was paid to the convent of saint edmunds by the mother of the deceased and that it might be fully deserved the whole brethren saving the lame sacristan had transferred themselves to coningsburgh where while six of their number were constantly on guard in the performance of divine rites by the bier of athelstane the others failed not to take their share of the refreshments and amusements which went on at the castle in maintaining this pious watch and ward the good monks were particularly careful not to interrupt their hymns for an instant lest zernebock the ancient saxon apollyon should lay his clutches on the departed athelstane nor were they less careful to prevent any unhallowed layman from touching the pall which having been that used at the funeral of saint edmund was liable to be desecrated if handled by the profane if in truth these attentions could be of any use to the deceased he had some right to expect them at the hands of the brethren of saint edmunds since besides a hundred mancuses of gold paid down as the soulransom the mother of athelstane had announced her intention of endowing that foundation with the better part of the lands of the deceased in order to maintain perpetual prayers for his soul and that of her departed husband richard and wilfred followed the saxon cedric into the apartment of death where as their guide pointed with solemn air to the untimely bier of athelstane they followed his example in devoutly crossing themselves and muttering a brief prayer for the weal of the departed soul  this act of pious charity performed cedric again motioned them to follow him gliding over the stone floor with a noiseless tread and after ascending a few steps opened with great caution the door of a small oratory which adjoined to the chapel it was about eight feet square hollowed like the chapel itself out of the thickness of the wall and the loophole which enlightened it being to the west and widening considerably as it sloped inward a beam of the setting sun found its way into its dark recess and showed a female of a dignified mien and whose countenance retained the marked remains of majestic beauty her long mourning robes and her flowing wimple of black cypress enhanced the whiteness of her skin and the beauty of her lightcoloured and flowing tresses which time had neither thinned nor mingled with silver her countenance expressed the deepest sorrow that is consistent with resignation on the stone table before her stood a crucifix of ivory beside which was laid a missal having its pages richly illuminated and its boards adorned with clasps of gold and bosses of the same precious metal  noble edith said cedric after having stood a moment silent as if to give richard and wilfred time to look upon the lady of the mansion these are worthy strangers come to take a part in thy sorrows and this in especial is the valiant knight who fought so bravely for the deliverance of him for whom we this day mourn  his bravery has my thanks returned the lady although it be the will of heaven that it should be displayed in vain i thank too his courtesy and that of his companion which hath brought them hither to behold the widow of adeling the mother of athelstane in her deep hour of sorrow and lamentation to your care kind kinsman i intrust them satisfied that they will want no hospitality which these sad walls can yet afford  the guests bowed deeply to the mourning parent and withdrew from their hospitable guide  another winding stair conducted them to an apartment of the same size with that which they had first entered occupying indeed the story immediately above from this room ere yet the door was opened proceeded a low and melancholy strain of vocal music when they entered they found themselves in the presence of about twenty matrons and maidens of distinguished saxon lineage four maidens rowena leading the choir raised a hymn for the soul of the deceased of which we have only been able to decipher two or three stanzas       dust unto dust      to this all must      the tenant hath resignd      the faded form      to waste and worm      corruption claims her kind       through paths unknown      thy soul hath flown      to seek the realms of woe      where fiery pain      shall purge the stain      of actions done below       in that sad place      by marys grace      brief may thy dwelling be      till prayers and alms      and holy psalms      shall set the captive free  while this dirge was sung in a low and melancholy tone by the female choristers the others were divided into two bands of which one was engaged in bedecking with such embroidery as their skill and taste could compass a large silken pall destined to cover the bier of athelstane while the others busied themselves in selecting from baskets of flowers placed before them garlands which they intended for the same mournful purpose the behaviour of the maidens was decorous if not marked with deep affliction but now and then a whisper or a smile called forth the rebuke of the severer matrons and here and there might be seen a damsel more interested in endeavouring to find out how her mourningrobe became her than in the dismal ceremony for which they were preparing neither was this propensity if we must needs confess the truth at all diminished by the appearance of two strange knights which occasioned some looking up peeping and whispering rowena alone too proud to be vain paid her greeting to her deliverer with a graceful courtesy her demeanour was serious but not dejected and it may be doubted whether thoughts of ivanhoe and of the uncertainty of his fate did not claim as great a share in her gravity as the death of her kinsman  to cedric however who as we have observed was not remarkably clearsighted on such occasions the sorrow of his ward seemed so much deeper than any of the other maidens that he deemed it proper to whisper the explanationshe was the affianced bride of the noble athelstaneit may be doubted whether this communication went a far way to increase wilfreds disposition to sympathize with the mourners of coningsburgh  having thus formally introduced the guests to the different chambers in which the obsequies of athelstane were celebrated under different forms cedric conducted them into a small room destined as he informed them for the exclusive accomodation of honourable guests whose more slight connexion with the deceased might render them unwilling to join those who were immediately effected by the unhappy event he assured them of every accommodation and was about to withdraw when the black knight took his hand  i crave to remind you noble thane he said that when we last parted you promised for the service i had the fortune to render you to grant me a boon  it is granted ere named noble knight said cedric yet at this sad moment  of that also said the king i have bethought mebut my time is briefneither does it seem to me unfit that when closing the grave on the noble athelstane we should deposit therein certain prejudices and hasty opinions  sir knight of the fetterlock said cedric colouring and interrupting the king in his turn i trust your boon regards yourself and no other for in that which concerns the honour of my house it is scarce fitting that a stranger should mingle  nor do i wish to mingle said the king mildly unless in so far as you will admit me to have an interest as yet you have known me but as the black knight of the fetterlockknow me now as richard plantagenet  richard of anjou exclaimed cedric stepping backward with the utmost astonishment  no noble cedricrichard of englandwhose deepest interestwhose deepest wish is to see her sons united with each otherand how now worthy thane hast thou no knee for thy prince  to norman blood said cedric it hath never bended  reserve thine homage then said the monarch until i shall prove my right to it by my equal protection of normans and english  prince answered cedric i have ever done justice to thy bravery and thy worthnor am i ignorant of thy claim to the crown through thy descent from matilda niece to edgar atheling and daughter to malcolm of scotland but matilda though of the royal saxon blood was not the heir to the monarchy  i will not dispute my title with thee noble thane said richard calmly but i will bid thee look around thee and see where thou wilt find another to be put into the scale against it  and hast thou wandered hither prince to tell me so said cedricto upbraid me with the ruin of my race ere the grave has closed oer the last scion of saxon royaltyhis countenance darkened as he spokeit was boldlyit was rashly done  not so by the holy rood replied the king it was done in the frank confidence which one brave man may repose in another without a shadow of danger  thou sayest well sir kingfor king i own thou art and wilt be despite of my feeble oppositioni dare not take the only mode to prevent it though thou hast placed the strong temptation within my reach  and now to my boon said the king which i ask not with one jot the less confidence that thou hast refused to acknowledge my lawful sovereignty i require of thee as a man of thy word on pain of being held faithless mansworn and nidering 581 to forgive and receive to thy paternal affection the good knight wilfred of ivanhoe in this reconciliation thou wilt own i have an interestthe happiness of my friend and the quelling of dissension among my faithful people  and this is wilfred said cedric pointing to his son  my fathermy father said ivanhoe prostrating himself at cedrics feet grant me thy forgiveness  thou hast it my son said cedric raising him up the son of hereward knows how to keep his word even when it has been passed to a norman but let me see thee use the dress and costume of thy english ancestryno short cloaks no gay bonnets no fantastic plumage in my decent household he that would be the son of cedric must show himself of english ancestrythou art about to speak he added sternly and i guess the topic the lady rowena must complete two years mourning as for a betrothed husbandall our saxon ancestors would disown us were we to treat of a new union for her ere the grave of him she should have weddedhim so much the most worthy of her hand by birth and ancestryis yet closed the ghost of athelstane himself would burst his bloody cerements and stand before us to forbid such dishonour to his memory  it seemed as if cedrics words had raised a spectre for scarce had he uttered them ere the door flew open and athelstane arrayed in the garments of the grave stood before them pale haggard and like something arisen from the dead 59  the effect of this apparition on the persons present was utterly appalling cedric started back as far as the wall of the apartment would permit and leaning against it as one unable to support himself gazed on the figure of his friend with eyes that seemed fixed and a mouth which he appeared incapable of shutting ivanhoe crossed himself repeating prayers in saxon latin or normanfrench as they occurred to his memory while richard alternately said benedicite and swore mort de ma vie  in the meantime a horrible noise was heard below stairs some crying secure the treacherous monksothers down with them into the dungeonothers pitch them from the highest battlements  in the name of god said cedric addressing what seemed the spectre of his departed friend if thou art mortal speakif a departed spirit say for what cause thou dost revisit us or if i can do aught that can set thy spirit at reposeliving or dead noble athelstane speak to cedric  i will said the spectre very composedly when i have collected breath and when you give me timealive saidst thoui am as much alive as he can be who has fed on bread and water for three days which seem three agesyes bread and water father cedric by heaven and all saints in it better food hath not passed my weasand for three livelong days and by gods providence it is that i am now here to tell it  why noble athelstane said the black knight i myself saw you struck down by the fierce templar towards the end of the storm at torquilstone and as i thought and wamba reported your skull was cloven through the teeth  you thought amiss sir knight said athelstane and wamba lied my teeth are in good order and that my supper shall presently findno thanks to the templar though whose sword turned in his hand so that the blade struck me flatlings being averted by the handle of the good mace with which i warded the blow had my steelcap been on i had not valued it a rush and had dealt him such a counterbuff as would have spoilt his retreat but as it was down i went stunned indeed but unwounded others of both sides were beaten down and slaughtered above me so that i never recovered my senses until i found myself in a coffinan open one by good luckplaced before the altar of the church of saint edmunds i sneezed repeatedlygroanedawakened and would have arisen when the sacristan and abbot full of terror came running at the noise surprised doubtless and no way pleased to find the man alive whose heirs they had proposed themselves to be i asked for winethey gave me some but it must have been highly medicated for i slept yet more deeply than before and wakened not for many hours i found my arms swathed downmy feet tied so fast that mine ankles ache at the very remembrancethe place was utterly darkthe oubliette as i suppose of their accursed convent and from the close stifled damp smell i conceive it is also used for a place of sepulture i had strange thoughts of what had befallen me when the door of my dungeon creaked and two villain monks entered they would have persuaded me i was in purgatory but i knew too well the pursy shortbreathed voice of the father abbotsaint jeremy how different from that tone with which he used to ask me for another slice of the haunchthe dog has feasted with me from christmas to twelfthnight  have patience noble athelstane said the king take breathtell your story at leisurebeshrew me but such a tale is as well worth listening to as a romance  ay but by the rood of bromeholm there was no romance in the matter said athelstanea barley loaf and a pitcher of waterthat they gave me the niggardly traitors whom my father and i myself had enriched when their best resources were the flitches of bacon and measures of corn out of which they wheedled poor serfs and bondsmen in exchange for their prayersthe nest of foul ungrateful vipersbarley bread and ditch water to such a patron as i had been i will smoke them out of their nest though i be excommunicated  but in the name of our lady noble athelstane said cedric grasping the hand of his friend how didst thou escape this imminent dangerdid their hearts relent  did their hearts relent echoed athelstanedo rocks melt with the sun i should have been there still had not some stir in the convent which i find was their procession hitherward to eat my funeral feast when they well knew how and where i had been buried alive summoned the swarm out of their hive i heard them droning out their deathpsalms little judging they were sung in respect for my soul by those who were thus famishing my body they went however and i waited long for foodno wonderthe gouty sacristan was even too busy with his own provender to mind mine at length down he came with an unstable step and a strong flavour of wine and spices about his person good cheer had opened his heart for he left me a nook of pasty and a flask of wine instead of my former fare i ate drank and was invigorated when to add to my good luck the sacristan too totty to discharge his duty of turnkey fitly locked the door beside the staple so that it fell ajar the light the food the wine set my invention to work the staple to which my chains were fixed was more rusted than i or the villain abbot had supposed even iron could not remain without consuming in the damps of that infernal dungeon  take breath noble athelstane said richard and partake of some refreshment ere you proceed with a tale so dreadful  partake quoth athelstane i have been partaking five times todayand yet a morsel of that savoury ham were not altogether foreign to the matter and i pray you fair sir to do me reason in a cup of wine  the guests though still agape with astonishment pledged their resuscitated landlord who thus proceeded in his storyhe had indeed now many more auditors than those to whom it was commenced for edith having given certain necessary orders for arranging matters within the castle had followed the deadalive up to the strangers apartment attended by as many of the guests male and female as could squeeze into the small room while others crowding the staircase caught up an erroneous edition of the story and transmitted it still more inaccurately to those beneath who again sent it forth to the vulgar without in a fashion totally irreconcilable to the real fact athelstane however went on as follows with the history of his escape  finding myself freed from the staple i dragged myself up stairs as well as a man loaded with shackles and emaciated with fasting might and after much groping about i was at length directed by the sound of a jolly roundelay to the apartment where the worthy sacristan an it so please ye was holding a devils mass with a huge beetlebrowed broadshouldered brother of the greyfrock and cowl who looked much more like a thief than a clergyman i burst in upon them and the fashion of my graveclothes as well as the clanking of my chains made me more resemble an inhabitant of the other world than of this both stood aghast but when i knocked down the sacristan with my fist the other fellow his potcompanion fetched a blow at me with a huge quarterstaff  this must be our friar tuck for a counts ransom said richard looking at ivanhoe  he may be the devil an he will said athelstane fortunately he missed the aim and on my approaching to grapple with him took to his heels and ran for it i failed not to set my own heels at liberty by means of the fetterkey which hung amongst others at the sextons belt and i had thoughts of beating out the knaves brains with the bunch of keys but gratitude for the nook of pasty and the flask of wine which the rascal had imparted to my captivity came over my heart so with a brace of hearty kicks i left him on the floor pouched some baked meat and a leathern bottle of wine with which the two venerable brethren had been regaling went to the stable and found in a private stall mine own best palfrey which doubtless had been set apart for the holy father abbots particular use hither i came with all the speed the beast could compassman and mothers son flying before me wherever i came taking me for a spectre the more especially as to prevent my being recognised i drew the corpsehood over my face i had not gained admittance into my own castle had i not been supposed to be the attendant of a juggler who is making the people in the castleyard very merry considering they are assembled to celebrate their lords funerali say the sewer thought i was dressed to bear a part in the tregetours mummery and so i got admission and did but disclose myself to my mother and eat a hasty morsel ere i came in quest of you my noble friend  and you have found me said cedric ready to resume our brave projects of honour and liberty i tell thee never will dawn a morrow so auspicious as the next for the deliverance of the noble saxon race  talk not to me of delivering any one said athelstane it is well i am delivered myself i am more intent on punishing that villain abbot he shall hang on the top of this castle of coningsburgh in his cope and stole and if the stairs be too strait to admit his fat carcass i will have him craned up from without  but my son said edith consider his sacred office  consider my three days fast replied athelstane i will have their blood every one of them frontdeboeuf was burnt alive for a less matter for he kept a good table for his prisoners only put too much garlic in his last dish of pottage but these hypocritical ungrateful slaves so often the selfinvited flatterers at my board who gave me neither pottage nor garlic more or less they die by the soul of hengist  but the pope my noble friendsaid cedric  but the devil my noble friendanswered athelstane they die and no more of them were they the best monks upon earth the world would go on without them  for shame noble athelstane said cedric forget such wretches in the career of glory which lies open before thee tell this norman prince richard of anjou that lionhearted as he is he shall not hold undisputed the throne of alfred while a male descendant of the holy confessor lives to dispute it  how said athelstane is this the noble king richard  it is richard plantagenet himself said cedric yet i need not remind thee that coming hither a guest of freewill he may neither be injured nor detained prisonerthou well knowest thy duty to him as his host  ay by my faith said athelstane and my duty as a subject besides for i here tender him my allegiance heart and hand  my son said edith think on thy royal rights  think on the freedom of england degenerate prince said cedric  mother and friend said athelstane a truce to your upbraidingsbread and water and a dungeon are marvellous mortifiers of ambition and i rise from the tomb a wiser man than i descended into it one half of those vain follies were puffed into mine ear by that perfidious abbot wolfram and you may now judge if he is a counsellor to be trusted since these plots were set in agitation i have had nothing but hurried journeys indigestions blows and bruises imprisonments and starvation besides that they can only end in the murder of some thousands of quiet folk i tell you i will be king in my own domains and nowhere else and my first act of dominion shall be to hang the abbot  and my ward rowena said cedrici trust you intend not to desert her  father cedric said athelstane be reasonable the lady rowena cares not for meshe loves the little finger of my kinsman wilfreds glove better than my whole person there she stands to avouch itnay blush not kinswoman there is no shame in loving a courtly knight better than a country franklinand do not laugh neither rowena for graveclothes and a thin visage are god knows no matter of merrimentnay an thou wilt needs laugh i will find thee a better jestgive me thy hand or rather lend it me for i but ask it in the way of friendshiphere cousin wilfred of ivanhoe in thy favour i renounce and abjurehey by saint dunstan our cousin wilfred hath vanishedyet unless my eyes are still dazzled with the fasting i have undergone i saw him stand there but even now  all now looked around and enquired for ivanhoe but he had vanished it was at length discovered that a jew had been to seek him and that after very brief conference he had called for gurth and his armour and had left the castle  fair cousin said athelstane to rowena could i think that this sudden disappearance of ivanhoe was occasioned by other than the weightiest reason i would myself resume  but he had no sooner let go her hand on first observing that ivanhoe had disappeared than rowena who had found her situation extremely embarrassing had taken the first opportunity to escape from the apartment  certainly quoth athelstane women are the least to be trusted of all animals monks and abbots excepted i am an infidel if i expected not thanks from her and perhaps a kiss to bootthese cursed graveclothes have surely a spell on them every one flies from meto you i turn noble king richard with the vows of allegiance which as a liegesubject  but king richard was gone also and no one knew whither at length it was learned that he had hastened to the courtyard summoned to his presence the jew who had spoken with ivanhoe and after a moments speech with him had called vehemently to horse thrown himself upon a steed compelled the jew to mount another and set off at a rate which according to wamba rendered the old jews neck not worth a pennys purchase  by my halidome said athelstane it is certain that zernebock hath possessed himself of my castle in my absence i return in my graveclothes a pledge restored from the very sepulchre and every one i speak to vanishes as soon as they hear my voicebut it skills not talking of it come my friendssuch of you as are left follow me to the banquethall lest any more of us disappearit is i trust as yet tolerably furnished as becomes the obsequies of an ancient saxon noble and should we tarry any longer who knows but the devil may fly off with the supper     chapter xliii       be mowbrays sins so heavy in his bosom      that they may break his foaming coursers back      and throw the rider headlong in the lists      a caitiff recreant      richard ii  our scene now returns to the exterior of the castle or preceptory of templestowe about the hour when the bloody die was to be cast for the life or death of rebecca it was a scene of bustle and life as if the whole vicinity had poured forth its inhabitants to a village wake or rural feast but the earnest desire to look on blood and death is not peculiar to those dark ages though in the gladiatorial exercise of single combat and general tourney they were habituated to the bloody spectacle of brave men falling by each others hands even in our own days when morals are better understood an execution a bruising match a riot or a meeting of radical reformers collects at considerable hazard to themselves immense crowds of spectators otherwise little interested except to see how matters are to be conducted or whether the heroes of the day are in the heroic language of insurgent tailors flints or dunghills  the eyes therefore of a very considerable multitude were bent on the gate of the preceptory of templestowe with the purpose of witnessing the procession while still greater numbers had already surrounded the tiltyard belonging to that establishment this enclosure was formed on a piece of level ground adjoining to the preceptory which had been levelled with care for the exercise of military and chivalrous sports it occupied the brow of a soft and gentle eminence was carefully palisaded around and as the templars willingly invited spectators to be witnesses of their skill in feats of chivalry was amply supplied with galleries and benches for their use  on the present occasion a throne was erected for the grand master at the east end surrounded with seats of distinction for the preceptors and knights of the order over these floated the sacred standard called le beauseant which was the ensign as its name was the battlecry of the templars  at the opposite end of the lists was a pile of faggots so arranged around a stake deeply fixed in the ground as to leave a space for the victim whom they were destined to consume to enter within the fatal circle in order to be chained to the stake by the fetters which hung ready for that purpose beside this deadly apparatus stood four black slaves whose colour and african features then so little known in england appalled the multitude who gazed on them as on demons employed about their own diabolical exercises these men stirred not excepting now and then under the direction of one who seemed their chief to shift and replace the ready fuel they looked not on the multitude in fact they seemed insensible of their presence and of every thing save the discharge of their own horrible duty  and when in speech with each other they expanded their blubber lips and showed their white fangs as if they grinned at the thoughts of the expected tragedy the startled commons could scarcely help believing that they were actually the familiar spirits with whom the witch had communed and who her time being out stood ready to assist in her dreadful punishment they whispered to each other and communicated all the feats which satan had performed during that busy and unhappy period not failing of course to give the devil rather more than his due  have you not heard father dennet quoth one boor to another advanced in years that the devil has carried away bodily the great saxon thane athelstane of coningsburgh  ay but he brought him back though by the blessing of god and saint dunstan  hows that said a brisk young fellow dressed in a green cassock embroidered with gold and having at his heels a stout lad bearing a harp upon his back which betrayed his vocation the minstrel seemed of no vulgar rank for besides the splendour of his gaily braidered doublet he wore around his neck a silver chain by which hung the wrest or key with which he tuned his harp on his right arm was a silver plate which instead of bearing as usual the cognizance or badge of the baron to whose family he belonged had barely the word sherwood engraved upon ithow mean you by that said the gay minstrel mingling in the conversation of the peasants i came to seek one subject for my rhyme and byr lady i were glad to find two  it is well avouched said the elder peasant that after athelstane of coningsburgh had been dead four weeks  that is impossible said the minstrel i saw him in life at the passage of arms at ashbydelazouche  dead however he was or else translated said the younger peasant for i heard the monks of saint edmunds singing the deaths hymn for him and moreover there was a rich deathmeal and dole at the castle of coningsburgh as right was and thither had i gone but for mabel parkins who  ay dead was athelstane said the old man shaking his head and the more pity it was for the old saxon blood  but your story my mastersyour story said the minstrel somewhat impatiently  ay ayconstrue us the story said a burly friar who stood beside them leaning on a pole that exhibited an appearance between a pilgrims staff and a quarterstaff and probably acted as either when occasion servedyour story said the stalwart churchman burn not daylight about itwe have short time to spare  an please your reverence said dennet a drunken priest came to visit the sacristan at saint edmunds  it does not please my reverence answered the churchman that there should be such an animal as a drunken priest or if there were that a layman should so speak him be mannerly my friend and conclude the holy man only wrapt in meditation which makes the head dizzy and foot unsteady as if the stomach were filled with new winei have felt it myself  well then answered father dennet a holy brother came to visit the sacristan at saint edmundsa sort of hedgepriest is the visitor and kills half the deer that are stolen in the forest who loves the tinkling of a pintpot better than the sacringbell and deems a flitch of bacon worth ten of his breviary for the rest a good fellow and a merry who will flourish a quarterstaff draw a bow and dance a cheshire round with eer a man in yorkshire  that last part of thy speech dennet said the minstrel has saved thee a rib or twain  tush man i fear him not said dennet i am somewhat old and stiff but when i fought for the bell and ram at doncaster  but the storythe story my friend again said the minstrel  why the tale is but thisathelstane of coningsburgh was buried at saint edmunds  thats a lie and a loud one said the friar for i saw him borne to his own castle of coningsburgh  nay then een tell the story yourself my masters said dennet turning sulky at these repeated contradictions and it was with some difficulty that the boor could be prevailed on by the request of his comrade and the minstrel to renew his talethese two sober friars said he at length since this reverend man will needs have them such had continued drinking good ale and wine and what not for the best part for a summers day when they were aroused by a deep groan and a clanking of chains and the figure of the deceased athelstane entered the apartment saying ye evil shepherds  it is false said the friar hastily he never spoke a word  so ho friar tuck said the minstrel drawing him apart from the rustics we have started a new hare i find  i tell thee allanadale said the hermit i saw athelstane of coningsburgh as much as bodily eyes ever saw a living man he had his shroud on and all about him smelt of the sepulchrea butt of sack will not wash it out of my memory  pshaw answered the minstrel thou dost but jest with me  never believe me said the friar an i fetched not a knock at him with my quarterstaff that would have felled an ox and it glided through his body as it might through a pillar of smoke  by saint hubert said the minstrel but it is a wondrous tale and fit to be put in metre to the ancient tune sorrow came to the old friar  laugh if ye list said friar tuck but an ye catch me singing on such a theme may the next ghost or devil carry me off with him headlong no noi instantly formed the purpose of assisting at some good work such as the burning of a witch a judicial combat or the like matter of godly service and therefore am i here  as they thus conversed the heavy bell of the church of saint michael of templestowe a venerable building situated in a hamlet at some distance from the preceptory broke short their argument one by one the sullen sounds fell successively on the ear leaving but sufficient space for each to die away in distant echo ere the air was again filled by repetition of the iron knell these sounds the signal of the approaching ceremony chilled with awe the hearts of the assembled multitude whose eyes were now turned to the preceptory expecting the approach of the grand master the champion and the criminal  at length the drawbridge fell the gates opened and a knight bearing the great standard of the order sallied from the castle preceded by six trumpets and followed by the knights preceptors two and two the grand master coming last mounted on a stately horse whose furniture was of the simplest kind behind him came brian de boisguilbert armed capapie in bright armour but without his lance shield and sword which were borne by his two esquires behind him his face though partly hidden by a long plume which floated down from his barrelcap bore a strong and mingled expression of passion in which pride seemed to contend with irresolution he looked ghastly pale as if he had not slept for several nights yet reined his pawing warhorse with the habitual ease and grace proper to the best lance of the order of the temple his general appearance was grand and commanding but looking at him with attention men read that in his dark features from which they willingly withdrew their eyes  on either side rode conrade of montfitchet and albert de malvoisin who acted as godfathers to the champion they were in their robes of peace the white dress of the order behind them followed other companions of the temple with a long train of esquires and pages clad in black aspirants to the honour of being one day knights of the order after these neophytes came a guard of warders on foot in the same sable livery amidst whose partisans might be seen the pale form of the accused moving with a slow but undismayed step towards the scene of her fate she was stript of all her ornaments lest perchance there should be among them some of those amulets which satan was supposed to bestow upon his victims to deprive them of the power of confession even when under the torture a coarse white dress of the simplest form had been substituted for her oriental garments yet there was such an exquisite mixture of courage and resignation in her look that even in this garb and with no other ornament than her long black tresses each eye wept that looked upon her and the most hardened bigot regretted the fate that had converted a creature so goodly into a vessel of wrath and a waged slave of the devil  a crowd of inferior personages belonging to the preceptory followed the victim all moving with the utmost order with arms folded and looks bent upon the ground  this slow procession moved up the gentle eminence on the summit of which was the tiltyard and entering the lists marched once around them from right to left and when they had completed the circle made a halt there was then a momentary bustle while the grand master and all his attendants excepting the champion and his godfathers dismounted from their horses which were immediately removed out of the lists by the esquires who were in attendance for that purpose  the unfortunate rebecca was conducted to the black chair placed near the pile on her first glance at the terrible spot where preparations were making for a death alike dismaying to the mind and painful to the body she was observed to shudder and shut her eyes praying internally doubtless for her lips moved though no speech was heard in the space of a minute she opened her eyes looked fixedly on the pile as if to familiarize her mind with the object and then slowly and naturally turned away her head  meanwhile the grand master had assumed his seat and when the chivalry of his order was placed around and behind him each in his due rank a loud and long flourish of the trumpets announced that the court were seated for judgment malvoisin then acting as godfather of the champion stepped forward and laid the glove of the jewess which was the pledge of battle at the feet of the grand master  valorous lord and reverend father said he here standeth the good knight brian de boisguilbert knight preceptor of the order of the temple who by accepting the pledge of battle which i now lay at your reverences feet hath become bound to do his devoir in combat this day to maintain that this jewish maiden by name rebecca hath justly deserved the doom passed upon her in a chapter of this most holy order of the temple of zion condemning her to die as a sorceresshere i say he standeth such battle to do knightly and honourable if such be your noble and sanctified pleasure  hath he made oath said the grand master that his quarrel is just and honourable bring forward the crucifix and the te igitur  sir and most reverend father answered malvoisin readily our brother here present hath already sworn to the truth of his accusation in the hand of the good knight conrade de montfitchet and otherwise he ought not to be sworn seeing that his adversary is an unbeliever and may take no oath  this explanation was satisfactory to alberts great joy for the wily knight had foreseen the great difficulty or rather impossibility of prevailing upon brian de boisguilbert to take such an oath before the assembly and had invented this excuse to escape the necessity of his doing so  the grand master having allowed the apology of albert malvoisin commanded the herald to stand forth and do his devoir the trumpets then again flourished and a herald stepping forward proclaimed aloudoyez oyez oyezhere standeth the good knight sir brian de boisguilbert ready to do battle with any knight of free blood who will sustain the quarrel allowed and allotted to the jewess rebecca to try by champion in respect of lawful essoine of her own body and to such champion the reverend and valorous grand master here present allows a fair field and equal partition of sun and wind and whatever else appertains to a fair combat the trumpets again sounded and there was a dead pause of many minutes  no champion appears for the appellant said the grand master go herald and ask her whether she expects any one to do battle for her in this her cause the herald went to the chair in which rebecca was seated and boisguilbert suddenly turning his horses head toward that end of the lists in spite of hints on either side from malvoisin and montfitchet was by the side of rebeccas chair as soon as the herald  is this regular and according to the law of combat said malvoisin looking to the grand master  albert de malvoisin it is answered beaumanoir for in this appeal to the judgment of god we may not prohibit parties from having that communication with each other which may best tend to bring forth the truth of the quarrel  in the meantime the herald spoke to rebecca in these termsdamsel the honourable and reverend the grand master demands of thee if thou art prepared with a champion to do battle this day in thy behalf or if thou dost yield thee as one justly condemned to a deserved doom  say to the grand master replied rebecca that i maintain my innocence and do not yield me as justly condemned lest i become guilty of mine own blood say to him that i challenge such delay as his forms will permit to see if god whose opportunity is in mans extremity will raise me up a deliverer and when such uttermost space is passed may his holy will be done the herald retired to carry this answer to the grand master  god forbid said lucas beaumanoir that jew or pagan should impeach us of injusticeuntil the shadows be cast from the west to the eastward will we wait to see if a champion shall appear for this unfortunate woman when the day is so far passed let her prepare for death  the herald communicated the words of the grand master to rebecca who bowed her head submissively folded her arms and looking up towards heaven seemed to expect that aid from above which she could scarce promise herself from man during this awful pause the voice of boisguilbert broke upon her earit was but a whisper yet it startled her more than the summons of the herald had appeared to do  rebecca said the templar dost thou hear me  i have no portion in thee cruel hardhearted man said the unfortunate maiden  ay but dost thou understand my words said the templar for the sound of my voice is frightful in mine own ears i scarce know on what ground we stand or for what purpose they have brought us hitherthis listed spacethat chairthese faggotsi know their purpose and yet it appears to me like something unrealthe fearful picture of a vision which appals my sense with hideous fantasies but convinces not my reason  my mind and senses keep touch and time answered rebecca and tell me alike that these faggots are destined to consume my earthly body and open a painful but a brief passage to a better world  dreams rebeccadreams answered the templar idle visions rejected by the wisdom of your own wiser sadducees hear me rebecca he said proceeding with animation a better chance hast thou for life and liberty than yonder knaves and dotard dream of mount thee behind me on my steedon zamor the gallant horse that never failed his rider i won him in single fight from the soldan of trebizondmount i say behind mein one short hour is pursuit and enquiry far behinda new world of pleasure opens to theeto me a new career of fame let them speak the doom which i despise and erase the name of boisguilbert from their list of monastic slaves i will wash out with blood whatever blot they may dare to cast on my scutcheon  tempter said rebecca begonenot in this last extremity canst thou move me one hairsbreadth from my resting placesurrounded as i am by foes i hold thee as my worst and most deadly enemyavoid thee in the name of god  albert malvoisin alarmed and impatient at the duration of their conference now advanced to interrupt it  hath the maiden acknowledged her guilt he demanded of boisguilbert or is she resolute in her denial  she is indeed resolute said boisguilbert  then said malvoisin must thou noble brother resume thy place to attend the issuethe shades are changing on the circle of the dialcome brave boisguilbertcome thou hope of our holy order and soon to be its head  as he spoke in this soothing tone he laid his hand on the knights bridle as if to lead him back to his station  false villain what meanest thou by thy hand on my rein said sir brian angrily and shaking off his companions grasp he rode back to the upper end of the lists  there is yet spirit in him said malvoisin apart to montfitchet were it well directedbut like the greek fire it burns whatever approaches it  the judges had now been two hours in the lists awaiting in vain the appearance of a champion  and reason good said friar tuck seeing she is a jewessand yet by mine order it is hard that so young and beautiful a creature should perish without one blow being struck in her behalf were she ten times a witch provided she were but the least bit of a christian my quarterstaff should ring noon on the steel cap of yonder fierce templar ere he carried the matter off thus  it was however the general belief that no one could or would appear for a jewess accused of sorcery and the knights instigated by malvoisin whispered to each other that it was time to declare the pledge of rebecca forfeited at this instant a knight urging his horse to speed appeared on the plain advancing towards the lists a hundred voices exclaimed a champion a champion and despite the prepossessions and prejudices of the multitude they shouted unanimously as the knight rode into the tiltyard the second glance however served to destroy the hope that his timely arrival had excited his horse urged for many miles to its utmost speed appeared to reel from fatigue and the rider however undauntedly he presented himself in the lists either from weakness weariness or both seemed scarce able to support himself in the saddle  to the summons of the herald who demanded his rank his name and purpose the stranger knight answered readily and boldly i am a good knight and noble come hither to sustain with lance and sword the just and lawful quarrel of this damsel rebecca daughter of isaac of york to uphold the doom pronounced against her to be false and truthless and to defy sir brian de boisguilbert as a traitor murderer and liar as i will prove in this field with my body against his by the aid of god of our lady and of monseigneur saint george the good knight  the stranger must first show said malvoisin that he is good knight and of honourable lineage the temple sendeth not forth her champions against nameless men  my name said the knight raising his helmet is better known my lineage more pure malvoisin than thine own i am wilfred of ivanhoe  i will not fight with thee at present said the templar in a changed and hollow voice get thy wounds healed purvey thee a better horse and it may be i will hold it worth my while to scourge out of thee this boyish spirit of bravado  ha proud templar said ivanhoe hast thou forgotten that twice didst thou fall before this lance remember the lists at acreremember the passage of arms at ashbyremember thy proud vaunt in the halls of rotherwood and the gage of your gold chain against my reliquary that thou wouldst do battle with wilfred of ivanhoe and recover the honour thou hadst lost by that reliquary and the holy relic it contains i will proclaim thee templar a coward in every court in europein every preceptory of thine orderunless thou do battle without farther delay  boisguilbert turned his countenance irresolutely towards rebecca and then exclaimed looking fiercely at ivanhoe dog of a saxon take thy lance and prepare for the death thou hast drawn upon thee  does the grand master allow me the combat said ivanhoe  i may not deny what thou hast challenged said the grand master provided the maiden accepts thee as her champion yet i would thou wert in better plight to do battle an enemy of our order hast thou ever been yet would i have thee honourably met with  thusthus as i am and not otherwise said ivanhoe it is the judgment of godto his keeping i commend myselfrebecca said he riding up to the fatal chair dost thou accept of me for thy champion  i do she saidi do fluttered by an emotion which the fear of death had been unable to produce i do accept thee as the champion whom heaven hath sent me yet nonothy wounds are uncuredmeet not that proud manwhy shouldst thou perish also  but ivanhoe was already at his post and had closed his visor and assumed his lance boisguilbert did the same and his esquire remarked as he clasped his visor that his face which had notwithstanding the variety of emotions by which he had been agitated continued during the whole morning of an ashy paleness was now become suddenly very much flushed  the herald then seeing each champion in his place uplifted his voice repeating thricefaites vos devoirs preux chevaliers after the third cry he withdrew to one side of the lists and again proclaimed that none on peril of instant death should dare by word cry or action to interfere with or disturb this fair field of combat the grand master who held in his hand the gage of battle rebeccas glove now threw it into the lists and pronounced the fatal signal words laissez aller  the trumpets sounded and the knights charged each other in full career the wearied horse of ivanhoe and its no less exhausted rider went down as all had expected before the wellaimed lance and vigorous steed of the templar this issue of the combat all had foreseen but although the spear of ivanhoe did but in comparison touch the shield of boisguilbert that champion to the astonishment of all who beheld it reeled in his saddle lost his stirrups and fell in the lists  ivanhoe extricating himself from his fallen horse was soon on foot hastening to mend his fortune with his sword but his antagonist arose not wilfred placing his foot on his breast and the swords point to his throat commanded him to yield him or die on the spot boisguilbert returned no answer  slay him not sir knight cried the grand master unshriven and unabsolvedkill not body and soul we allow him vanquished  he descended into the lists and commanded them to unhelm the conquered champion his eyes were closedthe dark red flush was still on his brow as they looked on him in astonishment the eyes openedbut they were fixed and glazed the flush passed from his brow and gave way to the pallid hue of death unscathed by the lance of his enemy he had died a victim to the violence of his own contending passions  this is indeed the judgment of god said the grand master looking upwardsfiat voluntas tua     chapter xliv       so now tis ended like an old wifes story      webster  when the first moments of surprise were over wilfred of ivanhoe demanded of the grand master as judge of the field if he had manfully and rightfully done his duty in the combat manfully and rightfully hath it been done said the grand master i pronounce the maiden free and guiltlessthe arms and the body of the deceased knight are at the will of the victor  i will not despoil him of his weapons said the knight of ivanhoe nor condemn his corpse to shamehe hath fought for christendomgods arm no human hand hath this day struck him down but let his obsequies be private as becomes those of a man who died in an unjust quarreland for the maiden  he was interrupted by a clattering of horses feet advancing in such numbers and so rapidly as to shake the ground before them and the black knight galloped into the lists he was followed by a numerous band of menatarms and several knights in complete armour  i am too late he said looking around him i had doomed boisguilbert for mine own propertyivanhoe was this well to take on thee such a venture and thou scarce able to keep thy saddle  heaven my liege answered ivanhoe hath taken this proud man for its victim he was not to be honoured in dying as your will had designed  peace be with him said richard looking steadfastly on the corpse if it may be sohe was a gallant knight and has died in his steel harness full knightly but we must waste no timebohun do thine office  a knight stepped forward from the kings attendants and laying his hand on the shoulder of albert de malvoisin said i arrest thee of high treason  the grand master had hitherto stood astonished at the appearance of so many warriorshe now spoke  who dares to arrest a knight of the temple of zion within the girth of his own preceptory and in the presence of the grand master and by whose authority is this bold outrage offered  i make the arrest replied the knighti henry bohun earl of essex lord high constable of england  and he arrests malvoisin said the king raising his visor by the order of richard plantagenet here presentconrade montfitchet it is well for thee thou art born no subject of minebut for thee malvoisin thou diest with thy brother philip ere the world be a week older  i will resist thy doom said the grand master  proud templar said the king thou canst notlook up and behold the royal standard of england floats over thy towers instead of thy temple bannerbe wise beaumanoir and make no bootless oppositionthy hand is in the lions mouth  i will appeal to rome against thee said the grand master for usurpation on the immunities and privileges of our order  be it so said the king but for thine own sake tax me not with usurpation now dissolve thy chapter and depart with thy followers to thy next preceptory if thou canst find one which has not been made the scene of treasonable conspiracy against the king of englandor if thou wilt remain to share our hospitality and behold our justice  to be a guest in the house where i should command said the templar neverchaplains raise the psalm quare fremuerunt gentesknights squires and followers of the holy temple prepare to follow the banner of beauseant  the grand master spoke with a dignity which confronted even that of englands king himself and inspired courage into his surprised and dismayed followers they gathered around him like the sheep around the watchdog when they hear the baying of the wolf but they evinced not the timidity of the scared flockthere were dark brows of defiance and looks which menaced the hostility they dared not to proffer in words they drew together in a dark line of spears from which the white cloaks of the knights were visible among the dusky garments of their retainers like the lightercoloured edges of a sable cloud the multitude who had raised a clamorous shout of reprobation paused and gazed in silence on the formidable and experienced body to which they had unwarily bade defiance and shrunk back from their front  the earl of essex when he beheld them pause in their assembled force dashed the rowels into his chargers sides and galloped backwards and forwards to array his followers in opposition to a band so formidable richard alone as if he loved the danger his presence had provoked rode slowly along the front of the templars calling aloud what sirs among so many gallant knights will none dare splinter a spear with richardsirs of the temple your ladies are but sunburned if they are not worth the shiver of a broken lance  the brethren of the temple said the grand master riding forward in advance of their body fight not on such idle and profane quarreland not with thee richard of england shall a templar cross lance in my presence the pope and princes of europe shall judge our quarrel and whether a christian prince has done well in bucklering the cause which thou hast today adopted if unassailed we depart assailing no one to thine honour we refer the armour and household goods of the order which we leave behind us and on thy conscience we lay the scandal and offence thou hast this day given to christendom  with these words and without waiting a reply the grand master gave the signal of departure their trumpets sounded a wild march of an oriental character which formed the usual signal for the templars to advance they changed their array from a line to a column of march and moved off as slowly as their horses could step as if to show it was only the will of their grand master and no fear of the opposing and superior force which compelled them to withdraw  by the splendour of our ladys brow said king richard it is pity of their lives that these templars are not so trusty as they are disciplined and valiant  the multitude like a timid cur which waits to bark till the object of its challenge has turned his back raised a feeble shout as the rear of the squadron left the ground  during the tumult which attended the retreat of the templars rebecca saw and heard nothingshe was locked in the arms of her aged father giddy and almost senseless with the rapid change of circumstances around her but one word from isaac at length recalled her scattered feelings  let us go he said my dear daughter my recovered treasurelet us go to throw ourselves at the feet of the good youth  not so said rebecca o nononoi must not at this moment dare to speak to himalas i should say more thanno my father let us instantly leave this evil place  but my daughter said isaac to leave him who hath come forth like a strong man with his spear and shield holding his life as nothing so he might redeem thy captivity and thou too the daughter of a people strange unto him and histhis is service to be thankfully acknowledged  it isit ismost thankfullymost devoutly acknowledged said rebeccait shall be still more sobut not nowfor the sake of thy beloved rachel father grant my requestnot now  nay but said isaac insisting they will deem us more thankless than mere dogs  but thou seest my dear father that king richard is in presence and that  true my bestmy wisest rebeccalet us hencelet us hencemoney he will lack for he has just returned from palestine and as they say from prisonand pretext for exacting it should he need any may arise out of my simple traffic with his brother john away away let us hence  and hurrying his daughter in his turn he conducted her from the lists and by means of conveyance which he had provided transported her safely to the house of the rabbi nathan  the jewess whose fortunes had formed the principal interest of the day having now retired unobserved the attention of the populace was transferred to the black knight they now filled the air with long life to richard with the lions heart and down with the usurping templars  notwithstanding all this liployalty said ivanhoe to the earl of essex it was well the king took the precaution to bring thee with him noble earl and so many of thy trusty followers  the earl smiled and shook his head  gallant ivanhoe said essex dost thou know our master so well and yet suspect him of taking so wise a precaution i was drawing towards york having heard that prince john was making head there when i met king richard like a true knighterrant galloping hither to achieve in his own person this adventure of the templar and the jewess with his own single arm i accompanied him with my band almost maugre his consent  and what news from york brave earl said ivanhoe will the rebels bide us there  no more than decembers snow will bide julys sun said the earl they are dispersing and who should come posting to bring us the news but john himself  the traitor the ungrateful insolent traitor said ivanhoe did not richard order him into confinement  o he received him answered the earl as if they had met after a hunting party and pointing to me and our menatarms said thou seest brother i have some angry men with methou wert best go to our mother carry her my duteous affection and abide with her until mens minds are pacified  and this was all he said enquired ivanhoe would not any one say that this prince invites men to treason by his clemency  just replied the earl as the man may be said to invite death who undertakes to fight a combat having a dangerous wound unhealed  i forgive thee the jest lord earl said ivanhoe but remember i hazarded but my own liferichard the welfare of his kingdom  those replied essex who are specially careless of their own welfare are seldom remarkably attentive to that of othersbut let us haste to the castle for richard meditates punishing some of the subordinate members of the conspiracy though he has pardoned their principal  from the judicial investigations which followed on this occasion and which are given at length in the wardour manuscript it appears that maurice de bracy escaped beyond seas and went into the service of philip of france while philip de malvoisin and his brother albert the preceptor of templestowe were executed although waldemar fitzurse the soul of the conspiracy escaped with banishment and prince john for whose behoof it was undertaken was not even censured by his goodnatured brother no one however pitied the fate of the two malvoisins who only suffered the death which they had both well deserved by many acts of falsehood cruelty and oppression  briefly after the judicial combat cedric the saxon was summoned to the court of richard which for the purpose of quieting the counties that had been disturbed by the ambition of his brother was then held at york cedric tushed and pshawed more than once at the messagebut he refused not obedience in fact the return of richard had quenched every hope that he had entertained of restoring a saxon dynasty in england for whatever head the saxons might have made in the event of a civil war it was plain that nothing could be done under the undisputed dominion of richard popular as he was by his personal good qualities and military fame although his administration was wilfully careless now too indulgent and now allied to despotism  but moreover it could not escape even cedrics reluctant observation that his project for an absolute union among the saxons by the marriage of rowena and athelstane was now completely at an end by the mutual dissent of both parties concerned this was indeed an event which in his ardour for the saxon cause he could not have anticipated and even when the disinclination of both was broadly and plainly manifested he could scarce bring himself to believe that two saxons of royal descent should scruple on personal grounds at an alliance so necessary for the public weal of the nation but it was not the less certain rowena had always expressed her repugnance to athelstane and now athelstane was no less plain and positive in proclaiming his resolution never to pursue his addresses to the lady rowena even the natural obstinacy of cedric sunk beneath these obstacles where he remaining on the point of junction had the task of dragging a reluctant pair up to it one with each hand he made however a last vigorous attack on athelstane and he found that resuscitated sprout of saxon royalty engaged like country squires of our own day in a furious war with the clergy  it seems that after all his deadly menaces against the abbot of saint edmunds athelstanes spirit of revenge what between the natural indolent kindness of his own disposition what through the prayers of his mother edith attached like most ladies of the period to the clerical order had terminated in his keeping the abbot and his monks in the dungeons of coningsburgh for three days on a meagre diet for this atrocity the abbot menaced him with excommunication and made out a dreadful list of complaints in the bowels and stomach suffered by himself and his monks in consequence of the tyrannical and unjust imprisonment they had sustained with this controversy and with the means he had adopted to counteract this clerical persecution cedric found the mind of his friend athelstane so fully occupied that it had no room for another idea and when rowenas name was mentioned the noble athelstane prayed leave to quaff a full goblet to her health and that she might soon be the bride of his kinsman wilfred it was a desperate case therefore there was obviously no more to be made of athelstane or as wamba expressed it in a phrase which has descended from saxon times to ours he was a cock that would not fight  there remained betwixt cedric and the determination which the lovers desired to come to only two obstacleshis own obstinacy and his dislike of the norman dynasty the former feeling gradually gave way before the endearments of his ward and the pride which he could not help nourishing in the fame of his son besides he was not insensible to the honour of allying his own line to that of alfred when the superior claims of the descendant of edward the confessor were abandoned for ever cedrics aversion to the norman race of kings was also much underminedfirst by consideration of the impossibility of ridding england of the new dynasty a feeling which goes far to create loyalty in the subject to the king de facto and secondly by the personal attention of king richard who delighted in the blunt humour of cedric and to use the language of the wardour manuscript so dealt with the noble saxon that ere he had been a guest at court for seven days he had given his consent to the marriage of his ward rowena and his son wilfred of ivanhoe  the nuptials of our hero thus formally approved by his father were celebrated in the most august of temples the noble minster of york the king himself attended and from the countenance which he afforded on this and other occasions to the distressed and hitherto degraded saxons gave them a safer and more certain prospect of attaining their just rights than they could reasonably hope from the precarious chance of a civil war the church gave her full solemnities graced with all the splendour which she of rome knows how to apply with such brilliant effect  gurth gallantly apparelled attended as esquire upon his young master whom he had served so faithfully and the magnanimous wamba decorated with a new cap and a most gorgeous set of silver bells sharers of wilfreds dangers and adversity they remained as they had a right to expect the partakers of his more prosperous career  but besides this domestic retinue these distinguished nuptials were celebrated by the attendance of the highborn normans as well as saxons joined with the universal jubilee of the lower orders that marked the marriage of two individuals as a pledge of the future peace and harmony betwixt two races which since that period have been so completely mingled that the distinction has become wholly invisible cedric lived to see this union approximate towards its completion for as the two nations mixed in society and formed intermarriages with each other the normans abated their scorn and the saxons were refined from their rusticity but it was not until the reign of edward the third that the mixed language now termed english was spoken at the court of london and that the hostile distinction of norman and saxon seems entirely to have disappeared  it was upon the second morning after this happy bridal that the lady rowena was made acquainted by her handmaid elgitha that a damsel desired admission to her presence and solicited that their parley might be without witness rowena wondered hesitated became curious and ended by commanding the damsel to be admitted and her attendants to withdraw  she entereda noble and commanding figure the long white veil in which she was shrouded overshadowing rather than concealing the elegance and majesty of her shape her demeanour was that of respect unmingled by the least shade either of fear or of a wish to propitiate favour rowena was ever ready to acknowledge the claims and attend to the feelings of others she arose and would have conducted her lovely visitor to a seat but the stranger looked at elgitha and again intimated a wish to discourse with the lady rowena alone elgitha had no sooner retired with unwilling steps than to the surprise of the lady of ivanhoe her fair visitant kneeled on one knee pressed her hands to her forehead and bending her head to the ground in spite of rowenas resistance kissed the embroidered hem of her tunic  what means this lady said the surprised bride or why do you offer to me a deference so unusual  because to you lady of ivanhoe said rebecca rising up and resuming the usual quiet dignity of her manner i may lawfully and without rebuke pay the debt of gratitude which i owe to wilfred of ivanhoe i amforgive the boldness which has offered to you the homage of my countryi am the unhappy jewess for whom your husband hazarded his life against such fearful odds in the tiltyard of templestowe  damsel said rowena wilfred of ivanhoe on that day rendered back but in slight measure your unceasing charity towards him in his wounds and misfortunes speak is there aught remains in which he or i can serve thee  nothing said rebecca calmly unless you will transmit to him my grateful farewell  you leave england then said rowena scarce recovering the surprise of this extraordinary visit  i leave it lady ere this moon again changes my father had a brother high in favour with mohammed boabdil king of grenadathither we go secure of peace and protection for the payment of such ransom as the moslem exact from our people  and are you not then as well protected in england said rowena my husband has favour with the kingthe king himself is just and generous  lady said rebecca i doubt it notbut the people of england are a fierce race quarrelling ever with their neighbours or among themselves and ready to plunge the sword into the bowels of each other such is no safe abode for the children of my people ephraim is an heartless doveissachar an overlaboured drudge which stoops between two burdens not in a land of war and blood surrounded by hostile neighbours and distracted by internal factions can israel hope to rest during her wanderings  but you maiden said rowenayou surely can have nothing to fear she who nursed the sickbed of ivanhoe she continued rising with enthusiasmshe can have nothing to fear in england where saxon and norman will contend who shall most do her honour  thy speech is fair lady said rebecca and thy purpose fairer but it may not bethere is a gulf betwixt us our breeding our faith alike forbid either to pass over it farewellyet ere i go indulge me one request the bridalveil hangs over thy face deign to raise it and let me see the features of which fame speaks so highly  they are scarce worthy of being looked upon said rowena but expecting the same from my visitant i remove the veil  she took it off accordingly and partly from the consciousness of beauty partly from bashfulness she blushed so intensely that cheek brow neck and bosom were suffused with crimson rebecca blushed also but it was a momentary feeling and mastered by higher emotions past slowly from her features like the crimson cloud which changes colour when the sun sinks beneath the horizon  lady she said the countenance you have deigned to show me will long dwell in my remembrance there reigns in it gentleness and goodness and if a tinge of the worlds pride or vanities may mix with an expression so lovely how should we chide that which is of earth for bearing some colour of its original long long will i remember your features and bless god that i leave my noble deliverer united with  she stopped shorther eyes filled with tears she hastily wiped them and answered to the anxious enquiries of rowenai am well ladywell but my heart swells when i think of torquilstone and the lists of templestowefarewell one the most trifling part of my duty remains undischarged accept this casketstartle not at its contents  rowena opened the small silverchased casket and perceived a carcanet or neck lace with earjewels of diamonds which were obviously of immense value  it is impossible she said tendering back the casket i dare not accept a gift of such consequence  yet keep it lady returned rebeccayou have power rank command influence we have wealth the source both of our strength and weakness the value of these toys ten times multiplied would not influence half so much as your slightest wish to you therefore the gift is of little valueand to me what i part with is of much less let me not think you deem so wretchedly ill of my nation as your commons believe think ye that i prize these sparkling fragments of stone above my liberty or that my father values them in comparison to the honour of his only child accept them ladyto me they are valueless i will never wear jewels more  you are then unhappy said rowena struck with the manner in which rebecca uttered the last words o remain with usthe counsel of holy men will wean you from your erring law and i will be a sister to you  no lady answered rebecca the same calm melancholy reigning in her soft voice and beautiful featuresthatmay not be i may not change the faith of my fathers like a garment unsuited to the climate in which i seek to dwell and unhappy lady i will not be he to whom i dedicate my future life will be my comforter if i do his will  have you then convents to one of which you mean to retire asked rowena  no lady said the jewess but among our people since the time of abraham downwards have been women who have devoted their thoughts to heaven and their actions to works of kindness to men tending the sick feeding the hungry and relieving the distressed among these will rebecca be numbered say this to thy lord should he chance to enquire after the fate of her whose life he saved  there was an involuntary tremour on rebeccas voice and a tenderness of accent which perhaps betrayed more than she would willingly have expressed she hastened to bid rowena adieu  farewell she said may he who made both jew and christian shower down on you his choicest blessings the bark that waits us hence will be under weigh ere we can reach the port  she glided from the apartment leaving rowena surprised as if a vision had passed before her the fair saxon related the singular conference to her husband on whose mind it made a deep impression he lived long and happily with rowena for they were attached to each other by the bonds of early affection and they loved each other the more from the recollection of the obstacles which had impeded their union yet it would be enquiring too curiously to ask whether the recollection of rebeccas beauty and magnanimity did not recur to his mind more frequently than the fair descendant of alfred might altogether have approved  ivanhoe distinguished himself in the service of richard and was graced with farther marks of the royal favour he might have risen still higher but for the premature death of the heroic coeurdelion before the castle of chaluz near limoges with the life of a generous but rash and romantic monarch perished all the projects which his ambition and his generosity had formed to whom may be applied with a slight alteration the lines composed by johnson for charles of sweden       his fate was destined to a foreign strand      a petty fortress and an humble hand      he left the name at which the world grew pale      to point a moral or adorn a tale       note to chapter i  note athe ranger or the forest that cuts the foreclaws off our dogs  a most sensible grievance of those aggrieved times were the forest laws these oppressive enactments were the produce of the norman conquest for the saxon laws of the chase were mild and humane while those of william enthusiastically attached to the exercise and its rights were to the last degree tyrannical the formation of the new forest bears evidence to his passion for hunting where he reduced many a happy village to the condition of that one commemorated by my friend mr william stewart rose       amongst the ruins of the church      the midnight raven found a perch      a melancholy place      the ruthless conqueror cast down      woe worth the deed that little town      to lengthen out his chase  the disabling dogs which might be necessary for keeping flocks and herds from running at the deer was called lawing and was in general use the charter of the forest designed to lessen those evils declares that inquisition or view for lawing dogs shall be made every third year and shall be then done by the view and testimony of lawful men not otherwise and they whose dogs shall be then found unlawed shall give three shillings for mercy and for the future no mans ox shall be taken for lawing such lawing also shall be done by the assize commonly used and which is that three claws shall be cut off without the ball of the right foot see on this subject the historical essay on the magna charta of king john a most beautiful volume by richard thomson     note to chapter ii  note bnegro slaves  the severe accuracy of some critics has objected to the complexion of the slaves of brian de boisguilbert as being totally out of costume and propriety i remember the same objection being made to a set of sable functionaries whom my friend mat lewis introduced as the guards and mischiefdoing satellites of the wicked baron in his castle spectre mat treated the objection with great contempt and averred in reply that he made the slaves black in order to obtain a striking effect of contrast and that could he have derived a similar advantage from making his heroine blue blue she should have been  i do not pretend to plead the immunities of my order so highly as this but neither will i allow that the author of a modern antique romance is obliged to confine himself to the introduction of those manners only which can be proved to have absolutely existed in the times he is depicting so that he restrain himself to such as are plausible and natural and contain no obvious anachronism in this point of view what can be more natural than that the templars who we know copied closely the luxuries of the asiatic warriors with whom they fought should use the service of the enslaved africans whom the fate of war transferred to new masters i am sure if there are no precise proofs of their having done so there is nothing on the other hand that can entitle us positively to conclude that they never did besides there is an instance in romance  john of rampayne an excellent juggler and minstrel undertook to effect the escape of one audulf de bracy by presenting himself in disguise at the court of the king where he was confined for this purpose he stained his hair and his whole body entirely as black as jet so that nothing was white but his teeth and succeeded in imposing himself on the king as an ethiopian minstrel he effected by stratagem the escape of the prisoner negroes therefore must have been known in england in the dark ages 60     note to chapter xvii  note cminstrelsy  the realm of france it is well known was divided betwixt the norman and teutonic race who spoke the language in which the word yes is pronounced as oui and the inhabitants of the southern regions whose speech bearing some affinity to the italian pronounced the same word oc the poets of the former race were called minstrels and their poems lays those of the latter were termed troubadours and their compositions called sirventes and other names richard a professed admirer of the joyous science in all its branches could imitate either the minstrel or troubadour it is less likely that he should have been able to compose or sing an english ballad yet so much do we wish to assimilate him of the lion heart to the band of warriors whom he led that the anachronism if there be one may readily be forgiven     note to chapter xxi  note dbattle of stamford  a great topographical blunder occurred here in former editions the bloody battle alluded to in the text fought and won by king harold over his brother the rebellious tosti and an auxiliary force of danes or norsemen was said in the text and a corresponding note to have taken place at stamford in leicestershire and upon the river welland this is a mistake into which the author has been led by trusting to his memory and so confounding two places of the same name the stamford strangford or staneford at which the battle really was fought is a ford upon the river derwent at the distance of about seven miles from york and situated in that large and opulent county a long wooden bridge over the derwent the site of which with one remaining buttress is still shown to the curious traveller was furiously contested one norwegian long defended it by his single arm and was at length pierced with a spear thrust through the planks of the bridge from a boat beneath  the neighbourhood of stamford on the derwent contains some memorials of the battle horseshoes swords and the heads of halberds or bills are often found there one place is called the danes well another the battle flats from a tradition that the weapon with which the norwegian champion was slain resembled a pear or as others say that the trough or boat in which the soldier floated under the bridge to strike the blow had such a shape the country people usually begin a great market which is held at stamford with an entertainment called the pearpie feast which after all may be a corruption of the spearpie feast for more particulars drakes history of york may be referred to the authors mistake was pointed out to him in the most obliging manner by robert belt esq of bossal house the battle was fought in 1066     note to chapter xxii  note ethe range of iron bars above that glowing charcoal  this horrid species of torture may remind the reader of that to which the spaniards subjected guatimozin in order to extort a discovery of his concealed wealth but in fact an instance of similar barbarity is to be found nearer home and occurs in the annals of queen marys time containing so many other examples of atrocity every reader must recollect that after the fall of the catholic church and the presbyterian church government had been established by law the rank and especially the wealth of the bishops abbots priors and so forth were no longer vested in ecclesiastics but in lay impropriators of the church revenues or as the scottish lawyers called them titulars of the temporalities of the benefice though having no claim to the spiritual character of their predecessors in office  of these laymen who were thus invested with ecclesiastical revenues some were men of high birth and rank like the famous lord james stewart the prior of st andrews who did not fail to keep for their own use the rents lands and revenues of the church but if on the other hand the titulars were men of inferior importance who had been inducted into the office by the interest of some powerful person it was generally understood that the new abbot should grant for his patrons benefit such leases and conveyances of the church lands and tithes as might afford their protector the lions share of the booty this was the origin of those who were wittily termed tulchan 61  bishops being a sort of imaginary prelate whose image was set up to enable his patron and principal to plunder the benefice under his name  there were other cases however in which men who had got grants of these secularised benefices were desirous of retaining them for their own use without having the influence sufficient to establish their purpose and these became frequently unable to protect themselves however unwilling to submit to the exactions of the feudal tyrant of the district  bannatyne secretary to john knox recounts a singular course of oppression practised on one of those titulars abbots by the earl of cassilis in ayrshire whose extent of feudal influence was so wide that he was usually termed the king of carrick we give the fact as it occurs in bannatynes journal only premising that the journalist held his masters opinions both with respect to the earl of cassilis as an opposer of the kings party and as being a detester of the practice of granting church revenues to titulars instead of their being devoted to pious uses such as the support of the clergy expense of schools and the relief of the national poor he mingles in the narrative therefore a well deserved feeling of execration against the tyrant who employed the torture which a tone of ridicule towards the patient as if after all it had not been ill bestowed on such an equivocal and amphibious character as a titular abbot he entitles his narrative  the earl of cassilis tyranny against a quick ie living man  master allan stewart friend to captain james stewart of cardonall by means of the queens corrupted court obtained the abbey of crossraguel the said earl thinking himself greater than any king in those quarters determined to have that whole benefice as he hath divers others to pay at his pleasure and because he could not find sic security as his insatiable appetite required this shift was devised the said mr allan being in company with the laird of bargany also a kennedy was by the earl and his friends enticed to leave the safeguard which he had with the laird and come to make good cheer with the said earl the simplicity of the imprudent man was suddenly abused and so he passed his time with them certain days which he did in maybole with thomas kennedie uncle to the said earl after which the said mr allan passed with quiet company to visit the place and bounds of crossraguel his abbacy of which the said earl being surely advertised determined to put in practice the tyranny which long before he had conceived and so as king of the country apprehended the said mr allan and carried him to the house of denure where for a season he was honourably treated if a prisoner can think any entertainment pleasing but after that certain days were spent and that the earl could not obtain the feus of crossraguel according to his own appetite he determined to prove if a collation could work that which neither dinner nor supper could do for a long time and so the said mr allan was carried to a secret chamber with him passed the honourable earl his worshipful brother and such as were appointed to be servants at that banquet in the chamber there was a grit iron chimlay under it a fire other grit provision was not seen the first course wasmy lord abbot said the earl it will please you confess here that with your own consent you remain in my company because ye durst not commit yourself to the hands of others the abbot answered would you my lord that i should make a manifest lie for your pleasure the truth is my lord it is against my will that i am here neither yet have i any pleasure in your company but ye shall remain with me nevertheless at this time said the earl i am not able to resist your will and pleasure said the abbot in this place ye must then obey me said the earland with that were presented unto him certain letters to subscribe amongst which there was a five years tack and a nineteen years tack and a charter of feu of all the lands of crossraguel with all the clauses necessary for the earl to haste him to hell for if adultery sacrilege oppression barbarous cruelty and theft heaped upon theft deserve hell the great king of carrick can no more escape hell for ever than the imprudent abbot escaped the fire for a season as follows  after that the earl spied repugnance and saw that he could not come to his purpose by fair means he commanded his cooks to prepare the banquet and so first they flayed the sheep that is they took off the abbots cloathes even to his skin and next they bound him to the chimneyhis legs to the one end and his arms to the other and so they began to beet ie feed the fire sometimes to his buttocks sometimes to his legs sometimes to his shoulders and arms and that the roast might not burn but that it might rest in soppe they spared not flambing with oil basting as a cook bastes roasted meat lord look thou to sic cruelty and that the crying of the miserable man should not be heard they dosed his mouth that the voice might be stopped it may be suspected that some partisan of the kings darnleys murder was there in that torment they held the poor man till that often he cried for gods sake to dispatch him for he had as meikle gold in his awin purse as would buy powder enough to shorten his pain the famous king of carrick and his cooks perceiving the roast to be aneuch commanded it to be tane fra the fire and the earl himself began the grace in this mannerbenedicite jesus maria you are the most obstinate man that ever i saw gif i had known that ye had been so stubborn i would not for a thousand crowns have handled you so i never did so to man before you and yet he returned to the same practice within two days and ceased not till that he obtained his formost purpose that is that he had got all his pieces subscryvit alsweill as ane halfroasted hand could do it the earl thinking himself sure enough so long as he had the halfroasted abbot in his own keeping and yet being ashamed of his presence by reason of his former cruelty left the place of denure in the hands of certain of his servants and the halfroasted abbot to be kept there as prisoner the laird of bargany out of whose company the said abbot had been enticed understanding not the extremity but the retaining of the man sent to the court and raised letters of deliverance of the person of the man according to the order which being disobeyed the said earl for his contempt was denounced rebel and put to the horne but yet hope was there none neither to the afflicted to be delivered neither yet to the purchaser ie procurer of the letters to obtain any comfort thereby for in that time god was despised and the lawful authority was contemned in scotland in hope of the sudden return and regiment of that cruel murderer of her awin husband of whose lords the said earl was called one and yet oftener than once he was solemnly sworn to the king and to his regent  the journalist then recites the complaint of the injured allan stewart commendator of crossraguel to the regent and privy council averring his having been carried partly by flattery partly by force to the black vault of denure a strong fortalice built on a rock overhanging the irish channel where to execute leases and conveyances of the whole churches and parsonages belonging to the abbey of crossraguel which he utterly refused as an unreasonable demand and the more so that he had already conveyed them to john stewart of cardonah by whose interest he had been made commendator the complainant proceeds to state that he was after many menaces stript bound and his limbs exposed to fire in the manner already described till compelled by excess of agony he subscribed the charter and leases presented to him of the contents of which he was totally ignorant a few days afterwards being again required to execute a ratification of these deeds before a notary and witnesses and refusing to do so he was once more subjected to the same torture until his agony was so excessive that he exclaimed fye on you why do you not strike your whingers into me or blow me up with a barrel of powder rather than torture me thus unmercifully upon which the earl commanded alexander richard one of his attendants to stop the patients mouth with a napkin which was done accordingly thus he was once more compelled to submit to their tyranny the petition concluded with stating that the earl under pretence of the deeds thus iniquitously obtained had taken possession of the whole place and living of crossraguel and enjoyed the profits thereof for three years  the doom of the regent and council shows singularly the total interruption of justice at this calamitous period even in the most clamant cases of oppression the council declined interference with the course of the ordinary justice of the county which was completely under the said earl of cassilis control and only enacted that he should forbear molestation of the unfortunate comendator under the surety of two thousand pounds scots the earl was appointed also to keep the peace towards the celebrated george buchanan who had a pension out of the same abbacy to a similar extent and under the like penalty  the consequences are thus described by the journalist already quoted  the said laird of bargany perceiving that the ordiner justice could neither help the oppressed nor yet the afflicted applied his mind to the next remedy and in the end by his servants took the house of denure where the poor abbot was kept prisoner the bruit flew fra carrick to galloway and so suddenly assembled herd and hyreman that pertained to the band of the kennedies and so within a few hours was the house of denure environed again the master of cassilis was the frackast ie the readiest or boldest and would not stay but in his heat would lay fire to the dungeon with no small boasting that all enemies within the house should die  he was required and admonished by those that were within to be more moderate and not to hazard himself so foolishly but no admonition would help till that the wind of an hacquebute blasted his shoulder and then ceased he from further pursuit in fury the laird of bargany had before purchest obtained of the authorities letters charging all faithfull subjects to the kings majesty to assist him against that cruel tyrant and mansworn traitor the earl of cassilis which letters with his private writings he published and shortly found sic concurrence of kyle and cunynghame with his other friends that the carrick company drew back fra the house and so the other approached furnished the house with more men delivered the said mr allan and carried him to ayr where publicly at the market cross of the said town he declared how cruelly he was entreated and how the murdered king suffered not sic torment as he did excepting only he escaped the death and therefore publickly did revoke all things that were done in that extremity and especially revoked the subscription of the three writings to wit of a fyve yeir tack and nineteen year tack and of a charter of feu and so the house remained and remains till this day the 7th of february 1571 in the custody of the said laird of bargany and of his servants and so cruelty was disappointed of proffeit present and shall be eternallie punished unless he earnestly repent and this far for the cruelty committed to give occasion unto others and to such as hate the monstrous dealing of degenerate nobility to look more diligently upon their behaviuours and to paint them forth unto the world that they themselves may be ashamed of their own beastliness and that the world may be advertised and admonished to abhor detest and avoid the company of all sic tyrants who are not worthy of the society of men but ought to be sent suddenly to the devil with whom they must burn without end for their contempt of god and cruelty committed against his creatures let cassilis and his brother be the first to be the example unto others amen amen 62  this extract has been somewhat amended or modernized in orthography to render it more intelligible to the general reader i have to add that the kennedies of bargany who interfered in behalf of the oppressed abbot were themselves a younger branch of the cassilis family but held different politics and were powerful enough in this and other instances to bid them defiance  the ultimate issue of this affair does not appear but as the house of cassilis are still in possession of the greater part of the feus and leases which belonged to crossraguel abbey it is probable the talons of the king of carrick were strong enough in those disorderly times to retain the prey which they had so mercilessly fixed upon  i may also add that it appears by some papers in my possession that the officers or country keepers on the border were accustomed to torment their prisoners by binding them to the iron bars of their chimneys to extort confession     note to chapter xxix  note fheraldry  the author has been here upbraided with false heraldry as having charged metal upon metal it should be remembered however that heraldry had only its first rude origin during the crusades and that all the minutiae of its fantastic science were the work of time and introduced at a much later period those who think otherwise must suppose that the goddess of armoirers like the goddess of arms sprung into the world completely equipped in all the gaudy trappings of the department she presides over  additional note  in corroboration of said note it may be observed that the arms which were assumed by godfrey of boulogne himself after the conquest of jerusalem was a cross counter patent cantoned with four little crosses or upon a field azure displaying thus metal upon metal the heralds have tried to explain this undeniable fact in different modesbut ferne gallantly contends that a prince of godfreys qualities should not be bound by the ordinary rules the scottish nisbet and the same ferne insist that the chiefs of the crusade must have assigned to godfrey this extraordinary and unwonted coatofarms in order to induce those who should behold them to make enquiries and hence give them the name of arma inquirenda but with reverence to these grave authorities it seems unlikely that the assembled princes of europe should have adjudged to godfrey a coat armorial so much contrary to the general rule if such rule had then existed at any rate it proves that metal upon metal now accounted a solecism in heraldry was admitted in other

chapter xxxiii  note ihedgepriests  it is curious to observe that in every state of society some sort of ghostly consolation is provided for the members of the community though assembled for purposes diametrically opposite to religion a gang of beggars have their patrico and the banditti of the apennines have among them persons acting as monks and priests by whom they are confessed and who perform

play of sir john oldcastle and the famous friar of robin hoods band nor were such characters ideal there exists a monition of the bishop of durham against irregular churchmen of this class who associated themselves with border robbers and desecrated the holiest offices of the priestly function by celebrating them for the benefit of thieves robbers and murderers amongst ruins and in caverns of the earth without regard to canonical form and with torn and dirty attire and maimed rites altogether improper for the occasion     note to chapter xli  note jcastle of coningsburgh  when i last saw this interesting ruin of ancient days one of the very few remaining examples of saxon fortification i was strongly impressed with the desire of tracing out a sort of theory on the subject which from some recent acquaintance with the architecture of the ancient scandinavians seemed to me peculiarly interesting i was however obliged by circumstances to proceed on my journey without leisure to take more than a transient view of coningsburgh yet the idea dwells so strongly in my mind that i feel considerably tempted to write a page or two in detailing at least the outline of my hypothesis leaving better antiquaries to correct or refute conclusions which are perhaps too hastily drawn  those who have visited the zetland islands are familiar with the description of castles called by the inhabitants burghs and by the highlandersfor they are also to be found both in the western isles and on the mainlandduns pennant has engraved a view of the famous dundornadilla in glenelg and there are many others all of them built after a peculiar mode of architecture which argues a people in the most primitive state of society the most perfect specimen is that upon the island of mousa near to the mainland of zetland which is probably in the same state as when inhabited  it is a single round tower the wall curving in slightly and then turning outward again in the form of a dicebox so that the defenders on the top might the better protect the base it is formed of rough stones selected with care and laid in courses or circles with much compactness but without cement of any kind the tower has never to appearance had roofing of any sort a fire was made in the centre of the space which it encloses and originally the building was probably little more than a wall drawn as a sort of screen around the great council fire of the tribe but although the means or ingenuity of the builders did not extend so far as to provide a roof they supplied the want by constructing apartments in the interior of the walls of the tower itself the circumvallation formed a double enclosure the inner side of which was in fact two feet or three feet distant from the other and connected by a concentric range of long flat stones thus forming a series of concentric rings or stories of various heights rising to the top of the tower each of these stories or galleries has four windows facing directly to the points of the compass and rising of course regularly above each other these four perpendicular ranges of windows admitted air and the fire being kindled heat or smoke at least to each of the galleries the access from gallery to gallery is equally primitive a path on the principle of an inclined plane turns round and round the building like a screw and gives access to the different stories intersecting each of them in its turn and thus gradually rising to the top of the wall of the tower on the outside there are no windows and i may add that an enclosure of a square or sometimes a round form gave the inhabitants of the burgh an opportunity to secure any sheep or cattle which they might possess  such is the general architecture of that very early period when the northmen swept the seas and brought to their rude houses such as i have described them the plunder of polished nations in zetland there are several scores of these burghs occupying in every case capes headlands islets and similar places of advantage singularly well chosen i remember the remains of one upon an island in a small lake near lerwick which at high tide communicates with the sea the access to which is very ingenious by means of a causeway or dike about three or four inches under the surface of the water this causeway makes a sharp angle in its approach to the burgh the inhabitants doubtless were well acquainted with this but strangers who might approach in a hostile manner and were ignorant of the curve of the causeway would probably plunge into the lake which is six or seven feet in depth at the least this must have been the device of some vauban or cohorn of those early times  the style of these buildings evinces that the architect possessed neither the art of using lime or cement of any kind nor the skill to throw an arch construct a roof or erect a stair and yet with all this ignorance showed great ingenuity in selecting the situation of burghs and regulating the access to them as well as neatness and regularity in the erection since the buildings themselves show a style of advance in the arts scarcely consistent with the ignorance of so many of the principal branches of architectural knowledge  i have always thought that one of the most curious and valuable objects of antiquaries has been to trace the progress of society by the efforts made in early ages to improve the rudeness of their first expedients until they either approach excellence or as is more frequently the case are supplied by new and fundamental discoveries which supersede both the earlier and ruder system and the improvements which have been ingrafted upon it for example if we conceive the recent discovery of gas to be so much improved and adapted to domestic use as to supersede all other modes of producing domestic light we can already suppose some centuries afterwards the heads of a whole society of antiquaries half turned by the discovery of a pair of patent snuffers and by the learned theories which would be brought forward to account for the form and purpose of so singular an implement  following some such principle i am inclined to regard the singular castle of coningsburghi mean the saxon part of itas a step in advance from the rude architecture if it deserves the name which must have been common to the saxons as to other northmen the builders had attained the art of using cement and of roofing a buildinggreat improvements on the original burgh but in the round keep a shape only seen in the most ancient castlesthe chambers excavated in the thickness of the walls and buttressesthe difficulty by which access is gained from one story to those above it coningsburgh still retains the simplicity of its origin and shows by what slow degrees man proceeded from occupying such rude and inconvenient lodgings as were afforded by the galleries of the castle of mousa to the more splendid accommodations of the norman castles with all their stern and gothic graces  i am ignorant if these remarks are new or if they will be confirmed by closer examination but i think that on a hasty observation coningsburgh offers means of curious study to those who may wish to trace the history of architecture back to the times preceding the norman conquest  it would be highly desirable that a cork model should be taken of the castle of mousa as it cannot be well understood by a plan  the castle of coningsburgh is thus described  the castle is large the outer walls standing on a pleasant ascent from the river but much overtopt by a high hill on which the town stands situated at the head of a rich and magnificent vale formed by an amphitheatre of woody hills in which flows the gentle don near the castle is a barrow said to be hengists tomb the entrance is flanked to the left by a round tower with a sloping base and there are several similar in the outer wall the entrance has piers of a gate and on the east side the ditch and bank are double and very steep on the top of the churchyard wall is a tombstone on which are cut in high relief two ravens or suchlike birds on the south side of the churchyard lies an ancient stone ridged like a coffin on which is carved a man on horseback and another man with a shield encountering a vast winged serpent and a man bearing a shield behind him it was probably one of the rude crosses not uncommon in churchyards in this county see it engraved on the plate of crosses for this volume plate 14 fig 1 the name of coningsburgh by which this castle goes in the old editions of the britannia would lead one to suppose it the residence of the saxon kings it afterwards belonged to king harold the conqueror bestowed it on william de warren with all its privileges and jurisdiction which are said to have extended over twentyeight towns at the corner of the area which is of an irregular form stands the great tower or keep placed on a small hill of its own dimensions on which lies six vast projecting buttresses ascending in a steep direction to prop and support the building and continued upwards up the side as turrets the tower within forms a complete circle twentyone feet in diameter the walls fourteen feet thick the ascent into the tower is by an exceeding deep flight of steep steps four feet and a half wide on the south side leading to a low doorway over which is a circular arch crossed by a great transom stone within this door is the staircase which ascends straight through the thickness of the wall not communicating with the room on the first floor in whose centre is the opening to
