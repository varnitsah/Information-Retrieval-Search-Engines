59547175	early kings of norway  by thomas carlyle   transcribers note the text has been taken from volume 19 of the sterling edition of carlyles complete works all footnotes have been collected as endnotes the pound currency symbol has been replaced by the word pounds    the icelanders in their long winter had a great habit of writing and were and still are excellent in penmanship says dahlmann it is to this fact that any little history there is of the norse kings and their old tragedies crimes and heroisms is almost all due the icelanders it seems not only made beautiful letters on their paper or parchment but were laudably observant and desirous of accuracy and have left us such a collection of narratives sagas literally says as for quantity and quality is unexampled among rude nations snorro sturlesons history of the norse kings is built out of these old sagas and has in it a great deal of poetic fire not a little faithful sagacity applied in sifting and adjusting these old sagas and in a word deserves were it once well edited furnished with accurate maps chronological summaries c to be reckoned among the great historybooks of the world it is from these sources greatly aided by accurate learned and unwearied dahlmann 1 the german professor that the following rough notes of the early norway kings are hastily thrown together in histories of england rapins excepted next to nothing has been shown of the many and strong threads of connection between english affairs and norse    chapter i harald haarfagr  till about the year of grace 860 there were no kings in norway nothing but numerous jarlsessentially kinglets each presiding over a kind of republican or parliamentary little territory generally striving each to be on some terms of human neighborhood with those about him butin spite of fylke things folk things little parish parliaments and small combinations of these which had gradually formed themselvesoften reduced to the unhappy state of quarrel with them harald haarfagr was the first to put an end to this state of things and become memorable and profitable to his country by uniting it under one head and making a kingdom of it which it has continued to be ever since his father halfdan the black had already begun this rough but salutary processinspired by the cupidities and instincts by the faculties and opportunities which the good genius of this world beneficent often enough under savage forms and diligent at all times to diminish anarchy as the worlds worst savagery usually appoints in such casesconquest hard fighting followed by wise guidance of the conqueredbut it was harald the fairhaired his son who conspicuously carried it on and completed it haralds birthyear deathyear and chronology in general are known only by inference and computation but by the latest reckoning he died about the year 933 of our era a man of eightythree  the business of conquest lasted harald about twelve years ad 860872 in which he subdued also the vikings of the outislands orkneys shetlands hebrides and man sixty more years were given him to consolidate and regulate what he had conquered which he did with great judgment industry and success his reign altogether is counted to have been of over seventy years  the beginning of his great adventure was of a romantic characteryouthful love for the beautiful gyda a then glorious and famous young lady of those regions whom the young harald aspired to marry gyda answered his embassy and prayer in a distant lofty manner her it would not beseem to wed any jarl or poor creature of that kind let him do as gorm of denmark eric of sweden egbert of england and others had donesubdue into peace and regulation the confused contentious bits of jarls round him and become a king then perhaps she might think of his proposal till then not harald was struck with this proud answer which rendered gyda tenfold more desirable to him he vowed to let his hair grow never to cut or even to comb it till this feat were done and the peerless gyda his own he proceeded accordingly to conquer in fierce battle a jarl or two every year and at the end of twelve years had his unkempt and almost unimaginable head of hair clipt offjarl rognwald reginald of more the most valued and valuable of all his subjectjarls being promoted to this sublime barber functionafter which king harald with head thoroughly cleaned and hair grown or growing again to the luxuriant beauty that had no equal in his day brought home his gyda and made her the brightest queen in all the north he had after her in succession or perhaps even simultaneously in some cases at least six other wives and by gyda herself one daughter and four sons  harald was not to be considered a strictliving man and he had a great deal of trouble as we shall see with the tumultuous ambition of his sons but he managed his government aided by jarl rognwald and others in a large quietly potent and successful manner and it lasted in this royal form till his death after sixty years of it  these were the times of norse colonization proud norsemen flying into other lands to freer scenesto iceland to the faroe islands which were hitherto quite vacant tenanted only by some mournful hermit irish christian fakir or so still more copiously to the orkney and shetland isles the hebrides and other countries where norse squatters and settlers already were settlement of iceland we say settlement of the faroe islands and by far the notablest of all settlement of normandy by rolf the ganger ad 876 2  rolf son of rognwald 3 was lord of three little islets far north near the fjord of folden called the three vigten islands but his chief means of living was that of sea robbery which or at least rolfs conduct in which harald did not approve of in the court of harald searobbery was strictly forbidden as between haralds own countries but as against foreign countries it continued to be the one profession for a gentleman thus i read haralds own chief son king eric that afterwards was had been at sea in such employments ever since his twelfth year rolfs crime however was that in coming home from one of these expeditions his crew having fallen short of victual rolf landed with them on the shore of norway and in his strait drove in some cattle there a crime by law and proceeded to kill and eat which in a little while he heard that king harald was on foot to inquire into and punish whereupon rolf the ganger speedily got into his ships again got to the coast of france with his searobbers got infestment by the poor king of france in the fruitful shaggy desert which is since called normandy land of the northmen and there gradually felling the forests banking the rivers tilling the fields became during the next two centuries wilhelmus conquaestor the man famous to england and momentous at this day not to england alone but to all speakers of the english tongue now spread from side to side of the world in a wonderful degree tancred of hauteville and his italian normans though important too in italy are not worth naming in comparison this is a feracious earth and the grain of mustardseed will grow to miraculous extent in some cases  haralds chief helper counsellor and lieutenant was the abovementioned jarl rognwald of more who had the honor to cut haralds dreadful head of hair this rognwald was father of turfeinar who first invented peat in the orkneys finding the wood all gone there and is remembered to this day einar being come to these islands by king haralds permission to see what he could do in themislands inhabited by what miscellany of picts scots norse squatters we do not knowfound the indispensable fuel all wasted turfeinar too may be regarded as a benefactor to his kind he was it appears a bastard and got no coddling from his father who disliked him partly perhaps because he was ugly and blind of an eyegot no flattering even on his conquest of the orkneys and invention of peat here is the parting speech his father made to him on fitting him out with a longship ship of war dragonship ancient seventyfour and sending him forth to make a living for himself in the world it were best if thou never camest back for i have small hope that thy people will have honor by thee thy mothers kin throughout is slavish  harald haarfagr had a good many sons and daughters the daughters he married mostly to jarls of due merit who were loyal to him with the sons as remarked above he had a great deal of trouble they were ambitious stirring fellows and grudged at their finding so little promotion from a father so kind to his jarls searobbery by no means an adequate career for the sons of a great king two of them halfdan haaleg longleg and gudrod ljome gleam jealous of the favors won by the great jarl rognwald surrounded him in his house one night and burnt him and sixty men to death there that was the end of rognwald the invaluable jarl always true to haarfagr and distinguished in world history by producing rolf the ganger author of the norman conquest of england and turfeinar who invented peat in the orkneys whether rolf had left norway at this time there is no chronology to tell me as to rolfs surname ganger there are various hypotheses the likeliest perhaps that rolf was so weighty a man no horse small norwegian horses big ponies rather could carry him and that he usually walked having a mighty stride withal and great velocity on foot  one of these murderers of jarl rognwald quietly set himself in rognwalds place the other making for orkney to serve turfeinar in like fashion turfeinar taken by surprise fled to the mainland but returned days or perhaps weeks after ready for battle fought with halfdan put his party to flight and at next mornings light searched the island and slew all the men he found as to halfdan longleg himself in fierce memory of his own murdered father turfeinar cut an eagle on his back that is to say hewed the ribs from each side of the spine and turned them out like the wings of a spreadeagle a mode of norse vengeance fashionable at that time in extremely aggravated cases  harald haarfagr in the mean time had descended upon the rognwald scene not in mild mood towards the new jarl there indignantly dismissed said jarl and appointed a brother of rognwald brother notes dahlmann though rognwald had left other sons which done haarfagr sailed with all speed to the orkneys there to avenge that cutting of an eagle on the human back on turfeinars part turfeinar did not resist submissively met the angry haarfagr said he left it all what had been done what provocation there had been to haarfagrs own equity and greatness of mind magnanimous haarfagr inflicted a fine of sixty marks in gold which was paid in ready money by turfeinar and so the matter ended    chapter ii eric bloodaxe and brothers  in such violent courses haarfagrs sons i know not how many of them had come to an untimely end only eric the accomplished searover and three others remained to him among these four sons rather impatient for property and authority of their own king harald in his old days tried to part his kingdom in some eligible and equitable way and retire from the constant press of business now becoming burdensome to him to each of them he gave a kind of kingdom eric his eldest son to be head king and the others to be feudatory under him and pay a certain yearly contribution an arrangement which did not answer well at all headking eric insisted on his tribute quarrels arose as to the payment considerable fighting and disturbance bringing fierce destruction from king eric upon many valiant but too stubborn norse spirits and among the rest upon all his three brothers which got him from the norse populations the surname of blodaxe eric bloodaxe his title in history one of his brothers he had killed in battle before his old fathers life ended this brother was bjorn a peaceable improving trading economic underking whom the others mockingly called bjorn the chapman the greatgrandson of this bjorn became extremely distinguished by and by as saint olaf headking eric seems to have had a violent wife too she was thought to have poisoned one of her other brothersinlaw eric bloodaxe had by no means a gentle life of it in this world trained to searobbery on the coasts of england scotland ireland and france since his twelfth year  old king fairhair at the age of seventy had another son to whom was given the name of hakon his mother was a slave in fairhairs house slave by illluck of war though nobly enough born a strange adventure connects this hakon with england and king athelstan who was then entering upon his great career there short while after this hakon came into the world there entered fairhairs palace one evening as fairhair sat feasting an english ambassador or messenger bearing in his hand as gift from king athelstan a magnificent sword with gold hilt and other fine trimmings to the great harald king of norway harald took the sword drew it or was half drawing it admiringly from the scabbard when the english excellency broke into a scornful laugh ha ha thou art now the feudatory of my english king thou hast accepted the sword from him and art now his man acceptance of a sword in that manner being the symbol of investiture in those days harald looked a trifle flurried it is probable but held in his wrath and did no damage to the tricksy englishman he kept the matter in his mind however and next summer little hakon having got his weaning doneone of the prettiest healthiest little creaturesharald sent him off under charge of hauk hawk so called one of his principal warriors with order take him to england and instructions what to do with him there and accordingly one evening hauk with thirty men escorting strode into athelstans high dwelling where situated how built whether with logs like haralds i cannot specifically say into athelstans high presence and silently set the wild little cherub upon athelstans knee what is this asked athelstan looking at the little cherub this is king haralds son whom a servingmaid bore to him and whom he now gives thee as fosterchild indignant athelstan drew his sword as if to do the gift a mischief but hauk said thou hast taken him on thy knee  common symbol of adoption thou canst kill him if thou wilt but thou dost not thereby kill all the sons of harald athelstan straightway took milder thoughts brought up and carefully educated hakon from whom and this singular adventure came before very long the first tidings of christianity into norway  harald haarfagr latterly withdrawn from all kinds of business died at the age of eightythreeabout ad 933 as is computed nearly contemporary in death with the first danish king gorm the old who had done a corresponding feat in reducing denmark under one head remarkable old men these two first kings and possessed of gifts for bringing chaos a little nearer to the form of cosmos possessed in fact of loyalties to cosmos that is to say of authentic virtues in the savage state such as have been needed in all societies at their incipience in this world a kind of virtues hugely in discredit at present but not unlikely to be needed again to the astonishment of careless persons before all is done    chapter iii hakon the good  eric bloodaxe whose practical reign is counted to have begun about ad 930 had by this time or within a year or so of this time pretty much extinguished all his brother kings and crushed down recalcitrant spirits in his violent way but had naturally become entirely unpopular in norway and filled it with silent discontent and even rage against him hakon fairhairs last son the little fosterchild of athelstan in england who had been baptized and carefully educated was come to his fourteenth or fifteenth year at his fathers death a very shining youth as athelstan saw with just pleasure so soon as the few preliminary preparations had been settled hakon furnished with a ship or two by athelstan suddenly appeared in norway got acknowledged by the peasant thing in trondhjem the news of which flew over norway like fire through dried grass says an old chronicler so that eric with his queen gunhild and seven small children had to run no other shift for eric they went to the orkneys first of all then to england and he got northumberland as earldom i vaguely hear from athelstan but eric soon died and his queen with her children went back to the orkneys in search of refuge or help to little purpose there or elsewhere from orkney she went to denmark where harald bluetooth took her poor eldest boy as fosterchild but i fear did not very faithfully keep that promise the danes had been robbing extensively during the late tumults in norway this the christian hakon now established there paid in kind and the two countries were at war so that gunhilds little boy was a welcome card in the hand of bluetooth  hakon proved a brilliant and successful king regulated many things public law among others gulething law frostthing law these are little codes of his accepted by their respective things and had a salutary effect in their time with prompt dexterity he drove back the bluetooth fosterson invasions every time they came and on the whole gained for himself the name of hakon the good these danish invasions were a frequent source of trouble to him but his greatest and continual trouble was that of extirpating heathen idolatry from norway and introducing the christian evangel in its stead his transcendent anxiety to achieve this salutary enterprise was all along his grand difficulty and stumblingblock the heathen opposition to it being also rooted and great bishops and priests from england hakon had preaching and baptizing what they could but making only slow progress much too slow for hakons zeal on the other hand every yuletide when the chief heathen were assembled in his own palace on their grand sacrificial festival there was great pressure put upon hakon as to sprinkling with horseblood drinking yulebeer eating horseflesh and the other distressing rites the whole of which hakon abhorred and with all his steadfastness strove to reject utterly sigurd jarl of lade trondhjem a liberal heathen not openly a christian was ever a wise counsellor and conciliator in such affairs and proved of great help to hakon once for example there having risen at a yulefeast loud almost stormful demand that hakon like a true man and brother should drink yulebeer with them in their sacred hightide sigurd persuaded him to comply for peaces sake at least in form hakon took the cup in his left hand excellent hot beer and with his right cut the sign of the cross above it then drank a draught yes but what is this with the kings right hand cried the company dont you see answered shifty sigurd he makes the sign of thors hammer before drinking which quenched the matter for the time  horseflesh horsebroth and the horse ingredient generally hakon all but inexorably declined by sigurds pressing exhortation and entreaty he did once take a kettle of horsebroth by the handle with a good deal of linenquilt or towel interposed and did open his lips for what of steam could insinuate itself at another time he consented to a particle of horseliver intending privately i guess to keep it outside the gullet and smuggle it away without swallowing but farther than this not even sigurd could persuade him to go at the things held in regard to this matter hakons success was always incomplete now and then it was plain failure and hakon had to draw back till a better time here is one specimen of the response he got on such an occasion curious specimen withal of antique parliamentary eloquence from an antichristian thing  at a thing of all the fylkes of trondhjem thing held at froste in that region king hakon with all the eloquence he had signified that it was imperatively necessary that all bonders and subbonders should become christians and believe in one god christ the son of mary renouncing entirely blood sacrifices and heathen idols should keep every seventh day holy abstain from labor that day and even from food devoting the day to fasting and sacred meditation whereupon by way of universal answer arose a confused universal murmur of entire dissent take away from us our old belief and also our time for labor murmured they in angry astonishment how can even the land be got tilled in that way we cannot work if we dont get food said the hand laborers and slaves it lies in king hakons blood remarked others his father and all his kindred were apt to be stingy about food though liberal enough with money at length one osbjorn or bear of the asen or gods what we now call osborne one osbjorn of medalhusin gulathal stept forward and said in a distinct manner we bonders peasant proprietors thought king hakon when thou heldest thy first thingday here in trondhjem and we took thee for our king and received our hereditary lands from thee again that we had got heaven itself but now we know not how it is whether we have won freedom or whether thou intendest anew to make us slaves with this wonderful proposal that we should renounce our faith which our fathers before us have held and all our ancestors as well first in the age of burial by burning and now in that of earth burial and yet these departed ones were much our superiors and their faith too has brought prosperity to us thee at the same time we have loved so much that we raised thee to manage all the laws of the land and speak as their voice to us all and even now it is our will and the vote of all bonders to keep that paction which thou gavest us here on the thing at froste and to maintain thee as king so long as any of us bonders who are here upon the thing has life left provided thou king wilt go fairly to work and demand of us only such things as are not impossible but if thou wilt fix upon this thing with so great obstinacy and employ force and power in that case we bonders have taken the resolution all of us to fall away from thee and to take for ourselves another head who will so behave that we may enjoy in freedom the belief which is agreeable to us now shalt thou king choose one of these two courses before the thing disperse whereupon adds the chronicle all the bonders raised a mighty shout yes we will have it so as has been said so that jarl sigurd had to intervene and king hakon to choose for the moment the milder branch of the alternative 4 at other things hakon was more or less successful all his days by such methods as there were he kept pressing forward with this great enterprise and on the whole did thoroughly shake asunder the old edifice of heathendom and fairly introduce some foundation for the new and better rule of faith and life among his people sigurd jarl of lade his wise counsellor in all these matters is also a man worthy of notice  hakons arrangements against the continual invasions of erics sons with danish bluetooth backing them were manifold and for a long time successful he appointed after consultation and consent in the various things so many warships fully manned and ready to be furnished instantly on the kings demand by each province or fjord watchfires on fit places from hill to hill all along the coast were to be carefully set up carefully maintained in readiness and kindled on any alarm of war by such methods bluetooth and cos invasions were for a long while triumphantly and even rapidly one and all of them beaten back till at length they seemed as if intending to cease altogether and leave hakon alone of them but such was not their issue after all the sons of eric had only abated under constant discouragement had not finally left off from what seemed their one great feasibility in life gunhild their mother was still with them a most contriving fierceminded irreconcilable woman diligent and urgent on them in season and out of season and as for king bluetooth he was at all times ready to help with his goodwill at least  that of the alarmfires on hakons part was found troublesome by his people sometimes it was even hurtful and provoking lighting your alarmfires and rousing the whole coast and population when it was nothing but some paltry viking with a couple of ships in short the alarmsignal system fell into disuse and good king hakon himself in the first place paid the penalty it is counted by the latest commentators to have been about ad 961 sixteenth or seventeenth year of hakons pious valiant and worthy reign being at a feast one day with many guests on the island of stord sudden announcement came to him that ships from the south were approaching in quantity and evidently ships of war this was the biggest of all the bluetooth fosterson invasions and it was fatal to hakon the good that night eyvind the skaldaspillir annihilator of all other skalds in his famed hakons song gives account and still more pertinently the always practical snorro danes in great multitude six to one as people afterwards computed springing swiftly to land and ranking themselves hakon nevertheless at once deciding not to take to his ships and run but to fight there one to six fighting accordingly in his most splendid manner and at last gloriously prevailing routing and scattering back to their ships and flight homeward these sixtoone danes during the struggle of the fight says snorro he was very conspicuous among other men and while the sun shone his bright gilded helmet glanced and thereby many weapons were directed at him one of his henchmen eyvind finnson ie skaldaspillir the poet took a hat and put it over the kings helmet now among the hostile first leaders were two uncles of the ericsons brothers of gunhild great champions both skreya the elder of them on the disappearance of the glittering helmet shouted boastfully does the king of the norsemen hide himself then or has he fled where now is the golden helmet and so saying skreya and his brother alf with him pushed on like fools or madmen the king said come on in that way and you shall find the king of the norsemen and in a short space of time braggart skreya did come up swinging his sword and made a cut at the king but thoralf the strong an icelander who fought at the kings side dashed his shield so hard against skreya that he tottered with the shock on the same instant the king takes his sword quernbiter able to cut querns or millstones with both hands and hews skreya through helm and head cleaving him down to the shoulders thoralf also slew alf that was what they got by such overhasty search for the king of the norsemen 5  snorro considers the fall of these two champion uncles as the crisis of the fight the danish force being much disheartened by such a sight and king hakon now pressing on so hard that all men gave way before him the battle on the ericson part became a whirl of recoil and in a few minutes more a torrent of mere flight and haste to get on board their ships and put to sea again in which operation many of them were drowned says snorro survivors making instant sail for denmark in that sad condition  this seems to have been king hakons finest battle and the most conspicuous of his victories due not a little to his own grand qualities shown on the occasion but alas it was his last also he was still zealously directing the chase of that mad danish flight or whirl of recoil towards their ships when an arrow shot most likely at a venture hit him under the left armpit and this proved his death  he was helped into his ship and made sail for alrekstad where his chief residence in those parts was but had to stop at a smaller place of his which had been his mothers and where he himself was borna place called hella the flat rock still known as hakons hella faint from loss of blood and crushed down as he had never before felt having no son and only one daughter he appointed these invasive sons of eric to be sent for and if he died to become king but to spare his friends and kindred if a longer life be granted me he said i will go out of this land to christian men and do penance for what i have committed against god but if i die in the country of the heathen let me have such burial as you yourselves think fittest these are his last recorded words and in heathen fashion he was buried and besung by eyvind and the skalds though himself a zealously christian king hakon the good so one still finds him worthy of being called the sorrow on hakons death snorro tells us was so great and universal that he was lamented both by friends and enemies and they said that never again would norway see such a king    chapter iv harald greyfell and brothers  erics sons four or five of them with a harald at the top now at once got norway in hand all of it but trondhjem as king and underkings and made a severe time of it for those who had been or seemed to be their enemies excellent jarl sigurd always so useful to hakon and his country was killed by them and they came to repent that before very long the slain sigurd left a son hakon as jarl who became famous in the northern world by and by this hakon and him only would the trondhjemers accept as sovereign death to him then said the sons of eric but only in secret till they had got their hands free and were ready which was not yet for some years nay hakon when actually attacked made good resistance and threatened to cause trouble nor did he by any means get his death from these sons of eric at this time or till long afterwards at all from one of their kin as it chanced on the contrary he fled to denmark now and by and by managed to come back to their cost  among their other chief victims were two cousins of their own tryggve and gudrod who had been honest underkings to the late headking hakon the good but were now become suspect and had to fight for their lives and lose them in a tragic manner tryggve had a son whom we shall hear of gudrod son of worthy bjorn the chapman was grandfather of saint olaf whom all men have heard ofwho has a church in southwark even and another in old jewry to this hour in all these violences gunhild widow of the late king eric was understood to have a principal hand she had come back to norway with her sons and naturally passed for the secret adviser and maternal president in whatever of violence went on always reckoned a fell vehement relentless personage where her own interests were concerned probably as things settled her influence on affairs grew less at least one hopes so and in the sagas hears less and less of her and before long nothing  harald the headking in this eric fraternity does not seem to have been a bad manthe contrary indeed but his position was untowardly full of difficulty and contradictions whatever harald could accomplish for behoof of christianity or real benefit to norway in these cross circumstances he seems to have done in a modest and honest manner he got the name of greyfell from his people on a very trivial account but seemingly with perfect good humor on their part some iceland trader had brought a cargo of furs to trondhjem lade for sale sale being slacker than the icelander wished he presented a chosen specimen cloak doublet or whatever it was to harald who wore it with acceptance in public and rapidly brought disposal of the icelanders stock and the surname of greyfell to himself his underkings and he were certainly not popular though i almost think greyfell himself in absence of his mother and the underkings might have been so but here they all were and had wrought great trouble in norway too many of them said everybody too many of these courts and court people eating up any substance that there is for the seasons withal two or three of them in succession were bad for grass much more for grain no herring came either very cleanness of teeth was like to come in eyvind skaldaspillirs opinion this scarcity became at last their share of the great famine of ad 975 which desolated western europe see the poem in the saxon chronicle and all this by eyvind skaldaspillir and the heathen norse in general was ascribed to anger of the heathen gods discontent in norway and especially in eyvind skaldaspillir seems to have been very great  whereupon exile hakon jarl sigurds son bestirs himself in denmark backed by old king bluetooth and begins invading and encroaching in a miscellaneous way especially intriguing and contriving plots all round him an unfathomably cunning kind of fellow as well as an audacious and stronghanded intriguing in trondhjem where he gets the underking greyfells brother fallen upon and murdered intriguing with gold harald a distinguished cousin or nephew of king bluetooths who had done fine viking work and gained such wealth that he got the epithet of gold and who now was infinitely desirous of a share in bluetooths kingdom as the proper finish to these searovings he even ventured one day to make publicly a distinct proposal that way to king harald bluetooth himself who flew into thunder and lightning at the mere mention of it so that none durst speak to him for several days afterwards of both these haralds hakon was confidential friend and needed all his skill to walk without immediate annihilation between such a pair of dragons and work out norway for himself withal in the end he found he must take solidly to bluetooths side of the question and that they two must provide a recipe for gold harald and norway both at once  it is as much as your life is worth to speak again of sharing this danish kingdom said hakon very privately to gold harald but could not you my golden friend be content with norway for a kingdom if one helped you to it  that could i well answered harald  then keep me those nine warships you have just been rigging for a new viking cruise have these in readiness when i lift my finger  that was the recipe contrived for gold harald recipe for king greyfell goes into the same vial and is also ready  hitherto the hakonbluetooth disturbances in norway had amounted to but little king greyfell a very active and valiant man has constantly without much difficulty repelled these sporadic bits of troubles but greyfell all the same would willingly have peace with dangerous old bluetooth ever anxious to get his clutches over norway on any terms if peace with him could be had bluetooth too professes every willingness inveigles greyfell he and hakon do to have a friendly meeting on the danish borders and not only settle all these quarrels but generously settle greyfell in certain fiefs which he claimed in denmark itself and so swear everlasting friendship greyfell joyfully complies punctually appears at the appointed day in lymfjord sound the appointed place whereupon hakon gives signal to gold harald to lymfjord with these nine ships of yours swift gold harald flies to lymfjord with his ships challenges king harald greyfell to land and fight which the undaunted greyfell though so far outnumbered does and fighting his very best perishes there he and almost all his people which done jarl hakon who is in readiness attacks gold harald the victorious but the wearied easily beats gold harald takes him prisoner and instantly hangs and ends him to the huge joy of king bluetooth and hakon who now make instant voyage to norway drive all the brother underkings into rapid flight to the orkneys to any readiest shelter and so under the patronage of bluetooth hakon with the title of jarl becomes ruler of norway this foul treachery done on the brave and honest harald greyfell is by some dated about ad 969 by munch 965 by others computing out of snorro only ad 975 for there is always an uncertainty in these icelandic dates say rather rare and rude attempts at dating without even an ad or other fixed year one to go upon in iceland though seldom i think so large a discrepancy as here    chapter v hakon jarl  hakon jarl such the style he took had engaged to pay some kind of tribute to king bluetooth if he could but he never did pay any pleading always the necessity of his own affairs with which excuse joined to hakons readiness in things less important king bluetooth managed to content himself hakon being always his good neighbor at least and the two mutually dependent in norway hakon without the title of king did in a stronghanded steadfast and at length successful way the office of one governed norway some count for above twenty years and both at home and abroad had much consideration through most of that time specially amongst the heathen orthodox for hakon jarl himself was a zealous heathen fixed in his mind against these chimerical christian innovations and unsalutary changes of creed and would have gladly trampled out all traces of what the last two kings for greyfell also was an english christian after his sort had done in this respect but he wisely discerned that it was not possible and that for peaces sake he must not even attempt it but must strike preferably into perfect toleration and that of every one getting to heaven or even to the other goal in his own way he himself it is well known repaired many heathen temples a great church builder in his way manufactured many splendid idols with much gilding and such artistic ornament as there wasin particular one huge image of thor not forgetting the hammer and appendages and such a collar supposed of solid gold which it was not quite as we shall hear in time round the neck of him as was never seen in all the north how he did his own yule festivals with what magnificent solemnity the horseeatings bloodsprinklings and other sacred rites need not be told something of a ritualist one may perceive perhaps had scandinavian puseyisms in him and other desperate heathen notions he was universally believed to have gone into magic for one thing and to have dangerous potencies derived from the devil himself the dark heathen mind of him struggling vehemently in that strange element not altogether so unlike our own in some points  for the rest he was evidently in practical matters a man of sharp clear insight of steadfast resolution diligence promptitude and managed his secular matters uncommonly well had sixteen jarls under him though himself only hakon jarl by title and got obedience from them stricter than any king since haarfagr had done add to which that the country had years excellent for grass and crop and that the herrings came in exuberance tokens to the thinking mind that hakon jarl was a favorite of heaven  his fight with the farfamed jomsvikings was his grandest exploit in public rumor jomsburg a locality not now known except that it was near the mouth of the river oder denoted in those ages the impregnable castle of a certain hotly corporate or sea robbery association limited which for some generations held the baltic in terror and plundered far beyond the beltin the ocean itself in flanders and the opulent trading havens thereabove all in opulent anarchic england which for forty years from about this time was the pirates goshen and yielded regularly every summer slaves danegelt and miscellaneous plunder like no other country jomsburg or the vikingworld had ever known palnatoke bue and the other quasiheroic heads of this establishment are still remembered in the northern parts palnatoke is the title of a tragedy by oehlenschlager which had its run of immortality in copenhagen some sixty or seventy years ago  i judge the institution to have been in its floweriest state probably now in hakon jarls time hakon jarl and these pirates robbing hakons subjects and merchants that frequented him were naturally in quarrel and frequent fightings had fallen out not generally to the profit of the jomsburgers who at last determined on revenge and the rooting out of this obstructive hakon jarl they assembled in force at the cape of stadin the firda fylke and the fight was dreadful in the extreme noise of it filling all the north for long afterwards hakon fighting like a lion could scarcely hold his owndeath or victory the word on both sides when suddenly the heavens grew black and there broke out a terrific storm of thunder and hail appalling to the human minduniverse swallowed wholly in black night only the momentary forkedblazes the thunderpealing as of ragnarok and the battering hailtorrents hailstones about the size of an egg thor with his hammer evidently acting but in behalf of whom the jomsburgers in the hideous darkness broken only by flashing thunderbolts had a dismal apprehension that it was probably not on their behalf thor having a sense of justice in him and before the storm ended thirtyfive of their seventy ships sheered away leaving gallant bue with the other thirtyfive to follow as they liked who reproachfully hailed these fugitives and continued the now hopeless battle bues nose and lips were smashed or cut away bue managed halfarticulately to exclaim ha the maids mays of funen will never kiss me more overboard all ye bues men and taking his two seachests with all the gold he had gained in such lifestruggle from of old sprang overboard accordingly and finished the affair hakon jarls renown rose naturally to the transcendent pitch after this exploit his people i suppose chiefly the christian part of them whispered one to another with a shudder that in the blackest of the thunderstorm he had taken his youngest little boy and made away with him sacrificed him to thor or some devil and gained his victory by artmagic or something worse jarl eric hakons eldest son without suspicion of artmagic but already a distinguished viking became thrice distinguished by his style of seafighting in this battle and awakened great expectations in the viking public of him we shall hear again  the jomsburgers one might fancy after this sad clap went visibly down in the world but the fact is not altogether so old king bluetooth was now dead died of a wound got in battle with his unnatural socalled natural son and successor otto svein of the forked beard afterwards king and conqueror of england for a little while and seldom perhaps never had vikingism been in such flower as now this mans name is sven in swedish svend in german and means boy or ladthe english swain it was at old father bluetooths funeralale drunken burialfeast that svein carousing with his jomsburg chiefs and other choice spirits generally of the robber class all risen into height of highest robber enthusiasm pledged the vow to one another svein that he would conquer england which in a sense he after long struggling did and the jomsburgers that they would ruin and root out hakon jarl which as we have just seen they could by no means do and other guests other foolish things which proved equally unfeasible searobber volunteers so especially abounding in that time one perceives how easily the jomsburgers could recruit themselves build or refit new robber fleets man them with the pick of crews and steer for opulent fruitful england where under ethelred the unready was such a field for profitable enterprise as the viking public never had before or since  an idle question sometimes rises on meidle enough for it never can be answered in the affirmative or the negative whether it was not these same refitted jomsburgers who appeared some while after this at red head point on the shore of angus and sustained a new severe beating in what the scotch still faintly remember as their battle of loncarty beyond doubt a powerful norsepirate armament dropt anchor at the red head to the alarm of peaceable mortals about that time it was thought and hoped to be on its way for england but it visibly hung on for several days deliberating as was thought whether they would do this poorer coast the honor to land on it before going farther did land and vigorously plunder and burn southwestward as far as perth laid siege to perth but brought out king kenneth on them and produced that battle of loncarty which still dwells in vague memory among the scots perhaps it might be the jomsburgers perhaps also not for there were many pirate associations lasting not from century to century like the jomsburgers but only for very limited periods or from year to year indeed it was mainly by such that the splendid thiefharvest of england was reaped in this disastrous time no scottish chronicler gives the least of exact date to their famed victory of loncarty only that it was achieved by kenneth iii which will mean some time between ad 975 and 994 and by the order they put it in probably soon after ad 975 or the beginning of this kenneths reign buchanans narrative carefully distilled from all the ancient scottish sources is of admirable quality for style and otherwise quiet brief with perfect clearness perfect credibility even except that semimiraculous appendage of the ploughmen hay and sons always hanging to the tail of it the grain of possible truth in which can now never be extracted by mans art 6 in brief what we know is fragments of ancient human bones and armor have occasionally been ploughed up in this locality proof positive of ancient fighting here and the fight fell out not long after hakons beating of the jomsburgers at the cape of stad and in such dim glimmer of wavering twilight the question whether these of loncarty were refitted jomsburgers or not must be left hanging loncarty is now the biggest bleachfield in queen victorias dominions no village or hamlet there only the huge bleachinghouse and a beautiful field some six or seven miles northwest of perth bordered by the beautiful tay river on the one side and by its beautiful tributary almond on the other a loncarty fitted either for bleaching linen or for a bit of fair duel between nations in those simple times  whether our refitted jomsburgers had the least thing to do with it is only matter of fancy but if it were they who here again got a good beating fancy would be glad to find herself fact the old piratical kings of denmark had been at the founding of jomsburg and to svein of the forked beard it was still vitally important but not so to the great knut or any king that followed all of whom had better business than mere thieving and it was magnus the good of norway a man of still higher antianarchic qualities that annihilated it about a century later  hakon jarl his chief labors in the world being over is said to have become very dissolute in his elder days especially in the matter of women the wretched old fool led away by idleness and fulness of bread which to all of us are well said to be the parents of mischief having absolute power he got into the habit of openly plundering mens pretty daughters and wives from them and after a few weeks sending them back greatly to the rage of the fierce norse heart had there been any means of resisting or revenging it did after a little while prove the ruin and destruction of hakon the rich as he was then called it opened the door namely for entry of olaf tryggveson upon the scenea very much grander man in regard to whom the wiles and traps of hakon proved to be a recipe not on tryggveson but on the wily hakon himself as shall now be seen straightway    chapter vi olaf tryggveson  hakon in late times had heard of a famous stirring person victorious in various lands and seas latterly united in searobbery with svein prince royal of denmark afterwards king svein of the doublebeard zvae skiaeg twa shag or forkbeard both of whom had already done transcendent feats in the viking way during this copartnery the fame of svein and this stirring personage whose name was ole and recently their stupendous feats in plunder of england siege of london and other wonders and splendors of viking glory and success had gone over all the north awakening the attention of hakon and everybody there the name of ole was enigmatic mysterious and even dangerouslooking to hakon jarl who at length sent out a confidential spy to investigate this ole a feat which the confidential spy did completely accomplishby no means to hakons profit the mysterious ole proved to be no other than olaf son of tryggve destined to blow hakon jarl suddenly into destruction and become famous among the heroes of the norse world  of olaf tryggveson one always hopes there might one day some real outline of a biography be written fished from the abysses where as usual it welters deep in foul neighborhood for the present farther on we intend a few words more upon the matter but in this place all that concerns us in it limits itself to the two following facts first that hakons confidential spy found ole in dublin picked acquaintance with him got him to confess that he was actually olaf son of tryggve the tryggve whom bloodaxes fierce widow and her sons had murdered got him gradually to own that perhaps an expedition into norway might have its chances and finally that under such a wise and loyal guidance as his the confidential spys whose friendship for tryggveson was so indubitable he tryggveson would actually try it upon hakon jarl the dissolute old scoundrel fact second is that about the time they two set sail from dublin on their norway expedition hakon jarl removed to trondhjem then called lade intending to pass some months there  now just about the time when tryggveson spy and party had landed in norway and were advancing upon lade with what support from the public could be got dissolute old hakon jarl had heard of one gudrun a bonders wife unparalleled in beauty who was called in those parts sunbeam of the grove so inexpressibly lovely and sent off a couple of thralls to bring her to him never answered gudrun never her indignant husband in a tone dangerous and displeasing to these court thralls who had to leave rapidly but threatened to return in better strength before long whereupon instantly the indignant bonder and his sunbeam of the grove sent out their wararrow rousing all the country into angry promptitude and more than one perhaps into greedy hope of revenge for their own injuries the rest of hakons history now rushes on with extreme rapidity  sunbeam of the grove when next demanded of her bonder has the whole neighborhood assembled in arms round her rumor of tryggveson is fast making it the whole country hakons insolent messengers are cut in pieces hakon finds he cannot fly under cover too soon with a single slave he flies that same nightbut whitherward can think of no safe place except to some old mistress of his who lives retired in that neighborhood and has some pity or regard for the wicked old hakon old mistress does receive him pities him will do all she can to protect and hide him but how by what uttermost stretch of female artifice hide him here every one will search here first of all old mistress by the slaves help extemporizes a cellar under the floor of her pighouse sticks hakon and slave into that as the one safe seclusion she can contrive hakon and slave begrunted by the pigs above them tortured by the devils within and about them passed two days in circumstances more and more horrible for they heard through their lightslit and breathingslit the triumph of tryggveson proclaiming itself by tryggvesons own lips who had mounted a big boulder near by and was victoriously speaking to the people winding up with a promise of honors and rewards to whoever should bring him wicked old hakons head wretched hakon justly suspecting his slave tried to at least keep himself awake slave did keep himself awake till hakon dozed or slept then swiftly cut off hakons head and plunged out with it to the presence of tryggveson tryggveson detesting the traitor useful as the treachery was cut off the slaves head too had it hung up along with hakons on the pinnacle of the lade gallows where the populace pelted both heads with stones and many curses especially the more important of the two hakon the bad ever henceforth instead of hakon the rich  this was the end of hakon jarl the last support of heathenry in norway among other characteristics he had a stronghanded hardheaded very relentless greedy and wicked being he is reckoned to have ruled in norway or mainly ruled either in the struggling or triumphant state for about thirty years 965995 he and his seemed to have formed by chance rather than design the chief opposition which the haarfagr posterity throughout its whole course experienced in norway such the cost to them of killing good jarl sigurd in greyfells time for curses like chickens do sometimes visibly come home to feed as they always either visibly or else invisibly are punctually sure to do  hakon jarl is considerably connected with the faroer saga often mentioned there and comes out perfectly in character an altogether worldlywise man of the roughest type not without a turn for practicality of kindness to those who would really be of use to him his tendencies to magic also are not forgotten  hakon left two sons eric and svein often also mentioned in this saga on their fathers death they fled to sweden to denmark and were busy stirring up troubles in those countries against olaf tryggveson till at length by a favorable combination under their auspices chiefly they got his brief and noble reign put an end to nay furthermore jarl eric left sons especially an elder son named also eric who proved a sore affliction and a continual stone of stumbling to a new generation of haarfagrs and so continued the curse of sigurds murder upon them  towards the end of this hakons reign it was that the discovery of america took place 985 actual discovery it appears by eric the red an icelander concerning which there has been abundant investigation and discussion in our time ginnungagap roaring abyss is thought to be the mouth of behrings straits in baffins bay big helloland the coast from cape walsingham to near newfoundland little helloland newfoundland itself markland was lower canada new brunswick and nova scotia southward thence to chesapeake bay was called wine land wild grapes still grow in rhode island and more luxuriantly further south white mans land called also great ireland is supposed to mean the two carolinas down to the southern cape of florida in dahlmanns opinion the irish themselves might even pretend to have probably been the first discoverers of america they had evidently got to iceland itself before the norse exiles found it out it appears to be certain that from the end of the tenth century to the early part of the fourteenth there was a dim knowledge of those distant shores extant in the norse mind and even some straggling series of visits thither by roving norsemen though as only danger difficulty and no profit resulted the visits ceased and the whole matter sank into oblivion and but for the icelandic talent of writing in the long winter nights would never have been heard of by posterity at all    chapter vii reign of olaf tryggveson  olaf tryggveson ad 9951000 also makes a great figure in the faroer saga and recounts there his early troubles which were strange and many he is still reckoned a grand hero of the north though his vates now is only snorro sturleson of iceland tryggveson had indeed many adventures in the world his poor mother astrid was obliged to fly on murder of her husband by gunhildto fly for life three months before he her little olaf was born she lay concealed in reedy islands fled through trackless forests reached her fathers with the little baby in her arms and lay deephidden there tended only by her father himself gunhilds pursuit being so incessant and keen as with sleuthhounds poor astrid had to fly again deviously to sweden to esthland esthonia to russia in esthland she was sold as a slave quite parted from her boywho also was sold and again sold but did at last fall in with a kinsman high in the russian service did from him find redemption and help and so rose in a distinguished manner to manhood victorious selfhelp and recovery of his kingdom at last he even met his mother again he as king of norway she as one wonderfully lifted out of darkness into new life and happiness still in store  grown to manhood tryggvesonnow become acquainted with his birth and with his alas hopeless claimsleft russia for the one profession open to him that of searobbery and did feats without number in that questionable line in many seas and scenesin england latterly and most conspicuously of all in one of his courses thither after long labors in the hebrides man wales and down the western shores to the very lands end and farther he paused at the scilly islands for a little while he was told of a wonderful christian hermit living strangely in these seasolitudes had the curiosity to seek him out examine question and discourse with him and after some reflection accepted christian baptism from the venerable man in snorro the story is involved in miracle rumor and fable but the fact itself seems certain and is very interesting the great wild noble soul of fierce olaf opening to this wonderful gospel of tidings from beyond the world tidings which infinitely transcended all else he had ever heard or dreamt of it seems certain he was baptized here date not fixable shortly before poor heartbroken dunstans death or shortly after most english churches monasteries especially lying burnt under continual visitation of the danes olaf such baptism notwithstanding did not quit his viking profession indeed what other was there for him in the world as yet  we mentioned his occasional copartneries with svein of the doublebeard now become king of denmark but the greatest of these and the alone interesting at this time is their joint invasion of england and tryggvesons exploits and fortunes there some years after that adventure of baptism in the scilly isles svein and he were above a year in england together this time they steered up the thames with three hundred ships and many fighters siege or at least furious assault of london was their first or main enterprise but it did not succeed the saxon chronicle gives date to it ad 994 and names expressly as sveins copartner olaus king of norwaywhich he was as yet far from being but in regard to the year of grace the saxon chronicle is to be held indisputable and indeed has the field to itself in this matter famed olaf tryggveson seen visibly at the siege of london year 994 it throws a kind of momentary light to us over that disastrous whirlpool of miseries and confusions all dark and painful to the fancy otherwise this big voyage and furious siege of london is svein doublebeards first real attempt to fulfil that vow of his at father bluetooths funeral ale and conquer englandwhich it is a pity he could not yet do had london now fallen to him it is pretty evident all england must have followed and poor england with svein as king over it been delivered from immeasurable woes which had to last some twoandtwenty years farther before this result could be arrived at but finding london impregnable for the moment no ship able to get athwart the bridge and many danes perishing in the attempt to do it by swimming svein and olaf turned to other enterprises all england in a manner lying open to them turn which way they liked they burnt and plundered over kent over hampshire sussex they stormed far and wide world lying all before them where to choose wretched ethelred as the one invention he could fall upon offered them danegelt 16000 pounds of silver this year but it rose in other years as high as 48000 pounds the desperate ethelred a clear method of quenching fire by pouring oil on it svein and olaf accepted withdrew to southamptonolaf at least didtill the money was got ready strange to think of fierce svein of the doublebeard and conquest of england by him this had at last become the one salutary result which remained for that distracted downtrodden now utterly chaotic and anarchic country a conquering svein followed by an ably and earnestly administrative as well as conquering knut whom dahlmann compares to charlemagne were thus by the mysterious destinies appointed the effective saviors of england  tryggveson on this occasion was a good while at southampton and roamed extensively about easily victorious over everything if resistance were attempted but finding little or none and acting now in a peaceable or even friendly capacity in the southampton country he came in contact with the then bishop of winchester afterwards archbishop of canterbury excellent elphegus still dimly decipherable to us as a man of great natural discernment piety and inborn veracity a herosoul probably of real brotherhood with olafs own he even made court visits to king ethelred one visit to him at andover of a very serious nature by elphegus as we can discover he was introduced into the real depths of the christian faith elphegus with due solemnity of apparatus in presence of the king at andover baptized olaf anew and to him olaf engaged that he would never plunder in england any more which promise too he kept in fact not long after sveins conquest of england being in an evidently forward state tryggveson having made withal a great english or irish marriagea dowager princess who had voluntarily fallen in love with himsee snorro for this fine romantic fact mainly resided in our island for two or three years or else in dublin in the precincts of the danish court there in the sister isle accordingly it was in dublin as above noted that hakons spy found him and from the liffey that his squadron sailed through the hebrides through the orkneys plundering and baptizing in their strange way towards such success as we have seen  tryggveson made a stout and in effect victorious and glorious struggle for himself as king daily and hourly vigilant to do so often enough by soft and even merry methods for he was a witty jocund man and had a fine ringing laugh in him and clear pregnant words ever readyor if soft methods would not serve then by hard and even hardest he put down a great deal of miscellaneous anarchy in norway was especially busy against heathenism devilworship and its rites this indeed may be called the focus and heart of all his royal endeavor in norway and of all the troubles he now had with his people there for this was a serious vital allcomprehending matter devilworship a thing not to be tolerated one moment longer than you could by any method help olafs success was intermittent of varying complexion but his effort swift or slow was strong and continual and on the whole he did succeed take a sample or two of that wonderful conversion process  at one of his first things he found the bonders all assembled in arms resolute to the death seemingly against his proposal and him tryggveson said little waited impassive what your reasons are good men one zealous bonder started up in passionate parliamentary eloquence but after a sentence or two broke down one and then another and still another and remained all three staring in openmouthed silence there the peasantproprietors accepted the phenomenon as ludicrous perhaps partly as miraculous withal and consented to baptism this time  on another occasion of a thing which had assembled near some heathen temple to meet himtemple where hakon jarl had done much repairing and set up many idol figures and sumptuous ornaments regardless of expense especially a very big and splendid thor with massive gold collar round the neck of him not the like of it in norwayking olaf tryggveson was clamorously invited by the bonders to step in there enlighten his eyes and partake of the sacred rites instead of which he rushed into the temple with his armed men smashed down with his own battleaxe the god thor prostrate on the ground at one stroke to set an example and in a few minutes had the whole hakon pantheon wrecked packing up meanwhile all the gold and preciosities accumulated there not forgetting thors illustrious gold collar of which we shall hear again and victoriously took the plunder home with him for his own royal uses and behoof of the state in other cases though a friend to strong measures he had to hold in and await the favorable moment thus once in beginning a parliamentary address so soon as he came to touch upon christianity the bonders rose in murmurs in vociferations and jingling of arms which quite drowned the royal voice declared they had taken arms against king hakon the good to compel him to desist from his christian proposals and they did not think king olaf a higher man than him hakon the good the king then said he purposed coming to them next yule to their great sacrificial feast to see for himself what their customs were which pacified the bonders for this time the appointed place of meeting was again a hakonjarl temple not yet done to ruin chief shrine in those trondhjem parts i believe there should tryggveson appear at yule well but before yule came tryggveson made a great banquet in his palace at trondhjem and invited far and wide all manner of important persons out of the district as guests there banquet hardly done tryggveson gave some slight signal upon which armed men strode in seized eleven of these principal persons and the king said since he himself was to become a heathen again and do sacrifice it was his purpose to do it in the highest form namely that of human sacrifice and this time not of slaves and malefactors but of the best men in the country in which stringent circumstances the eleven seized persons and company at large gave unanimous consent to baptism straightway received the same and abjured their idols but were not permitted to go home till they had left in sons brothers and other precious relatives sufficient hostages in the kings hands  by unwearied industry of this and better kinds tryggveson had trampled down idolatry so far as form wenthow far in substance may be greatly doubted but it is to be remembered withal that always on the back of these compulsory adventures there followed english bishops priests and preachers whereby to the openminded conviction to all degrees of it was attainable while silence and passivity became the duty or necessity of the unconvinced party  in about two years norway was all gone over with a rough harrow of conversion heathenism at least constrained to be silent and outwardly conformable tryggveson next turned his attention to iceland sent one thangbrand priest from saxony of wonderful qualities military as well as theological to try and convert iceland thangbrand made a few converts for olaf had already many estimable iceland friends whom he liked much and was much liked by and conversion was the ready road to his favor thangbrand i find lodged with hall of sida familiar acquaintance of burnt njal whose saga has its admirers among us even now thangbrand converted hall and one or two other leading men but in general he was reckoned quarrelsome and blusterous rather than eloquent and piously convincing two skalds of repute made biting lampoons upon thangbrand whom thangbrand by two opportunities that offered cut down and did to death because of their skaldic quality another he killed with his own hand i know not for what reason in brief after about a year thangbrand returned to norway and king olaf declaring the icelanders to be a perverse satirical and inconvertible people having himself the record says been the death of three men there king olaf was in high rage at this result but was persuaded by the icelanders about him to try farther and by a wilder instrument he accordingly chose one thormod a pious patient and kindly man who within the next year or so did actually accomplish the matter namely get christianity by open vote declared at thingvalla by the general thing of iceland there the roar of a big thunderclap at the right moment rather helping the conclusion if i recollect whereupon olafs joy was no doubt great  one general result of these successful operations was the discontent to all manner of degrees on the part of many norse individuals against this glorious and victorious but peremptory and terrible king of theirs tryggveson i fancy did not much regard all that a man of joyful cheery temper habitually contemptuous of danger another trivial misfortune that befell in these conversion operations and became important to him he did not even know of and would have much despised if he had it was this sigrid queen dowager of sweden thought to be amongst the most shining women of the world was also known for one of the most imperious revengeful and relentless and had got for herself the name of sigrid the proud in her high widowhood she had naturally many wooers but treated them in a manner unexampled two of her suitors a simultaneous two were king harald graenske a cousin of king tryggvesons and kind of king in some district by sufferance of the late hakonsthis luckless graenske and the then russian sovereign as well name not worth mentioning were zealous suitors of queen dowager sigrid and were perversely slow to accept the negative which in her heart was inexorable for both though the expression of it could not be quite so emphatic by illluck for them they came oncefrom the far west graenske from the far east the russianand arrived both together at sigrids court to prosecute their importunate and to her odious and tiresome suit much how very much to her impatience and disdain she lodged them both in some old mansion which she had contiguous and got compendiously furnished for them and there i know not whether on the first or on the second or on what following night this unparalleled queen sigrid had the house surrounded set on fire and the two suitors and their people burnt to ashes no more of bother from these two at least this appears to be a fact and it could not be unknown to tryggveson  in spite of which however there went from tryggveson who was now a widower some incipient marriage proposals to this proud widow by whom they were favorably received as from the brightest man in all the world they might seem worth being now in one of these antiheathen onslaughts of king olafs on the idol temples of hakoni think it was that case where olafs own battleaxe struck down the monstrous refulgent thor and conquered an immense gold ring from the neck of him or from the door of his templea huge gold ring at any rate had come into olafs hands and this he bethought him might be a pretty present to queen sigrid the now favorable though the proud sigrid received the ring with joy fancied what a collar it would make for her own fair neck but noticed that her two goldsmiths weighing it on their fingers exchanged a glance what is that exclaimed queen sigrid nothing answered they or endeavored to answer dreading mischief but sigrid compelled them to break open the ring and there was found all along the inside of it an occult ring of copper not a heart of gold at all ha said the proud queen flinging it away he that could deceive in this matter can deceive in many others and was in hot wrath with olaf though by degrees again she took milder thoughts  milder thoughts we say and consented to a meeting next autumn at some halfway station where their great business might be brought to a happy settlement and betrothment both olaf tryggveson and the high dowager appear to have been tolerably of willing mind at this meeting but olaf interposed what was always one condition with him thou must consent to baptism and give up thy idolgods they are the gods of all my forefathers answered the lady choose thou what gods thou pleasest but leave me mine whereupon an altercation and tryggveson as was his wont towered up into shining wrath and exclaimed at last why should i care about thee then old faded heathen creature and impatiently wagging his glove hit her or slightly switched her on the face with it and contemptuously turning away walked out of the adventure this is a feat that may cost thee dear one day said sigrid and in the end it came to do so little as the magnificent olaf deigned to think of it at the moment  one of the last scuffles i remember of olafs having with his refractory heathens was at a thing in hordaland or rogaland far in the north where the chief opposition hero was one jaernskaegg ironbeard scottice airnshag as it were here again was a grand heathen temple hakon jarls building with a splendid thor in it and much idol furniture the king stated what was his constant wish here as elsewhere but had no sooner entered upon the subject of christianity than universal murmur rising into clangor and violent dissent interrupted him and ironbeard took up the discourse in reply ironbeard did not break down on the contrary he with great brevity emphasis and clearness signified that the proposal to reject their old gods was in the highest degree unacceptable to this thing that it was contrary to bargain withal so that if it were insisted on they would have to fight with the king about it and in fact were now ready to do so in reply to this olaf without word uttered but merely with some signal to the trusty armed men he had with him rushed off to the temple close at hand burst into it shutting the door behind him smashed thor and co to destruction then reappearing victorious found much confusion outside and in particular what was a most important item the rugged ironbeard done to death by olafs men in the interim which entirely disheartened the thing from fighting at that moment having now no leader who dared to head them in so dangerous an enterprise so that every one departed to digest his rage in silence as he could  matters having cooled for a week or two there was another thing held in which king olaf testified regret for the quarrel that had fallen out readiness to pay what mulct was due by law for that unlucky homicide of ironbeard by his people and withal to take the fair daughter of ironbeard to wife if all would comply and be friends with him in other matters which was the course resolved on as most convenient accept baptism we marry jaernskaeggs daughter you this bargain held on both sides the wedding too was celebrated but that took rather a strange turn on the morning of the bridenight olaf who had not been sleeping though his fair partner thought he had opened his eyes and saw with astonishment the fair partner aiming a long knife ready to strike home upon him which at once ended their wedded life poor demoiselle ironbeard immediately bundling off with her attendants home again king olaf into the apartment of his servants mentioning there what had happened and forbidding any of them to follow her  olaf tryggveson though his kingdom was the smallest of the norse three had risen to a renown over all the norse world which neither he of denmark nor he of sweden could pretend to rival a magnificent farshining man more expert in all bodily exercises as the norse call them than any man had ever been before him or after was could keep five daggers in the air always catching the proper fifth by its handle and sending it aloft again could shoot supremely throw a javelin with either hand and in fact in battle usually throw two together these with swimming climbing leaping were the then admirable fine arts of the north in all which tryggveson appears to have been the raphael and the michael angelo at once essentially definable too if we look well into him as a wild bit of real heroism in such rude guise and environment a high true and great human soul a jovial burst of laughter in him withal a bright airy wise way of speech dressed beautifully and with care a man admired and loved exceedingly by those he liked dreaded as death by those he did not like hardly any king says snorro was ever so well obeyed by one class out of zeal and love by the rest out of dread his glorious course however was not to last long  king svein of the doublebeard had not yet completed his conquest of englandby no means yet some thirteen horrid years of that still before himwhen over in denmark he found that complaints against him and intricacies had arisen on the part principally of one burislav king of the wends far up the baltic and in a less degree with the king of sweden and other minor individuals svein earnestly applied himself to settle these and have his hands free burislav an aged heathen gentleman proved reasonable and conciliatory so too the king of sweden and dowager queen sigrid his managing mother bargain in both these cases got sealed and crowned by marriage svein who had become a widower lately now wedded sigrid and might think possibly enough he had got a proud bargain though a heathen one burislav also insisted on marriage with princess thyri the doublebeards sister thyri inexpressibly disinclined to wed an aged heathen of that stamp pleaded hard with her brother but the doublebearded was inexorable thyris wailings and entreaties went for nothing with some guardian fosterbrother and a servingmaid or two she had to go on this hated journey old burislav at sight of her blazed out into marriagefeast of supreme magnificence and was charmed to see her but thyri would not join the marriage party refused to eat with it or sit with it at all day after day for six days flatly refused and after nightfall of the sixth glided out with her fosterbrother into the woods into bypaths and inconceivable wanderings and in effect got home to denmark brother svein was not for the moment there probably enough gone to england again but thyri knew too well he would not allow her to stay here or anywhere that he could help except with the old heathen she had just fled from  thyri looking round the world saw no likely road for her but to olaf tryggveson in norway to beg protection from the most heroic man she knew of in the world olaf except by renown was not known to her but by renown he well was olaf at sight of her promised protection and asylum against all mortals nay in discoursing with thyri olaf perceived more and more clearly what a fine handsome being soul and body thyri was and in a short space of time winded up by proposing marriage to thyri who humbly and we may fancy with what secret joy consented to say yes and become queen of norway in the due months they had a little son harald who it is credibly recorded was the joy of both his parents but who to their inexpressible sorrow in about a year died and vanished from them this and one other fact now to be mentioned is all the wedded history we have of thyri  the other fact is that thyri had by inheritance or covenant not depending on her marriage with old burislav considerable properties in wendland which she often reflected might be not a little behooveful to her here in norway where her civillist was probably but straitened she spoke of this to her husband but her husband would take no hold merely made her gifts and said pooh pooh cant we live without old burislav and his wendland properties so that the lady sank into ever deeper anxiety and eagerness about this wendland object took to weeping sat weeping whole days and when olaf asked what ails thee then would answer or did answer once what a different man my father harald gormson was  vulgarly called bluetooth compared with some that are now kings for no king svein in the world would harald gormson have given up his own or his wifes just rights whereupon tryggveson started up exclaiming in some heat of thy brother svein i never was afraid if svein and i meet in contest it will not be svein i believe that conquers and went off in a towering fume consented however at last had to consent to get his fine fleet equipped and armed and decide to sail with it to wendland to have speech and settlement with king burislav  tryggveson had already ships and navies that were the wonder of the north especially in building war ships the crane the serpent last of all the long serpent 7he had for size for outward beauty and inward perfection of equipment transcended all example  this new sea expedition became an object of attention to all neighbors especially queen sigrid the proud and svein doublebeard her now king were attentive to it  this insolent tryggveson queen sigrid would often say and had long been saying to her svein to marry thy sister without leave had or asked of thee and now flaunting forth his war navies as if he king only of paltry norway were the big hero of the north why do you suffer it you kings really great  by such persuasions and reiterations king svein of denmark king olaf of sweden and jarl eric now a great man there grown rich by prosperous sea robbery and other good management were brought to take the matter up and combine strenuously for destruction of king olaf tryggveson on this grand wendland expedition of his fleets and forces were with best diligence got ready and withal a certain jarl sigwald of jomsburg chieftain of the jomsvikings a powerful plausible and cunning man was appointed to find means of joining himself to tryggvesons grand voyage of getting into tryggvesons confidence and keeping svein doublebeard eric and the swedish king aware of all his movements  king olaf tryggveson unacquainted with all this sailed away in summer with his splendid fleet went through the belts with prosperous winds under bright skies to the admiration of both shores such a fleet with its shining serpents long and short and perfection of equipment and appearance the baltic never saw before jarl sigwald joined with new ships by the way had he too a visit to king burislav to pay how could he ever do it in better company and studiously and skilfully ingratiated himself with king olaf old burislav when they arrived proved altogether courteous handsome and amenable agreed at once to olafs claims for his now queen did the rites of hospitality with a generous plenitude to olaf who cheerily renewed acquaintance with that country known to him in early days the cradle of his fortunes in the viking line and found old friends there still surviving joyful to meet him again jarl sigwald encouraged these delays king svein and co not being yet quite ready get ready sigwald directed them and they diligently did olafs men their business now done were impatient to be home and grudged every day of loitering there but till sigwald pleased such his power of flattering and cajoling tryggveson they could not get away  at length sigwalds secret messengers reporting all ready on the part of svein and co olaf took farewell of burislav and wendland and all gladly sailed away svein eric and the swedish king with their combined fleets lay in wait behind some cape in a safe little bay of some island then called svolde but not in our time to be found the baltic tumults in the fourteenth century having swallowed it as some think and leaving us uncertain whether it was in the neighborhood of rugen island or in the sound of elsinore there lay svein eric and co waiting till tryggveson and his fleet came up sigwalds spy messengers daily reporting what progress he and it had made at length one bright summer morning the fleet made appearance sailing in loose order sigwald as one acquainted with the shoal places steering ahead and showing them the way  snorro rises into one of his pictorial fits seized with enthusiasm at the thought of such a fleet and reports to us largely in what order tryggvesons winged coursers of the deep in long series for perhaps an hour or more came on and what the three potentates from their knoll of vantage said of each as it hove in sight svein thrice over guessed this and the other noble vessel to be the long serpent eric always correcting him no that is not the long serpent yet and aside always nor shall you be lord of it king when it does come the long serpent itself did make appearance eric svein and the swedish king hurried on board and pushed out of their hidingplace into the open sea treacherous sigwald at the beginning of all this had suddenly doubled that cape of theirs and struck into the bay out of sight leaving the foremost tryggveson ships astonished and uncertain what to do if it were not simply to strike sail and wait till olaf himself with the long serpent arrived  olafs chief captains seeing the enemys huge fleet come out and how the matter lay strongly advised king olaf to elude this stroke of treachery and with all sail hold on his course fight being now on so unequal terms snorro says the king high on the quarterdeck where he stood replied strike the sails never shall men of mine think of flight i never fled from battle let god dispose of my life but flight i will never take and so the battle arrangements immediately began and the battle with all fury went loose and lasted hour after hour till almost sunset if i well recollect olaf stood on the serpents quarterdeck says snorro high over the others he had a gilt shield and a helmet inlaid with gold over his armor he had a short red coat and was easily distinguished from other men snorros account of the battle is altogether animated graphic and so minute that antiquaries gather from it if so disposed which we but little are what the methods of norse seafighting were their shooting of arrows casting of javelins pitching of big stones ultimately boarding and mutual clashing and smashing which it would not avail us to speak of here olaf stood conspicuous all day throwing javelins of deadly aim with both hands at once encouraging fighting and commanding like a highest seaking  the danish fleet the swedish fleet were both of them quickly dealt with and successively withdrew out of shotrange and then jarl eric came up and fiercely grappled with the long serpent or rather with her surrounding comrades and gradually as they were beaten empty of men with the long serpent herself the fight grew ever fiercer more furious eric was supplied with new men from the swedes and danes olaf had no such resource except from the crews of his own beaten ships and at length this also failed him all his ships except the long serpent being beaten and emptied olaf fought on unyielding eric twice boarded him was twice repulsed olaf kept his quarterdeck unconquerable though left now more and more hopeless fatally short of help a tall young man called einar tamberskelver very celebrated and important afterwards in norway and already the best archer known kept busy with his bow twice he nearly shot jarl eric in his ship shoot me that man said jarl eric to a bowman near him and just as tamberskelver was drawing his bow the third time an arrow hit it in the middle and broke it in two what is this that has broken asked king olaf norway from thy hand king answered tamberskelver tryggvesons men he observed with surprise were striking violently on erics but to no purpose nobody fell how is this asked tryggveson our swords are notched and blunted king they do not cut olaf stept down to his armchest delivered out new swords and it was observed as he did it blood ran trickling from his wrist but none knew where the wound was eric boarded a third time olaf left with hardly more than one man sprang overboard one sees that red coat of his still glancing in the evening sun and sank in the deep waters to his long rest  rumor ran among his people that he still was not dead grounding on some movement by the ships of that traitorous sigwald they fancied olaf had dived beneath the keels of his enemies and got away with sigwald as sigwald himself evidently did much was hoped supposed spoken says one old mourning skald but the truth was olaf tryggveson was never seen in norseland more strangely he remains still a shining figure to us the wildly beautifulest man in body and in soul that one has ever heard of in the north    chapter viii jarls eric and svein  jarl eric splendent with this victory not to speak of that over the jomsburgers with his father long ago was now made governor of norway governor or quasisovereign with his brother jarl svein as partner who however took but little hand in governingand under the patronage of svein doublebeard and the then swedish king olaf his name sigrid the proud his mothers administered it they say with skill and prudence for above fourteen years tryggvesons death is understood and laboriously computed to have happened in the year 1000 but there is no exact chronology in these things but a continual uncertain guessing after such so that one eye in history as regards them is as if put outneither indeed have i yet had the luck to find any decipherable and intelligible map of norway so that the other eye of history is much blinded withal and her path through those wild regions and epochs is an extremely dim and chaotic one an evil that much demands remedying and especially wants some first attempt at remedying by inquirers into english history the whole period from egbert the first saxon king of england on to edward the confessor the last being everywhere completely interwoven with that of their mysterious continually invasive danes as they call them and inextricably unintelligible till these also get to be a little understood and cease to be utterly dark hideous and mythical to us as they now are  king olaf tryggveson is the first norseman who is expressly mentioned to have been in england by our english history books new or old and of him it is merely said that he had an interview with king ethelred ii at andover of a pacific and friendly naturethough it is absurdly added that the noble olaf was converted to christianity by that extremely stupid royal person greater contrast in an interview than in this at andover between heroic olaf tryggveson and ethelred the forever unready was not perhaps seen in the terrestrial planet that day olaf or olaus or anlaf as they name him did engage on oath to ethelred not to invade england any more and kept his promise they farther say essentially a truth as we already know though the circumstances were all different and the promise was to a devout high priest not to a crowned blockhead and cowardly donothing one other olaus i find mentioned in our books two or three centuries before at a time when there existed no such individual not to speak of several anlafs who sometimes seem to mean olaf and still oftener to mean nobody possible which occasions not a little obscurity in our early history says the learned selden a thing remediable too in which if any englishman of due genius or even capacity for standing labor who understood the icelandic and anglosaxon languages would engage in it he might do a great deal of good and bring the matter into a comparatively lucid state vain aspirationsor perhaps not altogether vain  at the time of olaf tryggvesons death and indeed long before king svein doublebeard had always for chief enterprise the conquest of england and followed it by fits with extreme violence and impetus often advancing largely towards a successful conclusion but never for thirteen years yet getting it concluded he possessed long since all england north of watling street that is to say northumberland east anglia naturally full of danish settlers by this time were fixedly his mercia his oftener than not wessex itself with all the coasts he was free to visit and to burn and rob in at discretion there or elsewhere ethelred the unready had no battle in him whatever and for a forty years after the beginning of his reign england excelled in anarchic stupidity murderous devastation utter misery platitude and sluggish contemptibility all the countries one has read of apparently a very opulent country too a ready skill in such arts and fine arts as there were sveins very ships they say had their gold dragons topmast pennons and other metallic splendors generally wrought for them in england unexampled prosperity in the manufacture way not unknown there it would seem but coexisting with such spiritual bankruptcy as was also unexampled one would hope read lupus wulfstan archbishop of yorks amazing sermon on the subject 8 addressed to contemporary audiences setting forth such a state of thingssons selling their fathers mothers and sisters as slaves to the danish robber themselves living in debauchery blusterous gluttony and depravity the details of which are wellnigh incredible though clearly stated as things generally knownthe humor of these poor wretches sunk to a state of what we may call greasy desperation let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die the manner in which they treated their own english nuns if young goodlooking and captive to the danes buying them on a kind of brutish or subterbrutish greatest happiness principle for the moment and by a jointstock arrangement far transcends all human speech or imagination and awakens in one the momentary redhot thought the danes have served you right ye accursed the socalled soldiers one finds made not the least fight anywhere could make none led and guided as they were and the generals often enough traitors always ignorant and blockheads were in the habit when expressly commanded to fight of taking physic and declaring that nature was incapable of castoroil and battle both at once this ought to be explained a little to the modern english and their warsecretaries who undertake the conduct of armies the undeniable fact is defeat on defeat was the constant fate of the english during these forty years not one battle in which they were not beaten no gleam of victory or real resistance till the noble edmund ironside whom it is always strange to me how such an ethelred could produce for son made his appearance and ran his brief course like a great and farseen meteor soon extinguished without result no remedy for england in that base time but yearly asking the victorious plundering burning and murdering danes how much money will you take to go away thirty thousand pounds in silver which the annual danegelt soon rose to continued to be about the average yearly sum though generally on the increasing hand in the last year i think it had risen to seventytwo thousand pounds in silver raised yearly by a tax incometax of its kind rudely levied the worst of all remedies good for the day only nay there was one remedy still worse which the miserable ethelred once tried that of massacring all the danes settled in england practically of a few thousands or hundreds of them by treachery and a kind of sicilian vespers which issued as such things usually do in terrible monition to you not to try the like again issued namely in redoubled fury on the danish part new fiercer invasion by sveins jarl thorkel then by svein himself which latter drove the miserable ethelred with wife and family into normandy to wifes brother the then duke there and ended that miserable struggle by sveins becoming king of england himself of this disgraceful massacre which it would appear has been immensely exaggerated in the english books we can happily give the exact date ad 1002 and also of sveins victorious accession ad 1013 9pretty much the only benefit one gets out of contemplating such a set of objects  king sveins first act was to levy a terribly increased incometax for the payment of his army svein was levying it with a stronghanded diligence but had not yet done levying it when at gainsborough one night he suddenly died smitten dead once used to be said by st edmund whilom murdered king of the east angles who could not bear to see his shrine and monastery of st edmundsbury plundered by the tyrants taxcollectors as they were on the point of being in all ways impossible howeveredmunds own death did not occur till two years after sveins sveins death by whatever cause befell 1014 his fleet then lying in the humber and only knut 10 his eldest son hardly yet eighteen count some in charge of it who on short counsel and arrangement about this questionable kingdom of his lifted anchor made for sandwich a safer station at the moment cut off the feet and noses one shudders and hopes not there being some discrepancy about it of his numerous hostages that had been delivered to king svein set them ashoreand made for denmark his natural storehouse and stronghold as the hopefulest first thing he could do  knut soon returned from denmark with increase of force sufficient for the english problem which latter he now ended in a victorious and essentially for himself and chaotic england beneficent manner became widely known by and by there and elsewhere as knut the great and is thought by judges of our day to have really merited that title a most nimble sharpstriking clearthinking prudent and effective man who regulated this dismembered and distracted england in its church matters in its state matters like a real king had a standing army house carles who were well paid well drilled and disciplined capable of instantly quenching insurrection or breakage of the peace and piously endeavored with a signal earnestness and even devoutness if we look well to do justice to all men and to make all men rest satisfied with justice in a word he successfully strapped up by every true method and regulation this miserable dislocated and dissevered mass of bleeding anarchy into something worthy to be called an england againonly that he died too soon and a second conqueror of us still weightier of structure and under improved auspices became possible and was needed here to appearance knut himself was capable of being a charlemagne of england and the north as has been already said or quoted had he only lived twice as long as he did but his whole sum of years seems not to have exceeded forty his father svein of the forkbeard is reckoned to have been fifty to sixty when st edmund finished him at gainsborough we now return to norway ashamed of this long circuit which has been a truancy more or less    chapter ix king olaf the thicksets viking days  king harald graenske who with another from russia accidentally lodging beside him got burned to death in sweden courting that unspeakable sigrid the proudwas third cousin or so to tryggve father of our heroic olaf accurately counted he is greatgrandson of bjorn the chapman first of haarfagrs sons whom eric bloodaxe made away with his little kingdom as he called it was a district named the greenland graeneland he himself was one of those little haarfagr kinglets whom hakon jarl much more olaf tryggveson was content to leave reigning since they would keep the peace with him harald had a loving wife of his own aasta the name of her soon expecting the birth of her and his pretty babe named olafat the time he went on that deplorable swedish adventure the foolish fated creature and ended self and kingdom altogether aasta was greatly shocked composed herself however married a new husband sigurd syr a kinglet and a greatgrandson of harald fairhair a man of great wealth prudence and influence in those countries in whose house as favorite and wellbeloved stepson little olaf was wholesomely and skilfully brought up in sigurds house he had withal a special tutor entertained for him one rane known as rane the fartravelled by whom he could be trained from the earliest basis in norse accomplishments and arts new children came one or two but olaf from his mother seems always to have known that he was the distinguished and royal article there one day his fosterfather hurrying to leave home on business hastily bade olaf no other being by saddle his horse for him olaf went out with the saddle chose the biggest hegoat about saddled that and brought it to the door by way of horse old sigurd a most grave man grinned sardonically at the sight hah i see thou hast no mind to take commands from me thou art of too high a humor to take commands to which says snorro boy olaf answered little except by laughing till sigurd saddled for himself and rode away his mother aasta appears to have been a thoughtful prudent woman though always with a fierce royalism at the bottom of her memory and a secret implacability on that head  at the age of twelve olaf went to sea furnished with a little fleet and skilful seacounsellor expert old rane by his fosterfather and set out to push his fortune in the world rane was a steersman and counsellor in these incipient times but the crew always called olaf king though at first as snorro thinks except it were in the hour of battle he merely pulled an oar he cruised and fought in this capacity on many seas and shores passed several years perhaps till the age of nineteen or twenty in this wild element and way of life fighting always in a glorious and distinguished manner in the hour of battle diligent enough to amass property as the vikings termed it and in the long days and nights of sailing given over it is likely to his own thoughts and the unfathomable dialogue with the evermoaning sea not the worst high school a man could have and indeed infinitely preferable to the most that are going even now for a high and deep young soul  his first distinguished expedition was to sweden natural to go thither first to avenge his poor fathers death were it nothing more which he did the skalds say in a distinguished manner making victorious and handsome battle for himself in entering maelare lake and in getting out of it again after being frozen there all winter showing still more surprising almost miraculous contrivance and dexterity this was the first of his glorious victories of which the skalds reckon up some fourteen or thirteen very glorious indeed mostly in the western and southern countries most of all in england till the name of olaf haraldson became quite famous in the viking and strategic world he seems really to have learned the secrets of his trade and to have been then and afterwards for vigilance contrivance valor and promptitude of execution a superior fighter several exploits recorded of him betoken in simple forms what may be called a military genius  the principal and to us the alone interesting of his exploits seem to have lain in england and what is further notable always on the antisvein side english books do not mention him at all that i can find but it is fairly credible that as the norse records report in the end of ethelreds reign he was the ally or hired general of ethelred and did a great deal of seafighting watching sailing and sieging for this miserable king and edmund ironside his son snorro says expressly london the impregnable city had to be besieged again for ethelreds behoof in the interval between sveins death and young knuts getting back from denmark and that our olaf haraldson was the great engineer and victorious captor of london on that singular occasionlondon captured for the first time the bridge as usual snorro says offered almost insuperable obstacles but the engineering genius of olaf contrived huge platforms of wainscoting  old walls of wooden houses in fact bound together by withes these carried steadily aloft above the ships will thinks olaf considerably secure them and us from the destructive missiles big boulder stones and other mischief profusely showered down on us till we get under the bridge with axes and cables and do some good upon it olafs plan was tried most of the other ships in spite of their wainscoting and withes recoiled on reaching the bridge so destructive were the boulder and other missile showers but olafs ships and self got actually under the bridge fixed all manner of cables there and then with the river current in their favor and the frightened ships rallying to help in this safer part of the enterprise tore out the important piles and props and fairly broke the poor bridge wholly or partly down into the river and its danish defenders into immediate surrender that is snorros account  on a previous occasion olaf had been deep in a hopeful combination with ethelreds two younger sons alfred and edward afterwards king edward the confessor that they two should sally out from normandy in strong force unite with olaf in ditto and landing on the thames do something effectual for themselves but impediments bad weather or the like disheartened the poor princes and it came to nothing olaf was much in normandy what they then called walland a man held in honor by those norman dukes  what amount of property he had amassed i do not know but could prove were it necessary that he had acquired some tactical or even strategic faculty and real talent for war at lymfjord in jutland but some years after this ad 1027 he had a seabattle with the great knut himselfships combined with floodgates with roaring artificial deluges right well managed by king olaf which were within a hairsbreadth of destroying knut now become a king and great and did in effect send him instantly running but of this more particularly by and by  what still more surprises me is the mystery where olaf in this wandering fighting searoving life acquired his deeply religious feeling his intense adherence to the christian faith i suppose it had been in england where many pious persons priestly and other were still to be met with that olaf had gathered these doctrines and that in those his unfathomable dialogues with the evermoaning ocean they had struck root downwards in the soul of him and borne fruit upwards to the degree so conspicuous afterwards it is certain he became a deeply pious man during these long viking cruises and directed all his strength when strength and authority were lent him to establishing the christian religion in his country and suppressing and abolishing vikingism there both of which objects and their respective worth and unworth he must himself have long known so well  it was well on in ad 1016 that knut gained his last victory at ashdon in essex where the earth pyramids and antique church near by still testify the thankful piety of knutor at lowest his joy at having won instead of lost and perished as he was near doing there and it was still this same year when the noble edmund ironside after forced partitiontreaty in the isle of alney got scandalously murdered and knut became indisputable sole king of england and decisively settled himself to his work of governing there in the year before either of which events while all still hung uncertain for knut and even eric jarl of norway had to be summoned in aid of him in that year 1015 as one might naturally guess and as all icelandic hints and indications lead us to date the thing olaf had decided to give up vikingism in all its forms to return to norway and try whether he could not assert the place and career that belonged to him there jarl eric had vanished with all his war forces towards england leaving only a boy hakon as successor and svein his own brothera quiet man who had always avoided war olaf landed in norway without obstacle but decided to be quiet till he had himself examined and consulted friends  his reception by his mother aasta was of the kindest and proudest and is lovingly described by snorro a pretty idyllic or epic piece of norse homeric type how aasta hearing of her sons advent set all her maids and menials to work at the top of their speed despatched a runner to the harvestfield where her husband sigurd was to warn him to come home and dress how sigurd was standing among his harvest folk reapers and binders and what he had onbroad slouch hat with veil against the midges blue kirtle hose of i forget what color with laced boots and in his hand a stick with silver head and ditto ring upon ita personable old gentleman of the eleventh century in those parts sigurd was cautious prudentially cunctatory though heartily friendly in his counsel to olaf as to the king question aasta had a spartan tone in her wild maternal heart and assures olaf that she with a halfreproachful glance at sigurd will stand by him to the death in this his just and noble enterprise sigurd promises to consult farther in his neighborhood and to correspond by messages the result is olaf resolutely pushing forward himself resolves to call a thing and openly claim his kingship there the thing itself was willing enough opposition parties do here and there bestir themselves but olaf is always swifter than they five kinglets somewhere in the uplands 11all descendants of haarfagr but averse to break the peace which jarl eric and hakon jarl both have always willingly allowed to peaceable peopleseem to be the main opposition party these five take the field against olaf with what force they have olaf one night by beautiful celerity and strategic practice which a friedrich or a turenne might have approved surrounds these five and when morning breaks there is nothing for them but either death or else instant surrender and swearing of fealty to king olaf which latter branch of the alternative they gladly accept the whole five of them and go home again  this was a beautiful bit of warpractice by king olaf on land by another stroke still more compendious at sea he had already settled poor young hakon and made him peaceable for a long while olaf by diligent quest and spymessaging had ascertained that hakon just returning from denmark and farewell to papa and knut both now under way for england was coasting north towards trondhjem and intended on or about such a day to land in such and such a fjord towards the end of this trondhjem voyage olaf at once mans two big ships steers through the narrow mouth of the said fjord moors one ship on the north shore another on the south fixes a strong cable well sunk under water to the capstans of these two and in all quietness waits for hakon before many hours hakons royal or quasiroyal barge steers gaily into this fjord is a little surprised perhaps to see within the jaws of it two big ships at anchor but steers gallantly along nothing doubting olaf with a signal of all hands works his two capstans has the cable up high enough at the right moment catches with it the keel of poor hakons barge upsets it empties it wholly into the sea wholly into the sea saves hakon however and his people from drowning and brings them on board his dialogue with poor young hakon especially poor young hakons responses is very pretty shall i give it out of snorro and let the reader take it for as authentic as he can it is at least the true image of it in authentic snorros head little more than two centuries later  jarl hakon was led up to the kings ship he was the handsomest man that could be seen he had long hair as fine as silk bound about his head with a gold ornament when he sat down in the forehold the king said to him  king it is not false what is said of your family that ye are handsome people to look at but now your luck has deserted you  hakon it has always been the case that success is changeable and there is no luck in the matter it has gone with your family as with mine to have by turns the better lot i am little beyond childhood in years and at any rate we could not have defended ourselves as we did not expect any attack on the way it may turn out better with us another time  king dost thou not apprehend that thou art in such a condition that hereafter there can be neither victory nor defeat for thee  hakon that is what only thou canst determine king according to thy pleasure  king what wilt thou give me jarl if for this time i let thee go whole and unhurt  hakon what wilt thou take king  king nothing except that thou shalt leave the country give up thy kingdom and take an oath that thou wilt never go into battle against me 12  jarl hakon accepted the generous terms went to england and king knut and kept his bargain for a good few years though he was at last driven by pressure of king knut to violate itlittle to his profit as we shall see one victorious naval battle with jarl svein hakons uncle and his adherents who fled to sweden after his beatingbattle not difficult to a skilful hardhitting kingwas pretty much all the actual fighting olaf had to do in this enterprise he various times met angry bonders and refractory things with arms in their hand but by skilful firm managementperfectly patient but also perfectly ready to be activehe mostly managed without coming to strokes and was universally recognized by norway as its real king a promising young man and fit to be a king thinks snorro only of middle stature almost rather shortish but firmstanding and stoutbuilt so that they got to call him olaf the thick meaning olaf the thickset or stoutbuilt though his final epithet among them was infinitely higher for the rest a comely earnest prepossessing look beautiful yellow hair in quantity broad honest face of a complexion pure as snow and rose and finally or firstly the brightest eyes in the world such that in his anger no man could stand them he had a heavy task ahead and needed all his qualities and fine gifts to get it done    chapter x reign of king olaf the saint  the late two jarls now gone about their business had both been baptized and called themselves christians but during their government they did nothing in the conversion way left every man to choose his own god or gods so that some had actually two the christian god by land and at sea thor whom they considered safer in that element and in effect the mass of the people had fallen back into a sluggish heathenism or halfheathenism the lifelabor of olaf tryggveson lying ruinous or almost quite overset the new olaf son of harald set himself with all his strength to mend such a state of matters and stood by his enterprise to the end as the one highest interest including all others for his people and him his method was by no means soft on the contrary it was hard rapid severesomewhat on the model of tryggvesons though with more of bishoping and preaching superadded yet still there was a great deal of mauling vigorous punishing and an entire intolerance of these two things heathenism and searobbery at least of searobbery in the old style whether in the style we moderns still practise and call privateering i do not quite know but vikingism proper had to cease in norway still more heathenism under penalties too severe to be borne death mutilation of limb not to mention forfeiture and less rigorous coercion olaf was inexorable against violation of the law too severe cried many to whom one answers perhaps in part yes perhaps also in great part no depends altogether on the previous question how far the law was the eternal one of god almighty in the universe how far the law merely of olaf destitute of right inspiration left to his own passions and whims  many were the jangles olaf had with the refractory heathen things and ironbeards of a new generation very curious to see scarcely ever did it come to fighting between king and thing though often enough near it but the thing discerning as it usually did in time that the king was stronger in men seemed to say unanimously to itself we have lost then baptize us we must burn our old gods and conform one new feature we do slightly discern here and there a touch of theological argument on the heathen side at one wild thing far up in the dovrefjeld of a very heathen temper there was much of that not to be quenched by king olaf at the moment so that it had to be adjourned till the morrow and again till the next day here are some traits of it much abridged from snorro who gives a highly punctual account which vividly represent olafs posture and manner of proceeding in such intricacies  the chief ironbeard on this occasion was one gudbrand a very rugged peasant who says snorro was like a king in that district some days before king olaf intending a religious thing in those deeply heathen parts with alternative of christianity or conflagration is reported on looking down into the valley and the beautiful village of loar standing there to have said wistfully what a pity it is that so beautiful a village should be burnt olaf sent out his messagetoken all the same however and met gudbrand and an immense assemblage whose humor towards him was uncompliant to a high degree indeed judge by this preliminary speech of gudbrand to his thingpeople while olaf was not yet arrived but only advancing hardly got to breeden on the other side of the hill a man has come to loar who is called olaf said gudbrand and will force upon us another faith than we had before and will break in pieces all our gods he says he has a much greater and more powerful god and it is wonderful that the earth does not burst asunder under him or that our god lets him go about unpunished when he dares to talk such things i know this for certain that if we carry thor who has always stood by us out of our temple that is standing upon this farm olafs god will melt away and he and his men be made nothing as soon as thor looks upon them whereupon the bonders all shouted as one man yea  which tremendous message they even forwarded to olaf by gudbrands younger son at the head of 700 armed men but did not terrify olaf with it who on the contrary drew up his troops rode himself at the head of them and began a speech to the bonders in which he invited them to adopt christianity as the one true faith for mortals  far from consenting to this the bonders raised a general shout smiting at the same time their shields with their weapons but olafs men advancing on them swiftly and flinging spears they turned and ran leaving gudbrands son behind a prisoner to whom olaf gave his life go home now to thy father and tell him i mean to be with him soon  the son goes accordingly and advises his father not to face olaf but gudbrand angrily replies ha coward i see thou too art taken by the folly that man is going about with and is resolved to fight that night however gudbrand has a most remarkable dream or vision a man surrounded by light bringing great terror with him who warns gudbrand against doing battle with olaf if thou dost thou and all thy people will fall wolves will drag away thee and thine ravens will tear thee in stripes and lo in telling this to thord potbelly a sturdy neighbor of his and henchman in the thing it is found that to thord also has come the self same terrible apparition better propose truce to olaf who seems to have these dreadful ghostly powers on his side and the holding of a thing to discuss matters between us thing assembles on a day of heavy rain being all seated uprises king olaf and informs them the people of lesso loar and vaage have accepted christianity and broken down their idolhouses they believe now in the true god who has made heaven and earth and knows all things and sits down again without more words  gudbrand replies we know nothing about him of whom thou speakest dost thou call him god whom neither thou nor any one else can see but we have a god who can be seen every day although he is not out today because the weather is wet and he will appear to thee terrible and very grand and i expect that fear will mix with thy very blood when he comes into the thing but since thou sayest thy god is so great let him make it so that tomorrow we have a cloudy day but without rain and then let us meet again  the king accordingly returned home to his lodging taking gudbrands son as a hostage but he gave them a man as hostage in exchange in the evening the king asked gudbrands son what their god was like he replied that he bore the likeness of thor had a hammer in his hand was of great size but hollow within and had a high stand upon which he stood when he was out neither gold nor silver are wanting about him and every day he receives four cakes of bread besides meat they then went to bed but the king watched all night in prayer when day dawned the king went to mass then to table and from thence to the thing the weather was such as gudbrand desired now the bishop stood up in his choirrobes with bishops coif on his head and bishops crosier in his hand he spoke to the bonders of the true faith told the many wonderful acts of god and concluded his speech well  thord potbelly replies many things we are told of by this learned man with the staff in his hand crooked at the top like a rams horn but since you say comrades that your god is so powerful and can do so many wonders tell him to make it clear sunshine tomorrow forenoon and then we shall meet here again and do one of two thingseither agree with you about this business or fight you and they separated for the day  overnight the king instructed kolbein the strong an immense fellow the same who killed gunhilds two brothers that he kolbein must stand next him tomorrow people must go down to where the ships of the bonders lay and punctually bore holes in every one of them item to the farms where their horses wore and punctually unhalter the whole of them and let them loose all which was done snorro continues  now the king was in prayer all night beseeching god of his goodness and mercy to release him from evil when mass was ended and morning was gray the king went to the thing when he came thither some bonders had already arrived and they saw a great crowd coming along and bearing among them a huge mans image glancing with gold and silver when the bonders who were at the thing saw it they started up and bowed themselves down before the ugly idol thereupon it was set down upon the thing field and on the one side of it sat the bonders and on the other the king and his people  then dale gudbrand stood up and said where now king is thy god i think he will now carry his head lower and neither thou nor the man with the horn sitting beside thee there whom thou callest bishop are so bold today as on the former days for now our god who rules over all is come and looks on you with an angry eye and now i see well enough that you are terrified and scarcely dare raise your eyes throw away now all your opposition and believe in the god who has your fate wholly in his hands  the king now whispers to kolbein the strong without the bonders perceiving it if it come so in the course of my speech that the bonders look another way than towards their idol strike him as hard as thou canst with thy club  the king then stood up and spoke much hast thou talked to us this morning and greatly hast thou wondered that thou canst not see our god but we expect that he will soon come to us thou wouldst frighten us with thy god who is both blind and deaf and cannot even move about without being carried but now i expect it will be but a short time before he meets his fate for turn your eyes towards the eastbehold our god advancing in great light  the sun was rising and all turned to look at that moment kolbein gave their god a stroke so that he quite burst asunder and there ran out of him mice as big almost as cats and reptiles and adders the bonders were so terrified that some fled to their ships but when they sprang out upon them the ships filled with water and could not get away others ran to their horses but could not find them the king then ordered the bonders to be called together saying he wanted to speak with them on which the bonders came back and the thing was again seated  the king rose up and said i do not understand what your noise and running mean you yourselves see what your god can dothe idol you adorned with gold and silver and brought meat and provisions to you see now that the protecting powers who used and got good of all that were the mice and adders the reptiles and lizards and surely they do ill who trust to such and will not abandon this folly take now your gold and ornaments that are lying strewed on the grass and give them to your wives and daughters but never hang them hereafter upon stocks and stones here are two conditions between us to choose upon either accept christianity or fight this very day and the victory be to them to whom the god we worship gives it  then dale gudbrand stood up and said we have sustained great damage upon our god but since he will not help us we will believe in the god whom thou believest in  then all received christianity the bishop baptized gudbrand and his son king olaf and bishop sigurd left behind them teachers and they who met as enemies parted as friends and afterwards gudbrand built a church in the valley 13  olaf was by no means an unmerciful manmuch the reverse where he saw good cause there was a wicked old king raerik for example one of those five kinglets whom with their bits of armaments olaf by stratagem had surrounded one night and at once bagged and subjected when morning rose all of them consenting all of them except this raerik whom olaf as the readiest sure course took home with him blinded and kept in his own house finding there was no alternative but that or death to the obstinate old dog who was a kind of distant cousin withal and could not conscientiously be killed stoneblind old raerik was not always in murderous humor indeed for most part he wore a placid conciliatory aspect and said shrewd amusing things but had thrice over tried with amazing cunning of contrivance though stoneblind to thrust a dagger into olaf and the last time had all but succeeded so that as olaf still refused to have him killed it had become a problem what was to be done with him olafs good humor as well as his quiet ready sense and practicality are manifested in his final settlement of this raerik problem olafs laugh i can perceive was not so loud as tryggvesons but equally hearty coming from the bright mind of him  besides blind raerik olaf had in his household one thorarin an icelander a remarkably ugly man says snorro but a fartravelled shrewdly observant loyalminded and goodhumored person whom olaf liked to talk with remarkably ugly says snorro especially in his hands and feet which were large and illshaped to a degree one morning thorarin who with other trusted ones slept in olafs apartment was lazily dozing and yawning and had stretched one of his feet out of the bed before the king awoke the foot was still there when olaf did open his bright eyes which instantly lighted on this foot  well here is a foot says olaf gayly which one seldom sees the match of i durst venture there is not another so ugly in this city of nidaros  hah king said thorarin there are few things one cannot match if one seek long and take pains i would bet with thy permission king to find an uglier  done cried olaf upon which thorarin stretched out the other foot  a still uglier cried he for it has lost the little toe  ho ho said olaf but it is i who have gained the bet the less of an ugly thing the less ugly not the more  loyal thorarin respectfully submitted  what is to be my penalty then the king it is that must decide  to take me that wicked old raerik to leif ericson in greenland  which the icelander did leaving two vacant seats henceforth at olafs table leif ericson son of eric discoverer of america quietly managed raerik henceforth sent him to icelandi think to father eric himself certainly to some safe hand there in whose house or in some still quieter neighboring lodging at his own choice old raerik spent the last three years of his life in a perfectly quiescent manner  olafs struggles in the matter of religion had actually settled that question in norway by these rough methods of his whatever we may think of them heathenism had got itself smashed dead and was no more heard of in that country olaf himself was evidently a highly devout and pious manwhosoever is born with olafs temper now will still find as olaf did new and infinite field for it christianity in norway had the like fertility as in other countries or even rose to a higher and what dahlmann thinks exuberant pitch in the course of the two centuries which followed that of olaf him all testimony represents to us as a most righteous no less than most religious king continually vigilant just and rigorous was olafs administration of the laws repression of robbery punishment of injustice stern repayment of evildoers wherever he could lay hold of them  among the bonder or opulent class and indeed everywhere for the poor too can be sinners and need punishment olaf had by this course of conduct naturally made enemies his severity so visible to all and the justice and infinite beneficence of it so invisible except to a very few but at any rate his reign for the first ten years was victorious and might have been so to the end had it not been intersected and interfered with by king knut in his far bigger orbit and current of affairs and interests knuts english affairs and danish being all settled to his mind he seems especially after that year of pilgrimage to rome and association with the pontiffs and kaisers of the world on that occasion to have turned his more particular attention upon norway and the claims he himself had there jarl hakon too sisters son of knut and always well seen by him had long been busy in this direction much forgetful of that oath to olaf when his barge got canted over by the cable of two capstans and his life was given him not without conditions altogether  about the year 1026 there arrived two splendid persons out of england bearing king knut the greats letter and seal with a message likely enough to be far from welcome to olaf for some days olaf refused to see them or their letter shrewdly guessing what the purport would be which indeed was couched in mild language but of sharp meaning enough a notice to king olaf namely that norway was properly by just heritage knut the greats and that olaf must become the great knuts liegeman and pay tribute to him or worse would follow king olaf listening to these two splendid persons and their letter in indignant silence till they quite ended made answer i have heard say by old accounts there are that king gorm of denmark  bluetooths father knuts greatgrandfather was considered but a small king having denmark only and few people to rule over but the kings who succeeded him thought that insufficient for them and it has since come so far that king knut rules over both denmark and england and has conquered for himself a part of scotland and now he claims also my paternal bit of heritage cannot be contented without that too does he wish to rule over all the countries of the north can he eat up all the kale in england itself this knut the great he shall do that and reduce his england to a desert before i lay my head in his hands or show him any other kind of vassalage and so i bid you tell him these my words i will defend norway with battleaxe and sword as long as life is given me and will pay tax to no man for my kingdom words which naturally irritated knut to a high degree  next year accordingly year 1027 tenth or eleventh year of olafs reign there came bad rumors out of england that knut was equipping an immense armylandarmy and such a fleet as had never sailed before knuts own ship in ita gold dragon with no fewer than sixty benches of oars olaf and onund king of sweden whose sister he had married well guessed whither this armament was bound they were friends withal they recognized their common peril in this imminence and had in repeated consultations taken measures the best that their united skill which i find was mainly olafs but loyally accepted by the other could suggest it was in this year that olaf with his swedish king assisting did his grand feat upon knut in lymfjord of jutland which was already spoken of the special circumstances of which were these  knuts big armament arriving on the jutish coasts too late in the season and the coast country lying all plundered into temporary wreck by the two norse kings who shrank away on sight of knut there was nothing could be done upon them by knut this yearor if anything what knuts ships ran into lymfjord the safesheltered frith or intricate long straggle of friths and straits which almost cuts jutland in two in that region and lay safe idly rocking on the waters there uncertain what to do farther at last he steered in his big ship and some others deeper into the interior of lymfjord deeper and deeper onwards to the mouth of a big river called the helge helgeaa the holy river not discoverable in my poor maps but certainly enough still existing and still flowing somewhere among those intricate straits and friths towards the bottom of which helge river lay in some safe nook the small combined swedish and norse fleet under the charge of onund the swedish king while at the top or source which is a biggish mountain lake king olaf had been doing considerable engineering works well suited to such an occasion and was now ready at a moments notice knuts fleet having idly taken station here notice from the swedish king was instantly sent instantly olafs wellengineered floodgates were thrown open from the swollen lake a huge deluge of water was let loose olaf himself with all his people hastening down to join his swedish friend and get on board in time helge river all the while alongside of him with everincreasing roar and widerspreading deluge hastening down the steeps in the nightwatches so that along with olaf or some way ahead of him came immeasurable roaring waste of waters upon knuts negligent fleet shattered broke and stranded many of his ships and was within a trifle of destroying the golden dragon herself with knut on board olaf and onund we need not say were promptly there in person doing their very best the railings of the golden dragon however were too high for their little ships and jarl ulf husband of knuts sister at the top of his speed courageously intervening spoiled their stratagem and saved knut from this very dangerous pass  knut did nothing more this winter the two norse kings quite unequal to attack such an armament except by ambush and engineering sailed away again plundering at discretion on the danish coast carrying into sweden great booties and many prisoners but obliged to lie fixed all winter and indeed to leave their fleets there for a series of wintersknuts fleet posted at elsinore on both sides of the sound rendering all egress from the baltic impossible except at his pleasure ulfs opportune deliverance of his royal brotherinlaw did not much bestead poor ulf himself he had been in disfavor before pardoned with difficulty by queen emmas intercession an ambitious officious pushing stirring and both in england and denmark almost dangerous man and this conspicuous accidental merit only awoke new jealousy in knut knut finding nothing pass the sound worth much blockading went ashore and the day before michaelmas says snorro rode with a great retinue to roeskilde snorro continues his tragic narrative of what befell there  there knuts brotherinlaw jarl ulf had prepared a great feast for him the jarl was the most agreeable of hosts but the king was silent and sullen the jarl talked to him in every way to make him cheerful and brought forward everything he could think of to amuse him but the king remained stern and speaking little at last the jarl proposed a game of chess which he agreed to a chessboard was produced and they played together jarl ulf was hasty in temper stiff and in nothing yielding but everything he managed went on well in his hands and he was a great warrior about whom there are many stories he was the most powerful man in denmark next to the king jarl ulfs sister gyda was married to jarl gudin godwin ulfnadson and their sons were harald king of england and jarl tosti jarl walthiof jarl maurokaare and jarl svein gyda was the name of their daughter who was married to the english king edward the good whom we call the confessor  when they had played a while the king made a false move on which the jarl took a knight from him but the king set the piece on the board again and told the jarl to make another move but the jarl flew angry tumbled the chessboard over rose and went away the king said run thy ways ulf the fearful the jarl turned round at the door and said thou wouldst have run farther at helge river hadst thou been left to battle there thou didst not call me ulf the fearful when i hastened to thy help while the swedes were beating thee like a dog the jarl then went out and went to bed  the following morning while the king was putting on his clothes he said to his footboy go thou to jarl ulf and kill him the lad went was away a while and then came back the king said hast thou killed the jarl i did not kill him for he was gone to st luciuss church there was a man called ivar the white a norwegian by birth who was the kings courtman and chamberlain the king said to him go thou and kill the jarl ivar went to the church and in at the choir and thrust his sword through the jarl who died on the spot then ivar went to the king with the bloody sword in his hand  the king said hast thou killed the jarl i have killed him said he thou hast done well answered the king i  from a man who built so many churches one on each battlefield where he had fought to say nothing of the others and who had in him such depths of real devotion and other fine cosmic quality this does seem rather strong but it is characteristic withalof the man and perhaps of the times still more 14 in any case it is an event worth noting the slain jarl ulf and his connections being of importance in the history of denmark and of england also ulfs wife was astrid sister of knut and their only child was svein styled afterwards svein estrithson astridson when he became noted in the worldat this time a beardless youth who on the back of this tragedy fled hastily to sweden where were friends of ulf after some ten years eclipse there knut and both his sons being now dead svein reappeared in denmark under a new and eminent figure jarl of denmark highest liegeman to the then sovereign there broke his oath to said sovereign declared himself svein estrithson to be real king of denmark and after much preliminary trouble and many beatings and disastrous flights to and fro became in effect suchto the wonder of mankind for he had not had one victory to cheer him on or any good luck or merit that one sees except that of surviving longer than some others nevertheless he came to be the restorer so called of danish independence sole remaining representative of knut or knuts sister of forkbeard bluetooth and old gorm and ancestor of all the subsequent kings of denmark for some 400 years himself coming as we see only by the distaff side all of the sword or male side having died so soon early death it has been observed was the great knuts allotment and all his posteritys as wellfatal limit had there been no others which we see there were to his becoming charlemagne of the north in any considerable degree jarl ulf as we have seen had a sister gyda by name wife to earl godwin gudin ulfnadsson as snorro calls him a very memorable englishman whose son and hers king harald harold in english books is the memorablest of all these things ought to be better known to english antiquaries and will perhaps be alluded to again  this pretty little victory or affront gained over knut in lymfjord was among the last successes of olaf against that mighty man olaf the skilful captain he was need not have despaired to defend his norway against knut and all the world but he learned henceforth month by month ever more tragically that his own people seeing softer prospects under knut and in particular the chiefs of them industriously bribed by knut for years past had fallen away from him and that his means of defence were gone next summer knuts grand fleet sailed unopposed along the coast of norway knut summoning a thing every here and there and in all of them meeting nothing but skyhigh acclamation and acceptance olaf with some twelve little ships all he now had lay quiet in some safe fjord near lindenaes what we now call the naze behind some little solitary isles on the southeast of norway there till triumphant knut had streamed home again home to england again sovereign of norway now with nephew hakon appointed jarl and viceregent under him this was the news olaf met on venturing out and that his worst anticipations were not beyond the sad truth all or almost all the chief bonders and men of weight in norway had declared against him and stood with triumphant knut  olaf with his twelve poor ships steered vigorously along the coast to collect money and forceif such could now anywhere be had he himself was resolute to hold out and try sailing swiftly with a fair wind morning cloudy with some showers he passed the coast of jedderen which was erling skjalgsons country when he got sure notice of an endless multitude of ships warships armed merchant ships all kinds of shippingcraft down to fishermens boats just getting under way against him under the command of erling skjalgsonthe powerfulest of his subjects once much a friend of olafs but now gone against him to this length thanks to olafs severity of justice and knuts abundance in gold and promises for years back to that complexion had it come with erling sailing with this immense assemblage of the naval people and populace of norway to seize king olaf and bring him to the great knut dead or alive  erling had a grand new ship of his own which far outsailed the general miscellany of rebel ships and was visibly fast gaining distance on olaf himselfwho well understood what erlings puzzle was between the tail of his game the miscellany of rebel ships namely that could not come up and the head or general prize of the game which was crowding all sail to get away and olaf took advantage of the same lower your sails said olaf to his men though we must go slower  ho you we have lost sight of them said erling to his and put on all his speed olaf going soon after this altogether invisiblebehind a little island that he knew of whence into a certain fjord or bay bay of fungen on the maps which he thought would suit him halt here and get out your arms said olaf and had not to wait long till erling came bounding in past the rocky promontory and with astonishment beheld olafs fleet of twelve with their battleaxes and their grapplingirons all in perfect readiness these fell on him the unready erling simultaneous like a cluster of angry bees and in a few minutes cleared his ship of men altogether except erling himself nobody asked his life nor probably would have got it if he had only erling still stood erect on a high place on the poop fiercely defensive and very difficult to get at could not be reached at all says snorro except by spears or arrows and these he warded off with untiring dexterity no man in norway it was said had ever defended himself so long alone against manyan almost invincible erling had his cause been good olaf himself noticed erlings behavior and said to him from the foredeck below thou hast turned against me today erling the eagles fight breast to breast answers he this was a speech of the kings to erling once long ago while they stood fighting not as now but side by side the king with some transient thought of possibility going through his head rejoins wilt thou surrender erling that will i answered he took the helmet off his head laid down sword and shield and went forward to the forecastle deck the king pricked i think not very harshly into erlings chin or beard with the point of his battleaxe saying i must mark thee as traitor to thy sovereign though whereupon one of the bystanders aslak fitiaskalle stupidly and fiercely burst up smote erling on the head with his axe so that it struck fast in his brain and was instantly the death of erling illluck attend thee for that stroke thou hast struck norway out of my hand by it cried the king to aslak but forgave the poor fellow who had done it meaning well the insurrectionary bonder fleet arriving soon after as if for certain victory was struck with astonishment at this erling catastrophe and being now without any leader of authority made not the least attempt at battle but full of discouragement and consternation thankfully allowed olaf to sail away on his northward voyage at discretion and themselves went off lamenting with erlings dead body  this small victory was the last that olaf had over his many enemies at present he sailed along still northward day after day several important people joined him but the news from landward grew daily more ominous bonders busily arming to rear of him and ahead hakon still more busily at trondhjem now near by and he will end thy days king if he have strength enough olaf paused sent scouts to a hilltop hakons armament visible enough and under way hitherward about the isle of bjarno yonder soon after olaf himself saw the bonder armament of twentyfive ships from the southward sail past in the distance to join that of hakon and worse still his own ships one and another seven in all were slipping off on a like errand he made for the fjord of fodrar mouth of the rugged strath called valdalwhich i think still knows olaf and has now an olafs highway where nine centuries ago it scarcely had a path olaf entered this fjord had his landtent set up and a cross beside it on the small level green behind the promontory there finding that his twelve poor ships were now reduced to five against a world all risen upon him he could not but see and admit to himself that there was no chance left and that he must withdraw across the mountains and wait for a better time  his journey through that wild country in these forlorn and straitened circumstances has a mournful dignity and homely pathos as described by snorro how he drew up his five poor ships upon the beach packed all their furniture away and with his hundred or so of attendants and their journeybaggage under guidance of some friendly bonder rode up into the desert and foot of the mountains scaled after three days effort as if by miracle thought his attendants and thought snorro the wellnigh precipitous slope that led across never without miraculous aid from heaven and olaf could baggagewagons have ascended that path in short how he fared along beset by difficulties and the mournfulest thoughts but patiently persisted steadfastly trusted in god and was fixed to return and by gods help try again an evidently very pious and devout man a good man struggling with adversity such as the gods we may still imagine with the ancients do look down upon as their noblest sight  he got to sweden to the court of his brotherinlaw kindly and nobly enough received there though gradually perhaps illseen by the now authorities of norway so that before long he quitted sweden left his queen there with her only daughter his and hers the only child they had he himself had an only son by a bondwoman magnus by name who came to great things afterwards of whom and of which by and by with this bright little boy and a selected escort of attendants he moved away to russia to king jarroslav where he might wait secure against all risk of hurting kind friends by his presence he seems to have been an exile altogether some two yearssuch is ones vague notion for there is no chronology in snorro or his sagas and one is reduced to guessing and inferring he had reigned over norway reckoning from the first days of his landing there to those last of his leaving it across the dovrefjeld about fifteen years ten of them shiningly victorious  the news from norway were naturally agitating to king olaf and in the fluctuation of events there his purposes and prospects varied much he sometimes thought of pilgriming to jerusalem and a henceforth exclusively religious life but for most part his pious thoughts themselves gravitated towards norway and a stroke for his old place and task there which he steadily considered to have been committed to him by god norway by the rumors was evidently not at rest jarl hakon under the high patronage of his uncle had lasted there but a little while i know not that his government was especially unpopular nor whether he himself much remembered his broken oath it appears however he had left in england a beautiful bride and considering farther that in england only could bridal ornaments and other wedding outfit of a sufficiently royal kind be found he set sail thither to fetch her and them himself one evening of wildishlooking weather he was seen about the northeast corner of the pentland frith the night rose to be tempestuous hakon or any timber of his fleet was never seen more had all gone downbroken oaths bridal hopes and all else mouse and maninto the roaring waters there was no farther oppositionline the like of which had lasted ever since old heathen hakon jarl down to this his grandson hakons finis in the pentland frith with this hakons disappearance it now disappeared  indeed knut himself though of an empire suddenly so great was but a temporary phenomenon fate had decided that the grand and wise knut was to be shortlived and to leave nothing as successors but an ineffectual young harald harefoot who soon perished and a still stupider fiercelydrinking hardaknut who rushed down of apoplexy here in london city as i guess with the goblet at his mouth drinking health and happiness at a weddingfeast also before long  hakon having vanished in this dark way there ensued a pause both on knuts part and on norways pause or interregnum of some months till it became certain first whether hakon were actually dead secondly till norway and especially till king knut himself could decide what to do knut to the deep disappointment which had to keep itself silent of three or four chief norway men named none of these three or four jarl of norway but bethought him of a certain svein a bastard son of his ownwho and almost still more his english mother much desired a career in the world fitter for him thought they indignantly than that of captain over jomsburg where alone the father had been able to provide for him hitherto svein was sent to norway as king or viceking for father knut and along with him his fond and vehement mother neither of whom gained any favor from the norse people by the kind of management they ultimately came to show  olaf on news of this change and such uncertainty prevailing everywhere in norway as to the future course of things whether svein would come as was rumored of at last and be able to maintain himself if he didthought there might be something in it of a chance for himself and his rights and after lengthened hesitation much prayer pious invocation and consideration decided to go and try it the final grain that had turned the balance it appears was a halfwaking morning dream or almost ocular vision he had of his glorious cousin olaf tryggveson who severely admonished exhorted and encouraged him and disappeared grandly just in the instant of olafs awakening so that olaf almost fancied he had seen the very figure of him as it melted into air let us on let us on thought olaf always after that he left his son not in russia but in sweden with the queen who proved very good and carefully helpful in wise ways to himin russia olaf had now nothing more to do but give his grateful adieus and get ready  his march towards sweden and from that towards norway and the passes of the mountains down vaerdal towards stickelstad and the crisis that awaited is beautifully depicted by snorro it has all of it the description and we see clearly the fact itself had a kind of pathetic grandeur simplicity and rude nobleness something epic or homeric without the metre or the singing of homer but with all the sincerity rugged truth to nature and much more of piety devoutness reverence for what is forever high in this universe than meets us in those old greek balladmongers singularly visual all of it too brought home in every particular to ones imagination so that it stands out almost as a thing one actually saw  olaf had about three thousand men with him gathered mostly as he fared along through norway four hundred raised by one dag a kinsman whom he had found in sweden and persuaded to come with him marched usually in a separate body and were or might have been rather an important element learning that the bonders were all arming especially in trondhjem country olaf streamed down towards them in the closest order he could by no means very close subsistence even for three thousand being difficult in such a country his speech was almost always free and cheerful though his thoughts always naturally were of a high and earnest almost sacred tone devout above all stickelstad a small poor hamlet still standing where the valley ends was seen by olaf and tacitly by the bonders as well to be the natural place for offering battle there olaf issued out from the hills one morning drew himself up according to the best rules of norse tactics rules of little complexity but perspicuously true to the facts i think he had a clear open ground still rather raised above the plain in front he could see how the bonder army had not yet quite arrived but was pouring forward in spontaneous rows or groups copiously by every path this was thought to be the biggest army that ever met in norway certainly not much fewer than a hundred times a hundred men according to snorro great bonders several of them small bonders very manyall of willing mind animated with a hot sense of intolerable injuries king olaf had punished great and small with equal rigor says snorro which appeared to the chief people of the country too severe and animosity rose to the highest when they lost relatives by the kings just sentence although they were in reality guilty he again would rather renounce his dignity than omit righteous judgment the accusation against him of being stingy with his money was not just for he was a most generous man towards his friends but that alone was the cause of the discontent raised against him that he appeared hard and severe in his retributions besides king knut offered large sums of money and the great chiefs were corrupted by this and by his offering them greater dignities than they had possessed before on these grounds against the intolerable man great and small were now pouring along by every path  olaf perceived it would still be some time before the bonder army was in rank his own dag of sweden too was not yet come up he was to have the right banner king olafs own being the middle or grand one some other person the third or left banner all which being perfectly ranked and settled according to the best rules and waiting only the arrival of dag olaf bade his men sit down and freshen themselves with a little rest there were religious services gone through a matinsworship such as there have been few sternly earnest to the heart of it and deep as death and eternity at least on olafs own part for the rest thormod sang a stave of the fiercest skaldic poetry that was in him all the army straightway sang it in chorus with fiery mind the bonder of the nearest farm came up to tell olaf that he also wished to fight for him thanks to thee but dont said olaf stay at home rather that the wounded may have some shelter to this bonder olaf delivered all the money he had with solemn order to lay out the whole of it in masses and prayers for the souls of such of his enemies as fell such of thy enemies king yes surely said olaf my friends will all either conquer or go whither i also am going  at last the bonder army too was got ranked three commanders one of them with a kind of loose chief command having settled to take charge of it and began to shake itself towards actual advance olaf in the mean while had laid his head on the knees of finn arneson his trustiest man and fallen fast asleep finns brother kalf arneson once a warm friend of olaf was chief of the three commanders on the opposite side finn and he addressed angry speech to one another from the opposite ranks when they came near enough finn seeing the enemy fairly approach stirred olaf from his sleep oh why hast thou wakened me from such a dream said olaf in a deeply solemn tone what dream was it then asked finn i dreamt that there rose a ladder here reaching up to very heaven said olaf i had climbed and climbed and got to the very last step and should have entered there hadst thou given me another moment king i doubt thou art fey i do not quite like that dream  the actual fight began about one of the clock in a most bright last day of july and was very fierce and hot especially on the part of olafs men who shook the others back a little though fierce enough they too and had dag been on the ground which he wasnt yet it was thought victory might have been won soon after battle joined the sky grew of a ghastly brass or copper color darker and darker till thick night involved all things and did not clear away again till battle was near ending dag with his four hundred arrived in the darkness and made a furious charge what was afterwards in the speech of the people called dags storm which had nearly prevailed but could not quite victory again inclining to the so vastly larger party it is uncertain still how the matter would have gone for olaf himself was now fighting with his own hand and doing deadly execution on his busiest enemies to right and to left but one of these chief rebels thorer hund thought to have learnt magic from the laplanders whom he long traded with and made money by mysteriously would not fall for olafs best strokes best strokes brought only dust from the enchanted deerskin coat of the fellow to olafs surprisewhen another of the rebel chiefs rushed forward struck olaf with his battleaxe a wild slashing wound and miserably broke his thigh so that he staggered or was supported back to the nearest stone and there sat down lamentably calling on god to help him in this bad hour another rebel of note the name of him long memorable in norway slashed or stabbed olaf a second time as did then a third upon which the noble olaf sank dead and forever quitted this doghole of a worldlittle worthy of such men as olaf one sometimes thinks but that too is a mistake and even an important one should we persist in it  with olafs death the sky cleared again battle now near done ended with complete victory to the rebels and next to no pursuit or result except the death of olaf everybody hastening home as soon as the big duel had decided itself olafs body was secretly carried after dark to some outhouse on the farm near the spot whither a poor blind beggar creeping in for shelter that very evening was miraculously restored to sight and truly with a notable almost miraculous speed the feelings of all norway for king olaf changed themselves and were turned upside down within a year or almost within a day superlative example of extinctus amabitur idem not olaf the thickset any longer but olaf the blessed or saint now clearly in heaven such the name and character of him from that time to this two churches dedicated to him out of four that once stood stand in london at this moment and the miracles that have been done there not to speak of norway and christendom elsewhere in his name were numerous and great for long centuries afterwards visibly a saint olaf ever since and indeed in bollandus or elsewhere i have seldom met with better stuff to make a saint of or a true worldhero in all good senses  speaking of the london olaf churches i should have added that from one of these the thricefamous tooley street gets its namewhere those three tailors addressing parliament and the universe sublimely styled themselves we the people of england saint olave street saint oley street stooley street tooley street such are the metamorphoses of human fame in the world  the battleday of stickelstad king olafs deathday is generally believed to have been wednesday july 31 1033 but on investigation it turns out that there was no total eclipse of the sun visible in norway that year though three years before there was one but on the 29th instead of the 31st so that the exact date still remains uncertain dahlmann the latest critic inclining for 1030 and its indisputable eclipse 15    chapter xi magnus the good and others  st olaf is the highest of these norway kings and is the last that much attracts us for this reason if a reason were not superfluous we might here end our poor reminiscences of those dim sovereigns but we will nevertheless for the sake of their connection with bits of english history still hastily mention the dames of one or two who follow and who throw a momentary gleam of life and illumination on events and epochs that have fallen so extinct among ourselves at present though once they were so momentous and memorable  the new king svein from jomsburg knuts natural son had no success in norway nor seems to have deserved any his english mother and he were found to be grasping oppressive persons and awoke almost from the instant that olaf was suppressed and crushed away from norway into heaven universal odium more and more in that country welldeservedly as still appears for their taxings and extortions of malt of herring of meal smithwork and every article taxable in norway were extreme and their service to the country otherwise nearly imperceptible in brief their one basis there was the power of knut the great and that like all earthly things was liable to sudden collapseand it suffered such in a notable degree king knut hardly yet of middle age and the greatest king in the then world died at shaftesbury in 1035 as dahlmann thinks 16leaving two legitimate sons and a busy intriguing widow norman emma widow of ethelred the unready mother of the younger of these two neither of whom proved to have any talent or any continuance in spite of emmas utmost efforts harald the elder son of knut not hers got england for his kingdom emma and her hardaknut had to be content with denmark and go thither much against their will harald in englandlightgoing little figure like his father before himgot the name of harefoot here and might have done good work among his now orderly and settled people but he died almost within year and day and has left no trace among us except that of harefoot from his swift mode of walking emma and her hardaknut now returned joyful to england but the violent idle and drunken hardaknut did no good there and happily for england and him soon suddenly ended by stroke of apoplexy at a marriage festival as mentioned above in denmark he had done still less good and indeedunder him in a year or two the grand imperial edifice laboriously built by knuts valor and wisdom had already tumbled all to the ground in a most unexpected and remarkable way as we are now to indicate with all brevity    sveins tyrannies in norway had wrought such fruit that within the four years after olafs death the chief men in norway the very slayers of king olaf kalf arneson at the head of them met secretly once or twice and unanimously agreed that kalf arneson must go to sweden or to russia itself seek young magnus son of olaf home excellent magnus to be king over all norway and them instead of this intolerable svein which was at once donemagnus brought home in a kind of triumph all norway waiting for him intolerable svein had already been rebelled against some years before this a certain young tryggve out of ireland authentic son of olaf tryggveson and of that fine irish princess who chose him in his low habiliments and low estate and took him over to her own green islandthis royal young tryggve olafson had invaded the usurper svein in a fierce valiant and determined manner and though with too small a party showed excellent fight for some time till svein zealously bestirring himself managed to get him beaten and killed but that was a couple of years ago the party still too small not including one and all as now svein without stroke of sword this time moved off towards denmark never showing face in norway again his drunken brother hardaknut received him brotherlike even gave him some territory to rule over and subsist upon but he lived only a short while was gone before hardaknut himself and we will mention him no more  magnus was a fine bright young fellow and proved a valiant wise and successful king known among his people as magnus the good he was only natural son of king olaf but that made little difference in those times and there his strangelooking unexpected latin name he got in this way alfhild his mother a slave through illluck of war though nobly born was seen to be in a hopeful way and it was known in the kings house how intimately olaf was connected with that occurrence and how much he loved this kings servingmaid as she was commonly designated alfhild was brought to bed late at night and all the world especially king olaf was asleep olafs strict rule then and always being dont awaken meseemingly a man sensitive about his sleep the child was a boy of rather weakly aspect no important person present except sigvat the kings icelandic skald who happened to be still awake and the bishop of norway who i suppose had been sent for in hurry what is to be done said the bishop here is an infant in pressing need of baptism and we know not what the name is go sigvat awaken the king and ask i dare not for my life answered sigvat kings orders are rigorous on that point but if the child die unbaptized said the bishop shuddering too certain he and everybody where the child would go in that case i will myself give him a name said sigvat with a desperate concentration of all his faculties he shall be namesake of the greatest of mankindimperial carolus magnus let us call the infant magnus king olaf on the morrow asked rather sharply how sigvat had dared take such a liberty but excused sigvat seeing what the perilous alternative was and magnus by such accident this boy was called and he not another is the prime origin and introducer of that name magnus which occurs rather frequently not among the norman kings only but by and by among the danish and swedish and among the scandinavian populations appears to be rather frequent to this day  magnus a youth of great spirit whose own and standing at his beck all norway now was immediately smote home on denmark desirous naturally of vengeance for what it had done to norway and the sacred kindred of magnus denmark its great knut gone and nothing but a drunken hardaknut fugitive svein and co there in his stead was become a weak dislocated country and magnus plundered in it burnt it beat it as often as he pleased hardaknut struggling what he could to make resistance or reprisals but never once getting any victory over magnus magnus i perceive was like his father a skilful as well as valiant fighter by sea and land magnus with good battalions and probably backed by immediate alliance with heaven and st olaf as was then the general belief or surmise about him could not easily be beaten and the truth is he never was by hardaknut or any other hardaknuts last transaction with him was to make a firm peace and even familytreaty sanctioned by all the grandees of both countries who did indeed mainly themselves make it their two kings assenting that there should be perpetual peace and no thought of war more between denmark and norway and that if either of the kings died childless while the other was reigning the other should succeed him in both kingdoms a magnificent arrangement such as has several times been made in the worlds history but which in this instance what is very singular took actual effect drunken hardaknut dying so speedily and magnus being the man he was one would like to give the date of this remarkable treaty but cannot with precision guess somewhere about 1040 17 actual fruition of it came to magnus beyond question in 1042 when hardaknut drank that wassail bowl at the wedding in lambeth and fell down dead which in the saxon chronicle is dated 3d june of that year magnus at once went to denmark on hearing this event was joyfully received by the headmen there who indeed with their fellows in norway had been main contrivers of the treaty both countries longing for mutual peace and the end of such incessant broils  magnus was triumphantly received as king in denmark the only unfortunate thing was that svein estrithson the exile son of ulf knuts brotherinlaw whom knut as we saw had summarily killed twelve years before emerged from his exile in sweden in a flattering form and proposed that magnus should make him jarl of denmark and general administrator there in his own stead to which the sanguine magnus in spite of advice to the contrary insisted on acceding too powerful a jarl said einar tamberskelverthe same einar whose bow was heard to break in olaf tryggvesons last battle norway breaking from thy hand king who had now become magnuss chief man and had long been among the highest chiefs in norway too powerful a jarl said einar earnestly but magnus disregarded it and a troublesome experience had to teach him that it was true in about a year crafty svein bringing ends to meet got himself declared king of denmark for his own behoof instead of jarl for anothers and had to be beaten and driven out by magnus beaten every year but almost always returned next year for a new beatingalmost though not altogether having at length got one dreadful smashingdown and halfkilling which held him quiet for a whileso long as magnus lived nay in the end he made good his point as if by mere patience in being beaten and did become king himself and progenitor of all the kings that followed king svein estrithson so called from astrid or estrith his mother the great knuts sister daughter of svein forkbeard by that amazing sigrid the proud who burnt those two ineligible suitors of hers both at once and got a switch on the face from olaf tryggveson which proved the death of that high man  but all this fine fortune of the often beaten estrithson was posterior to magnuss death who never would have suffered it had he been alive magnus was a mighty fighter a fiery man very proud and positive among other qualities and had such luck as was never seen before luck invariably good said everybody never once was beatenwhich proves continued everybody that his father olaf and the miraculous power of heaven were with him always magnus i believe did put down a great deal of anarchy in those countries one of his earliest enterprises was to abolish jomsburg and trample out that nest of pirates which he managed so completely that jomsburg remained a mere reminiscence thenceforth and its place is not now known to any mortal  one perverse thing did at last turn up in the course of magnus a new claimant for the crown of norway and he a formidable person withal this was harald halfbrother of the late saint olaf uncle or halfuncle therefore of magnus himself indisputable son of the saints mother by st olafs stepfather who was himself descended straight from harald haarfagr this new harald was already much heard of in the world as an ardent boy of fifteen he had fought at king olafs side at stickelstad would not be admonished by the saint to go away got smitten down there not killed was smuggled away that night from the field by friendly help got cured of his wounds forwarded to russia where he grew to mans estate under bright auspices and successes fell in love with the russian princess but could not get her to wife went off thereupon to constantinople as vaeringer lifeguardsman of the greek kaiser became chief captain of the vaeringers invincible champion of the poor kaisers that then were and filled all the east with the shine and noise of his exploits an authentic waring or baring such the surname we now have derived from these people who were an important institution in those greek countries for several ages vaeringer lifeguard consisting of norsemen with sometimes a few english among them harald had innumerable adventures nearly always successful sing the skalds gained a great deal of wealth gold ornaments and gold coin had even queen zoe so they sing though falsely enamored of him at one time and was himself a skald of eminence some of whose verses by no means the worst of their kind remain to this day  this character of waring much distinguishes harald to me the only vaeringer of whom i could ever get the least biography true or halftrue it seems the greek historybooks but indifferently correspond with these saga records and scholars say there could have been no considerable romance between zoe and him zoe at that date being 60 years of age haralds own lays say nothing of any zoe but are still full of longing for his russian princess far away  at last what with zoes what with greek perversities and perfidies and troubles that could not fail he determined on quitting greece packed up his immensities of wealth in succinct shape and actually returned to russia where new honors and favors awaited him from old friends and especially if i mistake not the hand of that adorable princess crown of all his wishes for the time being before long however he decided farther to look after his norway royal heritages and for that purpose sailed in force to the jarl or quasiking of denmark the oftenbeaten svein who was now in sweden on his usual winter exile after beating svein and he had evidently interests in common svein was charmed to see him so warlike glorious and renowned a man with masses of money about him too svein did by and by become treacherous and even attempted one night to assassinate harald in his bed on board ship but harald vigilant of svein and a man of quick and sure insight had providently gone to sleep elsewhere leaving a log instead of himself among the blankets in which log next morning treacherous sveins battleaxe was found deeply sticking and could not be removed without difficulty but this was after harald and king magnus himself bad begun treating with the fairest prospectswhich this of the vein battleaxe naturally tended to forward as it altogether ended the other copartnery  magnus on first hearing of vaeringer harald and his intentions made instant equipment and determination to fight his uttermost against the same but wise persons of influence round him as did the like sort round vaeringer harald earnestly advised compromise and peaceable agreement which soon after that of sveins nocturnal battleaxe was the course adopted and to the joy of all parties did prove a successful solution magnus agreed to part his kingdom with uncle harald uncle parting his treasures or uniting them with magnuss poverty each was to be an independent king but they were to govern in common magnus rather presiding he to sit for example in the high seat alone king harald opposite him in a seat not quite so high though if a stranger king came on a visit both the norse kings were to sit in the high seat with various other punctilious regulations which the fiery magnus was extremely strict with rendering the mutual relation a very dangerous one had not both the kings been honest men and harald a much more prudent and tolerant one than magnus they on the whole never had any weighty quarrel thanks now and then rather to harald than to magnus magnus too was very noble and harald with his wide experience and greater length of years carefully held his heat of temper well covered in  prior to uncle haralds coming magnus had distinguished himself as a lawgiver his code of laws for the trondhjem province was considered a pretty piece of legislation and in subsequent times got the name of graygoose gragas one of the wonderfulest names ever given to a wise book some say it came from the gray color of the parchment some give other incredible origins the last guess i have heard is that the name merely denotes antiquity the witty name in norway for a man growing old having been in those times that he was now becoming a graygoose very fantastic indeed certain however that graygoose is the name of that venerable law book nay there is another still more famous belonging to iceland and not far from a century younger the iceland graygoose the norway one is perhaps of date about 1037 the other of about 1118 peace be with them both or if anybody is inclined to such matters let him go to dahlmann for the amplest information and such minuteness of detail as might almost enable him to be an advocate with silk gown in any court depending on these graygeese  magnus did not live long he had a dream one night of his father olafs coming to him in shining presence and announcing that a magnificent fortune and worldgreat renown was now possible for him but that perhaps it was his duty to refuse it in which case his earthly life would be short which way wilt thou do then said the shining presence thou shalt decide for me father thou not i and told his uncle harald on the morrow adding that he thought he should now soon die which proved to be the fact the magnificent fortune so questionable otherwise has reference no doubt to the conquest of england to which country magnus as rightful and actual king of denmark as well as undisputed heir to drunken hardaknut by treaty long ago had now some evident claim the enterprise itself was reserved to the patient gay and prudent uncle harald and to him it did prove fataland merely paved the way for another luckier not likelier  svein estrithson always beaten during magnuss life by and by got an agreement from the prudent harald to be king of denmark then and end these wearisome and ineffectual brabbles harald having other work to do but in the autumn of 1066 tosti a younger son of our english earl godwin came to sveins court with a most important announcement namely that king edward the confessor so called was dead and that harold as the english write it his eldest brother would give him tosti no sufficient share in the kingship which state of matters if svein would go ahead with him to rectify it would be greatly to the advantage of svein svein taught by many beatings was too wise for this proposal refused tosti who indignantly stepped over into norway and proposed it to king harald there svein really had acquired considerable teaching i should guess from his much beating and hard experience in the world one finds him afterwards the esteemed friend of the famous historian adam of bremen who reports various wise humanities and pleasant discoursings with svein estrithson  as for harald hardrade harald the hard or severe as he was now called tostis proposal awakened in him all his old vaeringer ambitious and cupidities into blazing vehemence he zealously consented and at once with his whole strength embarked in the adventure fitted out two hundred ships and the biggest army he could carry in them and sailed with tosti towards the dangerous promised land got into the tyne and took booty got into the humber thence into the ouse easily subdued any opposition the official people or their populations could make victoriously scattered these victoriously took the city of york in a day and even got himself homaged there king of northumberland as per covenanttosti proving honorabletosti and he going with faithful strict copartnery and all things looking prosperous and glorious except only an important exception that they learnt for certain english harold was advancing with all his strength and in a measurable space of hours unless care were taken would be in york himself harald and tosti hastened off to seize the post of stamford bridge on derwent river six or seven miles east of york city and there bar this dangerous advent their own ships lay not far off in ouse river in case of the worst the battle that ensued the next day september 20 1066 is forever memorable in english history  snorro gives vividly enough his view of it from the icelandic side a ring of stalwart norsemen close ranked with their steel tools in hand english harolds army mostly cavalry prancing and pricking all around trying to find or make some opening in that ring for a long time trying in vain till at length getting them enticed to burst out somewhere in pursuit they quickly turned round and quickly made an end of that matter snorro represents english harold with a first party of these horse coming up and with preliminary salutations asking if tosti were there and if harald were making generous proposals to tosti but in regard to harald and what share of england was to be his answering tosti with the words seven feet of english earth or more if he require it for a grave upon which tosti like an honorable man and copartner said no never let us fight you rather till we all die who is this that spoke to you inquired harald when the cavaliers had withdrawn my brother harold answers tosti which looks rather like a saga but may be historical after all snorros history of the battle is intelligible only after you have premised to it what he never hints at that the scene was on the east side of the bridge and of the derwent the great struggle for the bridge one at last finds was after the fall of harald and to the english chroniclers said struggle which was abundantly severe is all they know of the battle  enraged at that breaking loose of his steel ring of infantry norse harald blazed up into true norse fury all the old vaeringer and berserkir rage awakening in him sprang forth into the front of the fight and mauled and cut and smashed down on both hands of him everything he met irresistible by any horse or man till an arrow cut him through the windpipe and laid him low forever that was the end of king harald and of his workings in this world the circumstance that he was a waring or baring and had smitten to pieces so many oriental cohorts or crowds and had made loveverses kind of iron madrigals to his russian princess and caught the fancy of questionable greek queens and had amassed such heaps of money while poor nephew magnus had only one gold ring which had been his fathers and even his fathers mothers as uncle harald noticed and nothing more whatever of that precious metal to combine with haralds treasuresall this is new to me naturally no hint of it in any english book and lends some gleam of romantic splendor to that dim business of stamford bridge now fallen so dull and torpid to most english minds transcendently important as it once was to all englishmen adam of bremen says the english got as much gold plunder from haralds people as was a heavy burden for twelve men 18 a thing evidently impossible which nobody need try to believe young olaf haralds son age about sixteen steering down the ouse at the top of his speed escaped home to norway with all his ships and subsequently reigned there with magnus his brother haralds body did lie in english earth for about a year but was then brought to norway for burial he needed more than seven feet of grave say some laing interpreting snorros measurements makes harald eight feet in staturei do hope with some error in excess    chapter xii olaf the tranquil magnus barefoot and sigurd the crusader  the new king olaf his brother magnus having soon died bore rule in norway for some fiveandtwenty years rule soft and gentle not like his fathers and inclining rather to improvement in the arts and elegancies than to anything severe or dangerously laborious a slimbuilt wittytalking popular and pretty man with uncommonly bright eyes and hair like floss silk they called him olaf kyrre the tranquil or easygoing  the ceremonials of the palace were much improved by him palace still continued to be built of huge logs pyramidally sloping upwards with fireplace in the middle of the floor and no egress for smoke or ingress for light except right overhead which in bad weather you could shut or all but shut with a lid lid originally made of mere opaque board but changed latterly into a light frame covered glazed so to speak with entrails of animals clarified into something of pellucidity all this olaf i hope further perfected as he did the placing of the court ladies court officials and the like but i doubt if the luxury of a glass window were ever known to him or a cup to drink from that was not made of metal or horn in fact it is chiefly for his sons sake i mention him here and with the son too i have little real concern but only a kind of fantastic  this son bears the name of magnus barfod barefoot or bareleg and if you ask why so the answer is he was used to appear in the streets of nidaros trondhjem now and then in complete scotch highland dress authentic tartan plaid and philibeg at that epochto the wonder of trondhjem and us the truth is he had a mighty fancy for those hebrides and other scotch possessions of his and seeing england now quite impossible eagerly speculated on some conquest in ireland as next best he did in fact go diligently voyaging and inspecting among those orkney and hebridian isles putting everything straight there appointing stringent authorities jarlsnay a king kingdom of the suderoer southern isles now called sodorand as first king sigurd his pretty little boy of nine years all which done and some quarrel with sweden fought out he seriously applied himself to visiting in a still more emphatic manner namely to invading with his best skill and strength the considerable virtual or actual kingdom he had in ireland intending fully to enlarge it to the utmost limits of the island if possible he got prosperously into dublin guess ad 1102 considerable authority he already had even among those poor irish kings or kinglets in their glibs and yellowsaffron gowns still more i suppose among the numerous norse principalities there king murdog king of ireland says the chronicle of man had obliged himself every yuleday to take a pair of shoes hang them over his shoulder as your servant does on a journey and walk across his court at bidding and in presence of magnus barefoots messenger by way of homage to the said king murdog on this greater occasion did whatever homage could be required of him but that though comfortable was far from satisfying the great kings ambitious mind the great king left murdog left his own dublin marched off westward on a general conquest of ireland marched easily victorious for a time and got some say into the wilds of connaught but there saw himself beset by ambuscades and wild irish countenances intent on mischief and had on the sudden to draw up for battleplace i regret to say altogether undiscoverable to me known only that it was boggy in the extreme certain enough too certain and evident magnus barefoot searching eagerly could find no firm footing there nor fighting furiously up to the knees or deeper any result but honorable death date is confidently marked 24 august 1103as if people knew the very day of the month the natives did humanely give king magnus christian burial the remnants of his force without further molestation found their ships on the coast of ulster and sailed homewithout conquest of ireland nay perhaps leaving royal murdog disposed to be relieved of his procession with the pair of shoes  magnus barefoot left three sons all kings at once reigning peaceably together but to us at present the only noteworthy one of them was sigurd who finding nothing special to do at home left his brothers to manage for him and went off on a far voyage which has rendered him distinguishable in the crowd voyage through the straits of gibraltar on to jerusalem thence to constantinople and so home through russia shining with such renown as filled all norway for the time being a king called sigurd jorsalafarer jerusalemer or sigurd the crusader henceforth his voyage had been only partially of the viking type in general it was of the royalprogress kind rather vikingism only intervening in cases of incivility or the like his reception in the courts of portugal spain sicily italy had been honorable and sumptuous the king of jerusalem broke out into utmost splendor and effusion at sight of such a pilgrim and constantinople did its highest honors to such a prince of vaeringers and the truth is sigurd intrinsically was a wise able and prudent man who surviving both his brothers reigned a good while alone in a solid and successful way he shows features of an original independentthinking man something of ruggedly strong sincere and honest with peculiarities that are amiable and even pathetic in the character and temperament of him as certainly the course of life he took was of his own choosing and peculiar enough he happens furthermore to be what he least of all could have chosen or expected the last of the haarfagr genealogy that had any success or much deserved any in this world the last of the haarfagrs or as good as the last so that singular to say it is in reality for one thing only that sigurd after all his crusadings and wonderful adventures is memorable to us here the advent of an irish gentleman called gylle krist gilchrist servant of christ whonot over welcome i should think but unconsciously big with the above resultappeared in norway while king sigurd was supreme let us explain a little  this gylle krist the unconsciously fatal individual who spoke norse imperfectly declared himself to be the natural son of whilom magnus barefoot born to him there while engaged in that unfortunate conquest of ireland here is my mother come with me said gilchrist who declares my real baptismal name to have been harald given me by that great king and who will carry the redhot ploughshares or do any reasonable ordeal in testimony of these facts i am king sigurds veritable halfbrother what will king sigurd think it fair to do with me sigurd clearly seems to have believed the man to be speaking truth and indeed nobody to have doubted but he was sigurd said honorable sustenance shalt thou have from me here but under pain of extirpation swear that neither in my time nor in that of my young son magnus wilt thou ever claim any share in this government gylle swore and punctually kept his promise during sigurds reign but during magnuss he conspicuously broke it and in result through many reigns and during three or four generations afterwards produced unspeakable contentions massacrings confusions in the country he had adopted there are reckoned from the time of sigurds death ad 1130 about a hundred years of civil war no king allowed to distinguish himself by a solid reign of welldoing or by any continuing reign at allsometimes as many as four kings simultaneously fightingand in norway from sire to son nothing but sanguinary anarchy disaster and bewilderment a country sinking steadily as if towards absolute ruin of all which frightful misery and discord irish gylle styled afterwards king harald gylle was by ill destiny and otherwise the visible origin an illegitimate irish haarfagr who proved to be his own destruction and that of the haarfagr kindred altogether  sigurd himself seems always to have rather favored gylle who was a cheerful shrewd patient witty and effective fellow and had at first much quizzing to endure from the younger kind on account of his irish way of speaking norse and for other reasons one evening for example while the drink was going round gylle mentioned that the irish had a wonderful talent of swift running and that there were among them people who could keep up with the swiftest horse at which especially from young magnus there were peals of laughter and a declaration from the latter that gylle and he would have it tried tomorrow morning gylle in vain urged that he had not himself professed to be so swift a runner as to keep up with the princes horses but only that there were men in ireland who could magnus was positive and early next morning gylle had to be on the ground and the race naturally under heavy bet actually went off gylle started parallel to magnuss stirrup ran like a very roe and was clearly ahead at the goal unfair said magnus thou must have had hold of my stirrupleather and helped thyself along we must try it again gylle ran behind the horse this second time then at the end sprang forward and again was fairly in ahead thou must have held by the tail said magnus not by fair running was this possible we must try a third time gylle started ahead of magnus and his horse this third time kept ahead with increasing distance magnus galloping his very best and reached the goal more palpably foremost than ever so that magnus had to pay his bet and other damage and humiliation and got from his father who heard of it soon afterwards scoffing rebuke as a silly fellow who did not know the worth of men but only the clothes and rank of them and well deserved what he had got from gylle all the time king sigurd lived gylle seems to have had good recognition and protection from that famous man and indeed to have gained favor all round by his quiet social demeanor and the qualities he showed    chapter xiii magnus the blind harald gylle and mutual extinction of the haarfagrs  on sigurd the crusaders death magnus naturally came to the throne gylle keeping silence and a cheerful face for the time but it was not long till claim arose on gylles part till war and fight arose between magnus and him till the skilful popular everactive and shifty gylle had entirely beaten magnus put out his eyes mutilated the poor body of him in a horrid and unnamable manner and shut him up in a convent as out of the game henceforth there in his dark misery magnus lived now as a monk called magnus the blind by those norse populations king harald gylle reigning victoriously in his stead but this also was only for a time there arose avenging kinsfolk of magnus who had no irish accent in their norse and were themselves eager enough to bear rule in their native country by one of thesea terribly stronghanded fighting violent and regardless fellow who also was a bastard of magnus barefoots and had been made a priest but liked it unbearably ill and had broken loose from it into the wildest courses at home and abroad so that his current name got to be slembidiakn slim or ill deacon under which he is much noised of in snorro and the sagas by this slimdeacon gylle was put an end to murdered by night drunk in his sleep and poor blind magnus was brought out and again set to act as king or kings cloak in hopes gylles posterity would never rise to victory more but gylles posterity did to victory and also to defeat and were the death of magnus and of slimdeacon too in a frightful way and all got their own death by and by in a ditto in brief these two kindreds reckoned to be authentic enough haarfagr people both kinds of them proved now to have become a veritable crop of dragons teeth who mutually fought plotted struggled as if it had been their lifes business never ended fighting and seldom long intermitted it till they had exterminated one another and did at last all rest in death one of these later gylle temporary kings i remember by the name of harald herdebred harald of the broad shoulders the very last of them i think was harald mund harald of the wrymouth who gave rise to two impostors pretending to be sons of his a good while after the poor wrymouth itself and all its troublesome belongings were quietly underground what norway suffered during that sad century may be imagined    chapter xiv sverrir and descendants to hakon the old  the end of it was or rather the first abatement and beginnings of the end that when all this had gone on ever worsening for some forty years or so one sverrir ad 1177 at the head of an armed mob of poor people called birkebeins came upon the scene a strange enough figure in history this sverrir and his birkebeins at first a mere mockery and dismal laughingstock to the enlightened norway public nevertheless by unheardof fighting hungering exertion and endurance sverrir after ten years of such a deathwrestle against men and things got himself accepted as king and by wonderful expenditure of ingenuity common cunning unctuous parliamentary eloquence or almost popular preaching and it must be owned general human faculty and valor or value in the overclouded and distorted state did victoriously continue such and founded a new dynasty in norway which ended only with norways separate existence after near three hundred years  this sverrir called himself a son of harald wrymouth but was in reality the son of a poor combmaker in some little town of norway nothing heard of sonship to wrymouth till after good success otherwise his birkebeins that is to say birchlegs the poor rebellious wretches having taken to the woods and been obliged besides their intolerable scarcity of food to thatch their bodies from the cold with whatever covering could be got and their legs especially with birch bark sad species of fleecy hosiery whence their nicknamehis birkebeins i guess always to have been a kind of norse jacquerie desperate rising of thralls and indigent people driven mad by their unendurable sufferings and famishingstheirs the deepest stratum of misery and the densest and heaviest in this the general misery of norway which had lasted towards the third generation and looked as if it would last foreverwhereupon they had risen proclaiming in this furious dumb manner unintelligible except to heaven that the same could not nor would not be endured any longer and by their sverrir strange to say they did attain a kind of permanent success and from being a dismal laughingstock in norway came to be important and for a time allimportant there their opposition nicknames baglers from bagall baculus bishops staff bishop nicholas being chief leader goldlegs and the like obscure terms for there was still a considerable course of counterfighting ahead and especially of counternicknaming i take to have meant in norse prefigurement seven centuries ago bloated aristocracy tyrannousbourgeoisietill in the next century these rents were closed again  king sverrir not himself bred to combmaking had in his fifth year gone to an uncle bishop in the faroe islands and got some considerable education from him with a view to priesthood on the part of sverrir but not liking that career sverrir had fled and smuggled himself over to the birkebeins who noticing the learned tongue and other miraculous qualities of the man proposed to make him captain of them and even threatened to kill him if he would not acceptwhich thus at the swords point as sverrir says he was obliged to do it was after this that he thought of becoming son of wrymouth and other higher things  his birkebeins and he had certainly a talent of campaigning which has hardly ever been equalled they fought like devils against any odds of number and before battle they have been known to march six days together without food except perhaps the inner barks of trees and in such clothing and shoeing as mere birch barkat one time somewhere in the dovrefjeld there was serious counsel held among them whether they should not all as one man leap down into the frozen gulfs and precipices or at once massacre one another wholly and so finish of their conduct in battle fiercer than that of baresarks where was there ever seen the parallel in truth they are a dim strange object to one in that black time wondrously bringing light into it withal and proved to be under such unexpected circumstances the beginning of better days  of sverrirs public speeches there still exist authentic specimens wonderful indeed and much characteristic of such a sverrir a combmaker king evidently meaning several good and solid things and effecting them too athwart such an element of norwegian chaoscomeagain his descendants and successors were a comparatively respectable kin the last and greatest of them i shall mention is hakon vii or hakon the old whose fame is still lively among us from the battle of largs at least    chapter xv hakon the old at largs  in the norse annals our famous battle of largs makes small figure or almost none at all among hakons battles and feats they do say indeed these norse annalists that the king of scotland alexander iii who had such a fate among the crags about kinghorn in time coming was very anxious to purchase from king hakon his sovereignty of the western isles but that hakon pointedly refused and at length being again importuned and bothered on the business decided on giving a refusal that could not be mistaken decided namely to go with a big expedition and look thoroughly into that wing of his dominions where no doubt much has fallen awry since magnus barefoots grand visit thither and seems to be inviting the cupidity of bad neighbors all this we will put right again thinks hakon and gird it up into a safe and defensive posture hakon sailed accordingly with a strong fleet adjusting and rectifying among his hebrides as he went long and landing withal on the scotch coast to plunder and punish as he thought fit the scots say he had claimed of them arran bute and the two cumbraes given my ancestors by donald bain said hakon to the amazement of the scots as part of the sudoer southern islesso far from selling that fine kingdomand that it was after taking both arran and bute that he made his descent at largs  of largs there is no mention whatever in norse books but beyond any doubt such is the other evidence hakon did land there land and fight not conquering probably rather beaten and very certainly retiring to his ships as in either case he behooved to do it is further certain he was dreadfully maltreated by the weather on those wild coasts and altogether credible as the scotch records bear that he was so at largs very specially the norse records or sagas say merely he lost many of his ships by the tempests and many of his men by land fighting in various partstacitly including largs no doubt which was the last of these misfortunes to him in the battle here he lost 15000 men say the scots we 5000 divide these numbers by ten and the excellently brief and lucid scottish summary by buchanan may be taken as the approximately true and exact 19 date of the battle is ad 1263  to this day on a little plain to the south of the village now town of largs in ayrshire there are seen stone cairns and monumental heaps and until within a century ago one huge solitary upright stone still mutely testifying to a battle therealtogether clearly to this battle of king hakons who by the norse records too was in these neighborhoods at that same date and evidently in an aggressive high kind of humor for while his ships and army were doubling the mull of cantire he had his own boat set on wheels and therein splendidly enough had himself drawn across the promontory at a flatter part no doubt with horns sounding banners waving all to the left of me is mine and norways exclaimed hakon in his triumphant boat progress which such disasters soon followed  hakon gathered his wrecks together and sorrowfully made for orkney it is possible enough as our guide books now say he may have gone by iona mull and the narrow seas inside of skye and that the kyleakin favorably known to seabathers in that region may actually mean the kyle narrow strait of hakon where hakon may have dropped anchor and rested for a little while in smooth water and beautiful environment safe from equinoctial storms but poor hakons heart was now broken he went to orkney died there in the winter never beholding norway more  he it was who got iceland which had been a republic for four centuries united to his kingdom of norway a long and intricate operationmuch presided over by our snorro sturleson so often quoted here who indeed lost his life by assassination from his sonsinlaw and out of great wealth sank at once into poverty of zeroone midnight in his own cellar in the course of that bad business hakon was a great politician in his time and succeeded in many things before he lost largs snorros death by murder had happened about twenty years before hakons by broken heart he is called hakon the old though one finds his age was but fiftynine probably a longish life for a norway king snorros narrative ceases when snorro himself was born that is to say at the threshold of king sverrir of whose exploits and doubtful birth it is guessed by some that snorro willingly forbore to speak in the hearing of such a hakon    chapter xvi epilogue  haarfagrs kindred lasted some three centuries in norway sverrirs lasted into its third century there how long after this among the neighboring kinships i did not inquire for by regal affinities consanguinities and unexpected chances and changes the three scandinavian kingdoms fell all peaceably together under queen margaret of the calmar union ad 1397 and norway incorporated now with denmark needed no more kings  the history of these haarfagrs has awakened in me many thoughts of despotism and democracy arbitrary government by one and selfgovernment which means no government or anarchy by all of dictatorship with many faults and universal suffrage with little possibility of any virtue for the contrast between olaf tryggveson and a universalsuffrage parliament or an imperial copper captain has in these nine centuries grown to be very great and the eternal providence that guides all this and produces alike these entities with their epochs is not its course still through the great deep does not it still speak to us if we have ears here clothed in stormy enough passions and instincts unconscious of any aim but their own satisfaction is the blessed beginning of human order regulation and real government there clothed in a highly different but again suitable garniture of passions instincts and equally unconscious as to real aim is the accursedlooking ending temporary ending of order regulation and governmentvery dismal to the sane onlooker for the time being not dismal to him otherwise his hope too being steadfast but here at any rate in this poor norse theatre one looks with interest on the first transformation so mysterious and abstruse of human chaos into something of articulate cosmos witnesses the wild and strange birthpangs of human society and reflects that without something similar little as men expect such now no cosmos of human society ever was got into existence nor can ever again be  the violences fightings crimesah yes these seldom fail and they are very lamentable but always too among those old populations there was one saving element the now want of which especially the unlamented want transcends all lamentation here is one of those strange piercing wingedwords of ruskin which has in it a terrible truth for us in these epochs now come  my friends the follies of modern liberalism many and great though they be are practically summed in this denial or neglect of the quality and intrinsic value of things its rectangular beatitudes and spherical benevolencestheology of universal indulgence and jurisprudence which will hang no rogues mean one and all of them in the root incapacity of discerning or refusal to discern worth and unworth in anything and least of all in man whereas nature and heaven command you at your peril to discern worth from unworth in everything and most of all in man your main problem is that ancient and trite one who is best man and the fates forgive muchforgive the wildest fiercest cruelest experimentsif fairly made for the determination of that  theft and bloodguiltiness are not pleasing in their sight yet the favoring powers of the spiritual and material world will confirm to you your stolen goods and their noblest voices applaud the lifting of your spear and rehearse the sculpture of your shield if only your robbing and slaying have been in fair arbitrament of that question who is best man but if you refuse such inquiry and maintain every man for his neighbors matchif you give vote to the simple and liberty to the vile the powers of those spiritual and material worlds in due time present you inevitably with the same problem soluble now only wrong side upwards and your robbing and slaying must be done then to find out who is worst man which in so wide an order of merit is indeed not easy but a complete tammany ring and lowest circle in the inferno of worst you are sure to find and to be governed by 20  all readers will admit that there was something naturally royal in these haarfagr kings a wildly great kind of kindred counts in it two heroes of a high or almost highest type the first two olafs tryggveson and the saint and the view of them withal as we chance to have it i have often thought how essentially homeric it wasindeed what is homer himself but the rhapsody of five centuries of greek skalds and wandering balladsingers done ie stitched together by somebody more musical than snorro was olaf tryggveson and olaf saint please me quite as well in their prosaic form offering me the truth of them as if seen in their real lineaments by some marvellous opening through the art of snorro across the black strata of the ages two high almost among the highest sons of nature seen as they veritably were fairly comparable or superior to godlike achilleus goddesswounding diomedes much more to the two atreidai regulators of the peoples  i have also thought often what a book might be made of snorro did there but arise a man furnished with due literary insight and indefatigable diligence who faithfully acquainting himself with the topography the monumental relies and illustrative actualities of norway carefully scanning the best testimonies as to place and time which that country can still give him carefully the best collateral records and chronologies of other countries and who himself possessing the highest faculty of a poet could abridging arranging elucidating reduce snorro to a polished cosmic state unweariedly purging away his much chaotic matter a modern highest kind of poet capable of unlimited slavish labor withalwho i fear is not soon to be expected in this world or likely to find his task in the heimskringla if he did appear here     footnotes  footnote 1 j g dahlmann geschichte von dannemark 3 vols 8vo hamburg 18401843  footnote 2 settlement dated 912 by munch
